	<P>Anois, iarratais chun tairisceana a dh&eacute;anamh an D&aacute;il a chur ar athl&oacute; faoi Bhuan Ord&uacute; 32.  Requests to move the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to discuss an issue of national importance, namely, Ireland&rsquo;s unsustainable ecological footprint which according to the World Wildlife Fund report ranks Ireland as tenth in a list of countries which rely on the ecological resources of other countries to prop up their lifestyles and economic growth, thereby using up the earth&rsquo;s diminishing resources at a faster rate than most other countries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to discuss an issue of local and national importance, namely, the need for the Minister for Transport to make an urgent statement to the D&aacute;il on the breakdown of talks between the board and management of Aer Lingus and SIPTU, and if he will ensure that the full mechanisms of the State&rsquo;s industrial relations apparatus will be utilised to facilitate the resumption of those talks with the aim of avoiding at all costs serious disruptions for the travelling public and the Aer Lingus workforce and a severe setback for the whole economy of north and west Dublin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to address the following matter of national importance requiring urgent consideration, namely, the growing economic pressure on families in the farming sector and the need for the Government to introduce a range of measures including the carrying out by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food of the promised review of costings under the farm waste management scheme, the need to restore the grant under the scheme to 70% of costs and to extend the scheme to June 2009.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is proposed to take No. 2, Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill 2008 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.  Private Members&rsquo; business shall be No. 45, <Col N="524"/>motion re education cuts, to be taken after the Order of Business and to conclude after 90 minutes, if not previously concluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no proposals to be put to the House.  I call Deputy Kenny.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a number of questions for the T&aacute;naiste.  Arising from the decision of the Government to accept the new fee per GP visit, does the Government now accept that between the changes to be made to the drugs scheme and the new fee per GP per patient over 70, the savings involved could have avoided all of the anxiety and fears&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the Order of Business, Deputy Kenny.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and all of the concerns expressed by the elderly on the streets of Dublin last week?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are other ways of raising that matter.  It is not in order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The budget was out of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the T&aacute;naiste prepared to put up the hand of Government and say: &ldquo;We are sorry for the angst caused and we have identified the savings in this area&rdquo;?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy wishes to ask a question which is in order, he is entitled to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Second, in respect of the fair deal legislation which is to come to the House the week after next, directly contradictory statements have been made by different Ministers about how this is to apply and how it will impact on people.  The budget statement read out by the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, states that the eligibility for reclaim or rebate will be reduced from the marginal rate to the standard rate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot deal with that legislation now, as the Deputy knows.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is of importance if it concerns legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy cannot ask about its content.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Contradictory statements have been made by Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy cannot ask about its content.  That is not my fault.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill is to come to the House shortly.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy asks when it is coming to the House, it is a different matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It means that for a patient going into a nursing home in Dublin, where the cost may be &euro;60,000 a year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy can ask when it is coming to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;there will be a difference of &euro;12,000 per patient if the Minister&rsquo;s rule is to be applied.  I would like to know from the T&aacute;naiste whether it is to be at the marginal rate or the standard rate.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="525"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot deal with the content.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the fair deal cover all of those who go into nursing homes as a consequence?</P>
        <P>I have a third question.  Today&rsquo;s <i>Tirconnell Tribune</i> &mdash; I have the front page in front of me &mdash; states the T&aacute;naiste met the spokespersons and representatives of the Down&rsquo;s syndrome association on Saturday.  In what is the most despicable act in this budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Hold on, Deputy.  This is neither a budget debate nor a Second Stage debate.  I cannot allow that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am dealing with legislation. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should continue.  He should ask the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>He should ask about the legislation.  The Deputy should be fair to the Chair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am dealing with legislation as far as the Finance Bill is concerned.  In what was the most despicable act of them all&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a question about the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the Government proposed to raise the eligibility limit for disability from 16 to 18 years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question on the legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>This newspaper today states that the T&aacute;naiste met the representatives of this association on Saturday, assured them this would be changed back and that the increase to the age of 18 would not go ahead.  It states that spokespersons&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call the T&aacute;naiste to reply on the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;who met the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coughlan, on Saturday&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>On the issue of the legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;said they were delighted with the outcome and they were more sure afterwards that the budget recommendations to extend eligibility to 18 years would not go head.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no circumstances under which I can allow Deputies to come into the House and read from provincial newspapers on a Thursday morning.  That is not possible.  I call the T&aacute;naiste on the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a fourth question.</P>

	<P>I call Deputy Kenny on the fourth issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not hear anything that the T&aacute;naiste muttered when the Ceann Comhairle disallowed my legitimate question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I answered clearly and distinctly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I have asked the T&aacute;naiste three questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I answered the three questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>We will see whether the quality of her answers has improved since last week.  Here is my fourth question.  Can the T&aacute;naiste explain to the House how there is now a differential of 7 cent between petrol prices at the pumps here and at pumps across every European country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>For God&rsquo;s sake, Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>This is dealing with the Competition Authority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is completely out of order.  The Deputy should ask a question on legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>This is your business, a Cheann Comhairle.  The Government proposes to amalgamate the National Consumer Agency into a fair trade agency.</P>

	<P>The T&aacute;naiste should reply on the legislation.</P>

        <P>This week last year, the Government voted down a Labour Party Private Members&rsquo; motion to restore to the Order Paper the Labour Party Private Members&rsquo; Bill on civil unions.  The Government promised it would introduce its own legislation.  Some time ago it published the heads of a Bill but we have not heard anything about it since.  What is delaying the publication of the Government&rsquo;s civil union legislation?  Will the T&aacute;naiste indicate when the Bill will come before the House?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Yesterday, on the Order of Business the Taoiseach confirmed something the T&aacute;naiste stated previously, which is that the Government will introduce legislation to amend the Competition Act.  I understood from what the Taoiseach stated yesterday that this legislation will amend the Competition Act to allow the Government to negotiate with the IMO and that it will be done only in respect of negotiations with the IMO.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party tabled a Private Members&rsquo; Bill in the name of Deputy Michael D. Higgins which would have amended the Competition Act to allow for negotiations to take place between the Government and other professional bodies on matters of delivery of public services.  Will the T&aacute;naiste clarify whether the legislation amending the Competition Act is confined only to the IMO or whether it will include the matters covered by the Labour Party Bill?  When will it be published?</P><Col N="530"/>
        <P>The bank scheme approved last week has a provision which states that any institution covered by the guarantee scheme shall agree to &ldquo;indemnify the Minister in respect of any payments of covered liabilities made by the Minister following a claim made under the guarantee or any other liabilities incurred by the Minister in that regard&rdquo;.  However, the market notice published by the Department of Finance on its website states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">A covered institution is not required to indemnify the Minister in respect of any payments made by the Minister under a guarantee given to any other covered institution which is not a member of its corporate group.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">What this means in practice is that the scheme approved by the D&aacute;il states if a bank gets into trouble the other banks will be required to pay but what the Department of Finance has advertised to the banking market is that this does not apply and any bank covered by the scheme will not have to pay.

	<P>It is reported today that the Health Service Executive proposes to establish nine regional authorities.  Coming so soon after the establishment of the HSE, it is a clear admission of its failure to deliver quality health care, something I believe we all know in this House.  Will legislation be brought before the D&aacute;il to effect this change or will it be done by ministerial order?  If it is done by ministerial order, will it be presented to the D&aacute;il to allow for a full D&aacute;il debate?

        <P el="5">Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>

	<P>I am delighted to support the motion put down by Deputy Quinn and the Labour Party on the chaos that will be caused in the education sector if the cutbacks announced in the budget and subsequently by the Minister for Education and Science go ahead as planned.  I have been a secondary school teacher for more than 30 years and I know at first hand the difficulties that will emerge inside and outside the classrooms of this country once these cutbacks begin to bite in a couple of months time.  I have been in contact with every primary and post-primary school in Mayo over the last week.  The response was one of anger, dismay and fear about what is going to happen in our primary and secondary schools after 1 January.  My colleagues have dealt with many of the issues already but in my few minutes I want to address the effects on the promotion of sport and extra-curricular activities as well as some specific problems in my constituency.</P>
        <P>Over the years thousands of teachers have given of their time on a voluntary basis to organise, train, supervise and manage school football teams in inter-college competitions across the length and breadth of the country.  Some of the training was done before class in the morning, at lunchtime or after school.  Teachers sometimes even drove the pupils home if they missed their school buses.  We are talking about a whole range of sports including GAA, rugby and soccer.  It is on the playing fields of St. Colman&rsquo;s, St. Nathy&rsquo;s, St. Muredach&rsquo;s, St. Jarlath&rsquo;s, Col&aacute;iste Chr&iacute;ost R&iacute;, St. Kieran&rsquo;s Kilkenny and others that the future all-stars, All-Ireland medal winners, soccer and rugby internationals are nurtured.  It is on those pitches that they learn how to win and lose, how to cope with success and defeat.  They learn the meaning of teamwork, loyalty, trust and discipline.  As a teacher who trained teams to win All-Ireland competitions at schools level I know how involvement in sport helps to relieve the pressure of the academic points race.  I know how self-esteem built on the school pitches helps students in the classroom and the exam hall.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated here last night that as regards promotion of sport in our schools we have merely returned to how things were in the early years of this decade.  I say to the Minister that the world has changed since 2002.  No principal can risk leaving the class of a teacher unattended while he goes to take charge of a football team, as was the case in the past.  Colm O&rsquo;Rourke, a school principal and a top footballer in the past, was right when he stated in his column last weekend: &ldquo;The days of leaving classes to their own devices while a teacher went to a football game are thankfully long gone.&rdquo;</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnOMahony"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
	<P>We should remember also that the teacher who goes with the team is doing so on a voluntary basis.  He must be the minder, trainer, kit-man and medical man.  He must get a referee, pay the caretaker and so on.  As a teacher I always found that I could get to know my students better on the playing field and therefore got greater co-operation in the classroom.  Is the Minister intending to put all that at risk by implementing these cutbacks?  If cover is not provided for games there will be a negative impact on the physical and social development of students.  This will lead to increased discipline problems in the classroom, as there will be no outlet for students to burn off their aggression.</P><Col N="538"/>
        <P>We all know we are nowhere near meeting the recommendations of the report of the national task force on obesity, which states that every child should have at least 30 minutes of exercise every day.  A Fine Gael survey carried out by my colleague Deputy Deenihan showed that students in a quarter of the schools surveyed received less than an hour of PE per week.  The obesity crisis and the health problems associated with it will cost the State in the long term.</P>
        <P>A couple of years ago nine secondary schools in Mayo which had been in the old DEIS scheme were excluded because of new criteria that were drawn up.  Of a total of 43 schools excluded nationally, 25% were from Mayo.  A similar story existed at primary level.  Due to the upcoming general election, a compromise was reached whereby schools were allowed to keep some of the privileges they had.  However, these have now been taken away in the budget.  Some schools in Mayo must face not only class size increases but also a loss of posts for disadvantaged areas as well as home-school liaison officers.  I have heard from three secondary schools in Mayo alone that they will each lose five teachers if these cuts are implemented.  That is among just three schools, yet the Minister stated that only 200 jobs would be lost.  How can the Minister justify this?</P>
        <P>Last Friday I visited Craggagh national school, a three-teacher school with a wonderful atmosphere and great sense of teamwork.  On 1 September 2008 there were 48 pupils on the roll, enough to retain its three teachers, but under the new guidelines this number will be reduced to two.  Thus it is losing 33.3% of its staff.  Each teacher will have to look after four classes.  There is a perception out there that class size will only increase by one, but in this case the number in each class will increase by ten.  This is not on.  Small rural schools will be hardest hit.  I could go on and on.</P>
        <P>It has been asked where Fine Gael would find the resources.  I do not have time to elaborate on this but I will make one simple point.  What about the millions spent on prefabs?  One school in Mayo spends &euro;70,000 per year renting prefabs.  There is also the perception, with regard to the Fine Gael proposals, that we want to hit teachers&rsquo; salaries.  Our proposal for a pay freeze for those earning more than &euro;50,000 is aimed at protecting the jobs that will be lost under the Minister&rsquo;s cutbacks.  I strongly commend the motion.</P>

	<P>I support the Labour Party motion concerning the cuts to the education system.  I ask the Minister to reverse his decision to increase class sizes at first and second level.  This budget will possibly go down in history as the worst ever.  It is a vicious attack on those over 70, our schoolchildren, the old, the vulnerable and other citizens of this country.  Let us not get too confused here.  People are saying the budget was rushed, ham-fisted and ill thought out.  In fact, this budget was show time once again.  There are spin-doctors, wizards and spooks out there who are monitoring what I am saying.  They orchestrated the general elections in 2002 and 2007 and every budget in between.  It was show time for them.  As in the general elections, there were the chorus, the lead singers, the orchestra, the comperes and the cheerleaders.  There were also the vested interests.  In previous budgets we have had everybody texting around the country telling us how good the budget was going to be.  Indeed, there was a standing ovation from the members of the Government.  What they could not hide, however, was that there was no substance to this budget and that the devil was in the detail.  The fiasco of medical cards for the over 70s resulted in a protest outside the D&aacute;il by 15,000 brave citizens who saw through the smoke and mirrors.  We had the students, the farmers and many more, and now the principals, teachers, students and parents are protesting again.</P><Col N="539"/>
        <P>There is a list of 32 education cutbacks in budget 2009.  I could read them into the record but they have already been read.  However, I will mention a few, including the reduction in school building programmes.  In Ballinamore in my constituency of Roscommon-South Leitrim, we had nine public meetings attended by more than 300 people.  The Minister promised that a school would be delivered in Ballinamore and I expect him to keep that promise.  In addition, the grants for school choirs and orchestras have been abolished, as have the early child care centres, and there has been a radical increase in school transport costs.  As spokesperson on school transport, I feel this is anti-family and anti-rural.  The Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey, lives in the constituency of Dublin North-Central which has had its difficulties, certainly in terms of educational challenges, but not when it comes to provision of school transport.  Most of the students live within 2.2 kilometres of the school and they have footpaths, cycle lanes, walkways and a good public transport system available to them but that is not necessarily the case in rural Ireland.  A total of 140,000 children avail of school transport each day.  The cost of school transport for junior cycle students last Easter was &euro;99 per student.  That has increased to &euro;300 in less than six months.  It now costs parents of two junior cycle students &euro;600, which is an increase of over 203%.</P>
        <P>Where were the Green Party Members on this occasion?  I welcome the provision of tax relief on the purchase of a bicycle but it is of no use to school children.  Parents who have their own transport are not affected but parents with two children who do not have their own transport, and who may have to walk a mile to get to public transport, must pay &euro;600 for those two children.  The Green Party wants to take cars off the road but it is now cheaper to drive one&rsquo;s children to school than it is to avail of public transport.  That goes against all the policies of Sustainable Ireland and it must be reversed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of the Government amendment to this Private Members&rsquo; motion on education.  In political commentary here it is often said that three areas should be protected &mdash; social welfare, health and education &mdash; but that analysis ignores the fact that those three Departments account for 78% of current gross Government expenditure.  The reality is that it is impossible to bring the public finances under control without addressing these Departments but notwithstanding that, the Government, in extremely difficult fiscal circumstances, has safeguarded them to the greatest possible extent.  They are the only three Departments that have secured an increased budget for next year.  Education has been prioritised.</P>
        <P>Every Member in this House is at one on the importance of education in our society.  All of our experiences of the education system have shaped us as individuals but the debate on this motion cannot be detached from the reality of a &euro;13.41 billion deficit next year or a &euro;4.7 billion deficit on the current side.  That must be addressed.</P>
        <P>The Government cannot sustain a situation in the coming years where we have a deficit of 6.5% of GDP.  We have no choice but to tackle the issue, and every area will have to make sacrifices, but the Minister has done remarkably well to shield the education sector from the worst of the cuts that were necessary.  The education budget is increased by 3.2% or &euro;302 million and by any objective measure, investment in our education system in the past ten years at primary, post-primary, third level and in the emergence of fourth level has transformed the educational landscape for the better.</P><Col N="540"/>
        <P>I am proud of the in-class supports we are providing to special needs children in mainstream schools.  A total of 19,000 adults now work solely with children with special needs in our schools.  There are 10,000 special needs assistants compared to just 2,000 in 1997.  Those supports are unrecognisable from the time I and many Members were in the primary education sector.</P>
        <P>Class size is probably the most emotive issue that has emerged in the debate in recent weeks and this covers the decision to increase the ratio from 27:1 to 28:1.  My son is in primary education, in first class.  He is in a class of 30 and is one of only 20% of pupils who are in classes of 30 or more.  That is not ideal.  Like every other parent I would like my children to be in the smallest class size possible but I would prefer my son to be in a class of 30 than for this Government to take out a mortgage on his future and the future of every other child in the primary education sector because we did not have the political courage to confront the grave economic situation that persists.</P>
        <P>I had occasion recently to visit my former primary school in Passage West.  When I was in the school there were 35 students in my sixth class; it was a multi-grade class.  The Minister has stated on the record that when resources permit, the Government will review the situation and reduce class sizes further.  It is disingenuous to suggest that the enormous progress we have achieved since 1997 is being undone in this budget.  That is untrue.  The staffing schedule changes that have been announced reverts us to the situation that prevailed in the 2006-07 school year.</P>
        <P>The Minister put it on the record last night, and I do not believe it was a political point, that when the Opposition was last in power the pupil-teacher ratio was 35:1.  That is not a criticism because ten years ago Ireland was a very different country to what it is today.  In the past ten years we have reduced that ratio to 27:1 in very good economic times but we are now faced with a crisis in the public finances and a modest adjustment is being made, increasing the ratio back to 28:1.  In the circumstances, that is not an unreasonable sacrifice to ask to be made.</P>
        <P>On the primary sector, it has been clarified that 900 new posts will be created for the next school year, with 1,100 being removed by virtue of the measures announced in the budget.  There will be 200 fewer primary school teachers on the payroll next year, as there is this year.</P>
        <P>I welcome the commitment the Minister has made on the capital budget &mdash; an increase of 11% to &euro;889 million.  I also welcome his commitment to restore the summer works scheme, review the language support teacher provisions on a case by case basis, and the increase in the capitation rate to &euro;200 per pupil.</P>
        <P>Our duty to the children of this country is not limited to the time they spend in our education sector.  There is an even greater duty on us as public representatives to ensure we do not cripple their future by allowing the public finances spiral out of control, which would condemn them to a future of high taxes to pay the debts we have generated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>This debate allows us to address a crucial issue in a time of real change in our country.  We must get three things right.  We must get our finances in order, both in terms of our own budget and in terms of getting saner and sustainable lending going again; we must get real public sector reform; and we must then start to plot a path to economic recovery to allow us generate the wealth that pays for the social services we all want to see happen.</P>
        <P>In regard to the budget and getting our finances right, the Government was faced with a difficult task.  The reduction in public finances in terms of the tax income is massive and has been very swift in the change that has occurred.  On the response by the Government, the broad parameters in terms of trying to make up some of the &euro;6 billion gap that we had not <Col N="541"/>expected but that had evolved and had to be dealt with was to see approximately &euro;2 billion in tax revenues raised, mainly in five areas which target the better off.  Those are capital gains tax rises, tax on second homes, tax on the higher VAT rate, which does not affect food, clothing, heating and other essential provisions, and a number of other taxes.</P>
        <P>A total of &euro;2 billion will be raised in cuts in spending, and &euro;2 billion in increased borrowing, adding to our borrowing requirement.  There is clear recognition that the increased borrowing means we are looking at a two or three year path out of the economic crisis we are in.  Next year the recommended borrowing requirement will double.  We can do that because our overall level of borrowing nationally compared to other countries is low but there is still a very difficult two to three year task that we must set out, and we should be honest with the people as to the nature of that.</P>
        <P>When it came to the cuts, it was decided in Government that every Department would play its part but that there would not be cutbacks in real expenditure in education, health and social welfare, despite the fact that approximately 80% of Government spending is accounted for in those three large social areas.  In education there is an increase in expenditure of &euro;300 million rather than a real cut.  However, the reality is that the wage bill and the increasing number of students coming into the system required the Minister for Education and Science and the Government to collectively agree a series of measures which would allow him operate within that budget.  That presents a real difficulty and a challenge but it is something we could not avoid within the context of the overall budgetary arithmetic.</P>
        <P>My second point relates to public service reform, which is crucial to the debate.  It would be wrong for us not to recognise that in the education sector, as in every other sector of the public service, there is scope for reform.  We cannot continue to operate as we have for the past ten years, particularly in light of the changes that have occurred globally.  There has been a budgetary increase and if we were to bring about reform in the education sector and achieve efficiencies of 2% or 3% in the context of how things are done, it would give us the resources to provide the services everyone wants to be delivered.  The issue of reform goes hand in hand with that relating to budgetary matters.</P>
        <P>Like the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, I look forward to negotiating with the partners in order to discover the means at our disposal to try to achieve efficiencies.  There are simple examples that can be provided which do not help the teachers in their cause.  First, there is the inflexibility that exists in the context of an inability to move from one school to another without one&rsquo;s rights being lost.  Second, there is also an inability to move staff from a school where there is an excess of teachers to one where there is shortage.  In this moment of real crisis and change, we must alter the way we operate.  We must be innovative and efficient in education and every other sector of society.  That is the crucial task we face in the context of delivering the services required.</P>
        <P>My third point relates to economic recovery and how this might be achieved.  An interesting article appeared in one of the newspapers this morning suggesting that what happened in Finland, which underwent a shock similar to that being experienced by Ireland in the early 1990s, is an example of how to proceed.  Finland experienced a 6% drop in GDP in 1992 and a 4% drop the following year.  The shift was dramatic and came about as a result of changes that had occurred in the Russian Federation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallBlaneyIND"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Blaney</NameTxt>
	<P>Education has taken centre stage this week.  The protests held outside the House yesterday by many people who work in the education sector brought this matter into sharp focus.  I regret that this is the case.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the vast contribution teaching staff make to the lives of children.  Teaching staff in this country are extremely committed and professional and I commend them on their efforts.  Like most other Members, I came through the education system and I fully understand and appreciate the professional service provided in schools throughout the country.</P>
        <P>I come from a rural area in County Donegal and I attended a small primary school in which there were two teachers.  The big event at our school was the day on which the lorry carrying turf arrived and students were allowed to leave their classes in order to transfer the turf from the roadside to the coal shed at the rear of the building.  This was the sum of our extracurricular activities.  It is sometimes worth one&rsquo;s while recalling how things used to be.  I am still a young man but even if I cast my mind back only a few years, I remember there was little discussion regarding disadvantage or special needs.  Unfortunately, many children were left behind because the additional services they required were not available when I attended school.</P>
        <P>It is time to acknowledge the services that are available today.  There are approximately 19,000 adults in our schools who work solely with children with special needs.  I will break that figure down because it is worthwhile discovering the way in which these resources are utilised.  Some 10,000 of the adults to whom I refer are special needs assistants, SNAs.  In 1997 there were only 300 SNAs in our schools.  A further 7,800 are resource and learning support teachers, of whom there were just 2,000 in 1998.  Some 1,100 other teachers are involved in supporting children in special schools, while hundreds more work in special classes.</P>
        <P>In the budget, &euro;10 million is being provided for children with special educational needs.  Among other benefits, this will provide a 33% increase in the money available to the Department&rsquo;s psychological service.  As a result, more psychologists will be working with children in our schools during the coming year.  It will also provide additional funding for the National Council for Special Education and enhance its capacity to co-ordinate the provision of services at local level for children, parents and schools.</P>
        <P>There has been much discussion of cuts to services in recent days.  It is important to highlight the vast investment that has been provided for education in the budget.  A great deal of anger <Col N="543"/>has been expressed with regard to increases in class sizes.  It is not ideal to be obliged to implement this measure.  However, we must recognise that we are rolling back to the position that obtained in 2007, when people were still provided with an excellent level of education.</P>
        <P>Some false information has been disseminated during the past week and I wish to correct some of it.  Statements have been made to the effect that class sizes in Ireland are the largest in Europe.  That is simply not the case.  Furthermore, Ireland&rsquo;s performance in international assessments of achievement underlines the fact that the quality of the education system does not merely equate to class sizes.  Surveys carried out for the programme for international student assessment, PISA, indicate that Irish 15 year olds have outperformed students in OECD and EU countries where class sizes are significantly lower than in Ireland.  Ultimately, however, I wish to stress that we want to be in a position to reduce class sizes.  We intend to resume that exercise in more stable economic times.</P>
        <P>It is worth noting that &euro;9.6 billion was allocated in respect of education in the budget.  This represents an increase of over 300% in the allocation since 1997.  It also represents an increase of &euro;302 million on the amount spent on education in the current year.  This is an investment in respect of which the Government, which is doing its utmost to prioritise education, should not be derided.</P>
        <P>There are difficult times ahead and we must work together to overcome the problems we face.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to begin by telling a story.  Approximately one year ago, as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Education and Science, I called an emergency meeting on the water charges issue.  It may have been coincidental but when I called that meeting, there was a response from the Government.  My aim in calling the meeting was to try to obtain an agreed cross-party motion from the members of the committee, the purpose of which would be to send a strong message to the Government.  It became apparent on the day of the meeting that a motion would be tabled by Fine Gael and Labour.  This meant a Government counter-motion would have to be tabled.  I informed Deputy Quinn that this would lead to the committee&rsquo;s motion being watered down and that, as a result, it would not have the same impact.  Deputy Quinn replied, &ldquo;That is politics, Paul&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Deputy, that is politics.  That is why the Labour Party tabled the motion before the House.  It is also why the Green Party, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats are tabling an amendment.  I praise the Labour Party for tabling the motion because it has provided a good opportunity for debate and exerted pressure on the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Minister on securing an increase, to &euro;9.6 billion, in the education budget this year.  That increase is to be welcomed.  It is quite commendable.  Most of the discussion on the education budget over recent days has centred on the pupil-teacher ratio.  Like other Deputies, I regret that the Minister had no option but to revert to the situation that prevailed in 2007, contrary to the commitment in the programme for Government to decrease class sizes.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement that he is totally committed to revisiting this matter at the earliest possible date.  As he has said over recent days, the best way to do that is by means of partnership.  We need to sit down with all the education partners to see where savings can be made.  We need to start working so that progress can be made in the future.  The Minister has suggested that we are taking one step back to take two steps forward.  He is taking a step back, but I hope he will be in a position to take two steps forward quickly, so the commitment in the programme for Government can be implemented.  We can be proud of the fact that every commitment in this area in previous programmes for Government was implemented.  All such commitments are based on the availability of resources.  We do not have sufficient resources at this time, unfortunately.  The Minister had no choice but to try to make savings.  He has decided to do so in this manner.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has increased the education capital budget, which is an important aspect of any budget, by &euro;79 million this year.  It is hugely important.</P>
        <P>I would like to mention a school in Kilfinane, which is in my constituency.  In recent years, the school&rsquo;s teachers and pupils have had to work and learn in extremely difficult circumstances.</P>

I understand that when <Col N="547"/>the scheme was suspended, many schools had already gone to the expense of preparing applications and sending them to the Department.  I am not sure whether the applications are still in the Department or have been sent back.  I would like those commitments to be honoured in the first instance.  It is expensive to put applications together.  I welcome the fact that this worthwhile scheme has been restored.

	<P Just="Left">I propose to share my time with Deputies Kathleen Lynch, Penrose, Stagg, Upton and Ciar&aacute;n Lynch.  I have only five minutes to reply to Deputy Fahey&rsquo;s comments.  It tells its own story that when my colleague, Deputy Quinn, was Minister for Finance between 1995 and 2000 there was sustained economic growth supported by export performance.  Between 2000 and 2005 the growth rate was sustained by the wildest forms of property speculation.  If Deputy Fahey wants to discuss the mad property speculation that drove the economy or the multimillionaires who benefited from pension transfers, he will find it in the last five budgets by his colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Last weekend students from one school in Athenry, a neighbouring constituency of Deputy Fahey&rsquo;s, delivered 500 letters.  Interestingly, this school has never expelled or suspended a student and has produced the first Traveller who will emerge from Mary Immaculate in a short period of time.  In that school the grant for Travellers&rsquo; education has been cut.  Let us get real about what is happening.  If Deputy Fahey decided to go to Claddagh national school, where six teachers deal with language difficulties, he would find that the cut to two teachers will be catastrophic not just for those coming in but students at all levels.  For those who sit beside <Col N="550"/>students who have difficulties with the English language it will be a disaster.  Deputy Fahey need not believe me.  He can talk to the teachers and the principal.</P>
        <P>If Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v takes time from his rambling leithsc&eacute;al br&eacute;agach that he spins on Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta he might like to go to Col&aacute;iste Chro&iacute; Mhuire, Spiddal, where a parent wrote to me this morning saying:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5" Just="Left">T&aacute; f&iacute;or imn&iacute; orm faoi na ruda&iacute; seo leanas.  An m&eacute;id is a cuimhn&iacute;os, idir mh&uacute;inteoir&iacute; agus dhalta&iacute;  ranga, caillfidh an scoil m&uacute;inteoir amh&aacute;in.

T&aacute; na deontais seo a leanas imithe: t&iacute;os, fisic, ceimic, ceol, idirbhliain agus sc&eacute;im iasachta leabhair.  Leanann s&eacute; ar aghaidh.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">It is extraordinary that the Green Party can talk about innovation at the same time as it destroys creativity in the curriculum.  With all the money gone for the materials for physics and chemistry, home economics, everything to do with school orchestras, music and art teaching among others, this is a curriculum policy of philistines.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, talks about innovation and sustainability that comes from individualism in society.  That form of connection between economy and society is over.  Courageous people are talking about new forms of social economy and the kind of creativity that will give several different kinds of economic opportunity.  Those on that side of the House must realise what has failed.  The old model of unregulated markets has failed internationally.  In addition, their wild speculative incentives driving individualist accumulation of profit is also gone.  Regarding Deputy Fahey&rsquo;s question on where the money would have come from, why confine themselves to &euro;200 for the second or third house?  Why not make it a geometric progression?  Deputy Fahey would know all about what would be gained from that.</P>
        <P>Many people have come to me, parents, teachers and boards of management members from St. Paul&rsquo;s secondary school in Oughterard and Calasanctius in Oranmore to name but two; there is a long list and I have no time to waste on it.  In the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 25 October Mr. John Walsh, a distinguished graduate of NUIG, listed what will happen in three schools in three different parts of the country.  In the case of a disadvantaged school in Dublin the net loss is that special subjects, transition year, the applied leaving certificate, the junior certificate, home economics, the Traveller grant and special provisions for physics and chemistry will be abandoned.  This is not republican and it is not about citizenship or sustainability.  It is a slash and burn, ignorant, savage set of cuts that impact on children who are not responsible for the wild, crazy economics for which Deputy Fahey and his party are responsible.  They should be ashamed.  These are disgraceful cuts.  The Minister can flap all he likes and read his letter from Deputy Gogarty &mdash; &ldquo;Dear Batt in China&rdquo;.  Let us hope parents, teachers and children give him the answer he needs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>As a debate goes on people change what they will say and that has clearly happened today.  I listened yesterday and today to Deputies on the Government side telling us how they were in classes of 35 when they grew up.  One said he was in a class of 40.  Let us analyse that because we all know what it is.  In here we see those who survived the classes of 35 or 40.  We need to find out how many people in such classes left school unable to read and write, how many got a worthwhile job, had to emigrate or never got to enjoy the things we enjoy every day because they cannot participate at a functioning literate or social level.  We know the answer because we know how many attend the National Adult Literacy Association, NALA, every year.  We know how many people in our communities sign up for literacy courses every week.  That is what the Government wants us to go back to.</P><Col N="551"/>
        <P Just="Left">There is no such thing as withdrawing these cuts in two years time because in two years' time a current five year old will be seven or eight.  The period in which students learn to read and write is that short span and it will be past.  That eight year old child will then be desperately seeking a place with a remedial teacher, who will have doubled his or her numbers and who will have no place for him or her.  This is not something we can do for a short period of time and then readjust; we cannot get that time back because a child&rsquo;s life does not stand still.  As Barnardos rightly says, a childhood lasts forever.  That child will grow into an adult and, if lucky, will have parents and a determined cohort of people around to ensure he or she has the skills to survive into adulthood.  However, a small group will not get those supports.</P>
        <P>This Government insisted children with special needs go into mainstream education, and that is very important, but with supports.  It has suspended the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, which gives children with special needs support in mainstream education.  Those children will flounder and their parents will go out there, determined, once again.  These parents are tired.  They fought and fought and spent years campaigning to have these special needs supports put in place for their children.  These have now been suspended.  The report has been with the Government since 2006, yet this Government did not see this catastrophe coming down the tracks.</P>
        <P>They never had any intention of putting it in place.  It is not about this particular crisis &mdash; the Government never intended to do it.</P>
        <P>What will the Minister for Education and Science say to the schools in Cork that are desperately trying to keep their heads above water?  One particular school, where 49% of pupils are in need of English language tuition, is about to lose two teachers.  What will he say to the child in the 35-pupil classroom or to the child that Mr. Michael McDowell insists we need because a little bit of inequality is good for us?  This Government will ensure that we have that little bit of inequality for the rest of our lives at least.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>As a teacher recently said to me, it is amazing that at this juncture of our economic cycle, when the Minister for Finance is calling on us all to be patriotic, it is the young, elderly and disadvantaged who are being called upon to be the most patriotic.  </P>
        <P>The budget will increase class sizes and diminish the learning experience of children for years to come with the staff schedule that has been announced by the Minister.  The Government and the Department of Education and Science have asserted that these changes will result in the loss of just 200 teaching jobs at primary and secondary level.  However, the INTO claims that changes to staffing schedules, the cap on English language teachers and reduced numbers of teachers for formerly designated disadvantaged schools will result in the loss of up to 1,000 teaching posts at primary level, while the TUI estimates that up to 1,200 jobs could be lost at second level.</P>
        <P>The proposed cuts at primary level have the potential to be devastating because they will affect children during their formative years on the educational ladder.  The cuts will not simply mean one extra child per classroom, as many have claimed.  The changes will mean that children will have to be divided up between classes from September 2009.  A school with three teachers for senior infants, for example, will only have two teachers from next year.  As Deputy Quinn has pointed out, matters will be exacerbated by the fact that the primary school population is expected to grow by 100,000 over the next seven or eight years.</P>
        <P>Education is the ultimate passport for young people.  It is a passport to the future, to freedom and liberty, to opportunity and to the workplace.  Without the vision and boldness of the former Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Education, the late Donagh O&rsquo;Malley, I would never have seen the <Col N="552"/>inside of a secondary school.  I would have fulfilled my destiny as a manual labourer on building sites in Ireland and Britain, as would many like me.</P>
        <P>It is important to value our education system as holistic, with more than just the classroom involved.  As the late Brother Keegan, who taught in the CBS in Mullingar used to say, &ldquo;the sharp mind is aided by a healthy, fit body&rdquo;.  He believed that those who succeeded on the playing fields were also likely to progress academically.  In that context, games were very important.  Mr. Liam Mulvihill, who taught me, used to arrive at school at 8.15 a.m. in his Anglia car, all the way from Kenagh, and bring us out to the training grounds at Ballinacarrigy national school.  He went on to become the Director General of the GAA.  Indeed, that organisation is up in arms over these cuts because it recognises that they will have a severe impact on children.</P>
        <P>As a Deputy, I receive a great many letters but never before have I seen such a tide of correspondence as that generated by these cuts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The response is spontaneous.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it is spontaneous.  I received a letter from Loreto Convent in Mullingar which outlines that the cutbacks will mean the loss of two teachers, larger class sizes, restricted choice of subjects for students, difficulty providing separate classes for higher, ordinary and foundation level in key subjects, a reduction in language support hours and no substitution.  What does no substitution actually mean?  It means that there will be no cover for teachers who are on uncertified sick leave or on official school business, for example, at football matches, on field trips to the theatre and so forth.  At least two teachers must accompany students to such events in order to comply with health and safety legislation, and rightly so, as well as to comply with insurance obligations.  Therefore, such trips will no longer be possible under the current cutbacks because, at Loreto Convent, for example, the teachers would each leave behind up to 30 students for each class period, of which there are nine.  That equates to 270 students per teacher, or 540 students without adult supervision during the school day.  According to the letter writer, the decision of the Government will have a devastating impact on numerous curriculum related activities in the school and will put an end to the provision of a magnificent range of extra-curricular activities which is such a celebrated feature of the school.  As well as all of that, the book grant for eligible students will be abolished, school transport charges will increase and any increase in the capitation grant will be cancelled out by the loss of grants for transition year, leaving certificate applied, home economics, physics, chemistry, Traveller education and for the choirs and orchestra.</P>
        <P>A similar situation will pertain at St. Finian&rsquo;s College, the CBS in Mullingar and every national school in the area.  I also received a letter from the most reverend Dr. Richard Clarke, the Bishop of Meath and Kildare, who is involved with Wilson&rsquo;s Hospital School.  He maintains that voluntary Protestant rural schools appear to have been specifically targeted by the withdrawal of support services grants, mid-year, which amounts to a mid-year budgetary seizure of  resources.  The removal of State grants to Wilson&rsquo;s Hospital School will mean the loss of &euro;125,000 of its funding.  The school was hoping to celebrate 250 years of existence in 2011.  However, Dr. Clarke writes that it is &ldquo;not being melodramatic&rdquo; to say that it may now, genuinely, not be able to do so.  He goes on to say that if the Government wishes to withdraw its commitment to denominational education, it is free to do so, but the destruction of schools such as Wilson&rsquo;s Hospital School, which is not a socially elitist establishment and which is very liberal in its enrolment policy for those of traditions other than the Church of Ireland, is shameful, particularly without even the courtesy of consultation.</P><Col N="553"/>
        <P>I could go on but if the Minister for Education and Science wants a summary of the impact the cuts will have, he should read the article by Colm O&rsquo;Rourke in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> last week.  That article encapsulates the exact impact of the cuts.  I salute Mr. O&rsquo;Rourke, who normally writes a sports article, for using his column to point out the negative impact the cuts will have on the future of our school children.  It is time for the Minister to reverse the engines.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>In 1997, 2002 and 2007, Fianna F&aacute;il told bare-faced lies to the public about class sizes and has repeated those persistently since.  They were not the bad years when we had no money.  They were the good years when we had plenty of money.  As the T&aacute;naiste said at that time, money was coming out of the Government&rsquo;s ears but it did nothing about class sizes then.</P>
        <P>The INTO, in the lead-up to the last election, conducted a fantastic campaign, involving parents and teachers, on class sizes.  Unfortunately, however, when Fianna F&aacute;il made another series of false promises to the public about what it would do if re-elected, the INTO swallowed it hook, line and sinker.  I warned the INTO at the time that to be fooled once or twice was bad, but to be fooled three times was too much.  Unfortunately, though, that is what happened.</P>
        <P>I have been in this House for a long time, comparatively speaking, but I have never seen a budget like this before.  This budget is aimed at children who have only eight years of opportunity in national school; children between the ages of four and 13 who have only one chance to lay a foundation for the rest of their lives.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government will damage that chance and that foundation by what it is proposing here.  All of those who vote for the budget proposals &mdash; including Deputy Paul Gogarty, who runs with the hare and chases with the hound, and my constituency colleague, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, who is a very fine Deputy &mdash; will be damaging these children.  Resigning from her teaching post in Celbridge, as Deputy Brady promised to do in the local newspaper, will have no effect at all on this issue.  What Deputy Brady needs to do, if she wants to be effective, is vote against the cuts.  </P>
        <P>In the short time allowed, I wish to refer to teachers, who have been scapegoated in this debate by the Government.  I wish to compliment teachers in Ireland on doing their jobs in extremely difficult circumstances.  I also wish to debunk the notion that they are paid too much.  The reason that 80% of the cost of education in Ireland is wages is that we do not provide the other facilities that the education system needs.  Instead, we send parents out to beg in the street to provide such essential services and facilities.</P>
        <P>Teachers fought hard for decent conditions for themselves, to which they are entitled.  They have well-earned those improved conditions and they have my support.  I am not at all supportive of the idea that they should be targeted to fund the mess the Government has made.  The scapegoating of teachers&rsquo; unions and teachers is something I will not support.</P>
      
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">In my constituency, before these cuts were announced, 28% or 1,300 children were in classes of more than 30 pupils.  In one school in particular, St. Brigid&rsquo;s in Celbridge, there are four classes of 34.  That school will lose two teachers under the budgetary proposals.  Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady&rsquo;s school, Scoil na Mainistreach, Celbridge where she is still a teacher, will lose three teachers.  She said if it lost any teachers she would resign her job as a teacher.  I understood her job was in the House, but that is a matter for her.  St. Patrick&rsquo;s national school is a permanent school on a temporary site in the corner of a GAA field, in which 85% of the pupils are newcomers.  For this reason it has five language support teachers, but it will now lose three of them.</P><Col N="554"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has targeted the poorest people by removing the book grants for children who cannot afford to lose them.  It has targeted Travellers who cannot afford these cuts and who need extra support and it has targeted the most vulnerable non-nationals in schools.  Shame on the Government.  It did not touch the fat cats in the budget.  Our proposals are available if the Minister for Education and Science wishes  to examine them.  Shame on the Minister for this mean-spirited budget aimed at the poorest victims.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to address all aspects of education including from 4th level down to primary level.  Last week I received a brochure with smiling photographs of the Minister for Education and Science, the T&aacute;naiste, and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Jimmy Devins, called Towards a Framework for Researcher Careers which included the following vision statement:  &ldquo;To make Ireland by 2013 internationally renowned for the excellence of its research and to the forefront in generating and using new knowledge for economic and social progress within an innovation driven culture&rdquo;.  In the meantime we heard the budget announcement that the two research councils, namely, the science, engineering and technology council and the humanities and social sciences council, must reduce the number of awards granted.  The budget for research and development activities is down by 31%, which reveals much about the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the knowledge economy.  This addresses 4th level education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In third level education I refer to the capitation fee increases from &euro;900 to &euro;1,500.  There is no provision for increases in student maintenance grants, which will force students already on the margins out of a place in third level.  The reduction in provision of 500 places on the back to education initiative will exclude people who are struggling to improve their skills in order to get back to employment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am bamboozled by the differing versions bandied about by the Minister for Education and Science of the numbers of teachers who will be lost at primary and second level.  The numbers have a touch of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> about them.  They seem to mean whatever the Minister wants them to mean.  However, it is certain that the numbers of teachers at second and primary level will be significantly less next year than this year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The removal of grants for subjects such as physics, chemistry and home economics and for options such as choirs and orchestras will turn our schools into, at best, grind schools, with a very narrow spectrum of subjects from which to choose and where survival of the fittest will become the norm.  What happens to the schools that have been running such good programmes as the leaving certificate applied and vocational programmes, which concentrate on extracurricular activities, and which recognised and cherished this aspect of learning as part of the development of the student, where values other than academic values  have a very important place?</P>
        <P>What will happen to sport in schools?  Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony has already eloquently described the consequences in this area.  It will be impossible for schools to run sports programmes with the reduction in teacher numbers.  Furthermore, the Minister for Education and Science told me recently that the Department has no fix on the number of schools that have physical education facilities.  Why does the Minister not know and why can he not find out? I know the answer to this question, it is because the policy in this area is a sham and many primary and secondary schools do not have even the most basic physical education facilities.  In the meantime the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, pays lip service to the importance of the development of students&rsquo; social skills, their health and fitness and the value of sport in the community.</P><Col N="555"/>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>In some cases the commitments and promises for school buildings were first made more than ten years ago.  I realise I sound like a broken record asking about the physical education hall for Loretto College, Crumlin, along with promised extensions for a school in Inchicore, for primary and second level schools in Crumlin, for Templeogue second level schools and class sizes for boys and girls primary schools in Terenure.  Instead of meeting any of these promises, the budget will result in an increase in class sizes.  Schools will lose teachers, teachers will lose jobs and children will lose their chance of a decent education.  There is no sign of a sod being turned anywhere for a new school extension or PE hall in my constituency.</P>
        <P>The removal of the book and library grant, the withdrawal of substitution cover, the cap on allocation of language support teachers and support for Traveller children will do irreparable damage to the chances of many children.  Parents will be asked for more and more subventions to pay for the supposedly free education of their children.  Does the Minister have any idea how difficult it is for schools to ask parents for one more subvention, or how difficult or impossible it often is for parents to come up with the money?</P>

	<P Just="Left">The question before the House this morning is, simply, does the education of a child have a price or a value that can be measured beyond its cost?  According to the Government it does not.  Its attitude is save now and let today&rsquo;s child pay the cost later.  What are these costs?  I will provide an example.  In 1999 an OECD report was carried out in Ireland which showed we had one of the worst literacy rates in the developed world.  It revealed that one in every four adults lives with a functional literacy difficulty.  That means one in four adults must take a back seat when an opportunity presents.  It means one in four adults does not seek promotion, because he or she is afraid of the paperwork involved.  It means one in four adults does not get involved in a residents&rsquo; association, because he or she is afraid to fill in the minutes of the meetings.  It means one in four adults dreads the thought of a child coming home on a daily basis looking for help with homework and, because he or she cannot help the child, he or she sees the problem recycling before his or her eyes.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year Mr. Larry Fleming of the Irish Primary Principals&rsquo; Network said eight out of ten primary schools in the Cork area were wasting valuable teaching energy fundraising to keep afloat and to struggle with the 17 cent per child per day capitation grant.  On top of this burden, the Government wishes to laden down these parents and teachers with the cost of sending their children to the most overcrowded classrooms in Europe.  I received a text message this morning from a person in my constituency in Cork, saying four teachers are to be laid off from a school in Togher.</P>
        <P>Earlier this week, I received correspondence from Bishop Paul Colton, a Church of Ireland bishop for the southern region, which was sent to the Minister for Education and Science.  Will the Minister respond to this letter?  Bishop Colton says that in 1968 there was an agreement with the Government that Protestant schools would not be classified as fee-paying schools, although fees were charged for boarding and other costs, but classified as schools in a free <Col N="556"/>scheme.  The classification was appropriate because the schools provide education for Protestants in regions and parts of the country where the State does not.  If these schools fold, will the State fund schools under Protestant management?   The Minister for Education and Science must address this matter and respond to it when he gets an opportunity.</P>
        <P>I recall prior to last year&rsquo;s general election a meeting in the Rochestown Park Hotel attended by Deputy Kathleen Lynch and other Members of the House, including I believe, the now Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  Some 1,400 parents crowded into a room and there was possibly another 1,000 outside the door as they could not fit.  They complained about overcrowding in classrooms in Ireland more than one year ago.  Today in the House after a decade of unprecedented wealth, the only ambition the Government can show to these parents is that it wishes to put Ireland at the top of the list for overcrowded classrooms across Europe.  The cost of overcrowding is not only measured in bricks and mortar or classroom sizes.  It has a cost paid throughout the life of a child into adulthood.  It not only relates to overcrowded or combined classrooms which is what will result from these measures.</P>
        <P>I read in this morning&rsquo;s newspapers a headline about the Green Party possibly pulling out of Government.  I was reminded of the line from Shakespeare that children doing the leaving certificate are probably reading today.  It states that the lady &mdash; or in this case, the Deputy &mdash; does protest too much.  We will see how this protester manages himself when he goes through the lobbies later today.</P>
        <P>One can only question the Green Party&rsquo;s motivation to be in the Government, given what has happened in the last two weeks.  Is it that they see the world in cult-like apocalyptic terms on issues such as climate change?  Are issues such as medical cards, decent housing and proper education for our children just worldly things that distract us from salvation from climate change?  Is that what the Green Party in Government is all about?  Is it all about a single environmental issue, or is it here to be part of a Government that represents the broader needs that provide us with a proper environmental society?</P>
        <P>The amendment brought before the House by the Minister wants us to accept that the children of our nation be asked to suspend their right to a decent education.  He dresses it up by saying that when the economic crisis is resolved, this matter will be examined.  He is actually saying that costs must be saved by the children of our nation to pay the price for the incompetency of his Government.  That is what this amendment is about.  The amendment means that as a child goes along the milestones of development in what should be a journey of lifelong learning, there is a toll to be paid at each milestone from now on.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Minister for Education and Science unambiguously set out the Government&rsquo;s position on education spending here yesterday evening.  The Taoiseach also told the House yesterday that the Government would continue to set out for the people the full realities of the economic and fiscal crisis that has to be managed and that it would continue to take strategic decisions to protect future prosperity, regardless of the implications for political popularity in opinion polls.  In the limited time available to me, I want to reiterate the essential realities of the situation.</P>
        <P>The 2009 budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect and while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, education could not be totally spared.  Like the Minister, I am concerned at the air of unreality about the debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;on this Private Members&rsquo; motion that does not reflect the seriousness of the current global economic uncertainty.  Prudent management of the Government finances is particularly important at a time when tax revenue has fallen so significantly and when world economic conditions are so serious.  Even with the budget measures in place, there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</P>
        <P>The budget measures mean that education is one of just three Departments that have increased budgets for 2009, but it still required tough decisions to be taken to remain within this funding, especially since over 80% of the Department&rsquo;s current funding goes on the salary costs of teachers, special needs assistants, lecturers and others working across the education sector.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to education is clear from its track record over the past decade in providing substantial additional resources, most notably extra teachers to meet previously unmet needs, and from the programme the Government set when it came into office.  Much has changed in the past year and the foremost imperative is that we stabilise the public finances.  It is only by doing so that we can shelter gains made and put ourselves in the position of being able to make improvements in the future.</P>
        <P>We will do this by building on the substantial achievements of recent years.  These include 15,000 extra teachers working in our primary and post-primary schools, the targeting of additional supports and resources for children with special education needs to bring the total number of special education staff to over 19,000, the improvements in the capitation grant, which at primary level is now at &euro;200 per pupil and almost &euro;1,000 per pupil for those in special needs classes and special schools, and the additional &euro;79 million in the Department&rsquo;s capital programme, which will facilitate a summer works scheme in 2009 and build on the record provision in 2008 of about 12,000 new school places at primary level.</P>
        <P>The issue of class sizes has dominated this debate and has been presented as a crisis.  While important, the position is not as stark as that portrayed by the Opposition.  The Minister made clear yesterday that all we are doing in primary schools from next September is proposing to staff schools on the same basis as they were staffed just over one school year ago.  When the State was able to afford it, we reduced the basis on which primary teachers are allocated to schools from 35 pupils per teacher down to the current level of 27 pupils.  The change to a new average of 28 pupils per teacher has to be viewed in that context.  Significant additional support went into schools, particularly in the area of special education.  We also reduced class sizes for the most disadvantaged in our DEIS schools to an average of one teacher for every 20 pupils in junior classes and an average of one teacher for every 24 pupils in senior classes.  These will not be changing in 2009.  When we add up all the teachers in the system there is one teacher for every 16 pupils in our primary schools.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Eamon Gilmore.  One of the great glories of Irish education in recent years has been the phenomenon of a great number of <Col N="558"/>graduates and young people interested in starting a career in education.  These teachers have brought new life to many of our new schools in expanding areas, along with the existing teachers.  What has not been mentioned by any of the Ministers on that side of the House, be they from Fianna F&aacute;il or the Green Party, is that students expecting to graduate next year and the graduates currently in conversion courses will in many cases no longer have jobs to go to.  We will be educating the cream of our young people who are willing to take up a life in education.  We will educate them and they will once again emigrate to the UK, Australia and New Zealand, where no doubt their skills will be snapped up.</P>
        <P>The McKinsey report shows that the biggest differential on whether a child is successful in school is the quality of the teacher.  The OECD reports show that we are at the middle level in literacy and reading skills, but we are far below the average in maths.  All the teacher training colleges have concentrated in recent years on new and expanded ways of teaching and interesting children in maths and science.  However, those teachers will not now be getting the jobs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In my area, we have an extraordinary number of diverse schools with a very large international population.  Almost every school, whether in a wealthy or less well-off area of Dublin West, has an enrolment 30% of which is made up of international children, children with a disability in the mainstream and traveller children.  This spells a disaster for a progressive policy of integration that would offer the most marginalised and disadvantaged children a head start in education.  Such a head start will last their whole lives, and all the research shows that.  I draw the attention of the House to Huntstown national school, a facility in my constituency catering for just under 1,000 pupils.  Over the past 20 years, it has pioneered the mainstreaming of international children, children with a disability and Traveller children.  The school has been internationally recognised for so doing.</P>
        <P>I received a letter from a nine year old girl in fourth class at that school.  She stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">My teacher is Mrs. M.  She is a great teacher, but she&rsquo;s not in our school that long and I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;s going to get sacked.  I will be so sad if this happens.  Mr. Lenihan came to our school [that is the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan] a while ago for a party.  Our school is 25 years old and if I had known the people he works for were going to do this, I would have given out to him.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">That is how a child puts it.  No more than in the case of older people who protested last week, the security of those children is to be put at risk, including the safe, caring world of the school that has been lovingly created for them by the principal, teachers, the board of management and not least by parents&rsquo; active participation in the school.  This is the Government that wanted to offer security to the banks, but it cannot offer security to children or the elderly.  It is shameful that Fianna F&aacute;il, which purports to represent the people of no property, has pretensions to make progress in education.</P>
        <P>As regards the Green Party, around Hallowe&rsquo;en in Dublin, children always played a game by knocking on doors and running away.  Deputy Paul Gogarty knocked on Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s door and, as far as I can make out, he is still running.  I hope he gets to the Hallowe&rsquo;en party because it is about the price of him.  Before the general election, the Greens produced a document called &ldquo;The 50 Steps to a Better Education&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>I wish to thank all the Deputies who have contributed to this debate.  In particular, I pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy Quinn, for tabling the motion and presenting the Labour Party&rsquo;s case on this issue.  As I listened to the debate, I was thinking about a primary school in County Cork that I visited some weeks before the budget.  It is a school of 245 pupils, all of them accommodated in prefab buildings because there is no permanent school building.  They have been knocked off the school building programme.  They have a site and have had architects and engineers there, but no money from the Department of Education and Science.  They explained to me that if they could only get a loan, the repayments would be less than what the Department is paying in rent for the prefab buildings. </P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the things that struck me during that visit was a young teacher who became quite emotional as we stood in his classroom in the prefab building.  He tried to explain to me what it is like to be in that room on a cold, wet Monday morning in winter.  He had to try to make the children comfortable and get them warm before thinking about teaching them.  He told me what it was like to be in that stuffy room on a summer&rsquo;s day with the sun belting in the windows.  The Minister has put three or four additional pupils into that teacher&rsquo;s classroom.  The answer to that teacher from the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is to give a precious little homily here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;include the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who has become more out of touch in 15 or 16 months in Government than Fianna F&aacute;il did in 11 years.  I met the principal of that school yesterday evening when she was up here for the protest.  I expected her to talk to me about the school buildings, but instead she spoke about school books.  Her school was one of the beneficiaries of the book grant.  She explained the book lending scheme they had put in place, which is now gone.  That is the consequence of the Minister&rsquo;s &euro;7.5 million cut in school books.  Just as the budget for school libraries has been cut, so too has the budget for gifted children.  In addition, classes at second level have been cut, which will reduce subject choice.  There will be consequences in further education where entire courses will go at a time when unemployed people require retraining.  At a time when unemployment is rising, how can the Minister justify cutting 500 places from the back-to-education scheme?  </P>

	<P>How does he justify cutting 8% from the budget for youth services at a time when society is concerned about what is happening on our streets?  We need to provide worthwhile activities for our young people.</P><Col N="560"/>
        <P>Deputy Frank Fahey challenged me and the Labour Party about where we would get the money.  I have two answers to that.  First, the Government is not making savings at all because down the line it will have to pay for this kind of &ldquo;penny wise, pound foolish&rdquo; approach to education.  If the Government makes it harder for a child to learn in primary school, it will have to pick up the cost in remedial teaching at secondary school.  Reducing subject choice at second level makes it more difficult for people to participate in third level.  Ultimately, that makes it harder for the economy to recover.  Those who fall through the cracks in the education system because of underfunding will end up costing money through additional bills for social welfare, health and justice.</P>
        <P>Second, Deputy Fahey should examine the curious arrangement the Government has made with the banks.  We had a bail out scheme for the banks which was the talk of the country for weeks.  The Taoiseach told us: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it.  It will never be called in because the banks, collectively, will pay for it.  If a bank goes to the wall, the other banks will club together and do it.&rdquo;  It was even written into the scheme that banks participating in it would agree to indemnify the Minister in respect of any payments covering liabilities made by the Minister following a claim made under the guarantee.  The ink was hardly dry on that scheme, however, when the Government did a sweetheart deal with the same banks.  The Department of Finance website published an arrangement whereby a covered institution is not required to indemnify the Minister in respect of any payments made by the Minister under a guarantee given by any covered institution which is not a member of its corporate group.</P>
        <P>While this Government is bringing in one of the most savage budgets in the history of the State, it is giving the nod and wink to the banks that it has asked the Irish taxpayer to bail out.  It is a nod and wink for the banks, but the l&aacute;mh l&aacute;idir for the poor school pupils.</P>
        <P>I am not angry at the Green Party, I am just sad about it.  I heard the contributions from the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and from Deputy Paul Gogarty.  I saw a party that is just beaten.  Deputy Gogarty shrugs his shoulders and says: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s politics.&rdquo;  We are all political practitioners and we understand that politics involves compromise, and there can sometimes be a degree of grandstanding.  Politics, however, also means standing for something.  Unless one stands for something, there is no place for one in politics.  I have always identified with what the Green Party has said and stood for, as well as the philosophy behind their politics.  I have to ask myself today what does the Green Party stand for.  The Green Party went to the people at the last general election saying they were going to look after education and they were going to look after children.  They have let them all down.  They have failed to honour that pledge and to stand up for education and for the children of the country.  If a party cannot stand up for the very issue it put in biggest highlights in its party political broadcast and in its pre-election promises, is it any surprise that such a party drives a motorway through the Hill of Tara&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Green Party is dead; the Green Party is beaten and this is a sad day for this country.  However, the Green Party has an opportunity to recover and to redeem itself.  The Green Party can make a stand here today.  This is a motion which is very simple; a motion calling on the Government to reverse the decision to increase class sizes.  The Green Party, like every individual backbench Deputy in Fianna F&aacute;il, will have the opportunity in a few minutes&rsquo; <Col N="561"/>time when the Ceann Comhairle puts this motion to the House to vote with the Labour Party.  This is an occasion where politics is about standing for something.  It is about standing by the children of the country, by their parents, by the education system.  It is about the future of education in this country which is so necessary if this country is going to achieve an economic recovery or it is simply about staying in office, getting further and further out of touch with the reality of people&rsquo;s lives and further away from the promises and pledges that the same party and politicians made to the public a bare 15 or 16 months ago.</P>

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The purpose of this short Bill is to strengthen the law on bribery of foreign public officials and to give fuller effect to certain provisions of the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, which was adopted in 1997.  The Bill broadens the existing legislation on the prevention of corruption and is designed primarily to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s full compliance with the OECD convention, which was ratified by Ireland in 2003.  The Minister wishes to make sure that all of our international commitments and obligations in matters relating to foreign bribery and corruption in both the public and private sectors are addressed by way of legislation and are fully met.</P>
        <P>The OECD is carrying out an evaluation of Ireland&rsquo;s compliance with the terms of the convention, which includes examining awareness of issues relating to bribery among the public and private sectors, as well as the relevant legislation.  This evaluation, which commenced in 2002, is a process that all parties to the convention undergo.  A team from the OECD visited Dublin in October 2006 to carry out the phase 2 evaluation of the application of the convention by the State, including examination of the relevant legislation.  On foot of this visit a number of recommendations were made by the OECD evaluation team which were intended to ensure that Ireland met its phase 2 monitoring obligations more fully, and a report of the recommendations was published in 2007.  Following the publication of the phase 2 report, as well as the new legislative proposals, Ireland took rapid steps to develop a number of initiatives to <Col N="565"/>raise awareness of the foreign bribery offence, which I will discuss in more detail below after I have set out the key provisions in the legislation.</P>
        <P>The Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill 2008 broadens the existing legislation on corruption.  It extends certain definitions; for instance, the term &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; has been broadened to make clear that as well as monetary gain, the conferral of all types of advantage comes within the terms of this offence.  With regard to corruption occurring outside the State, jurisdiction for this offence has been substantially extended to cover virtually all persons having a connection with the State, including companies and corporate bodies.  The range of foreign public officials coming within the scope of the legislation has also been extended to include persons under the direct or indirect control of a foreign government as well as representatives of a wider section of international organisations.  The Bill also provides new protection for whistleblowers, a term which covers employees and other persons who report suspected corruption offences in good faith.</P>
        <P>In order to raise awareness of anti-corruption legislation, one of the Government&rsquo;s initiatives is the creation of an anti-corruption website, <i>www.anticorruption.ie</i>, by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The website is intended to increase knowledge of the OECD convention and of our obligations in this regard.  Although set up by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the site represents a cross-departmental approach by the Government in raising awareness of the convention.  It informs members of the public about the consequences of bribery and corruption for individuals and for companies working in an international business environment.</P>
        <P>This year, the Government demonstrated its commitment to fulfilling all our obligations under the OECD anti-bribery convention by inviting the OECD examination team to carry out a further on-site evaluation in Ireland.  The examination took place over a week-long period in June.  The visit of the evaluation team on this occasion was characterised by the attendance and participation of a wide range of delegations, including representatives from all Departments, Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Bar Council as well as representatives from civil society, NGOs, trade unions and others.  The OECD is on record as stating it was very pleased with the level of co-operation and participation by the Irish authorities during their evaluation, and a report by the OECD evaluation team of their visit is expected to be published by the end of the year or early in 2009.</P>
        <P>In addition to ensuring greater compliance with the OECD anti-bribery convention, the provisions of the anti-corruption legislation being put before the House today will contribute in no small way to the ratification process of the United Nations Convention against Corruption.  The text of this convention was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly at its 58th session in October 2003 and opened for signature in December 2003.  The convention was signed at that time by Ireland following approval by the Government.  The UN convention is a comprehensive anti-corruption treaty whose stated purposes are to promote and strengthen measures to combat corruption more efficiently and effectively; to promote, facilitate and support international co-operation and technical assistance in the prevention of and fight against corruption; and to promote integrity, accountability and proper management in public affairs and public property.  The provisions before the House regarding bribery of foreign public officials and the protections in the Bill for whistleblowers will also satisfy some of the key requirements of the UN convention, which the Government is committed to ratifying.</P>
        <P>We already have a sophisticated body of anti-corruption legislation dating back to the late 19th century, which has frequently been updated, most recently by the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>That was the first time.  It has only been updated once.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="566"/>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation being considered by the House today proposes amendments, in particular, to the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001.</P>
        <P>I will now set out more fully the provisions of the Bill, which amends section 1 of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906 as amended by section 2 of the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001.  Section 1 contains a single definition, specifying that the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001 is referred to in the Bill as the &ldquo;Act of 2001&rdquo;.  Section 2 of the Bill amends section 1 of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906 as amended by section 2 of the Act of 2001 in a number of ways; in particular, at subsection (2) by the substitution of the term &ldquo;consideration or advantage&rdquo; for the term &ldquo;or consideration&rdquo;.  The OECD has suggested that the term &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; be expanded to ensure that it describes other forms of advantage which might be used as an inducement to someone to commit an offence under the legislation.  The words &ldquo;or advantage&rdquo; have been added to clarify that as well as monetary gain, all types of advantage come within the offence.</P>
        <P>In section 2, the Minister also proposes to expand the definition of &ldquo;agent&rdquo; to ensure the provisions of the Bill apply to people working for or on behalf of the public administration of any other country, including persons who may be under the direct or indirect control of another state.  The term &ldquo;agent&rdquo; is also expanded to apply to agents of an organisation established by an international agreement to which Ireland is not a party.  It is understood that the OECD would favour the omission of terms such as &ldquo;agent&rdquo; altogether from the Irish anti-corruption legislation, which it considers retains implications inherent to the agent-principal relationship, in other words, that it implies subordination and a relationship of trust.  However, the Government is advised that by expanding the definition of the term &ldquo;agent&rdquo; in the 2001 Act and by expanding on it further in this Bill, there is therefore no real difficulty presented by the use of the term &ldquo;agent&rdquo; in the context of this legislation.  There is now an extremely broad definition of this term within the legislation.</P>
        <P>A further amendment contained within this section is the insertion of a definition of the term &ldquo;state&rdquo;, meaning a state other than the Irish State.  The term &ldquo;state&rdquo; denoting a foreign jurisdiction will include, first, a territory, whether in the state or outside it for whose external relations the state or its government is wholly or partly responsible; second, a subdivision of the government of the state, and, third, a national regional or local entity of the state.  The effect of this is to extend the jurisdiction and scope of the legislation.</P>
        <P>Section 3 makes two drafting amendments in subsection (1) by inserting the phrase &ldquo;(whether or not a person is an agent)&rdquo; after &ldquo;where a person&rdquo; in line 1 and by substituting the words &ldquo;relevant section&rdquo; to replace &ldquo;section 1 (inserted by section 2 of this Act) of the Act of 1906&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Section 3 also deals with the issue of extra-territorial jurisdiction in regard to the offence of bribery of foreign public officials.  Normally, Irish law is territorial in its jurisdiction and applies only to acts done in Ireland.  The intention here is to ensure that an act which could constitute a corruption offence in this State is also an offence if committed outside of Ireland, which in most instances is likely to be the case in the context of bribery of foreign officials.  The provision, as it is currently set out, will allow this State to exercise jurisdiction in circumstances where the benefit of the relevant offence is derived by an Irish citizen or someone who is ordinarily resident in this State, a company registered under the Companies Acts, any other body corporate established under the laws of the State, or any legal person that has its head office in this State.</P>
        <P>The issue of the exercise of extra-territorial jurisdiction arises increasingly frequently in the context of a variety of our legislative provisions.  Since the publication of this Bill, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has received comprehensive advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the question of the application of extra-territorial jurisdiction <Col N="567"/>generally.  These advices were not furnished specifically in regard to this proposed Bill.  However, in light of this advice, the Minister is giving consideration to the application of a more consistent approach to the issue in a number of legislative proposals.  The Minister would like to give notice to the House, therefore, that he may look further at the extra-territorial jurisdiction provision in this Bill with a view to a possible amendment on Committee Stage.  The Minister is also of the view that the OECD may favour a broader exercise of extra-territorial jurisdiction than is currently outlined in this Bill.</P>
        <P>In section 3, which expands jurisdiction for the corruption offence, subsection 2(<i>d</i>) includes, among other categories, any other body corporate established under the laws of this State.  In the course of discussions between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the OECD on this issue, it was suggested by the evaluation team that a specific reference to unincorporated bodies to encompass registered clubs, and other such bodies might also be included.  The Minister intends to look at this issue again in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and, if it is considered necessary and if the House permits, will give consideration to an official amendment on this point on Committee Stage to address the OECD concerns in this regard.</P>
        <P>Section 4 amends the Act of 2001 by inserting a new section 8(A) in that Act.  This amendment provides for the protection of persons reporting offences under the Prevention of Corruption Acts, 1889-2008, which is the proposed collective citation of the anti-corruption legislation, following enactment of this measure.  The new provision provides immunity for any person who reports in good faith offences under this legislation to an appropriate person, and sets out that an individual shall not be liable in damages should they report, in writing or otherwise, their opinion that an offence under the Acts has been or is being committed.</P>
        <P>The protection applies unless it is proven that the person making the report has not acted reasonably or in good faith.  The section also contains a provision whereby an employer shall not penalise or threaten an employee who makes a report of his or her opinion that an offence under the Acts is being committed.  Examples of the penalisation in respect of which redress may be sought include the following: first, suspension or lay-off or dismissal within the meaning of the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977-2005; second, demotion or loss of opportunity for promotion; third, transfer of duties or change of location and place of work; and, fourth, unfair treatment including selection for redundancy.</P>
        <P>Section 5 amends section 9(1) of the Act of 2001.  That section enables responsibility for an offence under the Corruption Acts 1889 to 2005, where committed by a corporate body, to be attributed to certain of its officers so that individuals, as well as the corporate entity, can be held liable for the offence in particular circumstances.  The new provision substitutes the collective citation &ldquo;Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 to 2008&rdquo; to ensure that the provision in respect of offences by corporate bodies also applies to offences under this Bill.</P>
        <P>Section 6 relates to the protection for persons reporting offences as set out at section 4, and contains a Schedule providing redress for employees penalised if adverse action is taken against an employee reporting an offence under the Acts in good faith.  The procedures set out in the Schedule include complaints to a rights commissioner, and there is provision for an appeal of the commissioner&rsquo;s decision to the Labour Court by the parties concerned.</P>
        <P>Section 7 is a standard technical provision providing that the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 to 2005 and this Bill may be read together as one.</P>
        <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been working closely with the OECD evaluation team on the development of this legislation.  The Minister has asked me to take this opportunity to place on the record his acknowledgment of the constructive input of the OECD into this process.  Officials will continue to work with the OECD in the future to <Col N="568"/>ensure full compliance with the Convention on Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.</P>
        <P>Where it was felt it was appropriate to do so, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform took into account the views expressed by the OECD and drafted these legislative amendments accordingly.  However, there was not always agreement with the views of the evaluation team in every case.  In some instances the legal advice received from the Parliamentary Counsel was at variance with views expressed by the evaluation team.  We have also retained for the present in these amendments some of the terminology that was a feature of the earliest anti-corruption legislation which perhaps the OECD evaluation team might have preferred to have been omitted.</P>
        <P>The evaluation team has expressed the view that the various anti-corruption measures on the statute would benefit by being harmonised.  The OECD has expressed the view in its evaluation report on Ireland, which was published last year, that, for example, it would wish to see a harmonisation between elements of various statutes.  However, our advices indicate that this issue does not present any practical difficulty from a prosecution point of view.</P>
        <P>The Minister has no fundamental objection to the consolidation of the anti-corruption legislation in the future, thereby putting all of the related anti-corruption legislation under one cover, as it were.  It is understood that the Law Reform Commission has completed the restatement of all anti-corruption legislation.  The Minister expects to have an opportunity to examine the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s work and will then give consideration to the question of consolidation.</P>
        <P>It is expected the OECD examiners may recommend in their forthcoming evaluation report that the Government should support the work of the Criminal Law Codification Advisory Committee, with which the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is involved, in conjunction with University College Dublin, towards the codification of all corruption offences.  Consolidation and restatement of the legislation is an essential prelude to the codifying process.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is fully supportive of the codification project which it was instrumental in establishing.  While it is early days yet in the work of the Criminal Law Codification Advisory Committee, the House can be assured that the Department will work closely with that body if and when it comes to consider codification of the various anti-corruption statutes.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I welcome this legislation.  We will be supporting the Bill, although we may consider submitting amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>I had understood that the timing of this debate was to suit the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I am aware that he had other engagements this morning but I was of the view that the debate had been timed to suit his diary.  I am surprised, therefore, that the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs has come before the House to deal with the matter of criminal law reform.  However, I do not wish to cast aspersions on either the man or the office he holds.  I hope the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will contribute to the debate before it concludes.</P>
        <P>It is a refreshing change to have Fianna F&aacute;il associated with corruption in a positive sense.  It is good to see that party introducing anti-corruption measures and engaging in the fight against corruption rather than, as we have become accustomed to, being associated with dodgy deals and corrupt practices.  The Minister of State referred to the codification of the law, thereby giving the impression that there is a major corpus of law which must be brought together and that existing legislation is elaborate, lengthy and complex in nature.  As regards <Col N="569"/>the latter, nothing could be further from the truth.  The Minister of State indicated that the legislation has been amended over the years.  That is not really the case.  In 2001 there was an amendment to an enactment that came about in 1906.</P>
        <P>We have been particularly slow to legislate on ethical or whistleblower-related issues or matters relating to corruption.  One could argue that this legislative deficit was partially responsible for the culture of corruption which characterised aspects of the planning process for many years and which was particularly associated with the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and its cronies.  Indeed, Fianna F&aacute;il holds the record for the number of Deputies that have been expelled or resigned from senior positions due to allegations of corrupt practices.  The culture under which the making of large payments was deemed acceptable stems from an arrogance at being in power for too long.  There is a particular philosophy which permeates Fianna F&aacute;il to such an extent that the party&rsquo;s entire <i>modus operandi</i> has been the attainment and retention of high office above all else.  Under the philosophy to which I refer, the exercise of power seems to be an end in itself.</P>
        <P>The legislation before the House is not the brainchild of Fianna F&aacute;il or of the coalition Government of which it is a member.  Rather, it arises on foot of a highly critical OECD report and repeated criticism from a globally renowned group, Transparency International.  Successive Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments have shown their contempt for good governance by delaying, procrastinating in respect of and removing proposed legislation on corruption and ethics in public life.  The whistleblowers Bill 1999 was on the legislative programme for seven years before being removed in 2006.  Ireland has signed but not yet ratified the United Nations Convention against Corruption.  The criminal justice Bill to ratify the convention has not yet been published.  However, the A list of promised legislation indicates that it is to be published before the end of the year, that is, in the coming weeks.  We will see if that happens.</P>
        <P>In the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Act 2007, the then Minister for Finance and current Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, ignored the recommendations of the Standards in Public Office Commission and instead focused entirely on the provision of gifts to ministerial and parliamentary office holders and raised the value of a gift to be declared from &euro;650 to &euro;2,000.  Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments have consistently failed to show any leadership on the very serious matters of bribery, corruption and the acceptance of dodgy money.  It is only after being embarrassed by the OECD and having its commitment to fighting corruption and bribery questioned that the Government has introduced this Bill.</P>
        <P>The Bill will amend the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906 and the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001.  It will somewhat strengthen the law on bribery and corruption and will finally make Ireland fully compliant with the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.  It also provides a modicum of protection to whistleblowers who report cases of corruption in good faith.  I fully endorse this part of the Bill because there has been no compulsion to date on Irish companies to protect persons who report transactions of a corrupt or dubious nature.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il has shown a determined reluctance to give legislative protection to whistleblowers.  This issue has arisen on many occasions in different sectors such as health and justice.  A confidential recipient has only recently been appointed within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This followed six years of revelations at the Morris tribunal and eight reports detailing the consequences of allowing a culture of indifference and unaccountability not only to emerge but also to fester for many years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has on this occasion, unlike the last, consulted the private sector on the Bill&rsquo;s provisions.  His predecessor failed to do so in respect of the Prevention of Corruption Act 2001.  If the Bill before the House is to be taken <Col N="570"/>seriously, and enforced as strictly as should be the case, it is vital that all public and private sector businesses must be made fully aware of the procedures relating to reporting corrupt transactions and also of the consequences of reporting such transactions.  The Minister of State referred to a website.  A public information campaign should involve much more than merely setting up a website.</P>
        <P>The Bill will allow the Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions to bring more prosecutions against individuals or companies that are alleged to be involved in corrupt foreign transactions.  Enforcing this law will be difficult.  Will the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicate before the conclusion of the debate the additional resources that will be provided to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for report gathering in respect of such offences?</P>
        <P>As already stated, the Bill came about as a result of an important OECD report, published in March 2007, on Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.  That report was scathing in its criticism of the Government&rsquo;s attempts to meet its obligations under the convention.  The OECD was of the view that the Government did not take its obligations seriously and levelled three main charges against it.  First, it indicated that there was a very low attendance by officials from key Departments and bodies who were invited to meet representatives of the OECD while they were in Ireland.  There seemed to be a reluctance on the part of the Government to either reply to invitations or to attend meetings.  This made it very difficult for the OECD team to properly assess Irish efforts to comply with the convention.  When requests were made in respect of information on the implementation of the convention, much of that information was not provided.  The lack of attendance cast serious doubts in the minds of those on the OECD team as to the commitment of the Government to the implementation of the convention.</P>
        <P>Second, officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform informed the OECD officials that no awareness campaigns on the convention had taken place or that information had not been targeted towards the private sector.  The departmental officials stated that there were &ldquo;no plans to make [the foreign bribery offence] more widely known than at present&rdquo;.  Enterprise Ireland, part of the role of which is to offer advice and support to Irish exporters, felt it was &ldquo;not responsible for raising awareness of the myriad of Government legislation&rdquo; in this area.  What is the point of legislating against the bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions if Irish companies are not aware that a law exists and if said law is not enforced?</P>
        <P>Third, the OECD also criticised the Government&rsquo;s failure to put in place adequate whistleblower protection for both public and private sector employees.  The report notes the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;miserable&rdquo; attempt to introduce a whistleblowers&rsquo; protection Bill into the legislative programme in 1999.  Rather than acting on that intention, two successive Fianna F&aacute;il-led coalitions ignored the legislation for seven years before dropping it in 2006 in favour of what was described as a &ldquo;sectoral approach&rdquo;.  By providing for these matters to be considered on a case-by-case basis, the Government is leaving the door open for corruption, bribery and dubious transactions and engagements to continue.  I understand that the only case in which this approach has been taken to date relates to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, undoubtedly as a direct result of the findings of the Morris tribunal.  The belated inclusion in this legislation of a section on whistleblowers may represent an acceptance by the Minister that the protection of such people has been woeful up to now.  Is the Minister indicating we should expect to see new appropriate legislation to provide comprehensive protection for whistleblowers in all sectors of Irish life and business?</P>
        <P>The OECD report recommended the introduction of legislation to fully implement the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Trans<Col N="571"/>actions.  It proposed that an awareness campaign be organised to accompany the legislation.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform responded by saying there was a &ldquo;general perception that legislation in place was sufficient&rdquo;.  All we got was a typical response from a tired Government and a poor initiative from an arrogant Minister.  According to the Garda, when the OECD report was published in March 2007, no cases of foreign bribery had been brought before the Irish courts, although five investigations had been initiated.  I would like the Minister to update the House on the status of the five investigations.  Where do they stand now?  Why did no prosecutions take place?  Was the lack of resources part of the problem?  I am sure the Minister will comment on the current position.  I assume that prosecutions did not take place partly as a result of jurisdictional matters.  If the Garda requires additional resources, I hope they will be provided.  The penalties for foreign bribery &mdash; up to ten years of imprisonment and an unlimited fine &mdash; are severe.  When this legislation has been passed, the law on foreign bribery and corruption will need to be enforced.  The Government needs to assure the House that prosecutions will take place and due process will be resourced rather than obstructed.</P>
        <P>I am aware that an official anti-corruption website, <i>www.anticorruption.ie</i>, was launched in May 2008.  What other mechanisms has the Government put in place to ensure this Bill can be a success?  Can the Minister brief the House on the measures, if any, he proposes to take in this regard?  When the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, was still in office, he said he intended to establish a committee of officials from Government bodies and agencies who were to be responsible for monitoring compliance with the requirements of the convention.  I assume the committee is up and running and is in contact with the OECD on a regular basis.  The OECD evaluation team was supposed to return to Ireland for another review in March of this year.  Did this review take place?  Is a report on the evaluation available?  What is the position with regard to the interdepartmental senior official compliance committee?  How does the Minister propose to raise awareness of our obligations under the various international treaties to which we have signed up?  How can he keep this matter in the public eye?  I understand that OECD reports and examinations are normally subject to oral reporting on an annual basis, with a written review every two years.  Can the Minister clarify where the latest reports stand?</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001, which provides for a presumption of corruption when a public official or candidate for public office does not declare a political donation.  Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s coalition partners in successive Governments, the Progressive Democrats, clearly failed to prevent corruption and bribery by those in public political life during that time.  Now that the Green Party has taken on the watchdog role assumed by the PDs before its demise, perhaps it will have better luck in keeping an eye on Fianna F&aacute;il.  The signs are not good, however, as the Greens have behaved like a lapdog to date, which does not inspire confidence.  I refer to the vote that took place in this House within the last hour, for example.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Any analysis of political corruption, dodgy dealings and questionable behaviour in Irish public life will show that Fianna F&aacute;il is the clear leader when it comes to low standards in high places.  Over the past 15 years, the State has been rocked by sleaze and scandal on a massive scale, with Fianna F&aacute;il politicians in the driving seat on almost every occasion.  We all remember the Al Masri passports affair.  Politicians such as Haughey, Lawlor, Foley, the two Flynns, Burke and most recently, the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, were frequently aided and abetted by Mr. Frank Dunlop.  Mr. Dunlop, who fuelled the engine of planning corruption in this country for many years, was strongly associated with Fianna F&aacute;il at all times.  He was the ringmaster extraordinaire in a tangled web of deceit and profiteering.  Perhaps Mr. Dunlop&rsquo;s <Col N="572"/>only saving grace was that he eventually agreed to lay bare to the Mahon tribunal some of the detail of some of his activities.</P>
        <P>Is it any wonder that many of our citizens are disillusioned and indifferent to this country&rsquo;s politics, public affairs and politicians?  This disillusionment is compounded by the yawning gap the Government has created between itself and the people.  In the recent budget, the Government ensured that its cronies will be well looked after, come what may.  At the same time, it decided to remove the automatic entitlement to a medical card of people over the age of 70.  The mobilisation of 15,000 people, most of them elderly, after this outrageous and ill-thought-out move showed that the public feels it has to march on the streets if it is to communicate with Fianna F&aacute;il, which has truly lost touch with reality and the people it serves.  When Deputy Bertie Ahern was Taoiseach, he spent more of his time coming up with a strategy for the Mahon tribunal than keeping his eye on the ball with regard to our economic plight.  We have to thank him, in large measure, for the mess we are in.</P>
        <P>I would like to mention a statement that was made by the former Fianna F&aacute;il Senator, Mr. Des Hanafin, who guarded that party&rsquo;s purse strings for many years.  When speaking about protracted public tribunal hearings, he said:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">This demoralises, shakes confidence in politics and public servants, and even destabilises the State.  All politicians and public servants are smeared and held up to public odium.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">While there may be an element of exaggeration in that statement, it rightly points to the importance, in any democracy, of ensuring that politicians are not seen as removed from, or superior to, the people.  Despite the actions of a handful of politicians, most of them from Fianna F&aacute;il, it is important that those of us involved in this profession are not all branded as dodgy, corrupt or in it for ourselves.  The actions of Deputy Bertie Ahern, Liam Lawlor and Ray Burke etc., have damaged democracy in this country by undermining people&rsquo;s faith in their public representatives.  It is incumbent on us all to rebuild the trust between politicians and those we represent.  A package of robust measures emanating from this House is the starting point in that respect.  While this legislation is a start, it is no more than that.  As the Minister of State said, it is a small measure.  Further action is needed.  My colleague, Deputy Varadkar, is promoting the Public Appointments Transparency Bill 2008 to that end.  I propose a reduction in the dissuasively high fees charged when requests are made under the Freedom of Information Acts, which should be acting as a bulwark of transparency but, more often than not, are choked by the bureaucratic nature of the process.  We need to protect and reward whistleblowers.  We should ensure that whistleblowing legislation provides for comprehensive arrangements in the public and private sectors.</P>
   
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il has been quick to make commitments on ethics but has found it impossible to stand by its promises.  In 1997 the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government promised, in its programme for Government, to &ldquo;restore public confidence in public life through a credible policing mechanism for ethical issues&rdquo;.  In its manifesto of the same year, Fianna F&aacute;il looked forward to restoring &ldquo;people&rsquo;s confidence in the process of government&rdquo; and to address the demand to eradicate all unethical conduct from public life.</P>
        <P>This House set up the Tribunal to Inquire into Certain Planning Matters and Payments, chaired by Mr. Justice Flood.  However, when allegations arose about the most senior members of its own Government, Fianna F&aacute;il yet again failed to show any leadership or responsibility on the issue, and instead backed its people instead of the people of Ireland.  As already mentioned, Fianna F&aacute;il holds the dubious record for the number of Deputies who have been expelled or have had to resign from senior positions, and it continues to allow that self-centred mentality within its ranks.</P><Col N="573"/>
        <P>Fine Gael condemns the conduct of former Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy Ray Burke and the failure of the former Taoiseach to properly investigate the allegations against him.  There were many warnings given to the then Taoiseach about Mr. Burke but he decided to ignore them.  Former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern appointed a marked man to high political office and, when challenged, stood by his man, come what may.  The Taoiseach could not even bring himself to ask Mr. Burke a direct question.  He instead chose the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to make inquires on his behalf.  It is a pity the Minister is not here to elaborate on his role and function in the Burke affair.</P>
           <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, initiated inquiries on behalf of the Taoiseach, the Government and the party.  The former Taoiseach&rsquo;s investigation of the Burke allegations was a total sham.  In May 1998 he said, &ldquo;I tried to find out the truth but got nowhere&rdquo;.  This was after what he described as &ldquo;every tree in north Dublin&rdquo; had been looked at and after his colleague the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, had investigated the matter &ldquo;to the best of his ability&rdquo;.  The ability of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Dermot Ahern, is somewhat limited given that Mr. Burke was later successfully prosecuted in the courts.  The then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, in his handling of that affair, brought the highest public office of the land into ill repute.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, recently made an unwarranted political attack on a former and a current Member of the Oireachtas who reacted in an appropriate manner to information they received by bringing it to the appropriate person, the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and current Ceann Comhairle, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue.  They could have given it to the media but did not.  They acted in good faith and history will judge them to have acted fairly, honestly and to have done all they could within the limited resources they had.  The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, shamelessly attacked former Deputy Jim Higgins and Deputy Brendan Howlin, now in the Chair.  In doing so, he showed how partisan and narrow-minded he is.  For him, as in the Burke investigation, Fianna F&aacute;il always comes first, he closes ranks, and the public interest comes second.  He showed it regarding the Morris tribunal and Mr. Burke, and he continually shows it.</P>
        <P>The late Deputy Liam Lawlor was the only sitting Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy to have landed himself in prison.  In October 2000, following four orders to attend the Flood tribunal he refused to give evidence on everything from planning and Century Radio to his own finances.  The tribunal was preparing to investigate eight allegations made against him.  Deputy Harney called in this House for his resignation and was supported by all other parties.  Mr. Lawlor quit Fianna F&aacute;il in disgrace and four months later was before the High Court for refusal to co-operate with the tribunal.  Having been told to co-operate fully, he blatantly refused to do so.  He was sentenced to three months in prison, fined &pound;10,000 and made pay the costs.  After spending a week in prison, he was questioned on the burning of papers in a bonfire in his back garden and sent back to prison for another week.  He again failed to make full disclosure and was finally sent to Mountjoy for a month.  He made a mockery of the tribunal process and brought politics into disrepute.</P>
        <P>All this took place against a backdrop of firm Government support for the work of the tribunals and the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern&rsquo;s assertions, in statements in this House on political donations on 28 May 1998, on &ldquo;the need for financial propriety and probity in the conduct of our public affairs&rdquo;.  However, when push came to shove, Fianna F&aacute;il left the tribunal, which it contributed to establishing, out in the cold, in support of its less than honourable members.</P>
        <P>When the Flood tribunal was established, the former Taoiseach Deputy Bertie Ahern said, &ldquo;the tribunals we have established are, in my opinion, the best vehicle for following up any <Col N="574"/>new disclosure if they can be brought within their jurisdiction and we should not try to prejudice, pre-empt or cut across their work&rdquo;.  He did not foresee himself coming before the tribunal and that he would become one of the key players who would try to prevent and stall its work.</P>
        <P>The then coalition Government deliberately set out to delay the passing of the Courts and Courts Officers Act so that, among other things, extra judges needed for the Flood tribunal could be appointed.  Fine Gael demands that the Bill be prioritised were ignored.  The Government delayed because it was afraid of the revelations the tribunal would make, once again implicating Fianna F&aacute;il representatives at every level in less than acceptable behaviour bordering on sleaze and scandal.</P>
        <P>In March 2002, Mr. Justice Flood had to go to the extraordinary length of writing to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il, informing the Oireachtas that delay in passing the Bill prevented the appointment of new judicial members to the tribunal and this could, &ldquo;adversely affect the tribunal&rsquo;s ability to progress to the next phase of the inquiry as intended.&rdquo;  Only after great public and political pressure was applied did the Government move on the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">No-one foresaw that a tribunal of inquiry would be still investigating allegations of bribery, corruption and unethical payments ten years later and that there would be substantial costs involved.  Neither did we foresee Cabinet Ministers, particularly former Deputy Michael McDowell and Deputy Roche, arguing about costs and timeframes and publicly contradicting Judge Mahon as they squabbled with the tribunal&rsquo;s chairman in a bid to stop its revelations in the run up to the 2007 general election.  The then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, was almost hysterical in his efforts to undermine the tribunal and prophesied that it would cost &euro;1 billion.  We learned yesterday that the tribunal is to cost &euro;300 million, the figure Judge Mahon calmly supplied to former Deputy McDowell in advance of last year&rsquo;s election.  There may be added costs with that but the costs of the tribunal would have been far lower had witnesses co-operated.  Therefore, blame should be laid at their door rather than at that of tribunal employees over the past decade.</P>
        <P>In its 2006 annual report, the Standards in Public Office Commission included a chapter on recommendations for legislative change to improve the oversight of standards in Irish politics.  This has largely been ignored.  The commission wanted clear standards of acceptable behaviour and the power to initiate inquiry.  Regarding standards in State bodies it recommended that the Minister for Finance introduce regulations applying the obligations of the Ethics Acts to board members and specified senior employees of each newly established public body from the date on which the body is set up.  The commission also wanted broader applicability, for the Act to cover other Members of this House not currently included.</P>
        <P>Instead of taking these considered suggestions on board by its own statutory agency headed up by Mr. Justice Matthew Smith, the Ethics In Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007, published by the Department of Finance under Deputy Brian Cowen&rsquo;s stewardship, focused entirely on the provision of gifts to ministerial and parliamentary office holders, raising the value of a gift, but did little on taking on board the recommendations.</P>
        <P>I welcome the extension of existing anti-corruption legislation to include persons acting on behalf of states other than Ireland.  It is a strengthening of our corruption laws.  I endorse the whistleblowers section and we can return to this later.  However, a tougher approach needs to be taken.  A message must be sent to those who are involved in unethical behaviour that Ireland has changed and that unethical practices are no longer acceptable or tolerated in either the public or private sectors.</P>
        <P>I am sorry I do not have more time now, but such is the order of the House.  I look forward to engaging in further debate with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on Committee Stage.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I too welcome the Bill before the House, in so far as it goes.  I have a bit of a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp relationship with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I present at a committee on legislation, expecting him to be there, and I find a Minister of State in his stead.  I come into the House, expecting him to introduce this Bill, and again I find a Minister of State.  While I do not wish to reflect on any Minister of State, there are certain matters for which the senior Minister ought to be present.  He ought to present his own arguments for the Bill but that is not happening in this case.</P>
        <P>There are three items of legislation that precede independence dealing with this issue and when we enact this Bill, there will be three items of legislation post-independence dealing with corruption.  The 1889 Act did not make any reference at all, good, bad or indifferent, to central government.  Essentially, it dealt with local government.  It is very interesting to see the kinds of issues that were raised at that time.  My colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, who did some work on this once, advises me that the outstanding authority is K. Theodore Hoppen and that the prevalence of lemons to be squeezed into whiskey to induce people to vote was one of the major matters addressed.  We have come a long way since then.</P>

	<P>I wonder if we have.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be amused, were it not so serious, at the section of the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech which states that &ldquo;we already have in this country a very sophisticated body of anti-corruption legislation dating back to the late 19th century, which has been frequently updated since then&rdquo;.  How in the name of heavens does the record show that the legislation has been frequently updated?  The legislation has most emphatically not been frequently updated.  Until the rainbow coalition Government introduced the Ethics in Public Office Act in 1995, the matter had been untouched since 1916, pre-independence.  </P>
        <P>If one came into this House as an innocent, one would take the ministerial script as saying that this Bill is broadening the legislation as it relates to the prevention of corruption; that it brings us into compliance with the OECD convention; that the latest inspection by the OECD indicates that it is very happy with us; that everything is above board; and that we have been frequently updating the legislation from 1916.  That is a very seriously inaccurate picture of what has taken place.  In fact, the dominant party in the State, Fianna F&aacute;il, has shown no stomach at all for addressing this issue or for updating the law, not to mention updating the law &ldquo;frequently&rdquo;, as is claimed in the ministerial script.  That is not the situation at all.</P>
        <P>While I do not want to go over the territory covered by Deputy Charles Flanagan, this legislation is before the House today because of the embarrassment caused by OECD criticisms.  The embarrassment caused by Transparency International criticisms, although nuanced differently, is also very interesting and very pertinent to the culture that obtains in Ireland in this area.  The OECD criticisms obviously had to be dealt with, but I am puzzled as to why we are dealing with them in such a piecemeal fashion.  We now have six items of legislation and towards the end of the ministerial script, it is asserted that the OECD essentially shares the position of my party, which is that if we are expected to these items of legislation as a code in this area, then the sensible thing to do is to codify the legislation and bring it up to date.  The script states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The evaluation team has expressed the view that the various anti-corruption measures on the statute would benefit by being harmonised.  The OECD has expressed the view in its evaluation report on Ireland which was published last year, that it would for example wish to see a harmonisation between elements of various statutes.  However, our advices indicate that this issue does not present any practical difficulty from a prosecution point of view.</P><Col N="576"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">That is to quibble with the desirability of codifying the legislation, but I ask the Minister or Minister of State in his reply to tell me what prosecutions there have been to date.  I would like to hear the number of prosecutions taken, whether convictions have been secured and so forth because, clearly, it does not present an obstacle to prosecution if there have not been any prosecutions.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s script seems to hint that, at some ill-defined stage in the future, he is prepared to examine the whole business of putting all related anti-corruption legislation under one cover.  That is desirable and is what lawyers and others would expect and require.</P>
        <P>It is a coincidence that we are discussing this Bill on the day in which we learn that the Mahon tribunal has concluded its public hearings.  It is not our business in this House to draw conclusions for Judge Alan Mahon.  He and his two colleagues will presumably do that in due course.  However, it cannot be gainsaid that what we have endured for the past 11 years has done serious damage to politics and to public confidence in politicians.  It is very difficult to read the evidence, day after day, before the Mahon tribunal without concluding &mdash; and without trying to draw conclusions for Judge Alan Mahon &mdash; that there was corruption and, indeed, may still be corruption, in the planning process.</P>
        <P>Any of us addressing this issue should probably pay tribute to the remarkable patience and endurance of Judge Mahon and his colleagues while at the same time say that there must be a more speedy and economical way to address corruption in our society.  A statute enacted in 1921, which precedes the foundation of the State, is scarcely the most appropriate way to probe corruption.  Rather than frequently updating the legislation, we have been slow enough to address this issue.</P>
        <P>Why is there not an expert unit in the Garda to which many of these matters can be transferred?  Why can we not ask an appropriately equipped unit of the Garda to do much of the work, which takes such a long time to complete and must have due regard to keystone decisions such as the In re Haughey judgment, if one is going to pursue the matter by way of public inquiry under the 1921 Act?  Is there any reason why forensic accountants could not be added to such a Garda unit?  Could members of the Garda be equipped with such a mix of skills, given that it is possible in the Criminal Assets Bureau?  Can we have a mix of skills in a unit of the Garda designed to probe white collar corruption?  We have been very slow in attending to this area.</P>
        <P>There is no wish to link the anti-corruption legislation to which I have referred with the electoral Acts and to tie them in a fashion that will give us greater protection.  The former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Michael McDowell, presented an initiative in respect of the commission of investigation facility which was an improvement on the instruments available beforehand.  However, it is not adequate.  One can predict the response from the dominant party in the country, namely, Fianna F&aacute;il when the Mahon tribunal produces its report.  It will be focussed on the cost, which will be significant.  However, a storm about the cost will be created as a diversion.  The cost may represent a substantial amount of money at a time when we are enduring a recession, but it is within the capacity of the House to produce a more efficient, speedy and economic means of investigating white collar corruption.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Why is the House and the Government so reluctant to re-establish inquiry by parliamentary committee?  Given the nature and the narrow scope of this Bill, which involves the pursuit of misuse of public money and public procurement, inquiry by parliamentary committee is appropriate in some cases.  However, by conventional wisdom it is taken that this method of inquiry collapsed with the Abbeylara judgment.  This ought not to be the case as there were particular circumstances obtaining in the Abbeylara inquiry, which would not necessarily be present in <Col N="577"/>most types of inquiry overseen by a D&aacute;il committee dealing with pursuing the misuse of public money.  Since the DIRT inquiry, there is no appetite on the part of the Government to carry out an inquiry by parliamentary committee.  However, the DIRT inquiry retrieved just under &euro;1 billion for the State and it cost just over &euro;1 million.  It is beyond me why there is reluctance to re-boot inquiry by parliamentary committee.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Power, referred in his speech to provision in respect of whistleblowers and Deputy Flanagan referred to the Labour Party Bill which I introduced.  Deputy Power stated:  &ldquo;The Bill also provides new protection for whistleblowers, a term which covers employees and other persons who report suspected corruption offences in good faith&rdquo;.  There has been a remarkable reluctance by the Government to deal with this issue.  The Labour Party brought forward a Bill which the Government approved on Second Stage.  With the benefit of hindsight this was an act of deception and dishonesty, as the Government only wished to avoid the perception that it would vote down a whistleblower&rsquo;s Bill as a general election approached.  The Government gave the Bill the nod on Second Stage and then buried it in committee from where it has never resurfaced.  There has been much talk about introducing whistleblower&rsquo;s protection on the basis of a sectoral approach, but there has never been a coherent argument advanced outlining why that is a better option.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to the arrangements put in place for the Garda, but it is too early to evaluate the experience of the Garda, it has not been long enough in operation.  Public representatives ought to have access to the confidential receiver appointed for the Garda.  The Garda is a special and particular case and there are good reasons why individual members of the Garda may be concerned about making the approach themselves, which is a weakness.</P>
        <P>I cannot pass over the whistleblower matter without being reminded of what happened in the House.  There was a very inadequate, truncated debate on the eight reports from the Morris tribunal.  The more I consider the matter the more angry I become with the position of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  A retired High Court judge applied himself diligently to the task given by the House of producing eight painstaking reports.  He unearthed matters experienced by the State of the most acute concern about the operation of some elements of the Garda.  People were coerced into signing confessions to a murder that never took place.  Garda&iacute; planted explosives and claimed credit when they were uncovered, as it might assist their careers.  There was a litany of other incidents contained in the reports.</P>
        <P>In his 15 minute contribution to the debate on the tribunal, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law reform devoted nine minutes to criticising a Member of the House and a former Member of the House, referring to a particular remark by Mr. Justice Morris which indicated they might have engaged in more investigation.  It took Mr. Justice Morris, with all the resources of the State, a long number of years to come to his conclusions.  It is rich of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to lecture any Member of the House on how to investigate allegations, given his track record of investigation.  The then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, sent him to London to investigate whether any of the allegations in the ether about former Deputy Ray Burke were true.  The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, came back to the House to report to the Taoiseach that there was no truth in these allegations.  The Minister does not have a good enough record as an investigator to lecture people in this House about the steps they should take in causing investigations to be held into matters of public interest that are brought to their attention.</P>
        <P>The reason this subject is important is because the reputation of the State is vital in terms of our ability to conduct international trade and commerce and do business with other countries.  It cannot be a matter of satisfaction to anybody here that an organisation like Transparency <Col N="578"/>International ranks this country as low as it does.  Therefore, it is critical that we, as a modern western democracy, are in the good books of the OECD on the issue of our capacity to do business with other countries.  After all, we do not have a big stake in any military industrial complex, we do not do business with the Saudis and we are not involved with large companies that supply other countries with a terrible record of corruption.  That is not to say that the issues and the criticisms raised by the OECD are not especially important and we should show the will of this House by dealing with them.</P>
        <P>In times of affluence, people tend to turn away from politics.  In terms of recession, when things are more difficult, people begin to engage with politics again.  We have seen that in the past few months.  In that regard, it is regrettable that the standing of politicians has been lowered in the last decade due to the conduct of a small number of very senior politicians, former Members of this House.  The damage done has caused public cynicism towards politics, which is very serious.</P>
        <P>When the 2001 Bill was introduced, the then Minister was in full flight lecturing us on this subject.  Former Deputy Jim Higgins, to whom I referred in a different context, produced the following quotation:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">I staunchly supported Mr. Haughey.  I admired Mr. Haughey greatly, and few men of this century were more committed to this country and its people than Charlie Haughey.  There is a song which says follow the fellow who follows a dream, and Mr. Haughey had a vision of this country with which I could identify.  A lot of people at grassroots level of Fianna F&aacute;il could identify with it.  It was a vision of a republic, of a just society, of a society which made up its own rules and did not ape and copy the rules of any other country for the sake of doing so.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The former Deputy&rsquo;s point was that the quote was taken from an interview in <i>The Voices of Kerry</i> with the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who was introducing the 2001 Bill and lecturing us on the subject of corruption, yet that was his view.</P>
        <P>There is a need for us to revisit the pieces of anti-corruption legislation that are now on the Statute Book.  At that time, the Minister summarised it as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">At present, the law relating to corruption is governed mainly by the Corruption Acts 1889-1916.  There was some updating to these made by the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995.  Under these Acts, various activities are criminalised as corrupt practices.  For example, the 1889 Act, as amended by the 1995 Act, makes it an offence for a person holding a public office, a special adviser or a director of, or occupier of, a position of employment in a public body, to corruptly solicit or receive any reward as an inducement for acting or refraining from acting in accordance with the individual&rsquo;s duty.  It is also an offence for a person to offer such an individual any reward for acting or refraining from acting in accordance with his or her duty.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">That summary is fair enough, but we have learned that the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 is in need of updating.  There is a need for us to draw the necessary connections between the anti-corruption Acts on the Statute Book and the electoral law.  That needs to be done as does the codification to which I referred earlier.</P>
        <P>I would like the Minister to tell us about the instances of prosecution under the legislation so far.  If it is the case that the instances are few, as I suspect, then the House needs to be reassured that we are not just going through the motions here and putting yet another amendment to an amendment on anti-corruption on the Statute Book, but it is never really the <Col N="579"/>intention to invoke it or enforce it.  What is being done in the Minister&rsquo;s Department to make resources available to enforce the provisions of the existing legislation?</P>
        <P>There is a definite connection between the recession in which we find ourselves and the culture that dominates politics in this country, as well as the party that dominates politics in this country.  If it were not for the unhealthy nexus between 30 or 40 major developers and the dominant party in this country, then we would not be in the depths of recession.  People cried out for the Government to intervene in the cost of building land and to terminate the incentives that were there to drive the building industry.  We continued the tax incentives to boost output in the construction industry at a time when we knew the bubble was going to burst and we were going to be left with too much property.  There has since been a collapse in the revenues coming into the State and, as a result, the hole in the public finances is much larger than it would have been otherwise.  That is partly because of the unhealthy nexus in the culture of Irish politics involving some of the leading developers, whereby the major party, Fianna F&aacute;il, made decisions in the interests of financiers rather than voters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill, which is finally before the House.  It is ironic that a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government is introducing this Bill, given the long list of Deputies who have fallen foul of corruption charges.  The Bill was drafted because of a damning report from the OECD.  At every opportunity, Fianna F&aacute;il has chosen to delay the introduction of anti-corruption legislation.  A good example concerns the whistleblowers legislation in 1999.  The Bill before us will effectively amend the 2001 legislation, providing for more anti-corruption laws.  Hopefully, it will bring Ireland into line with the convention on the bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions. </P>
        <P>I particularly welcome the section which allows whistleblowers some protection in reporting cases of corruption in Irish companies.  It is essential that the Minister should have all parties on board for this legislation and all private and public sector business must be made fully aware of its implications and provisions.  There is no point in placing legislation on the Statute Book if it is not going to be implemented.</P>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to the ethics in public office legislation introduced by the rainbow coalition, but how many people will be prosecuted as a result of the legislation currently before us?  It is incumbent on the Minister to report to the House on the workings of the legislation, including the number of prosecutions arising from it.</P>
        <P>The Bill before the House will allow the Director of Public Prosecutions, in response to Garda investigations, to bring more prosecutions against companies and individuals who engage in corrupt foreign transactions.  This places a big onus on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for that reason more resources must be forthcoming from the Government to allow the legislation to work.</P>
        <P>The OECD report of March 2007 was most critical of the Government&rsquo;s attempts to deliver on its commitments under the convention on bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions.  We need to pull up our socks in this regard.  The OECD report pointed to a number of areas in which we are falling down.  The OECD was disappointed at the low attendance by key Departments and bodies, despite being invited to meet OECD officials on this matter.  It gives a poor impression of Ireland when departmental bodies did not even have the courtesy to turn up to the OECD meetings.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform informed the OECD that no awareness campaigns on the convention had taken place for the private sector.  How in God&rsquo;s name is legislation supposed to work if companies have not been informed or consulted?  In drawing up this legislation, I hope the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has consulted with all private and public sector companies.</P><Col N="580"/>
        <P>The OECD was also critical of the absence of whistleblower protection for private and public sector employees.  All these issues must be fully addressed in this legislation and there is no room for short-cuts in this respect.</P>
        <P>I welcome the section of the Bill dealing with whistleblowers, which is not before time.  Will the Minister now consider more favourably the introduction of a more comprehensive Bill concerning whistleblowers?  Such legislation is badly needed.</P>
        <P>Many of this Bill&rsquo;s provisions result from the recommendations of the OECD in its report last year.  That report criticised the Government&rsquo;s failure to put in place adequate protection, both for public and private sector whistleblowers.  This is interesting in light of the response by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the Morris tribunal&rsquo;s report last week, which was debated in the House.  It has been well documented how the Minister and one of his backbenchers spent quite an amount of their speaking time attacking the performance of former Deputy Jim Higgins and the current Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Howlin.  They tried to deal with an issue which at the time could potentially have been interpreted as one of corruption.  In that instance, the Minister largely chose to ignore the substantial conclusion of the Morris tribunal, trying instead to muddy the waters once again by questioning the integrity of Members of this House.  What message does that send out?  Can we have faith that the Minister believes in this type of legislation, or is he merely going through the motions?  The fact that he is not here to introduce the Bill, despite the order being in place to facilitate him, speaks volumes.</P>
        <P>Exposing corruption is never easy.  It is a lonely place for individuals trying to redress wrongs.  They run the risk of ridicule and estrangement.  The least one would expect is the acknowledgement and support of the State through legislation and attitude in the initial stages.  The Minister is a figurehead regarding all these types of issues.  If last week&rsquo;s performance is anything to go by, however, there must be an element of hypocrisy involved in bringing this legislation before the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should consider the record of the main Government party in dealing with corruption over the years.  It took Fianna F&aacute;il a full 16 months to implement a mandatory code of ethics for public representatives following an assurance in 1998 that such a code would be introduced.  At the time, that party did not comprehend that it was doing something wrong.  It took 16 months for it to act on this fundamental legislation.  Former Deputy Ray Burke whom the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern appointed to a very senior Cabinet position, received a large donation of money, the sum of &pound;38,000.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, initially claimed he had carried out extensive inquires regarding the bona fides of Ray Burke but these inquiries were so casual and superficial that they were tantamount to a cover up.  This is what has been going on in this country and what has been allowed to go on from the very top down, from a Taoiseach.  This sends out a completely wrong message to every citizen and to every person in this State who does his or her job and pays taxes.  This behaviour has been allowed to continue from the top down.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Mr. Tom Gilmartin handed over &pound;50,000 to the former EU Commissioner, P&aacute;draig Flynn in the late 1980s in order to secure planning permission and again with the knowledge of Bertie Ahern.  The Government changed its line on five separate occasions, just like in the case of the medical card debacle last week when the Government changed its tune.  In the case of Mr. Gilmartin, they stated that no one in Government knew the man.  Second, the then Taoiseach said it would be entirely wrong to comment.  Third, he said he had only one brief meeting with Mr. Gilmartin.  Fourth, he then found records of two or more meetings but said he could not recollect them.  Finally, he admitted there might after all have been telephone conversations <Col N="581"/>with Mr. Gilmartin and mention of money to Mr. Flynn may have been made but he could not remember.</P>
        <P>The long line of Fianna F&aacute;il people in and out of the tribunals down through the years is an indictment and these matters must be addressed by society.  We must ensure that people in public office live up to high standards.  This is the very reason this legislation is not before time and it is welcomed by Fine Gael.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this Bill is to extend the categories of persons to whom the 2001 Act applies, extending the extra-territorial application of the 2001 Act and creating the protection for whistleblowers.  The whistleblowers provision included in the Bill will allow employees of companies who wish to report corrupt actions and offer them protection from any sanction from their employers and this is welcome.  Fine Gael notes that it is a welcome, though very late acceptance by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, of the need for whistleblower legislation.  He might now bring forward a more thorough Act on the subject in the coming months.</P>
        <P>I refer to the recommendations of the 2006 annual report of the Standards in Public Office Commission.  The report included a chapter on recommendations for legislative change to improve the oversight of standards in Irish politics.  The commission pointed out that it had made many of these recommendations previously on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis but that none of them had been given consideration by the Government.  The commission had made specific recommendations that could have been included in the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007 but these were ignored.  These included a clear standard of acceptable behaviour, the power to initiate inquiry and standards in State bodies.  All these issues need to be addressed by Government.</P>
        <P>The country is currently facing a recession, principally because Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments have based all their budgets on a housing bubble that could not last.  Major developers have done well out of this but the ordinary person has not.  It was remarked to me recently that in many parts of Ireland the Celtic tiger was no more than a castrated cat when it visited the west and I agree with that sentiment.  Areas such as west and east Clare have not seen high employment figures.  Another focus is needed other than the culture of nod and wink politics and the paper bag.  The Government just looks away and does not try to address the problem.  This comes from the top down and it is stomach-churning.  This Bill is the sort of legislation that is needed.  We need to see leadership from the top down, from the new Taoiseach down.  It is most important that we as the body politic, as elected public representatives of the country, as Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, stand up and be honest and up-front with people.  We must be anti-corruption at every crossroads.  For that reason I support this legislation.</P>
        <P>Enough damage has been done to politics down through the years.  If nothing else, we are sending out a clear message that maybe finally, Fianna F&aacute;il has learned a lesson from the past, that corruption is not good for the country and is not good for the image of the country.  Unfortunately, what happened in the past has tarred all politicians with the same brush.  I support the provisions of this Bill and its passage through the House.</P>

	<P>I was not aware I had 20 minutes but I will see how it goes.  It is good to see the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, here in one piece following her ordeal with the pensioners last week.</P>
        <P>When I started looking up information on this Bill I came across the following quote from a Roman historian by the name of Tacitus which I thought was relevant:  &ldquo;In a state where corruption abounds, laws must be very numerous&rdquo;.  In the context of this legislation the laws were not numerous and we have very little option but to extend them in line with many other countries and with the OECD.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers have referred to contact with the OECD and Government bodies and agencies when it became clear there were deficiencies evident within the previous legislation dating back to 1906 and the 2001 Acts.  Deputy Rabbitte dealt with them in much greater detail.</P>
        <P>There has been significant corruption within this State.  It gives me no pleasure to say so.  I always see myself as somebody who tries to be positive and it is not always easy to be positive in dealing with matters when people were so very much off-side.</P>
        <P>Within our State, in comparison to other jurisdictions, nobody seems to ever go to prison for any version of corruption or white-collar crime.  That is because we have always had the nod and wink mentality which perhaps dates back to the period when we were being ruled by another nation and we were quite happy for that to continue.  Now that we have been ruling ourselves for the best part of 100 years, on every occasion that corruption occurs, and on every occasion that it is allowed continue, we are only fooling ourselves and we are only doing ourselves or, more often than not, the State out of income that could be used for significant <Col N="583"/>State funding rather than borrowing, which looks likely to be the natural course of action for the next number of years.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is important to look at what happened in the United States.  Anybody who was around in the early part of this decade will be aware of what happened within Enron, which was one of the Fortune 500 companies in the US.  Enron staff made up its balance sheets as they went along.  They created new accounting practices and did so just to keep the share price up.  When they hoped it would stay up when it was obvious it would not, they created more new instruments to pretend that the company was doing well and was stable and steady, but it was not.  In the meantime, directors and those people who knew what was going on within the corporation sold out.  It was a pyramid house of cards that could only possibly fall down, and fall down it did.</P>
        <P>However, the difference is that the people who perpetrated that fraud upon the corporate body and upon the investors were imprisoned.  My point is one may draw a contrast between here, where we do not imprison people for such matters, and the US where they do.  In the United States there were congressional hearings and those who perpetrated that act were brought to justice.</P>
        <P>More recently, in the case of banking in the United States, there have been a number of investment banks, particularly the Wall Street investment banks, which have found the going very tough.  This is because of practices which, while I would not call completely corrupt, were very irresponsible.  They eventually leached their way down to the lending institutions within the United States banking sector, which gave out loans to those who could not possibly repay them and those who should never have got any sort of loan whatsoever.</P>
        <P>This has a great deal to do with this Bill because we do not prosecute white collar crime.  We have brought in a number of agencies to oversee such matters but, in truth, nothing at all has happened.  In Ireland, there has not been a single criminal conviction for white collar crime or tax evasion.  Deputy Rabbitte spoke about the DIRT inquiry bringing in over &euro;1 billion in lost revenue and penalties from people from within this State and that it cost only &euro;1 million to proceed with the inquiry from within the jurisdiction of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Later I will touch upon some of what has happened with some of the Members within the House and which has been particularly disappointing.</P>
        <P>The whistleblower section of this Bill can only be welcomed.  Somebody from within the financial sector made a valid point to me, that 90% of embezzlement is found not by internal auditors but when somebody eventually gets the gumption to say, &ldquo;Hold on a second, that is not on.  That is illegal.  What you are doing is incorrect&rdquo;.  In the past we did not have the benefit of the immunity that an employee can use as a defence if he or she has acted in good faith.  If the person acts in good faith and believes what he or she is saying, the immunity issue must be considered.  We &mdash; by which I mean the business community of which I am a part &mdash; pay significant sums to have accounts done for our sole traders or to have internal auditors, whether within the banking sector or corporate bodies, but they do not find such matters because more often than not the embezzlers are more capable of hiding them than the internal auditors are capable of finding them.  Whisleblowing is a matter to which this legislation will give protection.</P>
        <P>I want to touch upon how one defines corruption.  It has often been stated that corruption will flourish when good men do nothing.  There is not a truer statement.  For far too long within this State we have had people within many different sectors who have been getting away with incorrect practices.  When these practices are brought to the attention of the people in charge, whether it be a State body or an agency, we do not take the correct course of action.  If, to expand upon that, somebody within a Department, a school or one of the Government agencies is acting incorrectly and it is a matter for the management to take deal with that person, there <Col N="584"/>is practically no sanction.  The ultimate sanction of course is for the person to lose his or her job, but the truth is that does not happen in this State.  Practically nobody, if he or she is acting incorrectly, loses his or her job.  The best example of this is found within some schools.  Given that most schools are managed by a board of management and patrons, the Department is able to use a hands-off approach by saying it is a matter for the board of management or the patron to deal with.  The truth is it is the Department which pays the wages and it should be able to move in.</P>
        <P>What would happen, however?  A deal would be struck so the person could retire early or would be able to move away or resign but do so with an unblemished record.  The truth is that far too often the State or those operating on its behalf do not take the correct action, which is that the person should be removed from his or her position and the record should be very clear as to what happened.  That is a difficult thing to say and perhaps it is difficult to achieve.  It would require a removal from the <i>entente</i> position that exists between unions, management and the State.  Until such time as we get around to dealing with this type of issue, corruption will continue to flourish because far too often good men do nothing.</P>
        <P>This legislation expands the definition of a bribe.  I remember once speaking to a man who worked in a builders providers&rsquo; yard.  We were discussing the definition of a bribe and he told me that if he helps someone to load a tonne of cement onto a truck, and that person gives him a few euro, that is a tip.  However, if he is given &euro;50, it is no longer a tip but a bribe, and the person who gives it would want a few extra bags of cement thrown in for free.  I thought this was about as good an analogy as one could give to define a bribe.</P>
        <P>It is good that the Bill provides that the definition of a bribe will be that it is an &ldquo;advantage&rdquo;.  An advantage can be expanded into many areas that may not have a monetary value.  That advantage can be knowledge, such as knowledge which allows a person to win a tender contract that will in time give a pecuniary advantage.  While the corruption may be that the information is passed from one person to another and on to a corporate body, that body may benefit significantly from the information or the knowledge.  This measure can only be welcomed.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to an issue that is quite raw in this House.  Great work has been done over the decades and generations by so many people within this Chamber and by those who have left this Chamber.  Deputy Carey&rsquo;s father was a Deputy, as was my father and the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey&rsquo;s.  Unfortunately, some people sullied the reputation of the very large majority who become Members of the House to protect the vulnerable and serve people who are in need of protection.  Those who have sullied the reputation of the House have done a disservice to those of us who are here to serve the people.  It is unfortunate but it has happened.  This Bill will deal with some of the possible future activities.  There are significant penalties under the 2001 Act but further penalties are introduced under this Bill, which must be welcomed.</P>
        <P>I touched on the DIRT inquiry.  One of the things I found bordering on the ridiculous was that a member of the committee investigating the offshore funds, former Deputy Foley, had an Ansbacher account.  It was the most ridiculous thing most people had heard.</P>
        <P>We have done well in terms of attracting foreign direct investment over the years.  We have brought in significant funds to set up businesses in the State.  The countries with which we are in competition and which have taken much good business away from us have proven to be better than us in this regard, although that business was won by competition so the best of luck to them.  With the OECD drive to ensure this legislation is passed, we have to accept that those other countries seem to have better practices than ours in regard to corruption.  Switzerland has shown a remarkable ability to attract foreign direct investment, one of the main reasons <Col N="585"/>for which is that it charges a 0% corporation tax.  Some of the Scandinavian countries have also done exceptionally well, again, because they seem to have a better position with regard to the prevention of corruption.</P>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte spoke about the reason the body politic must be seen to operate on behalf of the State without that body politic being compromised in any way.  While in times of affluence members of the public are not that interested and tend to be more interested in where they will go on holiday or how they can spend funds &mdash; what I would describe as the good stuff &mdash; we are now in a different economic climate and they are more interested in politics and much of what goes on in this Chamber suddenly becomes relevant.</P>
        <P>For example, I recently spoke with the brother of a friend&rsquo;s wife, who told me he was shocked to find he was watching the news and not &ldquo;The Simpsons&rdquo; &mdash; it should not be that shocking.  While I was not aware &ldquo;The Simpsons&rdquo; was on television at the same time as the news, all of a sudden what is happening in this Chamber is seen to have a bearing on the public whereas in the past this was not the case.</P>
        <P>My final point concerns the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern&rsquo;s, performance last week in regard to the Morris tribunal.  I am glad the Minister is present in the House because I am satisfied to say this directly to him rather than say it when he is not present.  His performance was nothing short of a shambles and a disgrace.  I know Deputy Brendan Howlin for 25 years although I do not know former Deputy Jim Higgins so well.  What they brought forward were allegations and they acted in good faith, which is relevant to this Bill.  While the tribunal statement suggested they should have investigated further and perhaps they should have done, they did not have the resources to do so &mdash; the Morris tribunal ran for years, after all.  The Minister chose to blacken the name of two good men, which was reprehensible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am glad the Minister is here while I say this.  I am not someone who would say it behind his back.  Life is a learning process and we all learn.  Deputy Dermot Ahern is a senior Minister and I am a junior Member of this Parliament.  I hope the Minister has learned that last week he did a particular disservice to the entire House, not just to a former and sitting Member.</P>

	<P>I will respond to what the Deputy stated and to what I understand Deputy Rabbitte stated earlier.  I apologise for not being here but I had another appointment.  I do not in any way regret what I stated last week and as I said at the time, it would have been a dereliction of duty if I did not refer to a substantial part of the report on how this interacts with whistleblowing issues.  I said no more or no less than what was in the report.</P>
        <P>The more I listen to some of the comments made by the Opposition, the more the term &ldquo;shooting the messenger&rdquo; comes to mind.  We gave a job to Mr. Justice Morris to investigate not only the allegations made in Donegal but also how these allegations came about particularly in the context of a number of people who did not or could not have had a voice, such as Assistant Garda Commissioner Carty.</P>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte raised my involvement in the Ray Burke affair.  I was asked by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, to ask a question as to whether a Mr. Joseph Murphy gave money to Ray Burke.  I received an answer and relayed it.  I did no more and no less than what I was asked to do.  In the context of trying to link it with the Morris tribunal report last week, which clearly criticised two Members of this House, Mr. Justice Flood issued a report into my rather peripheral involvement in that sorry episode and vindicated it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I challenge Deputy Flanagan to examine the conclusions of Mr. Justice Flood in his report on the issue.  He clearly and totally vindicated any involvement I had with regard to any inquiry I made.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge this is amending legislation.  It is intended primarily to comply with international commitments.  It is peripheral to many of the matters which the Deputies raised.  Its main purpose is to strengthen the law on corruption and ensure fuller compliance with the OECD convention on bribery for foreign public officials in international business transactions.  As I stated, it is helpful in progressing the ratification of the UN convention against corruption.</P>
        <P>This Bill is not designed to deal with the issue of domestic corruption, to which most of the Deputies referred.  In this jurisdiction we already have modern and effective anti-corruption legislation such as the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906 and the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001, both of which are further amended by this Bill.  We also have the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.</P>
        <P>Deputies Rabbitte and Joe Carey raised the question of the number of convictions during recent years.  With regard to corruption related offences in the Republic, the statistics I have to hand with regard to convictions for offences including fraud, embezzlement and corruption are that in 2004 there were 26, in 2005 there were nine and in 2006 there were six.</P>
        <P>Recently, the Law Reform Commission restated the body of anti-corruption statutes.  Therefore, we will have an opportunity to consider the question of possible consolidation of all of this legislation in the future and we must decide further on this.  Furthermore, Ireland has ratified a range of international instruments on the issue of corruption and this is the context in which the Bill is presented to the House.  Ireland is also party to a significant number of important international agreements on corruption.</P>
        <P>The provision in the Bill to protect for whistleblowers is important.  It provides protection against liability for damages, penalisation by an employer of persons who report in good faith an opinion that an offence under the Prevention of Corruption Acts has been or is committed.  The OECD was of the view that such a provision should be included in the Bill and the Government readily agreed.  This type of protection is not new in Irish law.  A similar provision is contained in the Employment Law Compliance Bill 2008 and a provision to regulate for similar protection is contained in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  We work closely with the OECD on compliance with this important convention and we will continue to do so.</P>
        <P>To return to the issues raised by Deputies Joe Carey and Charles Flanagan, the most recent visit of the OECD, which happened at our invitation, was a number of months ago and meetings took place with a wide variety of groups including Departments, lawyers, NGOs, trade unions and many representatives from the private sector.  The OECD stated it was satisfied with the meetings it had and I assure Deputies that the report will be published soon.</P>
        <P>With regard to the points made by Deputy Charles Flanagan, we understand that matters have greatly improved since the 2007 report and that this will be confirmed in the OECD report.  Information dissemination initiatives are being organised by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in conjunction with the private sector.  A website has been created by my Department in this respect.  The interagency senior officials compliance committee has been established and is in operation.  The OECD has expressed great satisfaction with <Col N="587"/>its establishment and has asked that it be kept in operation when this legislation has been enacted and I can give this undertaking.</P>
        <P>Deputies Charles Flanagan and Rabbitte stated there is a deficit of legislation in this area.  I do not accept this and I have already instanced the extensive body of legislation, particularly dealing with the domestic scene.  This Bill is an addition to the existing prevention of corruption legislation which I outlined earlier.</P>
        <P>A number of recent measures taken at our own initiative include the creation of the website to which I referred and the senior officials compliance committee.  The Government will continue to review all legislative and resource requirements needed to combat corruption at all levels.  The globalisation of financial services and business generally has meant the international dimension to the issue of corruption has become more complicated and is likely to continue to do so.  This is why we must continue to work closely with bodies such as the OECD, the United Nations, the EU and the Council of Europe to meet these challenges.  The passing of the Bill will play a significant part in this process and I thank the Deputies for their constructive comments.</P>

	<P>Data from the CSO&rsquo;s Farm Structures Survey 2005 estimated that 8% of farm holders were under the age of 35.  This figure is in line with the EU average and reflects the broad range of incentives in place to encourage the early transfer of family farms.  These incentives include extensive tax reliefs that allow for family farms to be transferred without incurring stamp duty, capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax.</P>
        <P>I point out that stamp duty relief, which is specifically aimed at young farmers under the age of 35 who have attained certain agricultural qualifications, has been renewed in budget 2009 for four years until 31 December 2012.  This is a very valuable relief that focuses on young farmers who are committed to pursuing a career in farming, and its renewal for a full four-<Col N="588"/>year period reflects this Government&rsquo;s commitment to these farmers and their desire to enter the industry.</P>
        <P>Stamp duty relief together with capital acquisitions tax (agricultural relief) and capital gains tax (retirement relief) ensures the majority of early farm transfers are exempt from tax.  Several adjustments were made in the Finance Act 2007 to help overcome technical issues such as an adjustment to capital acquisition tax (agricultural relief) to allow for outstanding borrowings on an off-farm principal private residence when determining whether the recipient is eligible for agricultural relief.</P>
        <P>Full capital gains tax (retirement relief) is available on disposals to family members, while relief is available on disposals to third parties up to the value of &euro;750,000 and marginal relief on disposals above this threshold.  An adjustment in the Finance Act 2007 allows farmers who had their farmland leased out prior to its disposal to a child to avail of capital gains tax (retirement relief), subject to certain conditions.</P>
        <P>The 100% rate of stock relief for young farmers was also renewed in this year&rsquo;s budget for two years until 31 December 2010.  This scheme is focused on new entrants who are building up the value of their herds.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above measures, which are specifically aimed at new entrants, there are several other major incentives aimed at encouraging greater levels of land mobility.  These include an income tax exemption for rental income received from the long-term lease of farmland.  The substantial rental income exemptions are &euro;12,000 on leases between five to seven years, &euro;15,000 on leases between seven and ten years and &euro;20,000 on leases over ten years.</P>
        <P>Stamp duty relief for farm consolidation was renewed in budget 2009 for two years until 30 June 2011.  It is available where a farmer is consolidating his or her holding through the purchase and sale of a parcel or parcels of land, subject to conditions set out in farm consolidation guidelines.  This encourages farmers to swap land parcels to decrease the level of farm fragmentation and increase economic efficiency.</P>
        <P>All these measures combined with the reduction in the top rate of stamp duty for agricultural land from 9% to 6% should help improve mobility of agricultural land and are substantial in reducing the set-up cost for young farmers.  This extensive range of measures helps to improve the age profile of farming through early farm transfer or by encouraging greater levels of leasing, land swaps or farm consolidation allowing younger, more productive farmers to enter the industry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s decision to withdraw installation aid and the early retirement scheme is disgraceful.  He accepts that 8% of farm holders under the age of 35 is an acceptable EU norm at a time when large global challenges face farming.  Nearly 50% of the farm-owning population are of an age to qualify for the early retirement scheme.</P>
        <P>I will give the Minister a word of warning.  The Minister is going to Tullamore this evening to talk about the sheep industry.  While I accept the sheep industry is in crisis, if he were to attempt to create a nest egg to fund another pet scheme by robbing Peter to pay Paul, farmers will not stand for it.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister accept that in the absence of installation aid and the early retirement scheme, the availability of the stamp duty relief on the transfer of family farms will be irrelevant?  The number of farmers availing of the stamp duty exemption will come to a standstill.  Without installation aid and the early retirement scheme, the stamp duty exemption is useless.  These schemes comprised a three-pronged attack to address the age profile issue in farming. <Col N="589"/> In one fell swoop the removal of these two schemes will undermine the effort to get younger people into agriculture.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not robbing Peter to pay Paul.  Resources available to the Department are being allocated.  Next year, in excess of &euro;9 million will be paid out in new installation aid scheme approvals.  Those are applications that are in hand at present and will be processed and approved in 2009.  Up to &euro;48 million will be paid out under the early retirement scheme.  The position is that both schemes have been suspended for new applicants.  I have stated clearly in meetings with Deputies from all parties and the farming organisations that we will be reviewing the suspension of both schemes when financial resources allow us to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>Those young people whose parents may have been transferring the farm had legitimate expectation, to use legal terminology.  What about those cases where a young person enrols this year at agricultural college to do a green certificate or the case of a farmer with a lease signed but waiting for the Revenue to stamp it?  Notwithstanding the Minister&rsquo;s budget day announcement of the suspension of the two schemes, will applicants who have legitimate expectation be accommodated?  Has the Minister taken legal advice from the Attorney General on this matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The decision to suspend both schemes to new applicants was due to budgetary constraints.  I have already indicated that those people who have had their completed applications with the Department &mdash; there are approximately 600 &mdash; will be processed.  When they meet the necessary criteria and are approved, funding is in place&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is avoiding the issue and the question.  It is not about the applications already in but the people who have legitimate expectations.  I am asking about those people, who through no fault of their own, were waiting for leases to be stamped by Revenue or are completing a green certificate at agricultural college and believed they could avail of the scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I have outlined clearly that both schemes are suspended for new applicants.  The limiting of the suspension of the schemes will be considered at the earliest opportunity but with regard to the current budgetary constraints.  In 2009 in excess of &euro;9 million will be allocated and approved for the young farmer installation aid scheme and &euro;48 million will be paid out in the early retirement scheme.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Against the background of the deterioration in public finances, my approach in preparing the 2009 Estimates for the Department was to focus available resources on the measures that allow us to maintain and grow the productive capacity of the agrifood sector.</P>
        <P>There has been a high level of investment in developing this sector in recent years, with the commitment of significant financial resources to areas such as the rural environment scheme, where the rates of grant had been increased by 17%, the new suckler cow scheme and the farm waste management scheme.  Expenditure for the farm waste management scheme in 2008 will exceed &euro;375 million following the recent provision of an additional &euro;195 million.  The first payments under the new suckler cow scheme will issue later this year.</P>
        <P>As I have chosen to protect expenditure in certain areas, expenditure in other areas has to be curtailed.  I have made provision of &euro;56.7 million to meet current commitments in the early retirement from farming and the young farmers&rsquo; installation aid scheme.  This level of funding means that, for the present, new applications for these schemes are suspended.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear from the earlier reply to Deputy Michael Creed that the Minister will not budge on this issue.  Today, a recently widowed lady contacted me whose son wishes to take over the family farm holding.  He would have been an ideal applicant for these two schemes.  However, as they were going through a process of grant of probate, he was not in a position to send his application before 14 October.  The legal instrument went against him and took longer than anticipated.  Will the Minister allow for some degree of discretion and fairness for those who were in the process of applying?  On 14 October the two schemes were cut down in one fell swoop without any notice period.  That did not allow individuals, such as those I have just mentioned, to have some fairness in submitting their applications.  If they had some notice, they might have come into the scheme.  Cutting the schemes off on 14 October was the wrong way to go about it.  Will the Minister revisit his decisions for the sake of equity and fairness?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Deputy Sherlock, I have spoken to people who were in the process of preparing their applications, whether under the early retirement scheme or the young farmers&rsquo; installation scheme, and I know of the disappointment and the break in planning for handing on the farm to the next generation that results.  There is never an easy time to suspend or, as has happened in the past, to abolish schemes.  This is a suspension of the scheme.  When speaking to public representatives, farm organisations and individual farmers I indicated to them that I have asked the Department to bear in mind that when we are in a position to reopen the scheme, the people who had been in the process of preparing applications for submission to the Department should be the first to be processed and considered.</P>
        <P>Over the past few months there has been a considerable increase in the number of applications submitted under the young farmers&rsquo; installation scheme.  As Deputy Sherlock knows, there have been a number of early retirement schemes, in the first of which more than 10,000 people participated, while there have been a few thousand participants in the more recent <Col N="591"/>scheme.  The figure of &euro;48 million to be paid out next year under the early retirement scheme is significant, as is the &euro;9 million that we have&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Sherlock for a brief supplementary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody questions the validity of the scheme or its success.  We all agree that Government policy has been sound in this regard.  What we are asking for is some degree of discretion.  There should be an extension beyond 14 October to allow these people to make their applications.  There must be some degree of flexibility on this issue.  As has already been said, those people who were on the point of making their applications had a reasonable expectation, because they had gone through the process of applying, that they would be within the timeframe.  The Minister has carried out a miserly and mean-spirited act towards those who set out in good faith to participate in the scheme.  It is a sad indictment of current Government policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept Deputy Sherlock&rsquo;s contention.  I can empathise fully&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Minister should tell that to the widow I mentioned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I have spoken to as many people as Deputy Sherlock who are disappointed that the scheme has been suspended for the present.  In the past, when the Deputy&rsquo;s own party was in Government, a scheme was suspended even for those whose applications were with the Department.  In this scheme, only entry for new applicants has been suspended, and all applicants who have submitted their completed application forms will be processed and approved if they meet the necessary criteria.  I do not think anybody has tried, as the previous Deputy did, to dismiss the fact that &euro;65 million has been forgone in taxation measures which are of benefit to young farmers.  It is important to put that on the record of the House.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Agricultural officers in my Department who are members of the IMPACT union commenced industrial action on 6 October.  IMPACT alleges that the Department has acted in breach of Towards 2016 by not informing the union in advance of changes in work practices.  IMPACT has instructed its members to work to rule; not to undertake overtime; not to undertake tasks or functions associated with posts which have not been filled; not to participate in or co-operate with activities connected to what IMPACT terms &ldquo;imposed changes&rdquo;; and not to attend meetings with sectional management.  It has also been indicated by IMPACT that other phased action is being planned.</P>
        <P>My Department has indicated its readiness to avail of the conciliation and arbitration processes provided for in Towards 2016.  However, IMPACT is unwilling to engage in this process, citing the need for additional expertise over and above that available under the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  The assistance of the National Implementation Body has been sought on the matter and a meeting will take place tomorrow as a matter of urgency.  My Department is also monitoring the effect of the industrial action on the processing of REPS payments and is seeking to ensure prompt delivery of these payments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that an issue as complex as industrial relations will not be resolved on the floor of the House, although I do hope it can be resolved promptly.  I seek an assurance from the Minister of State that REPS 4 applicants who applied before 15 May and are now caught in the crossfire will not have their payments delayed unduly.</P>
        <P>On a related matter, which probably goes to the heart of the industrial dispute, will the Minister comment on the EU audit inspection of REPS payments in Ireland?  Will he confirm to the House that the State is facing a fine which was originally predicted to be &euro;100 million but may be revised downwards to around &euro;60 million?  Has budgetary provision been made in the Department this year for such an eventuality?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is slightly outside the scope of the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>It is related to the dispute because this issue is at the heart of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will allow the Minister of State to explain, but the information may not be available to him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a complex issue and I am not quite sure it is at the heart of the dispute.  There may be other consequences arising from the dispute.  In fact, we are dealing with more than 100 schemes here.  Obviously, REPS and the farm waste management scheme are two of the highest profile schemes and we do not want to see any delays in these.  I am hopeful that resolution of the dispute will ensure that payments under these two schemes in particular, as well as all the other schemes, are issued in a timely manner.  This is one of the reasons for the importance of resolving this dispute as quickly as possible.  Under EU requirements, no REPS 4 payments can be made until all 11,400 applications submitted in 2008 have been checked.  As matters stand, some two thirds of all applications have not yet been processed to finality, and the current action is a major factor in this regard.  Hence, the Deputy will agree it is vital that all involved enter into this dialogue in as positive a frame of mind as possible, <Col N="593"/>because we do not want collateral damage arising from this dispute to make life even more difficult than it already is for farmers who are awaiting payments.</P>
        <P>The Deputy mentioned REPS compliance inspections.  All I can say is that the inspections ceased in 2008 and IMPACT has since sought their reintroduction on the grounds that their discontinuation without prior consultation was a breach of the provisions in Towards 2016.  To date, the Department has refused to reintroduce the inspections on the basis that their reintroduction cannot be justified given the findings of the EU auditors.  The Deputy could say we are caught in a dilemma as we are trying not to go against the EU auditors while remaining positively disposed to dealing with the grievances that have been articulated.  With more than 100 schemes in question, the union&rsquo;s request that it be informed of every change in the manner sought does raise practical issues.  We must approach this in a practical manner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>I am alarmed by the Minister&rsquo;s response, which indicated that at this late stage two thirds of REPS 4 applicants have yet to be processed and that this will delay all REPS 4 payments.  The Minister needs to recognise the urgency of the situation and to assist in every way possible in bringing about a resolution.  Farmers should not be used as a bargaining chip between the trade unions which have a grievance and the Department, which is the employer of the technical agricultural officers.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister again about the EU audit and the fines to be imposed on the State.  I cannot accept that the Minister would not have this information available to him, as it is a directly related issue.  What provision is in the agriculture Estimate this year for that likely outcome?  Will he quantify the amount of the fine?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate that this matter is being dealt with.  The Deputy is right.  It is an urgent matter but in working on this draft today the reply has changed in the time since I first saw it.  It referred to arranging a meeting as a matter of urgency and now, as I have been able to tell the Deputy, the meeting will take place tomorrow.  I understand it will be at 2 p.m. but I ask the Deputy not to hold me to that.  It has to happen, and the national inspection body chaired by the Government Secretary General, Dermot McCarthy, is to ensure that meeting goes ahead.  The urgency of it is beyond question, and I hope that can be taken as such.</P>
        <P>All I can say to the Deputy is that audits take place all the time.  The figure he cited is news to me.  I am not sure what his source of information is but if it was to be mentioned I would have been given information of that sort.  The reply I have read is the reply I have been given.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The 2009 Estimates provide over &euro;1.8 billion for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and, when combined with EU funding of &euro;1.4 billion, that means that total expenditure in 2009 by the Department will amount to over &euro;3.2 billion.</P>
        <P>While difficult decisions had to be taken in light of the situation of the public finances, account also had to be taken of the very high level of investment by the Government in recent years, when significant additional financial resources were committed to areas such as the rural <Col N="594"/>environment scheme, where the rates of grant had been increased by 17% cent, the new suckler cow welfare scheme, the farm waste management scheme, and the 8% increase in rates under the disadvantaged areas scheme introduced last year.</P>
        <P>With regard to the 2009 disadvantaged areas scheme, I decided to reduce expenditure for 2009 by reducing the maximum area limit to 34 hectares, which approximates to 84 acres, and by a small increase in the minimum stocking density requirement.  While overall expenditure will fall, almost 67,000 farmers will not suffer any reduction in their payments as a result of the introduction of the 34 hectare limit. Furthermore, these farmers, as well as all claimants under the scheme, will continue to benefit from the substantial increase of 8% in the rate of aid introduced by the Government in 2007.  In addition, of the 102,500 farmers who benefit under the disadvantaged areas scheme, in excess of 50,000 of these also benefit under the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, while in excess of 47,000 also benefit under the suckler welfare scheme, which introduces a new stream of payments to farmers this year.  It should also be taken into account that in addition to the payments under these schemes, a further &euro;920 million was paid to farmers with disadvantaged area lands under the 2007 single payment scheme.  The total amount payable of &euro;220 million to farmers under the disadvantaged areas scheme is part of the overall substantial injection of funds paid to farmers situated in the areas, and the scheme continues to be one of the best well funded disadvantaged areas schemes in the European Union.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the difficulties in the public finances and the decisions I have taken against that background, the position is that in excess of &euro;3.2 billion will be spent next year by the Department in support of agriculture, fisheries and food.  It is important to get through this challenging period and continue towards achieving the full potential of our most important indigenous industry when the economy begins to grow again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of what has happened in this House and outside it since budget day, will the Minister accept the budget is, in effect, merely a discussion document?  The Minister for Finance was able to do a U-turn on the 1% levy.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs was able to do a U-turn today on the issue of entitlement to disability benefit for 16 year olds.  We have had the U-turn on the medical card issue.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister in a position to go to his Cabinet colleagues and deliver a better deal on this discussion document than his predecessors?  This morning in Buswells Hotel, the Minister of State with responsibility for older people, God love her, Deputy Hoctor, asked the ICSA to give her the list of issues and she could arrange, through the Minister&rsquo;s good offices, for those to be dealt with and reconsidered.</P>
        <P>In respect of disadvantaged area payments, the Minister is hitting the most vulnerable people who are farming the most marginal land.  That payment was introduced for the specific purpose of maintaining the link between farmers in difficult disadvantaged areas and ensuring they could remain in farming.  How can the Minister justify hitting the most vulnerable people in farming and taking &euro;1,000 on average out of every one of those farmer&rsquo;s pockets?  Will he go back to his Cabinet colleagues on this specific issue for those farmers who are the most marginalised and who are taking a bigger hit than any other sector in the economy in terms of the suckler cow scheme, the early retirement scheme, installation aid, and the disadvantaged areas scheme?  We are talking about disadvantaged farmers.  Will the Minister go to his Cabinet colleagues and tell them he also made a mistake, and that he will revisit this decision?</P>

	<P>Deputy Creed might listen for a change.  He misquoted Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children.  The Minister of State did not say any such thing at the meeting with the ICSA.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I checked it with the Minister of State and she gave me the accurate report.  She outlined clearly to a spokesperson for the ICSA that of all the contributions she had heard in the room, nobody had suggested alternatives in terms of how funding could be transferred from one subhead to another.  The Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, has been misrepresented, as the Deputy has done just now.  She said no such thing.</P>

	<P>Look at the figures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The reality is not what the Deputy tried to portray.  If one takes into account a Supplementary Estimate on the capital side that was extremely high &mdash; &euro;195 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>

	<P>Yes, I have enough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>We will see.  Are you saying you will not be coming back with a Supplementary Estimate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Creed issued a statement in August to the effect that nobody would be paid from thence on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>As a result you got up off your backside and introduced a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Please allow the Minister to answer the question.  Supplementary questions should be put through the chair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The reality is that in the coming year the following payments will be made to farmers: the single payment scheme, &euro;1,300 million; REPS, &euro;355 million; disadvantaged areas scheme, &euro;220 million; and suckler cow welfare scheme, &euro;44 million.  A total of &euro;33 million is being paid out under the suckler cow welfare scheme, which will be paid later this year.  That is a new payment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>Some &euro;40 per cow next year.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="596"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  Deputy Creed is misrepresenting the situation again.  He is obviously not prepared to listen and hear the facts.  We had to reallocate some expenditure.  I decided reluctantly to reduce the expenditure on the disadvantaged areas scheme.  I have already outlined that the vast majority of people in the disadvantaged areas scheme will not have their payment affected.  It is people with hectarage above 34 hectares who will be affected.  Everybody will be paid up to the rate of 34 hectares.</P>
        <P>I want to give the Deputy some facts.  The total area that will not be payable under the new limit is 204,000 hectares in the cases of more severely and less severely disadvantaged lands, while the area reduced in the case of mountain type grazing is 102 hectares.  There was some misrepresentation that that latter category with the biggest hectarage would be affected.  That is not correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>Where stands the commitment of the Minister, his Department and the Government to social partnership?  These were schemes signed off in good faith less than 12 months ago, in respect of the sucker cow welfare scheme, when the Minister had or should have had full knowledge of the budgetary situation, if he was not asleep at the wheel.  What about the commitment to an &euro;80 payment per suckler cow and &euro;90 next year?  Where stands social partnership, which made arrangements recently for the disadvantaged area payments?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>This year, as last year, an 8% increase was paid by the Department under the disadvantaged areas scheme.  Deputy Creed refers to the suckler cow welfare scheme.  It was agreed in the partnership agreement, Towards 2016, that a five year, &euro;250 million suckler cow scheme would be introduced.  That commitment will be honoured and no amount of misrepresentation by the Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Creed does not want to listen to the facts.  The Government gave a commitment and no misrepresentation on the part of the Deputy or others will deflect attention from the fact that it is honouring that commitment, which relates to the payment of &euro;250 million through a new five-year suckler cow scheme.  The commitment will be honoured.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The sheep sector is an important part of the overall agrifood sector and its future depends on its ability to meet the needs of the market.  The sheep industry strategy development group and the subsequent implementation group set the blueprint for the sector&rsquo;s future development.  Most of the recommendations fall to be implemented by the industry.  However, the Department and the State agencies under its aegis are also playing an active role.  Good progress is being made and the following is a summary of the main actions taken: payments of an additional &euro;6 million to qualifying sheep farmers were issued under the national reserve; the Department secured European Commission approval for a new supplementary measure in REPS 4 to promote the mixed grazing of cattle and sheep and under this a farmer can qualify for an annual payment of up to &euro;1,000 in addition to his or her basic REPS payment; the pedigree sheep breeding prog<Col N="597"/>ramme, as operated by my Department in co-operation with the sheep breed societies, is being transferred to Sheep Ireland, a sister company of the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation and an interim sheep board has been established to manage and oversee the transfer; a trial to examine the feasibility of mechanical carcase classification for lamb &mdash; the results of which are expected shortly &mdash; was conducted earlier this year and it is hoped that the system will allow for the accurate and objective mechanical classification of lamb carcases and that it will gain universal industry support; the lamb quality assurance scheme, which was established in 2007, has led to some 6,500 farms being registered to date; Bord Bia is continuing to organise strategic marketing campaigns in selected European markets and in conjunction with its French and British counterparts, it is undertaking a three-year generic lamb promotion on the very important French market to promote lamb to younger consumers; and Teagasc has developed a comprehensive plan to restructure its sheep support services, including a programme for technology evaluation and transfer farms, which includes hill and lowland areas.</P>
        <P>These measures complement those to be taken by the industry in the implementation of the Malone Report.  I am satisfied that our Department is dealing satisfactorily with the areas of the report within its remit.</P>
 
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P el="0">Turning to the resources that will be available to the sector in 2009, it is worthwhile first to recall that  &euro;27.5 million approximately was paid under the sheep headage scheme and &euro;107.5 million was paid under the ewe premium scheme in 2000 and 2004, respectively &mdash; the last years of operation of such coupled payments.  Those schemes are now incorporated into the disadvantaged areas and single farm payment schemes and sheep farmers will continue to benefit under these subject to compliance with the relevant conditions.</P>
        <P>I will now outline other financial provisions that will benefit the sheep sector.  In the case of REPS, sheep farmers can qualify for the mixed grazing supplementary measure of up to &euro;1,000 and, where appropriate, qualify for the increased payment rates on Natura 2000 land, non-Natura 2000 commonage and on designated NHA land.  Some &euro;355 million has been allocated to REPS for 2009.</P>
        <P>Under the 2005 national reserve, some 500 hill sheep farmers benefit to the amount of &euro;400,000 annually or &euro;2.8 million over the period until 2012.  In addition, a special category was included under the 2007 national reserve for sheep farmers whose existing single payments are less than &euro;10,000 and where individual entitlements are less than the district electoral division, DED, average.  Allocations are capped at the DED average value of entitlements or a total single payment of &euro;10,000, whichever is the lesser, and allocations to successful applicants will not exceed &euro;1,000.  It is estimated that this measure will be worth some &euro;6 million annually or &euro;42 million over the period until 2012.</P>
        <P>The pedigree sheep breeding programme as operated by my Department, in co-operation with the sheep breed societies, is being transferred to Sheep Ireland, a sister company of the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF.  An interim sheep board has been established to manage and oversee the transfer.  To facilitate this transfer and to allow for redevelopment of the breeding programme, funding of &euro;163,000 has been provided to date in 2008.  My Department will provide further financial support to ICBF in 2009 for sheep breeding.</P>
        <P>A trial to examine the feasibility of mechanical classification for lamb was conducted earlier this year at a cost of &euro;135,000.  Additional funding at a similar level may be made available to carry out additional feasibility work, if required, in 2009.</P>
        <P>The lamb quality assurance scheme operated by Bord Bia has 6,500 participants and it is hoped to expand this by a further 6,000 in 2009.  This could involve spending of up to &euro;1 million <Col N="598"/>depending on uptake.  In addition, Bord Bia  will spend in the region of &euro;1 million on the promotion of sheep and lamb at home and abroad in 2009.</P>
        <P>Teagasc allocated approximately &euro;1.5 million in 2007 and 2008 on sheep research activities and these will be continued into 2009.  This also covers specialist staff for the sheep programme established following the sheep strategy group&rsquo;s report.  It does not include additional funding related to the advisory service, some of which would be directed towards sheep.</P>
        <P>Finally, the problems facing the sheep sector are well known at EU level.  The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor ensured they were discussed at the EU Agriculture Council of Ministers in March.  This was followed by the Aylward report to the European Parliament and a conference hosted by the French Presidency of the EU in September.  These initiatives have kept the sheep sector&rsquo;s concerns to the forefront and, in the context of the current CAP health check discussions, we continue to pursue possible solutions.</P>
     </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AndrewDoyle"><NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State referred to wonderful schemes, feasibility studies, marketing tools, etc.  Why have sheep numbers decreased by 50% in the past ten years and 240,000 on the most recent 12-month calculation?  The disadvantaged areas scheme provides sheep farmers with a direct fillip in the context of their incomes.  The owner of a 45-hectare sheep farm comprising mountain-type land will lose &euro;1,055 on foot of the cuts in disadvantaged areas scheme payments.  A PAYE worker would want to be earning &euro;100,000 and be charged a levy at 1% to incur the same loss.</P>
        <P>The REPS 4 measure to which the Minister of State referred involves &euro;28 million.  In May, only &euro;9,000 of it had been drawn down.  The measure is unworkable and the Minister of State is well aware of that.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Smith, stated that Peter would not be robbed in order to pay Paul.  What will happen to the single farm payment modulation in the context of the proposed sheep welfare scheme?  I guarantee those opposite that a proposal will be made to take that money and pay it out directly by way of some measure relating to sheep.  The long-term aim is to end the disadvantaged areas scheme and transfer the moneys relating to it to some rural development fund under the control of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should ask a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AndrewDoyle"><NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am doing so.  In light of the statistics to which I refer in respect of sheep, how can the Minister of State say that everything is being done to protect the industry?  What he said just does not add up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be an increase of 8% in disadvantaged areas scheme payments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is taking, on average, &euro;1,000 off these people.</P>

	<P>That amount might not be as much as people might like.  However, we are doing our best within budgetary restraints that exist.  We are not doing what the Deputy is attempting to do, namely, create a negative impression.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Doyle inquired as to why sheep numbers have decreased and he probably knows the answer to that question.  As stated earlier, there is an issue to be addressed as regards the demand for sheepmeat.  We must ensure that this demand increases.</P>

	<P>Why is Bord Bia&rsquo;s budget being cut?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The situation is not helped by the fact that since the advent of single farm payments, farmers are no longer required to retain sheep for premia purposes.  There was, therefore, a support based on numbers rather than on the areas in which the people affected were living.</P>
        <P>Prices for the year are up by approximately 5% on last year.  There has been a drop in recent weeks.  This is a market-driven situation and the difficulties relating to it will not be solved by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Deputy Creed should cease interrupting.  He did not table this question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I travelled to Paris in order to assist Bord Bia in its promotions because the French market is extremely important to Ireland.  The reality is that sheepmeat is primarily being bought by older customers.  We must try to bring about a change in that regard.  This is the challenge we face.  If Deputy Doyle has any useful suggestions to make, I would be more than happy to listen to them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AndrewDoyle"><NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I received a reply to a parliamentary question I tabled yesterday regarding the number of sheep being slaughtered in Irish plants that originate in Northern Ireland, Scotland or England.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is supposed to ask a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AndrewDoyle"><NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am about to do so.  In the reply I received yesterday, it is stated that in week 34 of 2006 some 3,964 animals were slaughtered, while 6,165 were slaughtered in the corresponding week in 2007.  Does the Minister of State have any proposals to control the way in which the price in the Republic is controlled and managed by the processors in the context of the ebb and flow of the supply of meat they receive from countries outside the jurisdiction?  It is a cartel.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the reply to which the Deputy refers.  There is no restriction with regard to sheep movements between the North and the South.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AndrewDoyle"><NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, there are restrictions.  It is not possible to export breeding sheep.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should be allowed to reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>

	<P>We do not have in place the restrictions that would be required if a problem arose.  However, there is no such problem.  We market the island as the &ldquo;Food Island&rdquo; and sheepmeat comes into the equation in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AndrewDoyle"><NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Not all of that meat originates on this island.  Some of it comes from Scotland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point.  There may be a need to contact the authorities in Northern Ireland or Scotland in that regard.  As already stated, however, we take a &ldquo;one-island&rdquo; approach.</P>

	<P>There are 94 commitments in the programme for Government for which my Department has direct responsibility.  In the first year of the Government&rsquo;s five-year term, 67% of these commitments have been implemented or are, by their nature, being implemented on an ongoing basis.  A detailed report on progress achieved is published on the web site of the Department of the Taoiseach,<i>www.taoiseach.gov.ie</i>.  The following is a list of examples of major commitments that are being implemented.</P>
        <P>The assignment to my Department of overall responsibility for the development and promotion of the agrifood sector is being strategically progressed through high-level interdepartmental groups and proactive sectoral policies.  For the first time, the value of food and drink exports from Ireland reached &euro;9.2 billion in 2007.  The resources made available to Bord Bia have enabled it to exceed the Government target of doubling food exports to Asia two years ahead of target.</P>
        <P>Grant assistance of &euro;114 million is being provided for capital investment for the dairy processing sector.  This will generate an estimated capital spend of about  &euro;286 million.  Investment of &euro;30 million has been put in place for innovative initiatives in the prepared consumer foods sector.</P><Col N="601"/>
        <P>Significant funding has been provided to develop the competitiveness and sustainability of the overall agriculture, forestry and fisheries sector through the proactive implementation of the rural and national development plans.  Payment levels under the rural environment protection scheme have increased by 17%.  The average annual payment has grown from &euro;6,170 to &euro;7,220.  Total payments in 2007 and 2008, to date, amount to &euro;525 million.  The provision for 2009 has been increased to &euro;355 million.  Almost &euro;114 million was provided under the farm waste management scheme in 2007.  Over &euro;375 million will be spent on the scheme in 2008.  This compares well to the agreed total allocation under the Towards 2016 agreement.  The relevant section of that agreement states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Payments under the new Farm Waste Management measure will be financed, at the rates already announced, from this funding package.  A total of &euro;350 million will be allocated for farm waste and other on-farm investment measures.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Advance payments of &euro;532 million have already been issued under the 2008 single payment scheme, six weeks ahead of the normal commencement date.  Balancing payments will commence on 1 December next and will continue as individual cases are cleared.  In 2007, payments worth approximately &euro;1.3 billion were issued under the scheme.  A similar level of payment is expected under the 2008 scheme.  The value of annual forestry premiums has been increased by 15%.  The 100% establishment grants and 20-year payment period have been retained.  Some &euro;230.9 million has been spent on afforestation initiatives in 2007 and to date in 2008.  The forestry provision for 2009 has been increased by 6% to &euro;128 million.  Some &euro;42 million has been allocated for the voluntary fishing fleet decommissioning scheme to assist fleet restructuring and increase the level of fish quotas available for those remaining in the industry.  In excess of &euro;18 million was spent in 2007 on improving fisheries infrastructure and landing facilities under the fishery harbour and coastal infrastructure programme.  A further &euro;17 million has been provided to make progress with this work in 2009.  This is an impressive list of achievements by any standards.  It demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the agri-food sector.  We are keen to make progress with the commitments set out in the five-year programme for Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>The original question was based on the premise that budgetary cuts have been applied across the board in the agriculture sector.  This is the only opportunity available to me to highlight some of those cuts.  For example, investment in research and training has decreased by 13%.  Similar reductions have been applied in areas like food safety, health and welfare, plant health, income and market supports and income supports for disadvantaged areas.  When one examines the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food&rsquo;s entire programme of expenditure, one has to conclude that the Government&rsquo;s ability to implement the programme for Government is seriously hampered.  Those of us responsible for the agriculture brief have not been given any legislation to consider since the last election.  When will the animal welfare Bill be published, in line with the commitment in the programme for Government?  The extensive consultation period in that regard does not seem to have come to a conclusion.  On what date will it be concluded?  I would also like to ask about the proposed establishment of an all-Ireland GM-free zone.  When does the Department envisage that this process will be concluded and this policy will be implemented?</P>

	<P>When does the Minister envisage that the target of dedicating 5% of acreage to organic farmland will be reached?  The European Commission recently announced that it does not envisage that mandatory country of origin labelling will be introduced.  The <Col N="602"/>programme for Government states that mandatory country of origin food labelling will be extended to sheep, pig and poultry meat.  Will that measure be implemented?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The forestry Bill is being prepared.  The Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, who cannot be with us this afternoon because he has another commitment, has done extensive work on that Bill.  Deputy Sherlock has asked about the animal welfare Bill on the Order of Business on a number of occasions.  He is aware that a great deal of work has already been undertaken in that regard.  Significant progress has been made with the drafting of the proposed animal health and welfare Bill.  It is intended that the legislation will give effect to a number of the commitments outlined in the programme for Government.</P>
        <P>The Deputy mentioned the process of public consultation on the draft Bill, which was initiated earlier this year.  Almost 400 submissions, containing wide-ranging observations, were received during that process.  They are being examined in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  If people go to the trouble of making detailed submissions and observations, it is only fair that they be given detailed and appropriate consideration.  A number of those who made submissions subsequently contacted the Department to ask for meetings to be arranged to give them an opportunity to elaborate further on them.  The drafting of the legislation is continuing.  It is obvious that all the submissions will be taken into account during that process.</P>
        <P>When I met representatives of various organisations, such as the Veterinary Council of Ireland and Veterinary Ireland, they indicated that they would like to meet departmental officials to elaborate further on their daily professional experience.  I mention those two groups because I met delegations from them recently to discuss other matters.  The representatives of the various bodies are keen to attend meetings so that these matters can be scrutinised in greater detail than is possible by means of written submissions of the type we all receive and sometimes make ourselves.  I assure the House that substantial progress has been made with this important and complex legislation.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, is actively promoting organic farming throughout this jurisdiction.  The rural environment protection scheme makes provision for organic farming.  Deputy Sherlock did not mention the substantial increase in expenditure under the scheme when he listed some of the matters which are covered in the Book of Estimates.  The Minister of State has done exceptional work to encourage organic production in all parts of the country.  Deputies will be aware that there have been huge attendances at the various farm walks and seminars which have been arranged to promote organic farming.</P>
        <P>Deputy Sherlock also spoke about the issue of labelling.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, in conjunction with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the Department of Health and Children, has undertaken extensive work on the matter over recent years.  The Department of Health and Children, on behalf of the Government, has provided detailed submissions on the issue to the European Union.  Our proposals have not been approved, unfortunately.</P>

	<P>The Common Agricultural Policy health check dossier was presented to Ministers at the informal Council meeting that was held in May.  A full first round examination of the text of the dossier has been completed by the working groups.  Most of the technical and linguistic issues have been addressed.  Trilateral meetings took place at the meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 29 and 30 September to identify three main priorities for each member state.  It is intended that the debate on the political issues will commence in October, at the special committee on agriculture and at a series of high-level working groups.  Further trilateral discussions took place at a meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Luxembourg on Monday night and Tuesday morning of this week.  The discussions aimed to further refine the outstanding political issues.  The negotiations are entering a decisive phase.  The French Presidency remains confident that the proposals will be adopted as a package at the November meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council.  The health check proposals, which have been described as a fine tuning of the 2003 reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, concentrate on three areas.  The implementation of the single payment scheme is being reviewed.  Various market management measures, including the milk quota regime, are also being reviewed.  The Union is working on its response to the new challenges of climate change, bioenergy, water management and biodiversity.</P>
        <P>The impact of this package of measures on Irish agriculture will depend on what is agreed at the end of the negotiations.  During that process, I will try to achieve the best possible outcome for Ireland and for our agriculture sector.  I outlined the issues which are of concern to Ireland to the Commissioner, Ms Fischer-Boel, the French Presidency, Commission officials and to my colleagues in other member states.  I will continue to take an active role in the discussions at every opportunity and to reiterate our priorities.</P>
        <P>During the meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Luxembourg on Tuesday of this week, I had a productive and constructive private meeting with the Commissioner, Ms Fischer-Boel, and the President of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council, Mr. Barnier.  We discussed Ireland&rsquo;s main priorities during the Common Agricultural Policy health check.  I explained that my key concerns pertain to milk quotas and additional modulation.  I stressed the need for a genuine soft landing in the milk sector when milk quotas come to an end.  A predictable set of steps will have to be followed at that stage to allow farmers, and the industry as a whole, to plan for the future.  I emphasised the need for progressive quota increases.  I specifically requested that additional quota allocations for Ireland be front-loaded, in light of Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to increase production progressively.  I asked the Commissioner to make adjustments to the butter fat calculations to facilitate the release of higher levels of quota in 2009.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House. </i></P>
<P el="0">I outlined to the Commissioner my opposition to the substantial increase in modulation that is proposed.  I sought an increase in available EU funding for special sectoral measures to assist farmers.  Many member states, including Ireland, cannot fully utilise the funding allocated for the single farm payment scheme because of the complex and restrictive rules governing it.  Therefore, I am seeking greater national discretion in the use of these funds.  If agreed, this would release these unspent funds, in effect, and provide additional money for necessary measures to assist farmers.  A consultative process with key stakeholders was established to advise on the main issues arising in the health check.  The output from this will feed into Ireland&rsquo;s position in the negotiations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>I see Mr. Barnier has indicated an anxiety to complete the health check during the French Presidency.  Does the Minister think that is realistic?  Does the Minister <Col N="604"/>agree with what is on the table regarding modulation?  I am interested in this particularly in the context of the Irish sheep sector.  I suspect a nod and wink game is being played between the Minister and the Commissioner; the Minister will publicly oppose the increased modulation, but on the basis that it will salvage the sheep sector, he will take credit for it out of the other side of his mouth.  No robbing Peter to pay Paul is acceptable in the context of the single farm payment modulation proposals.  We need something for the sheep industry but not by taking from one farmer&rsquo;s pocket to put it into another&rsquo;s.  Returning here and hiding behind Commissioner Fischer Boel&rsquo;s coat tails on modulation will not be acceptable.</P>
        <P>My second question is serious and coming from where he does in terms of the milk industry and processing companies in his area the Minister will be very familiar with it.  Global dairy markets are in a tail spin.  While much of the debate on the CAP health check is on increased quotas, would the Minister agree that the political imperative is to put some kind of floor price on dairy produce?  Skimmed milk powder and butter prices are down almost 50% in 12 months.  It is an alarming situation and predictions on price per litre will cause carnage not just at farm gate but also in the processing industry.  Will the Minister use the health check to advance that agenda of imposing a floor price on dairy produce?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>On the French Presidency&rsquo;s optimism or expectations on when the health check should be completed, there was an Agriculture and Fisheries Council on Monday and Tuesday of this week.  The next meeting is on 18 and 19 of November and we have pencilled in another day for the end of November, around the last Friday of November.  From speaking to other member states and the French Presidency, their expectation is that very substantial progress will be achieved by 19 November.  We have all been advised for some time of the expectation of another council meeting before the end of November should the health check discussions not be finalised on 19 November.  Earlier in the week we had our second trilateral meeting with Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel and with the Presidency, as have all other member states.  The first meeting took place a few weeks earlier.  We clearly outlined our total opposition to the proposals contained in the Commission papers for a very serious rise in modulation rates.  We have consistently outlined our position, both in the Council of Ministers at the full plenary meetings and in our trilateral discussions.</P>
        <P>In discussions officials of my Department and I have had with the dairy industry, processors and farming organisations, the views of the farming organisations diverge on the need for additional milk quota.  Unfortunately, demand for daily products in Europe has decreased, which has resulted in lower prices for farmers.  That has arisen due to increased exports from the US and New Zealand.  Another ingredient in the decreasing prices has been currency fluctuations.  I believe, and we have argued strongly with the Commission, that Ireland has the capacity to use additional milk quota.  The processors and the dairy industry, apart from the dairy farmers, are&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>What about getting a floor price rather than more quotas?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister might answer that with the next supplementary question.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>On the modulation issue, I am reassured to a certain extent by the Minister&rsquo;s statement on the move from pillar one to pillar two.  Is there a political appetite in the Council of Ministers for the rate of change from pillar 1 to pillar 2 as envisaged by the Commission proposal?  My second question is on climate change proposals.  There is a view <Col N="605"/>that the basis of measurement of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture is predicated on a faulty methodology.  Will the Minister examine that methodology and request an independent, scientific analysis of it?  It will have far-reaching effects on Irish agriculture and that is the reason for my question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>On Deputy Creed&rsquo;s earlier point on the market mechanism measures, the Commission has strongly pushed for their removal.  We have argued trenchantly that the aids to private storage and intervention measures are absolutely essential to ensure that this mechanism will kick in should there be a surge in supply from other continents or a dramatic reduction in demand.  In our trilateral discussions we highlighted that issue, that the dairy industry needed those market mechanisms because it gives some stability to the industry in planning.  In recent times, say last year, thankfully those measures were not needed.</P>
        <P>Either Deputy Sherlock or one of his Labour Party colleagues has a question on climate change.  At a recent Council of Ministers meeting I asked that a specific item be included on climate change as it affects agriculture.  I spoke to Deputy Sherlock&rsquo;s colleague, Deputy McManus on this issue.  A significant demand is being made on agriculture.  The Department provided substantial funding through the stimulus of the FIRM fund where widespread research has been undertaken in the past few years and is undertaken.  Teagasc, with other authorities, has done extensive research in this area.  It goes into the whole area.  There has been substantial progress in recent years in reducing emissions but that may not always be given the currency it should.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>My approach in preparing the 2009 Estimates for my Department was to focus available resources on the measures that allow us to maintain and grow the productive capacity of the agri-food sector.  While difficult decisions had to be taken in light of the situation of the public finances, account also had to be taken of the very high level of investment by the Government in recent years, when significant additional financial resources were committed to areas such as the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, where the rates of grant had been increased by 17%, the new suckler cow welfare scheme, the farm waste management scheme and the 8% increase in rates under the disadvantaged areas scheme, which has been paid in 2008 and was introduced in 2007.</P>
        <P>I decided to reduce expenditure on the disadvantaged areas scheme for 2009 by reducing the maximum area limit to 84 acres, 34 hectares, and by a small increase in the minimum stocking density requirement.  While overall expenditure will fall, almost 67,000 farmers will not suffer any reduction in their payments as a result of the introduction of the 34-hectare limit.  These farmers, as well as all claimants under the scheme, will continue to benefit from the substantial increase of 8% in the rate of aid introduced by the Government in 2007.  Of the 102,500 farmers who benefit under the disadvantaged areas scheme, in excess of 50,000 of these also benefit under REPS, while in excess of 47,000 also benefit under the suckler welfare scheme, which introduces a new stream of payments to farmers in 2008.  It should also be taken into account that in addition to the payments under these schemes a further &euro;920 million was paid to farmers with disadvantaged area lands under the 2007 single payment scheme.</P>
        <P>The total amount of &euro;220 million payable to farmers under the disadvantaged areas scheme is part of the overall substantial injection of funds paid to farmers situated in those areas.  The <Col N="606"/>scheme continues to be one of the best-funded disadvantaged areas schemes in the European Union.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the difficulties in the public finances and the decisions I have taken against that background, more than &euro;3.2 billion will be spent next year by my Department in support of agriculture, fisheries and food.  It is important to get through this challenging period and continue towards achieving the full potential of our most important indigenous industry as economic conditions improve.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>What 8% increase in disadvantaged area payments is the Minister talking about when all the farming bodies have been informed that the average farmer in a disadvantaged area will lose &euro;1,055?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>What I stated to the House &mdash; I may have stated it twice &mdash; is that in 2007 the rate of payment was increased by 8%, and that rate of payment was continued in 2008.  Obviously, that payment is continuing for all eligible applicants in next year&rsquo;s scheme.  That 8% increase in payment is being continued.  As the Deputy is aware, there is now a cut-off point of 34 hectares for payments, which was introduced due to budgetary constraints.  The disadvantaged and severely handicapped areas are familiar to me.  I am fully aware of the type of farming carried on there, the difficult terrain and so forth.  This was one decision I was very reluctant to take but if I did not reduce expenditure in this area, some other worthy scheme would have had to suffer.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept that, whatever way he wishes to camouflage it, he is taking an average of &euro;1,055 from the majority of farmers in my constituency, where so much of the land is heaped up in mountains and hills?

	<P>Those already in the scheme are losing in the region of &euro;1,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Nationally, over 60% of farmers are not affected by this scheme because their acreage is under the cut-off point of 34 hectares.  The reduction in the maximum area payable from 45 hectares to 35 hectares will result in the payments of 35,162 farmers being reduced, but in excess of 102,000 farmers are in receipt of disadvantaged area payments.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are 7,412 farmers in Kerry losing an average of &euro;956 under the disadvantaged area payments scheme.  How does that equate to an 8% increase?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>My understanding is that the total number of farmers in disadvantaged areas in County Kerry is 7,666, over 3,000 of whom will be affected by this particular <Col N="607"/>decision.  I can double check those figures for Deputy Sheahan, but I am confident that they are accurate.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asks if our attention has been drawn to the report by the Commission&rsquo;s Food and Veterinary Office recording ongoing failures by Brazil to meet EU standards.  I am aware of the report to which the Deputy refers.  The Commission&rsquo;s Food and Veterinary Office recently published its final report of a follow-up mission carried out between 25 February and 13 March 2008 to evaluate measures that the Brazilian authorities introduced to address serious shortcomings on cattle traceability with regard to exports to the EU.  </P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Commission proposed severe restrictions on Brazilian imports with effect from February of this year.  However, the former Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, directed Department officials attending the standing committee to vote against the Commission&rsquo;s proposal and to call for an outright ban on beef imports from Brazil.  While a complete ban was not agreed, the effect of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals was to limit exports of beef from Brazil to a relatively small number of herds.  Based on this latest report, I have arranged for my Department to write to the Commission to have this matter urgently discussed at the European Commission&rsquo;s standing committee on the food chain and animal health.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is clear that there are still issues of concern relating to Brazilian beef.  While I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply and acknowledge that beef exports from Brazil are confined to a small number of herds, the amounts within those herds would probably far outweigh the Irish national herd.  The numbers in question are still significant.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply and accept that the Department has chosen the correct course of action in the circumstances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to provide as much information as possible to Deputies and, in that context, it is interesting to note the up to date figures for EU beef imports.  Brazilian beef imports to the EU have gone down considerably and much of the imports that are now coming from that country are of cooked meat, which was not affected by the Commission&rsquo;s decision.  Last year, 5,123 tonnes of beef were imported into Ireland from Brazil, compared to 1,448 tonnes this year, which is quite a considerable drop in volume.  It is important to bear in mind that Brazil&rsquo;s misfortune is other countries&rsquo; opportunity.  New Zealand beef imports have increased from a very low base to quite a significant amount of tonnage, at <Col N="608"/>108 tonnes.  Similarly, Uruguay has also gone up from a very small base of just over 13 tonnes to 1,954 tonnes.  That is the kind of dynamic that is going on at present.  In the meantime, we obviously have an opportunity here in Ireland because of the increase in beef prices.</P>
        <P>It is important to state that an outright ban on Brazilian beef imports is by no means a foregone conclusion.  The European Commission has been assisting with advice and training of officials in the Brazilian authorities to ensure that auditing and evaluation would extend to local officials.  That is as they are required to do.  If they have a problem, they are required to indicate the nature of that problem and also what needs to be done in order for trade to resume.</P>
        <P>Brazil is marking time and getting its house in order.  In the meantime, we will have a meeting at EU level.  I hope the report will be on the agenda of the next meeting of the standing committee on the food chain and animal health but I am not sure if that is the case.</P>

The 2009 Estimates provide over &euro;1.8 billion for my Department, and, when combined with EU funding of &euro;1.4 billion, total expenditure in 2009 by my Department will amount to over &euro;3.2 billion.</P>
        <P>While difficult decisions had to be taken in light of the situation with the public finances, account also had to be taken of the very high level of investment by the Government in recent years when significant additional financial resources were committed to areas such as the rural environment scheme, where the rates of grant had been increased by 17%, the new suckler cow welfare scheme, the farm waste management scheme and, indeed, the 8% increase in rates under the disadvantaged areas scheme itself, introduced in 2007.</P>

While overall expenditure will fall, almost 67,000 farmers will not suffer any reduction in their payments as a result of the introduc<Col N="609"/>tion of the 34-hectare limit.  Furthermore, these farmers, as well as all claimants under the scheme, will continue to benefit from the substantial increase of 8% in the rate of aid introduced by the Government in 2007.  In addition, of the 102,500 farmers who benefit under the disadvantaged areas scheme, in excess of 50,000 of these also benefit under REPS, while in excess of 47,000 also benefit under the suckler welfare scheme, which introduced a new stream of payments to farmers in 2008.  It should also be taken into account that, in addition to the payments under these schemes, a further &euro;920 million was paid to farmers with disadvantaged area lands under the 2007 single payment scheme.</P>
        <P>The total amount payable of &euro;220 million to farmers under the disadvantaged areas scheme is part of the overall substantial injection of funds paid to farmers situated in the areas and the scheme continues to be one of the best well funded disadvantaged areas schemes in the European Union.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the difficulties in the public finances and the decisions I have taken against that background, the position is that in excess of &euro;3.2 billion will be spent next year by my Department in support of agriculture, fisheries and food.  It is important to get through this challenging period and continue towards achieving the full potential of our most important indigenous industry when the economy begins to grow again.</P>

	<P>I will take the answer as read but I wish to state that money is being taken out of farmers&rsquo; real income here.  Some of the measures that have been implemented in this budget, including this one, will bring about a further demise in agricultural productivity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>As I outlined in previous responses, this particular payment is one of a number that are made by the Department.  Some agricultural programmes are funded by the Exchequer, while others are funded by the European Union.  In 2009, some &euro;44 million will be provided for the suckler cow welfare scheme, &euro;220 million for the disadvantaged areas scheme, &euro;355 million for the rural environment protection scheme and &euro;1.3 billion in respect of the single payment scheme.  They are all very substantial payments.  There is also a substantial programme of investment in on-farm facilities.  In the partnership programme agreed in 2006, agreement was reached that funding of approximately &euro;350 million would be provided in respect of on-farm investment schemes for the duration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Sherlock queried, understandably, the level of financial commitment to the agricultural industry.  All of those schemes are important.  This year alone &euro;377 million was devoted to the farm waste management scheme.  These are all important measures for farmers.  We cannot ignore the substantial funding both from the Exchequer and from the European Union this year, which will continue next year.  These are all important schemes.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Previously I remarked on budgetary U-turns and said we should treat this budget as a work-in-progress.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, has exempted minimum wage recipi<Col N="610"/>ents from the 1% levy.  Since the Minister has the Teagasc farm income survey at his fingertips, will he consider exempting anyone in receipt of farm assist, which is top-up payments from the Department of Social and Family Affairs or the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs?  Will the Minister, Deputy Smith, consider exempting any farmer in receipt of farm assist from the reduction in disadvantaged area payments?  The Minister can talk about increases, but remember that behind all these figures are farm families subsisting on annual incomes of less than &euro;20,000.  These payments make up a substantial part of that income.  Even those on such minimum wages say they are prepared to shoulder their fair share of the burden.  However, this is not a 1% levy on farm incomes, it is a significant proportion of their income.  There are farmers throughout the country losing between &euro;5,000 and &euro;6,000.  Those in disadvantaged areas are set to lose on average &euro;1,000.  Will the Minister exempt those in receipt of farm assist for a start?</P>

The issues of taxation and the 1% levy will be finalised in the Finance Bill 2008.  I have already conveyed to the Minister for Finance the issues raised by the farm organisations.  I have also discussed with the Minister for Finance measures which could be considered in the Finance Bill 2008 that may affect new and young entrants to agriculture.</P>

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I am grateful to the House for facilitating early discussion of the Bill.  I approached the Opposition parties about this matter in the afternoon.  While it was not my intention to bring <Col N="612"/>the legislation to the House in such a speedy fashion, given the circumstances with which we may be confronted it is essential we proceed with it as a precautionary measure.</P>
        <P>A person in a private psychiatric hospital in Ireland, who has been a patient in that hospital since the summer of 2007 and who is involuntarily detained, sought a judicial review of her detention in June 2008.  The case was heard before the courts in October.  I was informed today that a decision will be made by the judge in the case at 12.30 p.m. tomorrow.  While the case seemed to involve particular circumstances relating only to that patient, it transpired during the hearing in October that there may be wider implications for up to 209 or 210 patients who are involuntarily detained in both public and private psychiatric hospitals in the country.  If the case of the Mental Health Commission is lost tomorrow on a technical issue, with which I will deal presently, there could be implications for all of those involuntarily detained.  If any of these people in the coming days were to use <i>habeas corpus</i> and discharge themselves, there could be serious implications for that patient&rsquo;s health.</P>
        <P>Involuntary detention is a sad but necessary part of mental health services and a decision to detain involuntarily a patient is not easily taken.  Under the Mental Health Act 2001 a patient must first be referred by his or her general practitioner.  A psychiatrist must then admit that person to an institution.  An independent psychiatrist appointed by the Mental Health Commission and a tribunal consisting of a consultant psychiatrist, a lawyer and a lay person must review the decision to involuntarily detain that person within a 21 day period.</P>
        <P>The issue which arose in this case concerns the form that the Mental Health Commission used under the Mental Health Act 2001.  The Act refers to a prescribed form which is the responsibility of the Mental Health Commission.  The view has been advanced in this case that because the form has three boxes with reference to not exceeding three months, not exceeding six months and not exceeding 12 months, it does not give sufficient discretion to the consultant psychiatrist.  There is no question of psychiatrists acting inappropriately from a clinical perspective or not acting in good faith.  However, the procedure seems to involve these forms.  It has been advanced in this case that these forms are invalid.  If that is found to be the case tomorrow, it puts at risk the 209 patients involuntarily detained.  This is a situation we cannot support.  People are only involuntarily detained because they are a danger to themselves, possibly a danger to others, or because detention is vital for appropriate medication to be administered.  Of the 3,000 psychiatric patients in the country, less than 10% are patients that are involuntarily detained.</P>
        <P>We had the option not to bring this Bill before the House until next week and to await the decision of the court tomorrow.  However, if even one patient&rsquo;s care was put at risk, then it is not option that we should pursue.  On balance, we have decided to bring the Bill forward today.  There was also an option to discharge all of these patients if the case was lost and to readmit them.  The trauma that would cause for the individual patients and their families would be completely unwarranted, aside from the administrative difficulties that would arise.  On the advice of the Attorney General on 24 October, all of these patients&rsquo; renewal admittances have been reviewed.  In 99% of cases, the period of detention has been upheld.</P>
        <P>The Bill does two things.  It states that notwithstanding any errors there might be in the form filling, these detentions are not invalid.  They may be invalid for other reasons, but they are not invalid by virtue of the renewal forms that are used by the consultant psychiatrists.  Second, within five working days of the enactment of the Bill, new renewal orders will have to be made in respect of all these patients.</P>
        <P>Issues arise as to the retrospective nature of the Bill.  It does not affect the patient who has initiated the proceedings, nor any other patient that may have initiated proceedings, although <Col N="613"/>we do not believe there is any such patient who has done so.  The legislation could not affect their particular circumstances.  The State has previously brought in legislation in advance of court decisions as a precautionary measure.  I understand that one such case was related to EU directives, while another was related to the asylum process.  Other legislation with a retrospective nature dealt with the failures in the appointment of a trial judge and the decisions made by that judge were retrospectively made legal.</P>
        <P>The Bill is short lived.  It only applies to these particular patients and they will all have to go before a new tribunal established by the Mental Health Commission in the 26 days following the enactment of the Bill.  There are five days to make the renewal order and 21 days to go through the procedures under the Mental Health Act 2001.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that the Opposition parties have had very little time to consider the Bill, which was approved by the Government at around 2 p.m. today.  The Attorney General took advice from his own office and from independent counsel, and he has been working on this Bill as a precautionary measure over the past few days.  It was his advice that all of these cases should be clinically reviewed to make sure that nobody is being detained for a longer period than is absolutely necessary.  It is a very serious decision to remove the liberty of any citizen, and therefore it must be done in accordance with the law.</P>
        <P>The judgment call that had to be made today was whether we should await the determination of the court tomorrow and act then, or sometime next week.  There is a risk to 209 very sick, vulnerable patients that have been clinically examined and found to be in need of involuntary detention, and we felt that it was a risk not worth taking.  I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to responding to the issues raised by the Opposition parties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to raise some concerns about the Bill.  The first concern is the fact that is has been rushed.  It is only 40 minutes since I received this detailed Bill, containing five pages and eight sections.  For a non-legal person who needs a full examination of the detail of the Bill, that is of great concern to me.  Rushed legislation is often bad legislation.  The reserved judgment was on 16 October, yet it is the day before the decision of the court that the Minister has decided that the Bill is necessary and must be rushed through the D&aacute;il.  She could have brought it before the House at any stage since 16 October and allowed us time to examine fully the contents and their implications, rather than take the approach she is taking today.  Can the Minister explain why she has delayed since the reserve judgment?  As I have been unable to research this, I have had to take much of what the Minister says on trust.  I am concerned about that, because it is our duty to probe the legislation, but I accept the difficulties that she is facing at the moment.</P>
        <P>This was an administrative cock-up that should not have happened.  Serious questions need to be answered when very vulnerable patients have been put in a situation where they are now being addressed by a Bill in the D&aacute;il.  There are legal implications about their safety and their continued treatment in the foreseeable future.  We are concerned about the patients and their safety if they are discharged into the community, because we know that 80% of those who die by suicide are suffering from psychiatric illness.  Not all patients who are involuntarily detained are suicidal; in fact it is only a minority of them.  However, we must worry about the safety of any that might be discharged.  Due to the serious conditions from which these patients suffer, there is probably a higher level of suicide among them than within normal psychiatric patients.</P>
        <P>We are also concerned about the small number that might be a danger to other people if they were discharged.  This is a small number and we do not want to send out the message that we are concerned about 209 people being  a danger to the public.  This is not so.  It is a very small minority of those patients who may be a danger to other people.  We must protect those other people, but we must not stigmatise all 209 patients with the idea that they represent a <Col N="614"/>danger to everybody.  From the 2001 Act, we know that those patients who are detained involuntarily are admitted because it is in the best interests of the patient that this happens.  It is in their long-term well being and chances of recovery that the clinicians decide that these patients should be involuntarily detained.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have some concerns about the constitutionality of the Bill.  If the High Court finds tomorrow that the basis of the woman&rsquo;s detention is unlawful due to an error in the procedures for renewing her detention, how will the enactment of this legislation make her detention lawful until the procedural error is fixed?  Article 40 of the Constitution provides a mechanism whereby the legality of a detention can be challenged.  It is one of the most important rights in our legal and political system, or in the legal system of any democracy.  The State does not have the power to unlawfully detain its citizens.  The 1982 case of the State (Aherne) <i>v </i>Cotter demonstrates the importance of this right.  In his judgment, Mr. Justice Walsh stated that the application to challenge the legality of the deprivation of someone&rsquo;s personal liberty is enshrined as a constitutional right in respect of which the whole procedure is set out in the Constitution.</P>
    
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The judgment tomorrow may find a flaw in the detention of the patient, which would result in the consequent setting at liberty of the patient herself.  There are 209 patients that will be affected by this ruling.  If the judge finds for the applicant in the case and the Oireachtas passes this legislation this evening, are we still going to see a rush of applications down to the High Court central office tomorrow afternoon to lodge Article 40 proceedings against the State for their continuing unlawful detention?  Is the Minister sure it is within the competence of the Oireachtas to enact legislation to continue the unlawful detention of any person?  Is she sure that legislation would rightfully enjoy the presumption of constitutionality?  Will the Minister set our minds at rest that she is sure that it is within the competence of the Oireachtas to enact legislation to make lawful retrospectively the otherwise unlawful detention of a patient or any other person?</P>
        <P>We have seen examples of rushed legislation in this area before, most recently with the Government&rsquo;s response to the C case, which still raises concerns.  I ask the Minister to convince the Opposition that there is no constitutional difficulty arising from this case and that we will not have a situation over the weekend whereby this legislation, that we are rushing through the House, will be found to be unconstitutional.  I hope the Minister understands my concerns about this.</P>
        <P>In general, the Mental Health Act has worked well in its first year of operation, with 25% fewer involuntary admissions.  We must welcome that.  It is a serious decision of the Mental Health Commission and its servants to withdraw somebody&rsquo;s freedom of movement.  We understand why it has to be done and we also know there are concerns about the 2001 Act.  We have repeatedly asked when the necessary amendments to that legislation will be made.  What has happened today may be a prompt for the Minister to inform us when she plans to introduce the necessary amendments to the 2001 Act.  Hopefully, it will be in the very near future.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to note the some 11% of detentions were revoked by the mental health tribunal.  In the time remaining, I ask the Minister for information from the HSE concerning proposed cuts in psychiatric services.  I appreciate, however, that the Minister may not be able to provide that information this evening.  The mental health alliance says the cuts amount to &euro;70 million, but I cannot see where that will come from.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Fine Gael, the Labour Party has serious concerns about this legislation.  We appreciate the fact that it is urgently required, as the Minister has assured us and therefore we will not stop it from proceeding through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We do so with reluctance, however.  As the Minister has acknowledged, we have had very little time in which to obtain any legal advice on the legislation.  We were only told about it at lunchtime today and were briefed this afternoon at 2.30 p.m.  We are now seeking to respond to it as comprehensively as we can.  In addition, we are doing our duty as legislators to protect the public interest and, particularly, to protect vulnerable people.  Clearly those concerned in this matter are vulnerable; they are detained against their will in psychiatric institutions and there is a duty to ensure that they are protected in whatever way possible.  It is therefore in that spirit that we raise issues concerning the legislation, although we do not seek to obstruct it.  We have serious concerns nonetheless.</P>
        <P>At our briefing with the Minister, I specifically asked her about the constitutionality of the legislation and whether she had been assured that it complied with the Constitution.  She assured me that she had obtained the advice of the Attorney General and that further legal advice had been obtained from another source.  Obviously, we must take the Minister&rsquo;s word and assurances on this matter, although we did get our own legal advice, which suggested that there may well be constitutional issues concerning the legislation.  There are serious concerns in this regard.  Sections 3, 4 and 5 are all predicated on the Minister&rsquo;s conclusion that the retrospective aspect of this legislation will be constitutionally sound.  While the Bill deals primarily with the current procedure under which people are detained, the renewal of that procedure within five working days, as proposed in the Bill, will also assume that they are not invalidly detained in the first place.  The validity of this legislation is important therefore in terms of future detentions as well, at least as I understand it.  Perhaps the Minister will respond to that point.</P>
        <P>The other issue I want to raise concerns the fact that the case was considered in the High Court on 15 and 16 October and it was clearly stated that judgment was reserved.  That judgment could well have been made before now, even though it has not been.  I still do not understand why the Minister&rsquo;s Department was only made aware of this ten days ago, as the Minister told us, which is three days after the case ended.  As I understand it, following the C case, Mr. Eddie Sullivan &mdash; who also did the report today &mdash; did the report on the procedures that were to be put in place in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office when there was any case that might have constitutional implications.  Under that new consultation procedure, all legal papers in such cases were to be copied to senior civil servants in the potentially affected Departments.  In her reply, will the Minister explain why her Department was not given earlier notice of this matter?</P><Col N="616"/>
        <P>I accept what was explained to us earlier today, that the case turned out in fact to be more significant in constitutional terms than was originally expected.  Nevertheless, I would have thought that under the procedures that were put in place in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, the Department of Health and Children should have been forewarned earlier.  We should all have had more time to deal with this urgent legislation.</P>
        <P>The Attorney General was a notice party in this case, so his office should have been aware all along of the permutations that were happening in the case.  I wonder why this procedure has not been working in this particular case.</P>
        <P>The Human Rights Commission was also a notice party.  In the brief time available this afternoon, I made a telephone call to the commission, which does not appear to have been asked to give any judgment concerning this case.  I would have thought the commission should have been consulted.  Under the Human Rights Commission Act 2000, one of its functions is to keep under review the adequacy and effectiveness of law and practice in the State relating to the protection of human rights.  The people involved in this case clearly need their human rights to be protected.  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s point that she is bringing forward this legislation in order to protect them, but nevertheless there are other issues of human rights protection on which I would have thought the Human Rights Commission would have been consulted.</P>
        <P>Although the Minister did not say so in the briefing, I think she said subsequently that 99% of the cases were not altered in the clinical review.  Will she explain why the figure is 99% and not 100%?  Does that 1% refer to somebody in whose case it was in some way decided that the detention was not appropriate?  We in the Opposition all have serious concerns about being asked to deal with this legislation in such a short period of time without sufficient time to consult and without sufficient time to consider drafting amendments.  I have a draft amendment here which was considered but I will not table it because the whole Bill is predicated on the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice being correct, that this is not unconstitutional.  There is little point in putting forward an amendment that would suggest that all other parts of the Act are deemed to be effective if it is found to be unconstitutional in certain parts.  The whole Act is tied and is predicated upon it being constitutional.  I hope the Minister&rsquo;s advice is correct and that we are not doing something we should not be doing.  Normally we would put a timeframe on this kind of legislation and we would insist there would be a time beyond which this legislation would no longer be valid and would have to be reintroduced.  However, because it has its own timeframe written into it, we are not going to do this because as I understand, the timeframe is that within five working days, there will be a new order and the Bill will fall and will no longer be valid.  I ask the Minister to reassure me on that point in her reply.  Those are the main concerns.</P>
        <P>I refer to the short notice given to the House.  While the case was proceeding and while the focus of the case was turning to something which has now required this urgent legislation, why was there no procedure in place for the Attorney General&rsquo;s office to alert the Minister and her Department to the situation?</P>
        <P>I refer to a reply given by the former Taoiseach to the leader of the Labour Party, on 21 November 2007, when he stated, &ldquo;As Deputy Gilmore is aware, 19 measures were adopted from the Sullivan report to minimise the risk of a recurrence of that serious event&rdquo;.  The serious event referred to was the fact that the Attorney General&rsquo;s office was not aware of serious events taking place in a court case.  It is important we use the opportunity today to signal that while there was a great deal of publicity at the time that the Attorney General&rsquo;s office was going to reorganise itself and would alert the political system if issues of concern arose in court cases, this does not appear to have been put into effect in this case.  For that reason, the House <Col N="617"/>is in the position of rushing through legislation which I hope will be constitutional but I have no guarantee of that.  We do not have time to seek proper legal advice and therefore with reluctance the Labour Party will not oppose the legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am greatly discomfited by the proposition before the House.  This Bill comes before the D&aacute;il in what can only be described as extraordinary circumstances.  Speaking with my colleagues following the Minister&rsquo;s briefing this afternoon, I cannot recall an instance over my 11 years in this House where legislation was passed in this way in advance of a court case and in anticipation of the outcome of that case.  </P>
        <P>This Bill is clearly anticipating the outcome of a court case due in literally a matter of hours.  As always with such emergency legislation and as other speakers have stated, the Government has the advantage of the advices of the Attorney General and his legal team of experts.  On the other hand, I am neither legally trained nor do I have instant access to legal and constitutional experts but this Bill raises major questions for me.  I have to ask whether it cuts across the right of access to the courts of this and other citizens in similar circumstances to the woman in question or indeed the right of all citizens.  On the face of it, it suggests that it may very well do.  If the High Court case is won by the woman in question tomorrow, the Oireachtas will have put in place legislation to nullify the judgment of the court.  Where does this place the separation of powers between the Judiciary and the Oireachtas?  This legislation would bar the way for others taking a similar course or following on from the judgment, if it is successful, by seeking a similar outcome by way of a <i>habeas corpus</i> application.  As other colleagues have asked, what are the constitutional implications of this legislation?</P>
        <P>Referring to the principles for the protection of persons with mental illness adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 17 December 1991, which states clearly that every person with a mental illness shall have the right to exercise all civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, as recognised in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Where does all that stand if this legislation is adopted?  Most important, what are the implications of this emergency legislation for the rights of people with mental illness?  In the very limited time since the Minister&rsquo;s briefing this afternoon at 2.30 p.m. it has not been possible to get to the kernel of the matter nor has all the salient information been shared.  How has this situation arisen?  It seems extraordinary that this situation should have arisen because the forms used to address these matters do not apparently conform with the requirements under the Mental Health Act 2001.</P>
        <P>This matter was not part of the earlier briefing and I did not have prior sight of the article which other elected colleagues had at the briefing meeting.  I ask the Minister to please follow me on this.  The woman herself states that the only reason she is in the institution where she is currently detained is because the HSE is failing to provide adequate support and accommodation.  She has claimed that her doctors believe she would fare best in supported accommodation outside hospital and that she remains detained against her will in the hospital here in Dublin because there is no supported accommodation available for her.  This is a huge issue.  Obviously what we would like to see is the HSE and the Minister and her Department moving with the same alacrity as she has demonstrated in bringing forward this legislation to provide the particular care that patients such as this woman require.  We were told in the course of the briefing that the psychiatrists involved in the assessment have all confirmed that it is in the best interests of the patient concerned that she continue to be detained in the hospital named.  Is this the case &mdash; because this was not a detail shared?</P>
        <P>I would be greatly disturbed if it is the case that this woman is being detained there, not because it is where she is best kept in the view of the clinicians who have made the assessment but because the State has failed to provide the appropriate accommodation and care she <Col N="618"/>requires and that this legislation is forcing a further period of detention on this woman in what is not viewed allegedly &mdash; I ask the Minister to clarify &mdash; by those who would have the professional wherewithal to make that determination as the alternative accommodation I have described.  On a general point, this situation emphasises the need for rights-based disability and mental health legislation and for a root and branch user-led review of mental health services in this State.  I hope this experience, at the very least, would prompt all of that to happen.  I would appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s responses and hopefully the assurances that the House clearly needs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the difficulties for the Opposition because the timeframe for dealing with this legislation has been difficult for us.  I will outline the precise dates as I was inaccurate at the earlier briefing.  My Department became informed of this case on 10 October.  I was recalling from memory about ten days ago.  It was actually 10 October.</P>
        <P>The case concluded on 17 October.  Originally, when the case for judicial review was taken against the decision of the Mental Health Commission to detain involuntarily this patient, the view was taken that the circumstances were solely around this particular individual.  It was only during the hearing of the case, which ended on 17 October, that it became apparent that it had wider implications around the form-filling of the consultants of the form prescribed by the Mental Health Commission.  Initially, it was felt the circumstances of the case were particular to only one patient, but the possible wider implications &mdash; I emphasise &ldquo;possible&rdquo; because we do not know yet what the outcome of the court decision will be tomorrow &mdash; of the prescriptive nature of the form that does not allow sufficient discretion were advanced during the case.  The Attorney General has been considering this matter over the past two weeks or so.  He advised that all of these patients should be clinically reviewed.  He advised that it was important in advance of any legislation that each of these patients would be clinically reviewed to ensure that all of the involuntary detentions were valid.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan asked why was 99% held to be valid and 1% was not.  I suppose that proves that on examination a detention can at any time be revoked by the consultant psychiatrist.  Under section 28 of the Mental Health Act a consultant psychiatrist can at any stage review the detention period of his or her patient, and it is not the case that the patient is only seen every three months, six months or 12 months.  The patient engages frequently with his or her clinical team during a period of involuntary detention.</P>
        <P>Second, in answer to Deputy Neville, section 7 of the Bill makes clear that this legislation does not, and cannot, have any effect on the current case.  The current case will be determined tomorrow and this Bill, if passed into law, cannot affect that patient&rsquo;s rights.  Neither can it affect the rights of any other patient who has initiated proceedings, although we do not believe there is any such proceedings.</P>
        <P>Clearly, I would not be advancing legislation here unless the Attorney General and his office were satisfied the legislation we were advancing was constitutional.  We could not promote legislation here that was not believed to be fully constitutional.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked for previous examples of when legislation was introduced in advance of a court hearing.  I understand there was legislation in relation to the Aliens Act and to EU Directives.  If my officials have details of the precise legislation I will make that clear during Committee Stage.  However, it is not unusual that we have had legislation pass through the Oireachtas in previous circumstances in advance of a court hearing.  In fact, the Immigration Act 2004 was introduced in the interregnum between High Court and Supreme Court pro<Col N="619"/>ceedings.  That legislation was passed by the Oireachtas also to avoid considerable difficulties that could arise.  This is one such piece of legislation.</P>
        <P>The Bill is time-framed to this extent, that after five working days from its enactment, it no longer has any effect because if the court finds tomorrow that these forms are invalid, then the Mental Health Commission will have new forms, all new renewals for involuntary detention will be under the new procedures and the new forms, and clearly, all of these 209 cases will be reviewed over the next five working days and they will go through the new procedure as well.  In that sense, the legislation is time-limited.  It is not legislation that will have effect beyond these 209 cases and five working days from now.</P>
        <P>The 2001 Act is not defective.  The possible difficulty that may arise here is the nature of the form that the Mental Health Commission introduced on foot of the requirement to produce such a form.</P>
        <P>I say to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that the decision to involuntarily detain somebody is a very serious matter and nobody should be in such a situation unless it is absolutely necessary.  No matter what other extraneous circumstances may be advanced, the decision is not made lightly.  It is not made that often, relatively speaking.  It is only made after quite a number of consultant psychiatrists have reviewed the patient, and it is done in the patient&rsquo;s interests.  I see this legislation as in the patients&rsquo; interests.  The clinical view is that these patients need to be in involuntary detention and that, from a Minister&rsquo;s perspective, must come first.</P>
        <P>I am sure we will get an opportunity to go through the particular issues that arise.</P>
        <P>The Attorney General advised me this morning that the decision of the court would be tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.  He advised that there was a possibility of the case being lost on these grounds.  In that case legislation would be necessary.  We could wait until tomorrow or next Tuesday to pass the legislation, but in the intervening period any one or more of the 209 patients could go to the courts and under <i>habeas corpus</i>, be discharged, but clinically and medically that would not be in the interests of the patient.  This is very much about putting the interests of the patient first.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>While I do not want to delay, I again refer to Article 40 of the Constitution on the legality of a detention if the detention is challenged.  As I stated earlier, it is one of the most important rights in our legal and political system.  The State does not have the power to detain unlawfully its citizens.  Could the Minister address exactly how she sees the constitutionality in light of The State (Aherne) <i>v</i>. Cotter of 1982?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume dealing with unexpired renewal orders applies in the specific cases at the centre of the court case the result of which is to be announced tomorrow.  I again ask because it is important in proceeding stage by stage.  I have not opposed the <Col N="620"/>passage of Second Stage and it is not my intention to be obstructive.  However, I am anxious to know factually the situation and to know at least as much as we can ascertain from the Minister.</P>
        <P>Can she clarify for us that renewal orders have been issued?  I understand this woman has been detained since August 2007 over which period four renewal orders have been signed, which means the options clearly were not 12 month in terms of those ticked, as we were informed earlier, by the consultant psychiatrists concerned.</P>
        <P>The claim she makes is that the doctors have indicated that the best place for her clinically in their renewal orders was not in the institution where she is presently in Dublin but in supported accommodation.  I ask again about her claims, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Friday, 17 October, that the only reason she is being detained in this hospital is because the HSE is failing to provide adequate supported accommodation.  If that is the case and if there are 209 or 230 involuntary detentions in psychiatric institutions, as was confirmed earlier, how many of those should not be in the care of institutions but who are there only because the State and the HSE have jointly failed to provide the appropriate accommodation which the respective psychiatrists have confirmed as the most appropriate?  It is important the Minister would clarify the position in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to point out my concerns with regard to the constitutional aspect of this issue.  Section 3(1) states: &ldquo;An unexpired renewal order shall be deemed to be valid and always to have been valid&rdquo;.  This is of concern because it is retrospective.  Whether one can retrospectively take away a person&rsquo;s right to freedom under the Constitution is the nub of the issue and we need to hear again from the Minister in this regard.</P>
        <P>I wish to again raise an issue under this section which I raised on Second Stage.  The Human Rights Commission was a notice party and presumably was present with the Office of the Attorney General in the court, or it was entitled to be present.  Has the Minister sought in any way to get the views of the commission on the legislation, particularly this section?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to Deputy Neville, section 7(1) states: &ldquo;Nothing in this Act shall prejudice any right or entitlement of a patient under or relating to section 28 of the Act of 2001.&rdquo;  That is in regard to the effect on this particular patient and, as I said, this legislation cannot affect this patient.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in took the view that perhaps this person is only involuntarily detained because there is no alternative suitable accommodation.  The criterion under the Mental Health Act 2001 that must be met in order for a person to be involuntarily detained is so serious, because it is a very serious issue to take away a person&rsquo;s liberty and involuntarily detain them in a psychiatric institution, that one could not meet that it if one did not satisfy the very strict basis on which a decision is made if alternative accommodation was more suitable.</P>
        <P>As I said earlier, the admitting psychiatrist has to make the decision to admit.  This is reviewed within a 21-day period by an independent psychiatrist appointed by the Mental Health Commission.  Also, within that 21-day period a tribunal is held consisting of a lawyer, a layperson and a different consultant psychiatrist to review the case.  In approximately 10% of cases, the tribunal makes a decision not to involuntarily detain the person and in approximately 90% of cases it confirms the involuntary detention.</P><Col N="621"/>
        <P>Those thresholds and criteria are so serious that there is no question, in our view, that somebody could be involuntarily detained simply because there was no alternative in place.  That would be unthinkable, and to take away somebody&rsquo;s liberty on that basis would not be warranted and would not be stood over by the Mental Health Tribunal.  This is why, under the Act, the detention must be reviewed constantly for periods not exceeding three months, six months or 12 months.  It cannot be a decision that is made today and not considered again for a considerable time.</P>
        <P>The Mental Health Commission includes patient advocates in its membership.  Schizophrenia Ireland and many other patients groups are represented on the commission, not just those from the clinical psychiatric community.  We are very proud of this legislation, which is modern, progressive and in compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights.  I am advised the Human Rights Commission was not in attendance during the course of the court hearing, although it was a party to the proceedings.</P>
        <P>With regard to the renewal orders, if the case is not lost on these grounds, it may well be found tomorrow that this legislation was completely unnecessary.  However, having listened to the advice of the Attorney General, even if one person&rsquo;s health was put at risk by virtue of a decision tomorrow, not to act today was a risk we were not prepared to take in the interests of patient safety.  These are the most vulnerable patients in any health system &mdash; mentally ill people who must be detained against their will in order to have appropriate medical treatment.  Therefore, it was not worth taking the risk even if it only affected one patient.</P>
        <P>In any event, if the judgment is that the procedures were faulty, then it is better that we do this today than wait until next week.  On balance, that is the right decision.  I acknowledge the rushed circumstances in which the Opposition is agreeing to this legislation.  Perhaps tomorrow we will know whether it was necessary.  In any event, its sell-by date is effectively five working days from its enactment because all of these patients will have to have a new renewal order made in regard to their detention.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has put on record that she is satisfied that five working days is adequate to undertake the necessary examination of patients and the necessary procedure to continue legal involuntary detention in the psychiatric hospital.  Has she any comment to make on the fact that this occurred and that the procedure introduced by the Mental Health Commission was not up to the standard required?  We are now in a position where we must enact the Bill.  While it will hopefully not be necessary by tomorrow, it could well be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the period of five working days, I presume, if we are counting the clock, that we are talking in real terms about expiry by this day next week, 6 November.</P>
        <P>With regard to Deputy Neville&rsquo;s question about carrying out the further replacement renewal orders and the assessment of all of the 200-plus clients, the Minister stated that the Attorney General had pressed for a further examination of all of these patients in advance of the introduction of this legislation.  If I remember correctly what the Minister indicated earlier, the Attorney General sought this almost a fortnight ago.  How long did it take to carry out the clinical examination in regard to each of the patients concerned?  Will this be a proper reassessment of each of the patients or is it simply to go through the motions in order to meet with <Col N="622"/>the detail of the legislation now presenting and the five day requirement?  Will this be a genuine clinical re-evaluation of each of the patients concerned, albeit within a very short time following the carrying out of the Attorney General&rsquo;s request in advance of the introduction of this legislation?</P>
        <P>If this was flagged by the Attorney General a fortnight ago, it underscores the very irregular way in which we are dealing with this legislation, which was rushed here this evening.  As the Minister has already admitted, the dates of all of this go further back than she believed when she gave us a briefing at 2.30 p.m.  It is most regrettable that this had not been done in a more thought-out and programmatic way, and that we did not have better time and opportunity to inform ourselves to properly engage with the legislation now presented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It was this morning that the Attorney General advised me that emergency legislation was desirable in this particular set of circumstances.  When we became aware of this case about 10 October, we were made aware of the possibility of a decision of this kind.  The view was that in event of this happening, we would perhaps appeal the case.  A view was expressed that in this event all of these patients could be discharged and readmitted.  Various options were examined and as I stated earlier the trauma of discharge and readmission for these patients and their families was such that it was not a prospect we could have put patients through.  This was alongside the considerable administrative difficulties, particularly with regard to the approximately 16 patients in the Central Mental Hospital.</P>
        <P>The Attorney General advised a robust clinical review of all of these patients and work began on this last Friday, 24 October, and was completed yesterday.  The President will sign the Bill into law tonight or tomorrow morning and five working days from then will bring us to next Thursday or Friday.  We believe we have the clinical capacity to complete the review within this time, given that this has happened in any event during the past four or five days because Monday was not a working day as it was a bank holiday.  We believe we have the capacity to do so fairly, honestly and openly.</P>
        <P>A view was not held on 10 October, or on 17 October when the case concluded, that legislation of this type was required.  This view was only advanced in recent days.  Outside counsel was consulted and the Attorney General has given considerable consideration to this matter.  The potential of what might happen tomorrow is the reason for introducing this legislation.  It may well be that tomorrow we will find it was not necessary.  The legislation was drafted on the advice of the Attorney General this morning and considered by the Government at approximately 2 p.m.</P>

        <P>The HSE must immediately reverse a decision it has made and provide high-frequency chest compression vests to those families seeking them for their young children.  The decision by the HSE to stop funding the vests is wrong and unjust.  We should listen to carers and parents who look after their children.</P>
        <P>A constituent contacted me with regard to her two young children, one aged 2 and a half years and the other aged ten months, who suffer from cystic fibrosis and get great benefit from the vests.  My constituent advises me that the vest is a godsend and should be supported.  Daily physiotherapy sessions for this woman&rsquo;s daughters take approximately one hour using the vest.  This is in comparison to taking at least two and a half hours if she were to use conventional methods such as chest clapping.  Without the vest the physiotherapy would have to be given in sequence as only one adult is available to provide it.  With the vest, physiotherapy can be provided to both children simultaneously which results in a much shorter session.</P><Col N="624"/>
        <P>My constituent&rsquo;s children prefer this form of physiotherapy as they can continue to play, draw or watch television when the vest is being worn rather than being tugged and moved about into various positions which is particularly annoying for young children.  The vest also means fewer hospital admissions.  It has eased stress in my constituent&rsquo;s household and allowed the girls live more normal lives.  This will result in a higher life expectancy for the children.</P>
        <P>The children&rsquo;s consultant and the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland endorse the vests but they cannot help to fund them.  Two types of vest exist, one costs &euro;7,000 and the other costs &euro;12,000, exclusive of VAT.  In the United States, the vests are provided by private health insurance companies.  It is in their interests to do so because on average it saves them $20,000 per annum due to the decreased need for hospitalisation and medication.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, the life expectancy of children with cystic fibrosis is a mere 23 years, which is ten years less than the life expectancy of children born in the North.  Various reasons exist for this, but we should be a world leader in this matter.  Research in the United States shows these vests are highly effective and we should support and give hope to the adults and children affected by cystic fibrosis and their families.</P>
        <P>The Government has let down the country with regard to this matter.  Dr. Ron Pollock produced a report in 2005 and the cystic fibrosis working group has recommended a report.  However, this has not been publicly produced which is shameful.  Medical evidence may not exist that these vests help and improve the children but a case can be made for providing them to families where a number of children suffer from cystic fibrosis.  It is less stressful for the family, particularly if there are several children awaiting physiotherapy.  The Government should put its money where its mouth is in this case.  We constantly hear the Government claiming it is standing up for the vulnerable, the young and the elderly.  This is a prime opportunity for the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran, to give us the good news this evening that the HSE will make an exception for families with several children suffering from cystic fibrosis.  Otherwise, it would be cruel and callous, badly reflecting on the Government.</P>

	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</P>
        <P>The Minister has identified the need to improve services to persons with cystic fibrosis in the Estimates process over recent years.  Since 2006, additional revenue funding of &euro;6.78 million has been allocated to the Health Service Executive to develop services for patients with cystic fibrosis.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has received several requests to fund the provision of high frequency chest compression, HFCC, vests to assist in the treatment of cystic fibrosis.  A preliminary review undertaken by the Health Service Executive in early 2008 did not provide a sufficient evidence base in terms of effectiveness to recommend the use of the vest.</P>
        <P>Following on from this, a more substantive review process was conducted to enable the Health Service Executive evaluate more comprehensively the benefits, or otherwise, of HFCC vests in the treatment of cystic fibrosis.  Suitable expertise in the field of cystic fibrosis was identified and a cross-directorate group, including expertise from the Health Information and Quality Authority, was established by the Health Service Executive early this year.  The evaluation group submitted its report last month.  It found there was not sufficient evidence at this point to recommend the HFCC vest as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of cystic fibrosis.  It concluded there was no significant benefit for the vest over conventional physiotherapy.</P><Col N="625"/>
        <P>Based on the recommendations of this group, the Health Service Executive decided the HFCC vest could not be endorsed at this time for use in the treatment of cystic fibrosis.  However, the Health Service Executive is open to reviewing this evaluation should relevant evidence-based information become available.</P>

	<P>The last part of my Adjournment matter submission reads &ldquo;those who perpetrated the vandalism on the Methodist church on Jones&rsquo;s Road, Dublin 3, are prosecuted and made to restore the church to its pristine condition&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>It is unbelievable to think that in this day and age a developer could on the night 14 October use a bulldozer to begin to demolish the beautiful old Methodist church on Jones&rsquo;s Road in the heart of Dublin city.  The local authority enforcement section served an order on the developer to desist from further demolition.  Instead of desisting, he returned the following morning at 6 o&rsquo;clock and proceed to continue with the demolition.  The local residents were incensed and called the Garda.  When the Garda arrived, the driver of the bulldozer ran away and the garda&iacute; on the scene were unable to catch him.</P>
        <P>It is a case of absolute vandalism and must be treated in that fashion.  The local residents are up in arms that this happened.  They certainly want to see this matter dealt with in a comprehensive manner.  They want to ensure the church is restored to its original condition, for which there is a precedent.  They also want to ensure the local authority proceeds with a civil action in this case.  I understand the local authority will ensure the owner of the church is levied the cost of protecting and securing the building from any further attempt at demolition.</P>
        <P>A prosecution of a criminal nature should take place.  However, there is a problem in this regard.  The maximum fine that can be imposed in these cases is only &euro;1,904, a derisory fine.  It can, however, include a prison sentence.  This must be considered as well.  In 2006 a similar event occurred when the Presentation Convent on Terenure Road was demolished by a developer.  The local authority ordered that it be reinstated.  When it was not, the matter went to court and the individual in question was fined a minuscule &euro;1,000.  The developer purchased that site for &euro;15 million, so it was quite clear, it was worth his while to flout the law.  We must ensure this is not replicated in the Jones&rsquo;s Road case.  We must ensure this particular developer does not get away with the same act of vandalism and the same intent to make a killing on the property.</P>
        <P>In Dublin and other parts of the country, there are many places of worship such as synagogues and churches of various denominations, which are surplus to use for their particular congregations.  It is time to put a system in place to oblige local authorities to ensure every one of these places of worship is listed for protection.  There should also be an audit of such churches to be recorded as protected structures.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should examine establishing trusteeships with funding to maintain these surplus buildings and ensure their appropriate use in keeping with the dignity of what they once were.  This would be better than the current system where any developer can purchase the site and demolish the building, if it is not listed.</P>
        <P>I am seeking that this particular case is prosecuted to a satisfactory outcome with proper sanctions being imposed and mechanisms put in place to prevent this happening again.</P>

	<P>The role of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is to ensure the regulatory framework is robust and adequate to underpin the protection and conservation of our built heritage and to encourage best practice in this area.</P>
        <P>Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides the primary legislative framework for the care and protection of the architectural heritage.  Its main features include a clear obligation for planning authorities to create a record of protected structures and a provision for the Minister to make recommendations to a planning authority concerning the inclusion of particular structures in its record of protected structures.</P>
        <P>The architectural heritage protection guidelines, published by the Department, provide a practical guide for planning authorities who must comply with Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Chapter 5 of these guidelines contains provisions for places of public worship, including the redundancy of a building as a place of public worship.  Guidance is provided on several issues including retention of the redundant building for other uses or the loan or sale of the building to another religious denomination.  My Department also funds a number of annual grant schemes through its built heritage capital programme, including the civic structures conservation grant scheme, the significant places of public worship scheme, the local authority architectural conservation grant scheme and the Heritage Council buildings at risk scheme.  Grant assistance under the relevant scheme or schemes may be available to places of public worship and to those that are no longer in use as places of public worship.</P>
   
           <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Planning and Development Act 2000 imposes a number of statutory obligations on a planning authority with regard to genuine complaints regarding unauthorised development, including investigating such unauthorised developments, issuing enforcement notices and informing complainants of its decision.  The maximum fines for unauthorised development have been greatly increased under the 2000 Act.  In addition, the planning regulations were changed with effect from 2 July 2008 to amend the exemptions with regard to demolition.  The amendment identifies various categories of demolition and site clearance works that are to be exempted from the requirement to obtain planning permission, but the associated conditions and new lower thresholds for demolition afford greater protection to public buildings.  Since 2 July last, the demolition of the building referred to by the Deputy required planning permission.</P>
        <P>I understand from Dublin City Council that there was no planning permission for the demolition of this building and that the unauthorised demolition commenced on 14 October.  Dublin City Council received a complaint on 15 October, visited the site immediately and directed the contractor carrying out the demolition to cease.  The contractor complied with that direction.  That evening the council served a formal enforcement notice prohibiting further demolition on the occupier and a person they believed to be one of the owners.  The following morning a vehicle entered the site and struck the front gable of the building, causing a further collapse.  The Garda was informed and its investigation is ongoing.  The council is also investigating the matter with a view to determining who was responsible for this unauthorised demolition and initiating legal proceedings.  I understand the council has acted in a timely manner in this case and is taking appropriate enforcement action under the relevant legislation.</P>
        <P>I note with interest the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion for an audit of buildings and their uses and I will convey this to the Department.</P>

      <sTitle>Financial Institutions Support Scheme.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is now some weeks since the enactment of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Bill 2008, which was introduced to rescue the banks, and it has been some days since the publication of the guarantee scheme.  This Act has given extraordinary unilateral <Col N="627"/>powers to the Minister for Finance, basically to do what he likes.  Although he set out certain conditions which were to apply to banks joining the scheme, it would appear from notices on his own Department&rsquo;s website that those conditions have changed.  He told us in the House that in the event of a bank going under, the first recourse would be to the bank itself, followed by the other banks in the scheme, and that there would be no recourse to the taxpayer.  He repeatedly told us the scheme would be cost free as far as the Irish taxpayer was concerned.  However, a notice on the Department&rsquo;s website indicates that apparently, arising from understandable objections by some of the bigger banks in the scheme, the banks entering the scheme were advised they would not have to unilaterally guarantee defaults by other banks in the scheme.  Other Members of the House have mentioned a report to that effect in the <i>Financial Times</i>.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s depiction of the scheme was that it was cost free.  The market take on the scheme can be seen from the fact that Irish bank shares are still tanking and have lost tremendous value.  We should remember these institutions are the lifeblood of most businesses and, indeed, most house purchasers in this country.  I draw to the Minister&rsquo;s attention the fact that NIB, which is a Danske Bank subsidiary, has written off a significant amount of bad debt.  NIB added &euro;69 million to its impairment charge in its third quarter accounts following a review by Danske Bank.  While NIB holds 4% of the total amount of Danske Bank group loans, it represents 30% of its impaired loans.  This raises major concerns about banks in the scheme which have more aggressive lending practices and risk having more toxic debts, particularly with regard to the construction sector.</P>
        <P>What is the situation now?  Is there a recourse to the Irish taxpayer, or are all the banks in the scheme essentially guaranteeing that any bank in the scheme will have second recourse to the other banks in the scheme?  Is the Irish taxpayer now carrying the can, as stated in the note on the Department&rsquo;s website, for the financial markets?  Will the Minister publish the terms of reference of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers and the review it is conducting for IFSRA?  I repeat the question I asked previously &mdash; what is the review considering?  Is it examining the issue of the accounting treatment of possibly impaired bank loans given for construction purposes, in which the interest has been rolled up or expressed in shares in the company?</P>
        <P>My next question is about the disclosure at the weekend of possible directors&rsquo; loans of &euro;288 million given by Quinn Insurance to a related company within the group which, in turn, may have been used either by individuals or by related companies to purchase or pay for shares in Anglo Irish Bank which were being acquired through contracts for difference.  Anglo Irish Bank is one of the companies included in the credit institutions scheme.  I called publicly for the Minister to make a statement on this at the weekend.  When did he know about this?  It appears the regulator has known about it for months as a consequence of the work of the auditors.  Is the regulator only now requiring monthly financial stability reports from insurance companies?  Insurance companies are similar to banks and need to carry very large reserves of cash in order to pay claims.</P>
        <P>I remember the Minister telling me when he was appointed Minister for Finance that he had a qualification in company and commercial law as part of his barrister&rsquo;s training.  He told me he was quite expert in commercial law.  Irish company law frowns heavily on the device of directors&rsquo; loans.  They are subject to special disclosure requirements and may also give rise to benefit-in-kind issues from a tax point of view.  The Minister needs to make the position clear in the House because ultimately it is the Irish taxpayer who is underwriting all of this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Burton has raised the issue of the serious financial consequences to the State arising from the guarantee scheme to banks and <Col N="628"/>credit institutions.  In the course of her contribution she raised a number of issues which do not arise within the terms of the Adjournment matter.  However, I will be pleased to deal with these by way of a reply to a parliamentary question.</P>
        <P>There can be no doubt as to the extent and depth of upheavals in international financial markets.  The objective of the credit institutions guarantee scheme is to reinforce the strength of the Irish economy and the financial sector and, in particular, to protect the long-term interests of the taxpayer.  Maintaining a stable banking system is at the heart of the functioning of our economy and the daily lives of everyone living in our country.  The scheme is not about protecting the interests of the banks; it is about safeguarding of the economy and everyone who lives and works in this country.  This support is being provided in the public interest to maintain the stability of our financial system and hence to protect the real economy from the consequences of the severe financial disruption that would otherwise arise.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the principles of the legislation, the scheme is designed to safeguard the interest of taxpayers.  The guarantee to covered institutions is being made available at a significant charge to the institutions that avail of it.  The terms of the scheme will also allow the State to reclaim from a covered institution any payments under a covered institution&rsquo;s guarantee.</P>
        <P>It is currently estimated that the State will be remunerated by the covered institutions for the guarantee by an amount of at least &euro;500 million per year for each of the two years of the guarantee.  The charge is risk-adjusted and is set at a level that is based on the long-term cost to the Exchequer of providing the guarantee.  Moreover, the scheme is designed to be self-financing and any financial support under the relevant legislation is intended to be recouped from the institution concerned.</P>
        <P>The charge has taken account of Government funding costs.  The giving of the guarantee is assumed to increase the cost of borrowing by the State by between 15 and 30 basis points.  This is estimated to amount to approximately &euro;1 billion on the cost of ten year funding.  If the cost to the Exchequer were to exceed &euro;1 billion, the charge to the covered institutions will be adjusted accordingly.</P>
        <P>It is clear, therefore, that the Government scheme is structured to cover taxpayer costs.  This is not a free lunch for the banks.  However, it is in no one&rsquo;s interest to impose a charge at a prohibitive level that undermines the long-term sustainability and commercial viability of our financial institutions.  A balance must be struck between ensuring that the Exchequer is reimbursed for the cost of the scheme and the financial sector is safeguarded at a time of extraordinary financial upheaval.  The scheme strikes the necessary balance.</P>
        <P>The charge on covered institutions will be substantial but not prohibitive, and will be differentiated to reflect the realistic level of risk in different covered institutions.  The covered institutions also indemnify the Minister for Finance in respect of any payments made as a result of claims made under the guarantee and in respect of any costs, claims, losses or liabilities incurred by the Minister for Finance as a result of providing the guarantee.  The principle as stated in the scheme is that any costs would be recouped from the sector by the State over time in a manner consistent with its long-term viability and sustainability.</P>
        <P>I note that there has been some inaccurate comment in regard to the scheme in recent days.  The scheme agreed by the Oireachtas has not been changed.  The market notice published by my Department stated that no legal guarantee was required under the scheme from one covered institution in respect of any other outside its group.</P>

	<P>As the Taoiseach and I have made clear on a number of occasions, if it was the case that a call was made under the guarantee for an institution and not recouped from that institution, the Government would ensure that any loss experienced by the taxpayer was recouped in a manner consistent with the covered institutions&rsquo; long-term viability and sustainability.  That general principle is reflected in the scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>A big change.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  That general principle is reflected in the scheme, and if Deputy Burton examines the scheme with care she will see that the general principle as stated, that in regard to the specific indemnification it is restricted to the particular institution, holds.  That is the provision of the scheme.  That was always the provision of the scheme and the market notice does not change that in any way.</P>
        <P>The covered institutions have provided an indemnity to the Minister in connection with any payments made under the guarantee given in respect of the particular covered institution&rsquo;s liabilities.  The indemnity does not extend to amounts owing by other covered institutions to the Minister in circumstances where the Minister is required to make a payment on a guarantee given in respect of that other covered institution&rsquo;s liabilities.  There is no cross-indemnity.  It is up to the Minister to decide how best to achieve all of the objectives of the scheme in light of the relevant factors over time.</P>
        <P>As I have emphasised on several occasions, the over-arching objective of the scheme is to remedy the serious disturbance that might have otherwise unfolded for the economy.  It is about taking whatever steps are necessary to ensure that we have a banking system that as a whole works effectively, efficiently and competitively in facilitating all the day to day ordinary economic transactions of commercial, business, family and social life.  The Financial Regulator has extensive regulatory powers to supervise the conduct of credit institutions&rsquo; affairs.  Our company law provides a strict legal framework governing the performance of the fiduciary responsibilities of boards and executives.  The Government is satisfied that alongside the powers provided directly under the scheme the relevant public bodies, and in particular the Financial Regulator, have the authority and legal power to take whatever steps are necessary to continue to look after the interests of all depositors and customers, as well as that of the State and the taxpayer, which now arises on account of the guarantee.</P>
        <P>Deputies will be aware that in order to promote the public interest covered institutions will be required under the scheme to appoint non-executive directors from a panel approved by me.  I will shortly announce the membership of this panel.  Deputies will also be aware that the scheme provides protection against excessive remuneration of directors and senior executives.  I will be moving shortly to appoint the members of the independent covered institution remuneration oversight committee which will oversee remuneration plans in accordance with the scheme.</P>

      <sTitle>Urban Development Project.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The news last week that the developers Stanley Holdings are not proceeding with the proposed new town square at Belmayne-Clare Hall is a devastating blow to the constituents I represent in the north fringe region of Dublin North-East.  The proposed location of this new town square linking with the long boulevard stretching eastwards to Clongriffin town centre was to be a centrepiece of the whole north fringe new urban project.  The extraordinary collapse of the deal for the 9.3 hectare site for the proposed town square is typical of the poor planning and management of the new north fringe and the continuing <Col N="630"/>serious deficit in social, economic, public transport, security and other essential infrastructure of this development.</P>
        <P>Although the huge north fringe new urban quarter stretching from Clonshaugh through Belcamp, Belmayne, Clongriffin, Donaghmede, Baldoyle and Portmarnock to the sea was to encompass 25,000 or more housing units and massive ancillary commercial development, the district is not a statutory strategic development zone, unlike Adamstown, Hansfield, Balgaddy and other much smaller new towns.</P>
        <P>A core problem of this vast project is that it is developer-led with the two local authorities concerned, Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council, and all other agencies scrambling to keep up and insisting on the delivery of very belated public services.  The area is split geographically between the administrative districts of Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council and, regrettably, there has been generally poor and only belated co-operation between the two local authorities in ensuring the delivery of key social infrastructure for this new city.</P>
        <P>On my own proposal nearly seven years ago, the informal stakeholder body called the North Fringe Forum was established and its quarterly meetings have been helpful in chasing developers and agencies to provide essential services.  Yet new residents and constituents are still waiting over five years for our new DART station at Clongriffin, our new primary health care centre, a Garda station, and a wide range of shopping, service and leisure facilities which were to be located on sites such as the new Belmayne town square.</P>
        <P>The astonishing news that Stanley Holdings, the primary developers of Belmayne, are not now proceeding with the purchase and development of the 9.3 hectare site is another disgraceful example of the absence of integrated planning in the north fringe of Dublin city.  I am informed by the Dublin City Council development manager, Mr. Declan Wallace, that the price of the site rose to &euro;60 million under an amended section 183 provision agreed by the city council with the developer in August 2006.  North central area councillors of Dublin City Council were informed in July this year that a non-refundable &euro;5 million option clause on the site was being considered by Stanley Holdings but it appears now that the company can meet neither the full price of &euro;60 million for the site nor even the possible down payment of &euro;5 million.</P>
        <P>Stanley Holdings have subsequently made an extraordinary and ludicrous proposal that they would spend &euro;2 million in drawing up plans for a possible approved planning permission should the market take an upturn.</P>
        <P>The Belmayne town square debacle is another shocking milestone in planning failures in the north fringe of Dublin city.  The credit crunch is becoming an empty excuse for many of those failures, including the derelict and partly built district at St. Samson&rsquo;s, which is just north of Belmayne.  The main victims of this appalling failure by a developer to discharge his responsibilities are our new residents and constituents in Belmayne, Clongriffin and adjoining areas, as even a cursory glance at the residents&rsquo; message board, <i>www.balgriffin.com</i>, will show.</P>
        <P>I do not have time to refer to the ongoing pyrites infill problem with which many hundreds of householders in the adjoining areas of Clongriffin and the coast are still wrestling.  The appalling situation faced by young householders with defective infill problems is one of the greatest scandals in recent Irish history.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, has refused my continuing pleas to take responsibility for and action on this issue.  That exacerbates the planning debacle which is the main subject of my contribution.  I predict that the fallout from the pyrites catastrophe, in terms of the State&rsquo;s finances, will be greater than the cost to the State of the banking disaster we discussed earlier.</P>
        <P>Even at this late stage I ask the Minister of State to ask the Minister, Deputy Gormley, to take a strong line and end the planning failures of the north fringe.  This is by far the biggest <Col N="631"/>urban development project in the history of the State.  The Acting Chairman&rsquo;s own constituency was developed in a similarly haphazard way 30 years ago and he has spent his entire career trying to remedy the deficiencies of that time.  I am in the middle of a similar debacle on the north side.  Will the Minister, even at this late stage, call in the county manager, Mr. David O&rsquo;Connor, the city manager, Mr. John Tierney, and all the relevant stakeholders and proclaim the north fringe as a strategic development zone, including, if necessary, bringing legislation before this House to take charge of the completion of the north fringe and the provision of all the key, and still missing, infrastructure?  In particular, the Minister of State must ensure that development of one of the two main town squares at Belmayne proceeds.  People should not have to look at hoardings and a derelict site and it is completely unacceptable that those who paid &euro;400,000 or &euro;500,000 for their homes are being obliged to do so.</P>

        <P>While specific responsibility for the planning and delivery of the north fringe development rests with the local authorities involved, namely, Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council, at a national policy level, the achievement of sustainable communities is a key objective for the Government.  New development must be more than just the provision of housing.  Key infrastructure such as roads, water and waste water services, together with essential social, economic and amenity infrastructure and facilities, must anticipate and not follow the delivery of new housing.</P>
        <P>The north fringe framework development plan, which was prepared by Dublin City Council in 2000, sets out the objectives for the area, the site context and the urban design framework.  The plan emphasises the need for a quality bus service and the provision of community facilities, including schools, a library, sports and community facilities and public spaces, which will serve the anticipated 30,000 or so people who will ultimately live in the area.  Planning permissions in the north fringe have been granted in line with the framework plan and, as such, it is clear that the provision of the community facilities mentioned in tandem with the housing development is seen as key in the development of the area.</P>
        <P>Latest reports from the councils indicate that approximately 2,000 units are occupied and that a further 500 will be ready for occupation by the end of the year.  The overall roll-out and timing of these private developments will be guided by the demand for housing and other market forces.</P>
        <P>In these challenging economic times, the Government is determined to identify more joined-up and cost-effective ways of ensuring that developing areas benefit from the range of physical and social infrastructures that are critical to securing sustainable communities.  Under my developing areas initiative, I am supporting work at central and local government level to ensure better co-ordination and timely delivery of key infrastructure and services, in parallel with housing, in fast growing strategic locations within the national spatial strategy, NSS, gateways and hubs.  For example, community service shared campuses where people can easily access schools, library, sports and community services, should be located at the heart of new communities.  While the public sector can deliver the joined-up thinking to make this happen, partnership with the private sector is critical in making it viable and deliverable as part of a broader roll-out of services.</P>
        <P>In conjunction with this initiative, my Department has produced a suite of planning guidance measures to promote the highest possible standards in residential development and ensure access to the requisite range of public services and facilities.  Guidance documents such as &ldquo;Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities&rdquo; and new draft planning guidelines on sus<Col N="632"/>tainable residential development in urban areas focus on the process surrounding the delivery of quality housing for sustainable communities and the promotion of better place-making through integrated planning and the delivery of quality neighbourhoods and homes.</P>
        <P>A north fringe cross-authority-agency forum has been established to monitor progress in the north fringe.  Membership of this forum includes senior officials from the two councils and representatives from local residents&rsquo; groups and from statutory bodies such as the HSE, the Department of Education and Science, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and public transport providers.  I understand Deputy Broughan is also a member of the forum.  Agreement has been reached, through the forum, on delivery of a broad range of public and community services such as the identification of sites for schools, a health centre and a Garda station.

        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</askee>
        <Quest> his views on the recent report published by the Food and Safety Authority of Ireland recommending the banning of septic tank residual sludge on grassland and untreated sludge in agriculture; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The use of septic tank residual sludge on grassland and untreated sludge in agriculture is controlled by the Waste Management (Use of Sewage Sludge in Agriculture) Regulations, 1998 to 2001. At present, residual sludge from septic tanks may be used on grassland provided that the grassland is not grazed within six months following such use. Untreated sludge may only be used in agriculture if it is previously injected or otherwise worked into land.</P>
        <P>The FSAI report recommends that the use of untreated sludge in agriculture and the application of residual sludge from septic tanks on grassland should cease. The quantities of these materials used in agriculture are small and there are strict controls in place, particularly under the 1998 Regulations. However, any revisions of the Sewage Sludge Regulations considered necessary as a result of the recommendations in the FSAI report are a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</askee>
        <Quest> the progress made within his Department in relation to the reduction of agricultural carbon emissions; if he will bring forward specific new measures on foot of the recent publication of the carbon budget; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[37518/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The agricultural sector is already contributing to the reduction of carbon emissions.  The Kyoto Protocol allowed for an increase in Ireland&rsquo;s emissions of 13% over 1990 levels by 2012. The Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s analysis of September 2008 projects that emissions from the agriculture <Col N="634"/>sector in the period up to 2012 will  fall to 18.95 million tonnes or 4.3% below 1990 levels. The EPA&rsquo;s most recent figures on actual emission levels indicate that emissions from agriculture decreased by 3.8% in 2007 on the previous year&rsquo;s figures continuing the downward trend since 1998.</P>
        <P>The continued implementation of the Nitrates Regulations is having and will continue to have an impact, as it results in better use of nutrients with consequently less nitrogen applications and therefore less nitrous oxide emissions. Measures under the Rural Environment Protection Scheme are also expected to contribute to greenhouse gas abatement. These measures encourage the use of minimum tillage, the use of clover swards and the adoption of low emission trailing shoe technology for slurry spreading. In terms of reduced fertiliser use and consequent emissions, organic farming will also have a role to play and is supported through my Department&rsquo;s Organic Farming Scheme.  The forestry sector is very important in addressing climate change, as it removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and is also a valuable source of renewable energy, thereby displacing emissions from fossil fuels. My Department continues to promote planting under the Afforestation Grant Scheme.  I believe that the contribution of forestry has to be recognised in the EU&rsquo;s Climate Change package.</P>
        <P>Energy crops can play a role in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. To encourage cultivation, my Department introduced a National Energy Crop Premium of &euro;80 per hectare in 2007 to supplement the EU Premium of &euro;45 per hectare. A new Bioenergy Scheme was also launched offering establishment grants worth &euro;1,450 per hectare to plant willow and miscanthus.  Land planted with energy crops can also benefit under the Single Payment Scheme as well as REPS and the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme.</P>
        <P>My Department continues to examine various abatement options in close liaison with Teagasc. There has been a significant commitment of &euro;15.5 million to climate change research projects since 2005 under the Research Stimulus Fund operated by my Department. This includes research into areas such as more efficient slurry application, increased use of clover, which would reduce nitrogen usage, non-inversion tillage and increasing length of grazing season.</P>
        <P>However the European Commission&rsquo;s target of a 20% reduction on 2005 levels by 2020 poses very significant difficulties for the Irish agriculture sector.  If the target were to be applied pro rata to agriculture it could not be achieved without considerable downward pressure on animal numbers, particularly in the suckler herd.  At a time when world-wide demand for beef is growing, and alternative supplies come from regions where farming practices are much less sustainable in terms of climate change emissions and the environment generally, I do not believe that such an approach would be consistent with the fundamental objectives of the global climate change strategy.  I have made my views known at a recent meeting of the EU Agriculture Council.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The seafood marketing and promotion element of Bord Iascaigh Mhara is to be merged with An Bord Bia.  The Government&rsquo;s initiative in transferring the seafood marketing and promotion functions to Bord Bia will ensure the strengthening of seafood marketing as part of a more cohesive overall food <Col N="635"/>marketing effort, while allowing BIM to focus all its energies in developing the seafood industry in line with the Cawley Strategy &mdash; Steering A New Course.   </P>
        <P>The integration of seafood marketing with the State&rsquo;s domestic and international food marketing body will deliver synergies and opportunities for seafood producers where Bord Bia can draw on its expertise in the food sector to identify key future trends and opportunities for growth while pre-empting and reacting to market, competitors and global changes.    The amalgamation of the promotion and market development functions of BIM with Bord Bia,  will enable one single agency to manage Ireland&rsquo;s food and drink marketing effort on domestic and international markets. This will facilitate a more effective and efficient marketing effort. It will include the merging of the agencies presence internationally, which overlap in the four markets where BIM currently has a presence.</P>
        <P>My ambition is that the transfer will be effective from early in 2009 subject to the appropriate legal instruments being in place.  In this regard, I am planning that the budget for seafood marketing and promotion currently within BIM&rsquo;s Estimates allocation will be transferred to An Bord Bia in respect of 2009. Bord Bia determines funding priorities and allocations within its Estimate and I am confident that the Board recognises the importance and opportunities available within the seafood sector and will provide the necessary funding in order to maximise the potential of the sector for 2009 and future years.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the recent study produced by Teagasc on the impact of World Trade Organisation negotiations on Irish agriculture and the particularly negative impact proposals would have on the beef industry and consequently agricultural income; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>FAPRI-Ireland, in association with its research partner Teagasc, launched two reports on 29 September, 2008, one of which is an analysis of the impact of a possible WTO deal, and, a second report, which provides an outlook for Irish and EU agriculture markets using 2008 as the baseline and assuming a status quo policy view over the next ten years.  FAPRI&rsquo;s report presents an analysis of the possible impact of a World Trade Organisation (WTO) deal along the lines of the proposals made last February by the Chairman of the WTO agriculture Committee and assesses the likely impact of such a deal by comparing what would happen if there was a deal with what would happen without it in the period up to 2017.</P>
        <P>They looked at two possible WTO deals &mdash; one where beef was declared a sensitive product, and therefore had a tariff cut of 23%, and another where beef suffered the full 70% tariff cut.  The key findings are that Irish farmers would have suffered an income loss of 5% (&euro;128m) per annum if beef was declared sensitive or 13% (&euro;319m) if it took the full tariff cut.  Unsurprisingly, they found that the sectors experiencing the biggest losses from the tariff reductions were beef and sheepmeat.  They estimate that beef production would be 507,000 tonnes in 2017 without a WTO deal but this would fall to 502,000 tonnes if there was a deal with sensitive product status, or 491,000 tonnes with the full tariff cut.</P>
        <P>The FAPRI reports provide very thorough, independent analysis on the impact of a WTO deal on Irish agriculture and on the outcome for agriculture in the absence of a deal. It is clear that the analysis and econometric model used has some limitations but the reports are very credible and professional pieces of work.  As the member will be aware, no WTO agreement was reached in the July Ministerial and it is a widely held view that it will be difficult to conclude a deal in 2008 or 2009. As to the current position in relation to the beef sector, while <Col N="636"/>Irish beef prices have risen considerably in 2008, due to the effective ban on Brazilian beef imports in the EU, it would appear that the absence of Brazilian beef from the EU market is set to continue into 2009, and in the short term it is expected that this will support EU and Irish cattle prices at levels close to those in 2008.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The FSAI Report concluded that the current practice of landspreading of organic agricultural materials on agricultural land for food production is beneficial and should continue, with one exception. The exception relates to the spreading of untreated organic agricultural materials on land to be used for ready-to-eat food crops.  The quantity of organic agricultural materials used in the production of ready-to-eat crops in conventional agriculture in Ireland is very small. Fertilisation of these crops is generally with chemical fertilisers. There are strict controls in place on the use of organic and chemical fertilisers in agriculture under the European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2006.</P>
        <P>The use of other materials such as treated or untreated sludge in agriculture is controlled by the Waste Management (Use of Sewage Sludge in Agriculture) Regulations, 1998 to 2001.

In relation to the Scheme of Early Retirement from Farming and the Young Farmers&rsquo; Installation Scheme, I have made provision of &euro;56.7 million to meet current commitments but this level of funding means that for the present, new applications for these schemes are suspended.  As my decision to suspend entry to the schemes was taken on the basis of the current budgetary situation, I have not taken legal advice in relation to any hypothetical case.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 43 and 79 together.</P>
        <P>The CAP Health Check dossier was presented to Ministers at the Informal May Council.  A full first round examination of the texts has now been completed by the Working Groups and most of the technical and linguistic issues have been addressed.  Tri-lateral meetings took place at the Agriculture Council on 29/30 September to identify the three main priorities for each Member State with a view to commencing debate on political issues at the Special Committee on Agriculture and at a series of high-level working groups to take place in October. Further tri-lateral meetings took place at the Agriculture Council in Luxembourg earlier this week to further refine the political issues outstanding.  The Presidency remains confident that the proposals will be adopted as a package at the November Council of Agriculture Ministers.</P>
        <P>The Health Check proposals are described as a fine-tuning of the 2003 reform of the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP); there are three areas (i) a review of the implementation of the single payment scheme (SPS), (ii) a review of market management measures including the milk quota regime and (iii) a response to the so-called new challenges of climate change, bio-energy, water management and bio-diversity.  The impact of the whole package of measures on Irish agriculture, including the financial impact, will clearly depend on what is agreed at the end of the negotiations.  My aim in the negotiations will be to achieve the best possible outcome for Ireland and for agriculture.  I have already outlined the issues of concern to Ireland to Commissioner Fischer Boel and the French Presidency, to Commission officials and to colleagues in other Member States.  I will continue to take an active role in the discussions at every <Col N="639"/>opportunity and to reiterate our priorities.  Our priorities for the health check negotiations include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Seeking sufficient milk quota increases and appropriate market management arrangements to ensure a &ldquo;soft landing&rdquo; in preparation for the expiry of quotas in 2015.</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Ensuring clear, predictable decisions are taken on milk quotas to give policy certainty to producers and to industry.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Opposing the substantial increases in compulsory modulation proposed by the Commission.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Seeking further simplification of the single payment scheme and cross compliance.</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Ensuring national discretion in the adjustment of the single payment scheme and the operation of specific supports funded from the single payment ceiling.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">A consultative process with key stakeholders was established to advise on the main issues arising in the Health Check and the output from this will feed into Ireland&rsquo;s position in the negotiations.</P>
        <P>As regards modulation in particular, as I have already indicated I am opposed to the Commission proposals.  I believe that they run counter to the legitimate expectations of Irish farmers who have accepted full decoupling just three years ago and who are still adapting to this fundamental change.  While Ireland strongly supports Pillar 2 of the CAP and has provided a high level of national funding for rural development I believe that any additional funding to address the so-called new challenges must be on a voluntary basis.</P>

        <P>Under my Department&rsquo;s capital investment scheme for the marketing and processing of agricultural products, a total of 51 eligible applications were received in respect of small slaughterhouses and low throughput meat establishments.  The applications are going through a competitive assessment and evaluation process in which the strengths of the various proposals are being assessed and ranked in line with the objectives of the Scheme together with applications in the horticulture and marts areas.  The assessment has involved, in a number of cases, seeking additional information from the applicants in terms of business plans, financial information and technical drawings.  The evaluation process is nearing completion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>My approach in preparing the 2009 Estimates for my Department was to focus available resources on the measures that allow us to maintain and grow the productive capacity of the agri-food sector.  The 2009 Estimates provide over &euro;1.8 billion for my Department, and, when combined with EU funding of &euro;1.4 billion, means that total expenditure in 2009 by my Department will amount to over &euro;3.2 billion.  While difficult decisions had to be taken in light of the situation of the public finances, account also had to be taken of the very high level of investment by the Government in recent years, when significant additional financial resources were committed to areas such as the rural environment scheme, where the rates of grant had been increased by 17 per cent, the new suckler cow welfare scheme and the farm waste management scheme and, indeed, the 8% increase in rates under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme itself, introduced in 2007.</P>
        <P>With regard to the 2009 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, I decided to reduce expenditure for 2009, by reducing the maximum area limit to 34 hectares (84 acres) and by a small increase in the minimum stocking density requirement. While overall expenditure will fall, almost 67,000 farmers will not suffer any reduction in their payments as a result of the introduction of the 34-hectare limit. Furthermore, these farmers, as well as all claimants under the Scheme, will continue to benefit from the substantial increase of 8% in the rate of aid introduced by the Government in 2007.</P>
        <P>In addition, of the 102,500 farmers who benefit under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, in excess of 50,000 of these also benefit under REPS, while in excess of 47,000 also benefit under the Suckler Welfare Scheme, which introduces a new stream of payments to farmers in 2008.  It should also be taken into account, that in addition to the payments under these Schemes a further &euro; 920 million was paid to farmers with Disadvantaged Area lands under the 2007 Single Payment Scheme.  The total amount payable of &euro;220 million to farmers under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is part of the overall substantial injection of funds paid to farmers situated in the areas and the Scheme continues to be one of the best well funded Disadvantaged Areas Schemes in the European Union.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the difficulties in the public finances and the decisions I have taken against that background, the position is that in excess of &euro;3.2 billion will be spent next year by my Department in support of agriculture, fisheries and food.  It is important to get through this challenging period and continue towards achieving the full potential of our most important indigenous industry when the economy begins to grow again.</P>

	<P>The majority of imported sheep presented for slaughter in Irish plants come from or through Northern Ireland and a small number of these would have originated in Great Britain or beyond.  All imported sheep are accompanied by veterinary certification.  While the identification and certification of imported sheep is checked at the plants prior to slaughter, records of these are not maintained at central level in the Department.  The table shows the total number of sheep imported from <Col N="641"/>and through Northern Ireland that were slaughtered in the six named factories for the period requested.  I cannot supply a breakdown for each of the named plants individually as this information is a commercial matter. </P>

	<P>EU legislation stipulates that food products of animal origin imported from an EU source must come from an approved food business establishment and be accompanied to its destination by a commercial document or a health certificate signed by an official veterinarian of the competent authority of the Member State of origin.  In the case of importation from third countries they must originate in a country approved by the EU for trade in such products, have been produced in an approved establishment, be appropriately labelled and transported and must be accompanied by a veterinary health certificate in accordance with the models laid down by Community legislation.  Checks to ensure that imported products comply with EU legislation are carried out by my Department.</P>
        <P>All consignments from third countries must first be landed at a Border Inspection Post (BIP) operated by my Department that has been approved by the Food and Veterinary Office of the EU (FVO) and there undergo documentary, identity and physical checks.  These latter are carried out at frequencies laid down in EU law. In Ireland BIPs approved for the processing of imports of animal products are located at Dublin Port and Shannon Airport.  The FVO carries out monitoring and inspection of each Member State&rsquo;s BIPs to ensure the conditions for import of animal products into Europe, provided under the harmonized legislation, are being correctly applied.</P>
        <P>Once it has been established that imported animal product has met all the required conditions it is released for free circulation within the community.  Copies of the BIP clearance document and the health certificate must accompany the consignment to its destination.  Imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination.  If non-compliance is established they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed.</P>

	<P>In the &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; Partnership Agreement, a provision was made to provide &euro;250 million in support of a suckler scheme over five years 2008-2012.  This is being honoured.  In order that the scheme is continued within the &euro;250 million funding budget, it will, on current levels of participation be necessary to reduce the rate of payment in future years.</P>
        <P>Almost 54,000 farmers have joined the scheme nationally.  The number of farmers in County Roscommon who joined the scheme is 3,187.  The number for County Leitrim is 2,127.  The payment rate for 2008 will be &euro;80 per cow and the total amount for the year will be determined by the number of eligible cows that calve in the calendar year 2008 and go on to fulfil the various measures under the scheme.  The rate of payment in the remaining years of the scheme will be determined by reference to the continuing rate of participation in the scheme. The rate applicable to 2009 will be advised to participating farmers before the end of this year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 59 together.</P>
        <P>The EU regulations governing the Single Payment Scheme provided for the setting up of a National Reserve.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case reducing each farmer&rsquo;s individual Single Payment by 1.82% created the Reserve.  The total amount of money available for distribution under the 2005 National Reserve was some &euro;22.5m.  A further &euro;6.5m was added representing the value of payment entitlements not activated (claimed) in 2005 bringing the total fund to some &euro;29m.  Over &euro;23m was allocated under the 2005 National Reserve with the balance of &euro;6m carried forward to the 2006 National Reserve.  Some &euro;4m was then added to the 2006 National Reserve (representing mainly reserve deductions applied to Dairy Premium, surplus Dairy Premium, deductions applied to the Sugar Beet and unused National Reserve entitlements in 2006) bringing the total funds available for 2006 to &euro;10m.</P>
        <P>The total cost of the 2006 National Reserve was &euro;2.6m leaving a carryover of some &euro;7.4m to the 2007 National Reserve.  This allowed my Department to introduce two new categories to the National Reserve in 2007 one of which was a significant measure that catered for the sheep-farming sector.  To date some &euro;6m has been allocated from the 2007 National Reserve leaving a balance of &euro;1.4m.  The 2007 National Reserve fund has been further replenished with the addition of &euro;4.6m from deductions applied to Sugar beet; unused National Reserve entitlements in 2007 and unused standard and setaside entitlements which were not used in the three-year period (2005, 2006, 2007).  The funds going forward for the 2008 National Reserve amounted to &euro;6m and the expected allocations in 2008 is &euro;1m.  When account is taken of entitlements <Col N="644"/>that remained unused in the three-year period 2006, 2007 and 2008 it is estimated that some &euro;7m will be available for distribution under the 2009 National Reserve.</P>
        <P>The National Reserve is therefore a scarce resource created by reducing the entitlements of existing farmers and will only be replenished by the addition of any entitlements that remain unused.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the National Reserve was to try and minimise the impact on farmers who, for a variety of reasons, found themselves disadvantaged in the transition to the new decoupled support regime as a result of changes in their businesses during or since the reference period.  Categories of farmers to be catered for under the National Reserve were set out in EU regulations and, in 2005, included those who inherited land that was leased out during the reference period (Category A) those who made investments in production capacity or purchased or leased land on a long-term basis (Category B) or who converted from dairying to a sector for which a direct payment would have been payable during the 2000-2002 reference period (Category C).  New entrants to farming after 2002 were also catered for under the National Reserve (Category D).</P>
        <P>Certain sheep farmers with commonage land and a relatively low stocking density were prevented from increasing ewe numbers during the reference period pending the publication of commonage framework plans.  A special category was created for these farmers under the 2005 National Reserve.  In addition, a category was included under the 2007 National Reserve for sheep farmers whose existing Single Payment is less than &euro;10,000 and where individual entitlements are less than the District Electoral Division (DED) average.  A separate category was also introduced under the 2007 National Reserve to cater for off-shore island farmers with low value entitlements.</P>
        <P>The tables below outline the number of farmers who have benefited under the National Reserve in 2005, 2006 and 2007.</P>

	<P>My Department has responsibility for foreshore functions under the Foreshore Acts 1933 to 2005.  When considering applications under the Foreshore Acts, including offshore energy projects, the role of my Department is to ensure the protection and sustainable development of the foreshore.</P>
        <P>A consolidation and streamlining of the Foreshore Acts has been under consideration for some time.  This is intended to provide a modern, effective and integrated legal framework for the management of the State&rsquo;s foreshore estate in the future.  Preparation of these proposals will take account, among other things, of the EU Public Participation Directive, the principles in the EU Recommendation on Integrated Coastal Zone Management, the outcome of the EU Maritime Green Paper and the EU Marine Strategy Directive.</P>
        <P>The Government decided on 2 October 2007 that responsibility for certain foreshore licensing functions under the Foreshore Act 1933 including in respect of all energy related developments would transfer to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  This requires primary legislation which is currently being prepared.  My Department is currently putting in place the necessary arrangements, including the assignment of additional staff from within its overall resources, to ensure the efficient and effective transfer of the appropriate legislation and associated functions.</P>
        <P>In the interest of efficiency and effectiveness it is considered appropriate that the review of the Foreshore Acts should await the completion of the transfer of the relevant elements of the Foreshore functions to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  This is particularly important in view of the fact that both departments will have responsibility for different aspects of Foreshore management.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the context of progressing the various elements required to develop the appropriate coastal zone legislative and management framework.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>An informal discussion to mark the start of the debate on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy was held with Fisheries Ministers on the margins of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on the 29th September 2008.  The Common Fisheries Policy was formally established in 1983, and has since then been subject to revision every ten years.  The latest Reform was agreed in 2002, and is up for review in 2012 at the latest.  Our aim is for a Common Fisheries Policy which results in a strong, sustainable and profitable seafood industry and, most importantly, which provides economic activity for our coastal communities, as set down for Ireland in the Cawley Strategy &mdash; Steering A New Course.</P><Col N="646"/>
        <P>I am concerned that there is some pressure at this early stage in the debate for a change in the policy that would promote an Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) regime at European level.  l will not support such a policy which promotes the concentration of activity and benefits in the hands of a small number of large companies.  Our aim is for a policy which maximises the development of all our coastal communities and for this reason it is vital that quotas and their management are retained under national competence and not moved to a market based mechanism.</P>
        <P>This debate on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy is at a very early stage.  The Commission will bring forward a Green Paper for discussion next year.  I will continue to work closely with the FIF (Federation of Irish Fishermen) to progress all matters of importance to the Irish fishing industry and have our national priorities taken on board as far as possible in the discussion on the Reform of the CFP following the publication of the Green Paper.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 58 together.</P>
        <P>The development of renewable energy in Ireland, including solar, thermal, wind and bioenergy are matters in the first instance for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  My Department&rsquo;s role is to support the supply side of the bioenergy market by encouraging farmers and foresters to produce biomass feedstocks.</P>
        <P>In this regard, my Department is implementing the agri-related initiatives in the National Bioenergy Action Plan to increase the share of renewable energy derived from the agriculture and forestry sectors.  A number of these measures assist farmers in growing energy crops.  For example, my Department introduced a National Energy Crop Premium worth &euro;80 per hectare to supplement the EU premium available under the EU Energy Crops Scheme.  A Bioenergy Scheme was also launched to provide establishment grants of &euro;1,450 per hectare to farmers interested in planting willow and miscanthus.  So far some 1,700 hectares have been planted under the Scheme.  Areas planted with energy crops can also qualify for the Single Payment.</P>
        <P>Aid is also provided for research projects that relate to bioenergy and energy crops through the Department&rsquo;s Research Stimulus Fund Programme.  Over the past three years, some &euro;6.4 million in research assistance has been made available for 13 projects encompassing a broad range of agri-energy topics including energy crop production.</P>
        <P>As regards on-farm projects, my Department is supporting the development of anaerobic digestion facilities by providing grant aid to farmers for pilot projects under the Scheme of Investment Aid for Demonstration On Farm Waste Processing Facilities.  In 2007, ten projects were awarded grants under the Scheme.  On the forestry side, the Wood Biomass Harvesting Scheme provides up to 40% grant aid for the purchase of specialised wood machinery.  Other <Col N="647"/>supports for forestry include 100% grants and annual premiums to encourage increased afforestation.</P>
        <P>The exploitation of bioenergy resources can provide an extra source of income for farmers and rural communities along with reduced carbon emissions and enhanced energy security.  My Department will play its role in realising the multifaceted opportunities that the sector has to offer.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</askee>
        <Quest> the progress made in relation to the awarding of aquaculture licences in the past 12 months; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[37484/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a substantial backlog in licence applications at present.  This is due in large measure to the fact that many of the existing licences were granted for a period of 10 years on foot of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997 and are therefore falling due for renewal at present. In addition, many of the outstanding aquaculture licence applications are located in Natura 2000 sites.</P>
        <P>My Department is working actively with the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the European Commission to develop a methodology acceptable to the EU Commission to enable these aquaculture licences to be renewed in compliance with the Habitats and Birds Directives.  A sum of &euro;1.4m has been set aside in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Vote for 2009, to assist environmental compliance activities in relation to aquaculture and sea fishing activities in Natura 2000 sites.</P>
        <P>Reaching early agreement with the EU Commission on how to enable licence renewals in Natura 2000 sites in compliance with the Birds and Habitats Directives will greatly assist reducing the backlog of aquaculture licence renewals.  The application process has become increasingly complex since the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997 was enacted due to increased activity and demands in the coastal zone and involves a range of intermediate measures before a recommendation and decision can be made in any one case.  I can assure the Deputy that everything possible is being done to reduce the backlog of applications while at the same time ensuring that the process is in compliance with relevant EU legislation.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Health and Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Responsibility for enforcement of labelling legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) through its service contracts with my Department, the Sea Fisheries Protection Agency, the Health Service Executive, the Local Authorities and the National Consumer Agency.</P>
        <P>General food labelling legislation, as set out in Directive 2000/13/EC on the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs does not require a declaration of origin of food.  However declaration requirements exist in legislation for some food products including beef, and some <Col N="648"/>imported poultry in specific circumstances such as when raw and imported from a non-EU country.  There is a clear requirement that consumers should not be misled by food labelling.  Manufacturers may voluntarily declare a country of origin, and consumers should not be misled by that declaration.</P>
        <P>The competent authority with responsibility for enforcement of labelling legislation in retail establishments is the Health Service Executive through its Environmental Health Officers under contract to the FSAI.  Labelling checks are also carried out by officials of my Department as part of the routine official checks in meat establishments under the Department supervision.  Checks are conducted on a random, risk based frequency and cover labelling, traceability, origin, identification of animals, and the labelling of carcases, meat, mince meat and meat products.</P>
        <P>Lamb imported from within the European Union is checked to ensure that it complies with the labelling and hygiene requirements.  Lamb imported from a third country is checked at a Border Inspection Post on its arrival into the EU to confirm that its veterinary certification is correct, that it is correctly labelled and identified and the meat is checked to ensure that it is fit for human consumption.  All lamb imported into Ireland must comply with the same labelling requirements as Irish lamb when sold in supermarkets in Ireland.  There is no legal requirement to indicate the country of origin for lamb.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>My approach in preparing the 2009 Estimates for my Department was to focus available resources on the measures that allow us to maintain and grow the productive capacity of the agri-food sector.  The 2009 Estimates provide over &euro;1.8 billion for my Department, and, when combined with EU funding of &euro;1.4 billion, means that total expenditure in 2009 by my Department will amount to over &euro;3.2 billion.</P>
        <P>While difficult decisions had to be taken in light of the situation of the public finances, account also had to be taken of the very high level of investment by the Government in recent years, when significant additional financial resources were committed to areas such as the rural environment scheme, where the rates of grant had been increased by 17 per cent, the new <Col N="649"/>suckler cow welfare scheme and the farm waste management scheme and, indeed, the 8% increase in rates under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme itself, introduced in 2007.</P>
        <P>With regard to the 2009 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, I decided to reduce expenditure for 2009, by reducing the maximum area limit to 34 hectares (84 acres) and by a small increase in the minimum stocking density requirement.  While overall expenditure will fall, almost 67,000 farmers will not suffer any reduction in their payments as a result of the introduction of the 34-hectare limit.  Furthermore, these farmers, as well as all claimants under the Scheme, will continue to benefit from the substantial increase of 8% in the rate of aid introduced by the Government in 2007.</P>
        <P>In addition, of the 102,500 farmers who benefit under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, in excess of 50,000 of these also benefit under REPS, while in excess of 47,000 also benefit under the Suckler Welfare Scheme, which introduces a new stream of payments to farmers in 2008.  It should also be taken into account, that in addition to the payments under these Schemes a further &euro;920 million was paid to farmers with Disadvantaged Area lands under the 2007 Single Payment Scheme.  Under the 2008 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, there are 3,485 farmers in County Galway who declared, and were paid, for in excess of 34 eligible hectares.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The total amount payable of &euro;220 million to farmers under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is part of the overall substantial injection of funds paid to farmers situated in the areas and the Scheme continues to be one of the best funded Disadvantaged Areas Schemes in the European Union.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the difficulties in the public finances and the decisions I have taken against that background, the position is that in excess of &euro;3.2 billion will be spent next year by my Department in support of agriculture, fisheries and food.  It is important to get through this challenging period and continue towards achieving the full potential of our most important indigenous industry when the economy begins to grow again.</P>
        <P>The Suckler Welfare Scheme has not been withdrawn. The commitment in the &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; Partnership Agreement was that &euro;250 million would be provided over five years 2008 &mdash; 2012 and this commitment is being honoured.  There are almost 54,000 farmers currently participating in the scheme and in order to remain within the &euro;250 million budget, it will be necessary to reduce the rate of payment in future years by reference to the actual level of participation.  In the case of the Young Farmers&rsquo; Installation Scheme, all fully completed applications from County Galway received by my Department up to and including 14 October 2008 will be processed and, if in order, payment will be made.</P>

	<P>My approach in preparing the 2009 Estimates for my Department was to focus available resources on the measures that allow us to maintain and grow the productive capacity of the agri-food sector.  The 2009 Estimates provide over &euro;1.8 billion for my Department, and, when combined with EU funding of &euro;1.4 billion, means that total expenditure in 2009 by my Department will amount to over &euro;3.2 billion.</P>
        <P>While difficult decisions had to be taken in light of the situation of the public finances, account also had to be taken of the very high level of investment by the Government in recent <Col N="650"/>years, when significant additional financial resources were committed to areas such as the rural environment scheme, where the rates of grant had been increased by 17 per cent, the new suckler cow welfare scheme and the farm waste management scheme and, indeed, the 8% increase in rates under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme itself, introduced in 2007.</P>
        <P>With regard to the 2009 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, I decided to reduce expenditure for 2009, by reducing the maximum area limit to 34 hectares (84 acres) and by a small increase in the minimum stocking density requirement.  While overall expenditure will fall, almost 67,000 farmers will not suffer any reduction in their payments as a result of the introduction of the 34-hectare limit.  Furthermore, these farmers, as well as all claimants under the Scheme, will continue to benefit from the substantial increase of 8% in the rate of aid introduced by the Government in 2007.</P>
        <P>In addition, of the 102,500 farmers who benefit under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, in excess of 50,000 of these also benefit under REPS, while in excess of 47,000 also benefit under the Suckler Welfare Scheme, which introduces a new stream of payments to farmers in 2008.  It should also be taken into account, that in addition to the payments under these Schemes a further &euro;920 million was paid to farmers with Disadvantaged Area lands under the 2007 Single Payment Scheme.  Under the 2008 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, there are 1,585 farmers in County Roscommon and 1,058 farmers in County Leitrim who declared, and were paid, for in excess of 34 eligible hectares.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The total amount payable of &euro;220 million to farmers under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is part of the overall substantial injection of funds paid to farmers situated in the areas and the Scheme continues to be one of the best funded Disadvantaged Areas Schemes in the European Union.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the difficulties in the public finances and the decisions I have taken against that background, the position is that in excess of &euro;3.2 billion will be spent next year by my Department in support of agriculture, fisheries and food.  It is important to get through this challenging period and continue towards achieving the full potential of our most important indigenous industry when the economy begins to grow again.</P>

	<P>Ireland has been successful in building EU and world market trade over a sustained period.  This has been supported by consistent efforts to promote and market Ireland&rsquo;s dairy produce in these markets by Irish operators.  Over 80% of Irish dairy production is exported to EU and world markets.  2007 was another successful year for the Irish Dairy Sector with exports up 13% to &euro;2.36bn.  This was achieved despite challenges brought about by reduced export refunds, subsidies and aids, increased energy costs and a weakening of the US dollar against the Euro.  The increase in dairy exports amounted to &euro;270 million, 65% of the total rise in food and drink exports, and half of this growth came from Asian Markets.</P>
        <P>Market forces have a large and increasing influence on the price paid for milk.  As a consequence of tightness of supply on EU and World Markets, prices for dairy products increased considerably in 2007 and prices reached record levels in the autumn.  Due to this market buoyancy, internal aids and export refunds in the milk sector were suspended.  Prices have fallen back from those high levels and this has been reflected in the milk price currently being paid to farmers.  My Department closely monitors developments in the dairy market on an ongoing basis.  I will continue to recommend that the Commission utilise the various support measures when market conditions warrant it.</P>

	<P>A number of measures have been put in place in Budget 2009 to encourage young farmers to both enter agriculture and to increase their investment in farming.  Most importantly, stamp duty relief for young trained farmers has been renewed in Budget 2009 for a further four years, until 31 December 2012.  This means that, in combination with Capital Acquisitions Tax (Agricultural relief) and Capital Gains Tax (Retirement Relief), the vast majority of early farm transfers are exempt from tax. </P>
        <P>In addition, there is the renewal of stamp duty relief for farm consolidation for two years from 1 July 2009 to 31 June 2011; the renewal of the young trained farmers&rsquo; rates of stock relief for a further two years; and the extension of the accelerated capital allowance for necessary farm pollution control facilities from 31 December 2008 to the 31 December 2010.  When combined these farm tax measures from Budget 2009 are estimated to be worth over &euro;65 million in a full year.  The top rate of stamp duty on agricultural land transactions is being reduced from 9% to 6% on amounts over &euro;80,000 with effect from 15 October.  This should reduce the cost of agricultural land to purchasers and encourage a higher number of transactions.  All these measures help young farmers to improve land mobility, increase the level of land swaps and achieve higher environmental standards.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The agricultural sector is already contributing to the reduction of carbon emissions.  The Kyoto Protocol allowed for an increase in Ireland&rsquo;s emissions of 13% over 1990 levels by 2012.  The Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s analysis of September 2008 projects that emissions from the agriculture sector in the period up to 2012 will fall to 18.95 million tonnes or 4.3% below 1990 levels.  The EPA&rsquo;s most recent figures on actual emission levels indicate that emissions from agriculture decreased by 3.8% in 2007 on the previous year&rsquo;s figures continuing the downward trend since 1998. </P>
        <P>The continued implementation of the Nitrates Regulations is having and will continue to have an impact, as it results in better use of nutrients with consequently less nitrogen applications and therefore less nitrous oxide emissions.  Measures under the Rural Environment Protection Scheme are also expected to contribute to greenhouse gas abatement.  These measures encourage the use of minimum tillage, the use of clover swards and the adoption of low emission trailing shoe technology for slurry spreading. In terms of reduced fertiliser use and consequent emissions, organic farming will also have a role to play and is supported through my Department&rsquo;s Organic Farming Scheme.</P>
        <P>The forestry sector is very important in addressing climate change, as it removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and is also a valuable source of renewable energy, thereby displacing emissions from fossil fuels.  My Department continues to promote planting under the Afforestation Grant Scheme.  I believe that the contribution of forestry has to be recognised in the EU&rsquo;s Climate Change package.</P>
        <P>Energy crops can play a role in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.  To encourage cultivation, my Department introduced a National Energy Crop Premium of &euro;80 per hectare in 2007 to supplement the EU Premium of &euro;45 per hectare.  A new Bioenergy Scheme was also launched offering establishment grants worth &euro;1,450 per hectare to plant willow and miscanthus.  Land planted with energy crops can also benefit under the Single Payment Scheme as well as REPS and the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme.</P>
        <P>My Department continues to examine various abatement options in close liaison with Teagasc.  There has been a significant commitment of &euro;15.5 million to climate change research projects since 2005 under the Research Stimulus Fund operated by my Department.  This includes research into areas such as more efficient slurry application, increased use of clover, which would reduce nitrogen usage, non-inversion tillage and increasing length of grazing season.</P><Col N="655"/>
        <P>However the European Commission&rsquo;s target of a 20% reduction on 2005 levels by 2020 poses very significant difficulties for the Irish agriculture sector.  If the target were to be applied pro rata to agriculture it could not be achieved without considerable downward pressure on animal numbers, particularly in the suckler herd.  At a time when world-wide demand for beef is growing, and alternative supplies come from regions where farming practices are much less sustainable in terms of climate change emissions and the environment generally, I do not believe that such an approach would be consistent with the fundamental objectives of global climate change strategy.  I have made my views known at a recent meeting of the EU Agriculture Council.</P>

	<P>The profit monitor analysis system is a service provided by Teagasc to farmers.  It enables farmers to measure the physical and financial performance of their farms, to compare it with farmers nationally and to plan for improvements to be made in specific areas in order to improve profitability.  The profit monitor results for 2007, which were launched in September 2008, show a range in profitability on suckler farms throughout the country.  A wide range in margins has been demonstrated between the top third and the bottom third in terms of overall profitability. </P>
        <P>Taking the situation net of farm support payments, the top third of suckler farmers generated a net profit with the average and bottom third of farms not generating a profit.  There are however significant levels of payments being obtained by farmers on top of any profit from their stock including the Single Farm Payment, the Rural Environment Protection Scheme, and the Disadvantaged Area Scheme.  The suckler herd is the source of much of our high-quality beef and the results highlight that there is huge scope for many suckler farms to increase profits by improving farm efficiency.  The report indicates a number of key areas where efficiency can be increased. These include:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Better grassland management</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />higher on farm stocking rate</P>

The successful eradication of this disease is due to a number of factors, not least the full cooperation of all stakeholders with the eradication regime, which included comprehensive testing and depopulation arrangements, the tightening up on illegal cattle movements, the regulation of dealers and appropriate follow up of breaches and failures to comply with animal disease and identification regulations.</P>
        <P>In addition to the obvious benefits to the farming sector, the eradication of Brucellosis brings considerable public health benefits, as the risk of a disease that was once a significant threat to the health of farmers, vets and others in agriculture has now greatly diminished.</P>
        <P>Securing officially brucellosis-free status for Ireland will enable me to reduce some of the control elements of the eradication programme over the coming years.  A gradual reduction in the level of testing will, over time, lead to lower testing costs for farmers.  However, we need to take a cautious approach with a controlled reduction in the programme over a period of years, based on risk assessment, following the achievement of disease free status for the country.  My Department has begun the process of consultation with the farm organisations and other stakeholders with a view to settling a roadmap for the gradual scaling down of the programme in the years following the attainment of the status.  I will take a definitive decision on the roadmap in light of these consultations.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the current position, it is essential that farmers continue to adopt appropriate replacement policies and effective bio-security measures.  Where farmers have to buy in replacement stock, including young female stock, they should do so only from known sources.  Some calves and young female stock can carry Brucellosis without showing any signs and without it showing up in blood tests until they calve or abort later in the herd.  Furthermore, farmers should continue to apply sensible bio-security arrangements on their premises and report any abortions to their vet or to the Department.  I must caution that any new outbreaks of the disease between now and April next could jeopardise the attainment of officially-free status.</P>

	<P>The Irish Dairy Board and the National Dairy Council are the main bodies responsible for promoting the sale of dairy products.  The Irish Dairy Board is a commercial co-operative that markets Irish Dairy products internationally and is jointly owned by the milk processors who sell their products through it.  Of course, the dairy processing firms also take a lead role in the marketing of their products on international markets.  The National Dairy Council plays a key role in supporting growth in consumption of milk and dairy products in Ireland.  Over the years it has been the main voice promoting the benefits of dairy products to Irish consumers.  Last year, dairy exports increased by 13% to &euro;2.36 billion, an increase of &euro;270 million on the previous record achieved in 2006. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Dairy farmers&rsquo; incomes are comprised of the market price paid for milk and direct income support from the EU.  Market forces have a significant and increasing influence on the price paid for milk.  World market prices determine the returns received by dairy processors and these in turn are reflected in the price paid to farmers.  In essence, farm gate prices normally reflect the returns from international markets of dairy product sales.</P>
        <P>The key challenges in the medium term will be to ensure that Irish farming and the agri-food sector is at the heart of an evolving high-value food market, which is focussed on quality and innovation.  This is at the core of Government strategy, evidenced by the National Development Plan 2007-2013, AgriVision 2015 and the Partnership Agreement Towards 2016.  A key element of this strategy was the Dairy Investment Fund launched in 2007.  My Department provided funding of &euro;114 million towards investment in dairy processing and a total of 19 capital investment projects were approved and awarded Government grant assistance under the Fund, which will generate an estimated capital spend of &euro;286 million at full production.  The purpose of the Fund is to increase the efficiency of the main dairy outputs by supporting the upgrading of plant and buildings.  This will assist operators in capturing new business in global markets and in developing new valued added products.</P>
        <P>At EU level, one of the CAP Health Check proposals is to increase milk quotas in order to provide a &lsquo;soft landing&rsquo; towards the abolition of quotas in 2015.  This will provide Irish and EU dairy farmers with a new opportunity to respond to global demand.  I have consistently pressed for increased quotas to ensure a soft landing and to allow Irish dairy farmers to avail of those opportunities to increase production and capture new market share.</P>

	<P>The final decision as to what products will be declared as sensitive in the context of a trade deal in the World Trade Organisation has not been made.  However, at this stage there is a recognition by EU Member States and other trading partners that beef and, indeed, poultry will almost certainly be declared as sensitive, with a number of other products under consideration.  The actual selection process of sensitive products at EU level will be carried out in association with Member States, following agreement within the WTO negotiation on the level and treatment of such products.  Ireland&rsquo;s position in relation to which products should be declared as sensitive has been arrived at following consultation with our stakeholders, including the producers and processors.</P>
        <P>The mechanisms and detailed rules for the treatment of sensitive products are still under discussion in the WTO negotiations.  Under the current proposals the selection of beef as a sensitive product would reduce the tariff cut by two thirds to 23%.  In compensation for this reduction, the EU would be required to establish a tariff rate quota for beef imports of the order of 290,000 tonnes at much reduced rates of duty.</P>

	<P>My approach in preparing the 2009 Estimates for my Department was to focus available resources on the measures that allow us to maintain and grow the productive capacity of the agri-food sector.  The 2009 Estimates provide over &euro;1.8 billion for my Department, and, when combined with EU funding of &euro;1.4 billion, means that total expenditure in 2009 by my Department will amount to over &euro;3.2 billion.</P>
        <P>While difficult decisions had to be taken in light of the situation of the public finances, account also had to be taken of the very high level of investment by the Government in recent years, when significant additional financial resources were committed to areas such as the rural environment scheme, where the rates of grant had been increased by 17 per cent, the new suckler cow welfare scheme and the farm waste management scheme and, indeed, the 8% increase in rates under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme itself, introduced in 2007.</P>
        <P>With regard to the 2009 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, I decided to reduce expenditure for 2009, by reducing the maximum area limit to 34 hectares (84 acres) and by a small increase in the minimum stocking density requirement.  While overall expenditure will fall, almost 67,000 farmers will not suffer any reduction in their payments as a result of the introduction of the 34-hectare limit.  Furthermore, these farmers, as well as all claimants under the Scheme, will continue to benefit from the substantial increase of 8% in the rate of aid introduced by the Government in 2007.  In addition, of the 102,500 farmers who benefit under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, in excess of 50,000 of these also benefit under REPS, while in excess of 47,000 also benefit under the Suckler Welfare Scheme, which introduces a new stream of payments to farmers in 2008.  It should also be taken into account, that in addition to the payments under these Schemes a further &euro;920 million was paid to farmers with Disadvantaged Area lands under the 2007 Single Payment Scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The total amount payable of &euro;220 million to farmers under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is part of the overall substantial injection of funds paid to farmers situated in the areas and <Col N="660"/>the Scheme continues to be one of the best funded Disadvantaged Areas Schemes in the European Union.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the difficulties in the public finances and the decisions I have taken against that background, the position is that in excess of &euro;3.2 billion will be spent next year by my Department in support of agriculture, fisheries and food.  It is important to get through this challenging period and continue towards achieving the full potential of our most important indigenous industry when the economy begins to grow again.</P>

	<P>The Sheep Strategy Implementation group recommended an agreed price reporting system for sheep to give full information to producers on prices achieved in different plants on a quality graded basis. This is however contingent on the implementation of an agreed pricing grid which is an important element in building producer confidence in the production of better quality animals. This is currently under discussion by producer and processor representatives.</P>
        <P>I would hope that a transparent grid for pricing can be agreed between the processors and suppliers in the near future. At that stage, I would consider publishing detailed price information with the agreement of producers and meat plants.

	<P>REPS is an agri-environmental measure, and for that reason payments to farmers must be costed and justified <Col N="662"/>on the basis of quantifiable environmental benefits that go beyond keeping land in good agricultural and environmental condition and observing the statutory management requirements of the Single Payment Scheme.  No element of the REPS payment can be justified on the basis of a production support, nor can a farmer be compensated for the same action twice.  REPS is not a support scheme; it is a voluntary scheme open to all farmers and payments under the scheme are not entitlements as of right.  Participants who agree to be bound by the scheme conditions qualify for payment.</P>
        <P>The maximum area of miscanthus permitted on REPS farms is 10 hectares or 25% of the REPS contract area, whichever is the greater. This area limitation is in order to maintain landscape diversity. It would not be desirable or acceptable in an agri-environmental scheme to have whole farms, or a major portion of the lands, devoted to the growing of an introduced species monoculture.  Existing levels of flora and fauna need to be sustained, and if possible improved, on all REPS farms and the large-scale growing of miscanthus is not consistent with this objective.</P>

	<P>The provision of 100% grants for the establishment costs of afforestation has been a key element of national forestry policy and is considered essential to overcome the traditional reluctance to plant and in recognition of the long-term commitment of land to forestry. However, the maximum grant aid available to applicants in Ireland for any afforestation scheme co-funded from EU and Exchequer funds under the Rural Development Regulation 1698/2005 is 80% and it was decided, therefore, not to include the forestry measures under the RDP. However the EU has no objection to Member States paying a higher rate of aid on a national basis.  In fact, the EU makes specific provision in its state aid rules for a 100% rate of aid, by countries like Ireland, where forest cover is particularly low. The possibility of Member States providing top-ups to the 80% co-funded rate, through national exchequer funding, was not allowable.</P>
        <P>The overall amount of EU support for rural development in Ireland for the period 2007 to 2013 was fixed at &euro;2.339 billion in 2006. The full amount of EU funding is already committed to various schemes in Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme. The maximum level of drawdown will be achieved as a matter of course over the period 2007 to 2013 through the roll-out of these schemes. Therefore the decision not to include the forestry programme in the Irish Rural Development Programme has no bearing on the total amount of EU support for rural development in Ireland. All available EU funds will be fully drawn down by the end of the period in 2013.</P>

	<P>There are some 52 staff in my Department engaged in administering the Early Retirement  and Young Farmers&rsquo; Installation Schemes.  My Department has reduced staff numbers by over 500 staff in the last four years and has redeployed another 500 from declining and discontinued schemes to new areas of work. Furthermore, my Department is committed to reducing overall numbers by another 250 to reach a staffing complement of 3,974 by the end of 2010.  Staffing requirements in all areas, including the Early Retirement and Young Farmers&rsquo; Installation Schemes, will continue to be actively reviewed on an ongoing basis in my Department to achieve the required reduction. The Department is satisfied it can, as in the past, achieve this target through natural wastage and by redeployment to other Government Departments.</P>

<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2005: &euro;1,193 billion;</P>

<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2007: &euro;1,240 billion.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Payments under the Single Payment Scheme are governed by a number of factors: while payment entitlements were initially calculated by reference to scheme participation of individuals during one or more of the three reference years, farmers were subsequently free to trade entitlements, some farmers obtained additional entitlements from the National Reserve, others forfeited entitlements to the National Reserve because of non-usage, while others were awarded entitlements following the incorporation of the Dairy Premium and compensation granted to sugar beet growers following the EU Reform of the Sugar Sector.</P>

	<P>The requirements in relation to BSE testing of cattle are provided for in Regulation (EC) No.999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council which lays down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The current prescribed age for testing cattle that are being slaughtered for human consumption is 30 months and I do not have the discretion to raise that age.</P><Col N="664"/>
        <P>However, the Regulation contains a provision that allows for the possibility that the Commission may provide for a higher age and I have been pressing the Commissioner to have the necessary actions taken and finalised to provide for this in our case. The Deputy will be aware that I have warmly welcomed the recent agreement of the Commissioner to a proposed increase in the minimum age for BSE testing of both animals slaughtered for human consumption as well as emergency slaughtered and fallen animals to 48 months. This decision is warranted in view of the improved BSE situation and the control measures that remain in place will deliver significant savings to farmers who currently pay for testing in the case of slaughter animals over 30 months.  This has been a particular priority of mine since my appointment and I am confident that the new testing regime will be in place from January 2009.</P>

	<P>Ireland submitted a detailed, costed set of proposals to the EU Commission on 12th September. In keeping with my previous stance on the matter, and supported by the Commission&rsquo;s policy document of 8 July, these proposals sought additional EU funding of &euro;32m to support the restructuring of the fishing fleet in line with the provisions of EU Regulation 744/2008 instituting a temporary specific action aiming to promote the restructuring of the European Community fishing fleets affected by the high fuel prices.   We are actively pursuing the case at both Council and Commission level.</P>
        <P>The Irish Plan was the  subject of a lengthy bilateral meeting at official level with the European Commission in Brussels on the 30th September. At that meeting the current situation of the Irish Fishing industry was outlined to the Commission and it was be made clear that the Plan cannot be implemented unless the Commission secures and allocates the necessary funding to Ireland.  Minister Killeen raised the matter at the September Fisheries Council and pressed for Commission proposals to enable the implementation of the plan in Ireland at an early date.   We will continue to push  Ireland&rsquo;s case over the coming period with a view to the Commission bringing forward proposals without delay.</P>

	<P>Despite the deterioration in the public finances, funding of &euro;1.8 billion gross is provided for my Department in the 2009 Budget. When combined with EU funding and co-funding of about &euro;1.4 billion next year, this represents very substantial funding for the support and development of the agri-food sector.  Nevertheless, difficult choices had to be made in allocating the resources available to me in 2009. I made these decisions in the best interests of the sector following detailed analysis of my Department&rsquo;s programme of expenditure and careful consideration of the options available. </P>
        <P>My priority in framing the 2009 Budget for the Department was to focus available resources on protecting the most productive elements of the agriculture, food, forestry and fisheries <Col N="665"/>sectors and to ensure that they will continue to develop. I decided that the major developmental schemes which are intended to facilitate the strategic development of the sector will continue. I also provided for liabilities expected to mature for payment in 2009 under various schemes. My objective is to continue to develop the sector within the budgetary constraints to ensure that it is well positioned to achieving its full potential and to benefitting from future economic growth.  I will monitor all aspects of my Department&rsquo;s expenditure in 2009 and, in the normal course, I will review spending priorities in the context of the preparation of the 2010 Estimates.</P>

	<P>I am keenly aware of the problems being encountered by farmers as a consequence of the bad weather, particularly the harvesting of this year&rsquo;s cereal crops.  In recognition of these problems, I wrote to the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Ms Fischer Boel, seeking approval for the early payment of the 2008 Single Payment. My request was for advance payment at a rate of 50%, payable from 16 October 2007.</P>
        <P>The reason for my request was based on the very adverse weather conditions being experienced in Ireland. These weather conditions are causing significant hardship to farmers. Many arable farmers, in particular, are in danger of suffering severe losses while the conditions have also negatively impacted on beef and dairy farmers with instances of animals having to be housed.  I am pleased to say that the European Commission has responded favourably and on 24 September approved the advance payment of 50% of the Single Payment effective from 16 October. I believe that these advance payments will go some way in alleviating the difficulties faced by farmers due to the exceptional weather conditions this summer and early autumn.</P>

        <Quest> if, in view of his commitment and expressed concern for the impact of carbon emission impacts on the future of grass-based agricultural production here, he has asked the Council of Agriculture Ministers to request a report from the Commission on this issue; if he has requested a report from his Department or its agencies on this issue; and the timeframe for reports requested. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>In January 2008, the European Commission published an impact assessment of the three key policy proposals for the implementation of a new, post Kyoto, climate change and renewable energy package. The assessment considered, inter alia, the impacts of a proposal relating to the sharing of efforts to meet the Community&rsquo;s independent greenhouse gas reduction commitment, in sectors not covered by the EU emissions trading system, including the agriculture sector.  As part of the review of the EU Emissions Trading Directive, the Commission is currently conducting an analysis of sectors likely to be at significant risk of carbon leakage.</P>
        <P>At a  recent Agriculture Council the issue of climate change was included in the agenda at my request.  While I emphasised that Ireland fully supports the goals agreed at the 2007 Spring European Council for a reduction in the EU&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, I voiced my concerns about the challenge which the Commission&rsquo;s effort-sharing proposals posed for the agriculture and agri-food sectors in Ireland.  I pointed out that if the 20% target set for Ireland&rsquo;s non-trading sector were to be applied pro rata to agriculture, it could not be achieved without considerable downward pressure on animal numbers, particularly in the suckler herd.  At a time when world-wide demand for beef is growing, and alternative supplies come from regions where farming practices are much less sustainable in terms of climate change emissions and the environment generally, I do not believe that such an approach would be consistent with the fundamental objectives of global climate change strategy.</P>
        <P>I am firmly of the view that reducing Ireland&rsquo;s agricultural production in order to meet greenhouse gas targets will not reduce global emissions. Ireland&rsquo;s pasture based agricultural production systems are very efficient in terms of the ratio of greenhouse gas per unit of food <Col N="668"/>produced.  Any fall in Irish beef and dairy output will probably be replaced, on the European and global markets, by food from countries where productions systems are far less sustainable and where the carbon footprint of that food is significantly higher than food produced in Ireland.</P>
        <P>These issues have been examined extensively within my Department with the assistance of Teagasc. My officials have had direct discussions with the Commission at very senior level and I have raised the issue at meetings of the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.</P>

	<P>Almost &euro;128 million has been allocated to the forestry and bioenergy budget for 2009 which will allow for the operation of a range of forestry schemes next year.  This substantial investment in forestry reflects the recognition by the Government of the importance of the forestry sector in terms of its contribution to the economic, environmental and social fabric of this country.  The allocation demonstrates the commitment of the Government to a strong future for forestry in Ireland.  The overall forestry situation is being reviewed in the light of the allocation under the 2009 Budget to ensure that the available funds are put to best use.  The allocation of funding to specific schemes will be on a basis of strict prioritisation of programmes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The present provisions provide for the deduction of 5% modulation on all payments made under the Single Payment Scheme.  The funds raised by this measure are transferred to Pillar II of the EU Budget and used to finance Rural Development measures.  The Regulations require that Member States subsequently refund that element of modulation related to the first &euro;5,000 of each payment.  I welcome the abolition of the &euro;5,000 franchise proposed in the EU Health Check as this means that the requirement to deduct the modulation from all payments and refund it at a later stage will no longer apply.  This means that farmers no longer have to wait for the payment of the refund and the proposed change will also simplify the administration of the Single Payment Scheme.  I am opposed to the increases in the modulation deductions from 2009 proposed by the EU Commission as part of its Health Check proposals and I have made this position clear during the on-going negotiations on the proposals.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The original Government decision on the decentralisation of my Department was that 600 headquarters posts would move to Portlaoise; some 100 posts in the local offices in Cork city would move to Fermoy; and up to 100 posts in the laboratories in Cork and Limerick would move to Macroom.  Fisheries joined the Department in 2007 and the move of that function of my Department to Clonakilty is now substantially complete with 84 posts having moved there since the programme began.  The decision regarding state agencies was that Bord Bia would move to Enniscorthy and Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) would move to Clonakilty.</P>
        <P>Following the decentralisation announcement in the Budget 2009, the moves to Portlaoise and Clonakilty (including BIM) were approved by Government to proceed.  The moves to Fermoy, Macroom and Enniscorthy have been deferred pending a review in 2011.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s original Decentralisation Implementation Plan allowed for a phased move to Portlaoise and the 2005, 2006 and 2007 advance phases of decentralisation to Portlaoise were completed on schedule.  To date, the Department has met its targets as set out in its original plan and in total, since the programme was announced, there has been an increase of 297 full-time posts in Portlaoise bringing the total number there to almost 500.  The Office of Public Works (OPW) announced last December that a consortium, the Macquarie Partnership, has won the tender for the project to build the permanent offices in Portlaoise (as part of a public private partnership including offices in Mullingar and Carlow) and planning permission for the new building has now been granted.  A revision to the Department&rsquo;s Decentralisation Implementation Plan is now being considered, to reflect the changes to the timetable and the progress so far, as well as the evolving operating environment. An additional advance phase has been agreed and planning and preparations for this phase are currently underway.</P><Col N="670"/>
        <P>In total there has been an increase of 297 full-time posts in Portlaoise and 84 in Clonakilty since the programme was announced.  Of the 297 staff that transferred to Portlaoise, 128 who originally worked in my Department were relocated under the programme.  The completion of the programme depends on the availability of the permanent accommodation and we are in discussion with OPW regarding the timescale for delivery of the building.  The Government decision on my Department is that the headquarters, which is currently in Dublin, will move to Portlaoise.</P>

	<P>Against the background of the deterioration in public finances, my approach in preparing the 2009 Estimates for my Department was to focus available resources on the measures that allow us to maintain and grow the productive capacity of the agri-food sector.  Because I had chosen to protect expenditure in certain areas, expenditure in other areas had to be curtailed.  In relation to the Scheme of Early Retirement from Farming and the Young Farmers&rsquo; Installation Scheme, I have made provision of &euro;56.7 million to meet current commitments but, for the present, it has been necessary to close these Schemes to new applications.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Health and Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Under the general labelling Directive (2000/13/EC), the place of origin of the foodstuff must be given only if its absence might mislead the consumer to a material degree.  The European Commission is currently undertaking a major review of all food labelling legislation.  As part of this process, Ireland has sought mandatory origin labelling for all meats.  Prior to this overall review the Deputy will be aware of the measures taken in relation to the labelling of beef both at retail level and within the catering sector.  Ireland introduced regulations extending the origin labelling requirement for beef to the catering sector, thereby ensuring that origin labelling for beef covers all sales to consumers.</P>
        <P>Regarding the labelling of poultry meat, there are EU Regulations, which provide for the labelling of unprocessed poultry meat at retail level.  The Regulations require such poultry meat to be labelled with the information regarding class, price, condition, registered number of slaughterhouse or cutting plant and, where imported from a Third Country, an indication of country of origin.</P>
        <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, drafted regulations that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultry and sheepmeat.  This was notified to the EU Commission in December 2007 as required by legislation.  The Commission was not prepared to adopt the draft regulations in their present format on the grounds that the proposed legislation is not in compliance with EU food labelling regulations.</P><Col N="671"/>
        <P>In March, the EU Commission delivered a negative opinion on the regulations but afforded Ireland an opportunity to provide further information in support of them.  In the meantime, the Department provided additional details including the current misleading labelling practices and evidence of consumers&rsquo; desire for country of origin labelling.  The EU Commission has considered this additional information in the context of the EU Labelling Directive but considers that it does not justify the introduction of national legislation.  At the relevant standing committee meeting on food law on 13th October, the EU Commission outlined its decision not to agree to Ireland&rsquo;s proposed regulations.</P>
        <P>The EU has 36 specific marketing standards covering fresh fruit and vegetables.  Apart from quality criteria these standards also set down strict provisions regarding labelling, including country of origin.  The EU Commission is currently reforming the Common Organisation of the market for fruit and vegetables.  As part of this process a number of the existing specific standards will be replaced by a general standard which will cover a wider range of fruit and vegetables.</P>

	<P>The most recent Agriculture Council meeting took place in Luxembourg on Monday and Tuesday of this week and dealt with both agriculture and fisheries issues.  As regards fisheries, the Council reached political agreement on proposals for Council Regulations fixing fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks in the Baltic and Black Seas for 2009 and for fishing opportunities for Community fishing vessels for certain deep-sea fish stocks for 2009 and 2010.  The Council also had an exchange of views on the bilateral fisheries agreement with Norway and on preparation of the Community position for the forthcoming meeting of the International Commission for the conservation of Atlantic tuna.</P>
        <P>As to agriculture, the Commission made a first presentation of its proposals establishing obligations for traders concerning the marketing of timber and timber products.  This is part of the ongoing effort to combat illegal logging.  The Council also held a policy debate on a Commission proposal making provision for school fruit schemes on an EU-wide basis.  In this regard, Ireland&rsquo;s &ldquo;food dude&rdquo; scheme has been praised by the Commission and other Member States as an ideal template.</P>
        <P>On the Health Check of the CAP I met privately with the Commissioner and with the President of the Agriculture Council, Michel Barnier, to discuss the main Irish priorities.  It was a very productive and constructive meeting at which I made known my key concerns regarding milk quotas and additional modulation.  As regards the milk sector I stressed the need for a genuine &lsquo;soft landing&rsquo;, when milk quotas come to an end, accompanied by a predictable set of steps that would allow farmers and industry to plan for the future.  I emphasised the need for progressive quota increases and made a specific request that additional quota allocations for Ireland be front-loaded given our capacity to progressively increase production.  In this regard I asked the Commissioner to make adjustments to the butterfat calculations in order to facilitate the release of higher levels of quota in 2009.</P>
        <P>As regards the proposed increase in modulation, I outlined to the Commissioner my opposition to the substantial increase proposed.  On other priorities I sought an increase in available EU funding for special sectoral measures to assist farmers.  Many Member States, including <Col N="672"/>Ireland, cannot currently fully utilise the funding allocated for the single farm payment scheme because of the complex and restrictive rules governing the scheme.  I am therefore seeking greater national discretion in the use of these funds.  If agreed, this would effectively release these unspent funds and provide additional money for necessary measures to assist farmers.  I am confident that this dossier will be brought to a successful conclusion at next month&rsquo;s Agriculture Council.</P>
        <P>Under other business, the Commission provided information on its Green Paper on the quality of agricultural products and Slovenia informed the Council of the outcome of the 23rd conference of EU paying agencies held in Ljubljana in May of this year during the Slovenian presidency.  Hungary and Poland raised concerns about the crisis on the market for apples for processing in certain central European Member States.  Poland also presented its views on how unspent CAP funds might be used and raised issues in relation to some current difficulties on agricultural markets.  The French Presidency also asked the Commission to provide an update on the situation in relation to bluetongue.</P>

	<P>Aquaculture licensing is governed by the terms and conditions of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997 and regulations made thereunder, including, in particular, the Aquaculture (Licence Application) Regulations 1998, S.I. No. 236 of 1998.  The 1997 Act obliges the Minister to determine any application for a licence by either deciding to grant the licence or a variation of the licence, or deciding to refuse to grant the licence.  Licences may be granted for a period not exceeding 20 years.  In practice licences are generally granted for a period of 10 years.  The 1997 Act makes provision for renewal, review, revocation or amendment of licences.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Health and Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Under the general labelling Directive (2000/13/EC), the place of origin of the foodstuff must be given only if its absence might mislead the consumer to a material degree.  The European Commission is currently undertaking a major review of all food labelling legislation.  EU beef labelling legislation requiring country of origin labelling of beef has been in place since September 2000.  As this legislation did not cover beef sold by the catering trade my Department collaborated with the Department of Health and Children to have national legislation enacted to require that all beef sold or served in the retail or catering sector is now required to carry an indication of the country of origin.  This legislation is enforced by the FSAI.</P>
        <P>Regarding the labelling of poultry meat, there are EU Regulations which provide for the labelling of unprocessed poultry meat at retail level.  The Regulations require such poultry meat to be labelled with the information regarding class, price, condition, registered number of slaughterhouse or cutting plant and, where imported from a Third Country, an indication of country of origin.</P>
        <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, drafted regulations that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultry and sheepmeat.  This was notified to the EU Commission in December 2007 as required by legislation.  The Commission was not prepared to adopt the draft regulations in their present format on the grounds that the proposed legislation is not in compliance with EU food labelling regulations.  In March, the EU Commission delivered a negative opinion on the regulations but afforded Ireland an opportunity to provide further information in support of them.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, the Department provided additional details including the current misleading labelling practices and evidence of consumers&rsquo; desire for country of origin labelling.  The EU Commission has considered this additional information in the context of the EU Labelling Directive but considers that it does not justify the introduction of national legislation.  At the <Col N="674"/>relevant standing committee meeting on food law on 13th October, the EU Commission outlined its decision not to agree to Ireland&rsquo;s proposed regulations.</P>
        <P>The EU has 36 specific marketing standards covering fresh fruit and vegetables.  Apart from quality criteria these standards also set down strict provisions regarding labelling, including country of origin.  The EU Commission is currently reforming the Common Organisation of the market for fruit and vegetables.  As part of this process a number of the existing specific standards will be replaced by a general standard which will cover a wider range of fruit and vegetables.</P>

	<P>Section 4 of the Competition Act 2002 prohibits and makes void all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition in trade in any goods or services in the State or in any part of the State.  This reflects the provisions of EC Treaty Article 81 which contains a similar prohibition in relation to agreements, decisions and concerted practices which may affect trade between Member States.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In general there is nothing to prevent the State, as a purchaser of services, from consulting with representatives of professional organisations in relation to the fees for those services.  The key requirement in all cases is that the State must have the final say in setting the price it will pay for the services concerned.  Ultimately, it is a matter for the courts, both domestic and EU, to interpret legislation and to decide, on the compatibility of any particular set of circumstances with competition law.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Revenue Customs Service has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs at importation.  This Service has particular responsibility for implementing import controls at all points of entry to Ireland, including ports, airports and the land frontier with Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>In line with best practice in customs administration worldwide, Revenue regards the development of information and intelligence as critical to the detection of drug smuggling.  This is very important in the case of Ireland and other EU Member States where the operating environment for Customs has been shaped to a significant degree by the introduction of the Internal Market and the related principles of freedom of movement within the EU.  Of specific relevance are the abolition of routine and systematic Customs checks on goods and passengers moving within any part of the EU and the elimination of Customs controls on the baggage of intra-Community passengers other than anti smuggling checks.  The approach has of necessity been to balance the freedom of movement principle in regard to people and goods with the need to control smuggling, especially drug smuggling.</P>
        <P>In relation to Donegal, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that eight officers, based in Letterkenny, have responsibility for Revenue enforcement in County Donegal.  Two of these officers are engaged full-time on drugs enforcement duties and the other officers are deployed to that task as the need arises.  Revenue continually assesses the risks along the Donegal coast and the coastline is patrolled by these enforcement officers as part of their normal day-to-day enforcement duties.  These patrols are in the main selective and targeted and are based on analysis and evaluation of national and international seizure trends, traffic <Col N="677"/>frequency, routes and other risk indicators.  The patrols are constantly reviewed, taking into account available intelligence and emerging smuggling trends.</P>
        <P>As well as land-based staff, Revenue also has a sea-going vessel, the Customs Cutter, which patrols the coastline.  During the years 2004 to 2007 the Revenue Cutter carried out four patrols along the Donegal coastline.  A contract has been signed for the provision of a second cutter that is expected to be delivered late next year.  Customs officers also receive assistance from the Naval Service, the Air Corps and the Coast Guard.  During the years 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service in Co. Donegal, were involved in three seizures of 92 kgs of cannabis resin with a street value of &euro;644,000.</P>
        <P>As Revenue has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs at importation, enforcement officers and sniffer dog units have not been involved in the visiting of nightclubs and concert venues, where detection of drugs is primarily a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are actively promoting the Customs Drugs Watch programme in all coastal areas.  This Programme seeks to enlist the help of the public in combating drug smuggling by noting any unusual or suspicious activity and reporting it immediately to a local Customs Drugs Watch Officer.  The two Drugs Officers in Letterkenny are specifically tasked with developing the Drugs Watch programme.</P>

	<P>There is no compensation scheme in place in Ireland in the event of a default of a life assurance undertaking.  The Deputy should be aware that the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s insurance supervision unit works closely with Irish insurance companies to ensure that they maintain capital requirements and manage their risks effectively. Prudential supervision has proven to be a most effective safeguard of the interest of policyholders and regulatory oversight of the insurance sector has been stepped up in recent times by the Financial Regulator.</P>
        <P>At EU level only a few Member States have insurance guarantee schemes and an EU Commission working group has indicated that while a majority of Member States are in favour of some European co-ordination of insurance guarantee schemes, there is no consensus on the extent or content of such co-ordination.  The EU Commission has subsequently contracted the consultants OXERA to conduct a study on insurance guarantee schemes in the EU both for life and non-life insurance (excluding motor insurance).  The resultant report entitled &lsquo;Comparative analysis of existing schemes, analysis of problems and evaluation of options&rsquo; was published in early 2008.  The Commission has consulted with the various stakeholders in May &mdash; July 2008, so as to provide them with the opportunity to comment on the main findings of OXERA&rsquo;s report and to make known their views on the desirability and feasibility of Community action in this area.  In addition to collecting written comments, the Commission has held a public hearing on insurance guarantee schemes in June 2008.  The Commission has committed itself to take account of the results of this consultation when making its policy decision on the way forward.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the difficulties for certain individuals, particularly members of defined contribution schemes, who are retiring in current market conditions and who are required to purchase <Col N="678"/>an annuity on retirement at this time.  I am examining this matter and will be consulting with industry interests to establish its extent and what, if anything, can be done to alleviate it.</P>

My Department is responsible for the payment of pensions to retired Civil Servants, the Judiciary and Ministerial and other office holders.  Pensions are also paid to their surviving spouses and children.  The statistics requested by the Deputy are set out in the following tables and exclude surviving spouses and children as their pensions are not granted as a result of employment.  In addition, the figures refer to all relevant pensioners, both married and single, as the payroll database does not distinguish between them. </P>

	<P>My Office has been working to finalise a new Bill which will ratify the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption. The purpose of ratifying the Hague Convention is to protect children in the process of adoption. The Hague Convention emphasises the importance of regulatory systems in protecting the fundamental rights of children, and in preventing the abduction, sale of, or traffic in children. Ratification of the Hague Convention puts in place the equivalent of a contract between states to regulate the standards that will apply in each jurisdiction. It is the intention that the proposed adoption legislation will ensure all inter-country adoptions meet standards of the Convention either through ratification of the Convention or through bilateral agreements which meet the standards of the Hague Convention.</P>
        <P>As part of the preparations for the likely passage and entry into force of the new legislative arrangements for adoption in Ireland, my Office has been advising the Department of Foreign Affairs on the potential implications of the legislation on existing arrangements and agreements for those countries which have not yet ratified the Hague Convention. We are working actively to assess the possibilities of entering into bilateral agreements with a small number of countries, including Ethiopia and the Russian Federation. Priority is being given to those countries which Irish applicants have traditionally adopted from. Every effort will be made to advance bilaterals where this is possible and acceptable to the countries of origin.</P>

	<P>The Government recently announced, as part of its budget proposals, the withdrawal of automatic entitlement to the medical card from people aged 70 years and over and the introduction of new income thresholds for entitlement to a medical card for those aged 70 and over of &euro;700 (gross) per week for a single person and &euro;1,400 (gross) per week for a couple.</P>
        <P>Any savings up to &euro;36,000 (single)/&euro;72,000 (couple) will be disregarded and only interest from savings above these figures will be considered as income for means testing purposes. <Col N="682"/> Income will not be imputed from property (whether a family home, a holiday home or any other property) for means testing purposes, unless it is rented, and only the net rental income will be included as income.  The income to be assessed will be the gross income, less any cost necessarily incurred associated with the property and such cost may include insurance premia, loan/mortgage repayments, maintenance, etc.  Only dividend payments will be considered as income for means testing purposes in the context of shares and investments.</P>
        <P>Medical expenses will not be considered as part of the initial means test.  However, when a person&rsquo;s means are in excess of the relevant income guidelines, the Health Service Executive may issue a medical card on a discretionary basis, having considered if the applicant would otherwise be caused undue hardship in providing general medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.</P>

	<P>Under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme general practitioners hold one of two contract types, i.e. the Fee per Item contract (first introduced in 1972) or the Capitation contract (effective from 1989).  These contracts reflect the agreed outcomes of negotiations between my Department and the GP representative body, the Irish Medical Organisation.</P>
        <P>Over time, provisions additional to the 1972 and the 1989 GMS contracts have been supplemented on foot of agreements between the Department of Health and Children, the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) and the Health Boards/Health Service Executive (HSE) by way of circulars issued by my Department.  Automatic medical card eligibility for persons aged 70 and over came into effect on 1 July 2001.  The terms of the agreement were contained in a circular issued by my Department on 3 August 2001.  I will make arrangements for a copy of the GMS GP capitation contract and circulars to be placed in the Library of the Houses of the Oireachtas as requested by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The annual GP capitation rates as of 1 July 2001 and 1 January 2008 in respect of persons aged 70 and over living in the community issued with a medical card for the first time regardless of income and persons aged 70 and over in private nursing homes (approved by the HSE) for continuous periods in excess of five weeks are set out in tabular form below.</P>

        <P>Section 41(2) of the 1989 GMS contract states &ldquo;The terms of this contract shall be subject to alteration every three years in accordance with the outcome of a review of the agreement between the Minister and the Irish Medical Organisation on arrangements for the provision of services under Section 58 of the Health Act, 1970, which review may be conducted by a third party&rdquo;.  It is not stated in the 2001 Circular, which introduced automatic medical card eligibility for persons aged 70 and over, that GPs&rsquo; payments cannot be explicitly changed without the agreement of the IMO.</P>
        <P>Legal advice received by my Department and the HSE in 2006 and 2007 confirms that there are significant competition law issues which must be taken into account in reaching any agreements and in particular in fixing fees regarding the provision of health services by self-employed professionals.</P>
        <P>The Government is satisfied that the scope of the engagement by General Practitioners in the delivery of primary health care and the significance of primary health care for the overall efficacy of the public health system makes a more direct form of engagement with the representatives of General Practitioners both necessary and desirable.  Accordingly, it is the intention of Government to pursue appropriate amendments to Section 4 of the Competition Act 2002 to enable the representative body of GPs, the IMO, to represent its members in negotiations with the HSE and the Department of Health and Children in respect of the services provided to the public health service in a manner consistent with the public interest.  The legal provision to be made will be subject to consistency with EU competition rules.</P>

In my letter of the 15th October 2008 to the Chairman of the HSE, I indicated the budget was framed in the context of the fiscal challenges facing the country.  I also indicated a number of cost saving measures which the HSE would need to achieve to ensure it remained within its overall expen<Col N="685"/>diture limit. I further emphasised the need to meet these targets so as to protect front line services and I have requested the HSE to submit, for my approval, a National Service Plan, which will indicate how the Executive proposes to allocate its funding and the levels of service it will provide for that funding in 2008.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive funds a wide range of agencies and the Executive will notify these agencies of their funding regarding their allocations after the Service Plan is approved.  My Department also directly funds a wide range of agencies which provide a diverse range of services such as cancer screening, health research, enforcing standards in health care, medicines and food and I hope to be in a position to notify them of their allocation soon.</P>

	<P>The Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) was introduced by my Office in January 2008, under the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP).  The introduction of the CCSS was announced in July 2007 when the initial framework for the scheme was outlined. Community childcare services which at that time were in receipt from my Office of staffing support grants, were invited to apply for funding under the CCSS. Based on the infor<Col N="686"/>mation received from services, the final details of the scheme were put in place in December 2007. The CCSS has not been reviewed since that time and changes to the arrangements governing the scheme are not currently proposed.</P>
        <P>With regard to CCSS funding for community childcare services in 2009, I am pleased to advise the Deputy that applications from participating services were invited in September and are currently being processed. Where applications have been correctly made by the due date, I understand that officials in my Office expect to be in a position to advise services of the outcome and their proposed level of funding in 2009, during November. Applications which are received late or are incorrectly completed would be expected to be responded to as soon as possible after that time.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, requests for assessment for intercountry adoption assessments are continuously increasing. The Study on intercountry adoption, undertaken by the Children&rsquo;s Research Centre in Trinity College, revealed that Ireland has one of the highest rates for intercountry adoption in Europe. It is against this background that my Office is continuing to work to create the appropriate legislative, policy and administrative frameworks which will ensure a well regulated regime of adoption. Our aim is to support and protect prospective parents, and even more importantly, the children for whom adoption services are devised and provided. </P>
        <P>The first priority is the ratification of the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Intercountry Adoption, 1993. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Adoption Bill, 2008, which will ratify the Convention, will be published at the earliest opportunity.  A core principle of the Hague Convention is that intercountry adoption should be child centred, that is, in all stages of the process the child&rsquo;s interests must be paramount. The Hague Convention has put in place the equivalent of a contract between states to regulate the standards that will apply in each jurisdiction. It is an additional safeguard for a receiving country like Ireland regarding the standards that are being applied in the sending country, over which we have no jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>As a receiving country it is especially important to have some confidence in the process of consent to the adoption, the status of the child as adoptable and a guarantee of no improper financial gain from the process. Legislation and specifically the regime of the Hague Convention is at least some assurance for individual children, their families, and the State, that appro<Col N="688"/>priate procedures have been followed and that the adoption was effected in the best interests of the child.</P>
        <P>As regards the assessment process, a family that wishes to adopt should be recognised beforehand as able to promote, safeguard and support the development and well being of a child in need of adoption in a lasting manner. It should also be noted that increasing numbers of adopted children from abroad create additional pressures on intercountry adoption teams within the HSE. This is because these same teams provide post-adoption reports to the sending countries, at the request of those countries, with the agreement of the adoptive parents. This is an important component in the willingness of countries to consider Irish applicants for adoption.</P>
        <P>Officials with my office have also been discussing the issue of preparedness for the new legislative framework with both the Adoption Board and the HSE. While our aim is to ensure that there is a seamless transition to the new regime, I am conscious that persons applying for intercountry adoption are experiencing delays in the assessment process. I acknowledge that there are delays in the waiting times for assessment, and that there are also concerns regarding the standardisation of the service across the country. I appreciate the frustration that these issues must cause.</P>
        <P>The HSE has conducted a review of the intercountry adoption service. This review examined staffing, business processes, resources, strengths and options within the service.  On foot of this report, HSE principal social workers have been having regular meetings, chaired by a senior manager, to discuss the streamlining of the service. The outcome of these discussions will be put into policy format by the end of this year. I understand that the Adoption Board has also taken on a programme of work to support the change process required to devise a more effective system of service delivery. The Board will be delivering a series of training sessions to HSE staff, and I am confident that this will greatly contribute to the standardisation of the service.</P>
        <P>I want to assure the Deputy of my attention to this issue and reiterate the importance of a rigorous and effective assessment system, which is provided on a timely, fair and transparent basis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government recently announced, as part of its budget proposals, the withdrawal of automatic entitlement to the medical card from people aged 70 years and over and the introduction of new income thresholds for entitlement to a medical card for those aged 70 and over of &euro;700 (gross) per week for a single person and &euro;1,400 (gross) per week for a couple.</P>
        <P>Legislation, which will give effect to these changes, will be enacted before the end of 2008 and will come into effect on 1st January 2009.  The arrangements set out in the legislation will provide that persons aged 70 and over who automatically acquired their medical card on age grounds before 31st December 2008 will self-assess for medical card eligibility.  In the case of persons reaching age 70 on or after 1 January 2009, the intention is that they would be required to apply formally for a medical card, to confirm in their application that their income is below the specified limits and to provide appropriate supporting evidence.</P>
        <P>The legislation will include appropriate provisions in relation to validating the initial self-assessments and the eligibility of those granted medical cards in future under the new arrangements.  It is not possible at this time to estimate the cost of administering these arrangements but full regard will be had to the need to balance cost-effectiveness and probity in the use of public funds.</P>

	<P>The Government recently announced, as part of its budget proposals, the withdrawal of automatic entitlement to the medical card from people aged 70 years and over and the introduction of new income thresholds for entitlement to a medical card for those aged 70 and over of &euro;700 (gross) per week for a single person and &euro;1,400 (gross) per week for a couple.  When a person&rsquo;s means are in excess of the relevant income guidelines, the Health Service Executive may issue a medical card on a discretionary basis, having considered if the applicant would otherwise be caused undue hardship in providing general medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
        <P>As part of the means test, any savings up to &euro;36,000 (single) / &euro;72,000 (couple) will be disregarded and only interest from savings above these figures will be considered as income for means testing purposes.  Income will not be imputed from property (whether a family home, a holiday home or any other property) for means testing purposes, unless it is rented and only the net rental income will be included as income.  The income to be assessed will be the gross income, less any cost necessarily incurred associated with the property and such cost may include insurance premia, loan/mortgage repayments, maintenance etc.  Only dividend pay<Col N="690"/>ments will be considered as income for means testing purposes in the context of shares and investments.</P>
        <P>The HSE will shortly write to all persons aged 70 and over.  This letter will clarify the various issues that have arisen and will ask persons whose income is above &euro;700 per week (gross) for a single person and &euro;1,400 per week (gross) for a married couple to notify their circumstances to the HSE.  Persons whose income is less than the aforementioned thresholds will not have to contact the HSE and will retain their medical card.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 86 of 22 October 2008, the date on which the Health Service Executive re-oriented its addiction services. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware any re-orientation of services takes place over a period of time.  Existing HSE services are being re-oriented under the HSE&rsquo;s Transformation Programme 2007-2010 and a key aspect of the re-orientation of addiction services is the training and up-skilling of staff to address the needs arising from changing patterns of drug use in the population e.g. poly drug use (including cocaine use), alcohol use and the abuse of prescribed drugs.</P>
        <P>In this regard, in mid 2007 the HSE National Working Group on Drugs and Alcohol was instrumental in establishing a National Addiction Training Programme (NATP) as a two year pilot programme.  Its purpose is to meet the training needs of staff (voluntary and statutory) within the addiction services &mdash; including training in the treatment of cocaine use.  Over 800 participants have benefited from this programme.</P>
        <P>Phase II of the NATP has a major focus on psychotherapeutic training: it aims to enhance the skills of appropriate staff and clinical supervisors.  A total of 38 staff from the statutory and voluntary sectors and from the community availed of this training. A third training module is scheduled for January/February 2009.</P>

	<P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. In the case of a non national applicant who is the spouse of an Irish citizen, those conditions are that the applicant must:</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />be of full age</P>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />be of good character</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />be married to the Irish Citizen for at least three years</P>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />be in a marriage recognised under the laws of the state as subsisting</P>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />be living together as husband and wife with the Irish Spouse</P><Col N="694"/>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency on the island of Ireland immediately before the date of the application and during the four years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to two years</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation</P>
   <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />have made, either before a Judge of the District Court in open Court or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Deputy will appreciate that the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is an honour. In order to maintain the integrity of the naturalisation process, I do not believe that the periods of residence and marriage for spouses of Irish Citizens, as specified in that Act, warrant any change.</P>

There are two main categories of visa &mdash; a &lsquo;C&rsquo; visa is for a stay of a maximum of 90 days, a &lsquo;D&rsquo; visa is for a longer stay.  It should be borne in mind that a visa is merely a pre-entry clearance to seek permission to enter the State &mdash; no automatic right of entry is conferred.  Whether the person is permitted to enter and the exact period for which s/he is allowed to remain is a matter for the Immigration Officer at the port of entry.</P>

         <P FLI="0">In considering the number of applications for leave to judicially review the RAT since it was established in 2000, account should be taken of the high number of appeals received and decisions made by the RAT in the same period, i.e. 32,385 appeals received and 28,928 decisions issued. The number of judicial reviews taken against RAT equates to 6.9% of all RAT decisions.</P>
        <P>In 986 of these judicial review cases the matter was settled out of court during the course of proceedings. In the majority of cases this was before leave to judicially review the tribunal was granted. All judicial reviews settled by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal are settled following consultation and counsel&rsquo;s advice from the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office. In so far as the balance of judicial review cases is concerned, the number of applicants successful before a court in this eight year period was 43.

Prior to making his proposal to me, the Garda Commissioner established a Working Group to examine all aspects of the matter.  The Working Group examined the impact that the introduction of such sprays has had in other jurisdictions and concluded that their introduction has been a factor in reducing assaults on and injuries to police officers. It was also found that there was a reduction in the number of injuries to suspects and complaints made against officers.</P>
        <P>With regards to health and safety issues, the Working Group consulted with the Garda Chief Medical Officer, who, in conjunction with other medical specialists, studied extensive material available from other jurisdictions where incapacitant sprays have been used for a number of years.  Prior to deployment, appropriate policy, training and medical guidance will be put in place and be re-visited on a periodic basis in light of experience and international developments in this area.</P>

        <P FLI="0">It is, of course, the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing  community policing issues as and when the need arises.  In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and I agree with the view expressed by the Garda Inspectorate in their third report entitled &ldquo;Policing in Ireland &mdash; Looking Forward&rdquo; that community policing is a fundamental policing philosophy and that there is a strong foundation for it in Ireland. I am also looking forward to receiving from the Commissioner, in the near future, a copy of the final report of a working group developing proposals for a comprehensive model of rural and urban community policing.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking everything into account. The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the allocation of Community Garda&iacute; will be fully considered by the Commissioner within the overall context of policing requirements throughout the country.</P>

	<P>The policy regarding non-EEA religious or volunteer workers who wish to enter the State and work in that capacity is as follows.</P>
        <P>If the person concerned is a visa required national he/she would have to set out full details in a visa application of their reason for seeking to come to Ireland.  The visa, if granted, is pre-clearance to the person concerned to arrive at an approved port of entry and seek permission to enter.  All foreign nationals must obtain permission to enter the State from an immigration officer at the approved port of entry.  The person concerned must then register with the Garda National Immigration Bureau and seek the appropriate permission to remain if he/she intends to remain in excess of 3 months.</P>
        <P>Registration for religious and volunteer workers has in the past been renewed on a 12 months basis up to a maximum of 3 years.  The time limit of 3 years, however, has not been strictly enforced in recent years.  The particular immigration status (stamp 3) given to persons in these circumstances indicates that they are not entitled to participate in the labour market and that they are dependent on their employing church or organisation for their upkeep, finances  and medical needs.  In recent months a number of religious and volunteer workers were refused registration for immigration purposes as those persons were in excess of 3 years in the State.  Their cases were referred to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service for a decision as to whether to renew their permission to remain.  These applications will be considered on a case by case basis.</P>
        <P>While I have no proposals to amend the policy in this particular area at this time, it is intended more generally in the context of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008, <Col N="699"/>to review various categories of immigration to the State and to produce revised regulations, schemes and guidelines, as appropriate.  This may include the issue of religious workers and volunteers.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, following an investigation of the criminal matter referred to by the Deputy, a person was arrested and charged with assault and a conviction recorded.  The court also ordered compensation to be paid, and I understand this was done.  As the Deputy is aware, the courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions, and it is not open to me to comment or intervene in any way on the conduct or decision of any individual court case which is entirely a matter for the presiding judge.  I am further informed that policy and procedures, which reflect best international practices, have been introduced for the management and use of intelligence sources by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>All members of the public, including those who provide information to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are subject to investigation by the law enforcement agencies of the State.  Where an offence is disclosed, the matter is investigated and an investigation file prepared for the law officers.  The law officers, in the exercise of their independent role, determine the matter of criminal charges against any person in this jurisdiction.  I am also informed that Garda management is not aware of any information relating to this case along the lines referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides for a shortened period before a person who is married to an Irish citizen can apply for naturalisation.  The residency condition for standard applications specifies that the applicant has, immediately before the date of the application, a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residence and has, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, a total residence amounting to five years.  Where that applicant has an Irish spouse and has been married for three years, the residency condition is reduced to one year&rsquo;s continuous residence and, during the four years immediately preceding that period, total residence amounting to two years.  The Deputy will appreciate that the granting of Irish citizenship <Col N="700"/>through naturalisation is an honour.  In order to maintain the integrity of the naturalisation process, I do not believe that the periods of residence and marriage for spouses of Irish Citizens, as specified in that Act, warrant any change.</P>

The programme consists of five phases.  Phase 1 is a two-day induction course to give Reserve members an appreciation of the Garda organisation and its culture.  Phase 2 consists of 56 hours of training at evenings <Col N="701"/>and weekends during which the trainee Reserve members learn basic law and Garda procedures.  Phase 3 involves two days during which the trainee Reserve members engage in role play exercises including radio procedures and are instructed in self-defence, handcuff techniques and use of equipment.  Phase 4 involves a minimum of 40 hours at a nominated Garda station during which the Trainee Reserve members engage in accompanied beat patrol with a full-time Garda and station duty under a station sergeant.  Phase 5 is a one-day graduation.</P>

However, I should point out that parenting support programmes also operate under the aegis of my colleagues, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Minister of State with responsibility for Children and Youth Affairs.</P>
        <P>With regard to the specific evidenced-based programme &ldquo;Strengthening Families&rdquo;, it has not been possible in the time available to get the full details of the programmes which have already been delivered.  When I have received the information, I will write to the Deputy directly.  However, I can say that approval has been given to Young Persons Probation to deliver the Strengthening Families programme nationally in 2009.  The cost will be approximately &euro;250,000.   Twelve programmes are planned for 2009.  The targeted locations are Dublin (Ballymun, Tallaght, Blanchardstown and Finglas), Cork, Limerick, Portlaoise and Waterford.</P>

	<P>The Probation Service of my Department has responsibility for the supervision and management of Community Service Orders in accordance with the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act 1983.  As I indicated to the Deputy in my reply of 22 October last, the Community Service Scheme is the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review by an Independent Evaluator.  I can inform the Deputy that the preliminary indications from that work shows that during 2006, the average length of a CSO was 136 hours.  This is equivalent to approximately 20 days of full-time attendance on Community Service for an offender.  By comparison, other research dating back to 1999 found that the average length of a CSO was 141 hours.  The table sets out the number of Community Service Orders supervised by the Probation Service between 1998 and 2007.</P>

Therefore, the issue of establishing a formal review mechanism will be addressed at an appropriate stage when conclusions on the impact of the provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Acts 2006 and 2007 which deal with this matter can be appropriately reached.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government supports initiatives to ease or cancel the debt burden on developing countries.  It is important that Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral assistance to the developing world is exclusively in the form of grants rather than loans.  Ireland supports the two main international instruments which address the problem of the debt burden in the developing world &mdash; the multilateral debt relief initiative and the heavily indebted poor countries initiative.</P>
        <P>The multilateral debt relief initiative was agreed by the G8 countries at Gleneagles in July 2005 with a focus on debt cancellation.  It came into effect on 1 July 2006, and provides for 100% relief on eligible debt from the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund for many of the poorest countries in the world, most of them in Africa.  The aim is to relieve these countries from the burden of servicing debt and assist them in making progress on the UN millennium development goals, with the overall objective of halving global poverty by 2015.</P>
        <P>In 2007, the Inter-American Development Bank agreed to provide similar debt relief to the five poorest countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.  To date, 25 countries have benefited from debt relief under the multilateral debt relief initiative, at a cost of some $43.5 billion.  Ireland demonstrated its support for the full implementation of debt relief and, where appropriate, cancellation, in 2006 by being the first country to pay its full share of the costs of the multilateral debt relief initiative of &euro;58.64 million.</P>
        <P>The heavily indebted poor countries initiative is implemented by the World Bank and the IMF.  It was launched in 1996 to reduce the debt burden of qualifying countries to sustainable levels but does not involve cancellation of debt.  Progress on the implementation of the initiative has been relatively slow.  However, to date US$68 billion in debt-service relief has been approved under the initiative for 33 countries, 27 of which are in Africa.  Ireland has contributed &euro;20 million towards the cost of implementing this initiative &mdash; &euro;6 million of this being paid this year.  Ireland will remain actively engaged in ensuring that international commitments to dealing with the debt burden on developing countries are met.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the ongoing issue of sectarian behaviour at Scottish Premier League games.  I am conscious of the distress and offence it can cause.  Since its opening in 1998, the Consulate General of Ireland in Edinburgh has maintained a wide-ranging dialogue with the Scottish Government on various issues.  In recent weeks, the Consul General has been in close contact with senior officials in the Scottish Government in relation to incidents of sectarianism of the kind referred to in the question.  Following these discussions, I am assured that tangible new steps to tackle sectarianism and racism in sport are being reviewed by the Scottish Government.  I am hopeful that the proposed measures will help to improve the situation.  The Consulate General will continue to monitor closely developments in this regard.</P>

	<P>Together with our European Union partners, Ireland is closely monitoring investigations by the Colombian Supreme Court into the alleged association of members of Congress and Government officials with paramilitary groups in Colombia.  Any association between elected representatives or officials and paramilitary groups is a matter of serious concern in itself, and also has the capacity further to destabilise the Colombian peace process.</P>
        <P>I am gravely concerned by the revelations emerging as a result of these investigations. However, it is important that the Supreme Court investigations continue so that further information and evidence can be uncovered. We respect the fact that the due process of law is being applied. We are also monitoring the proposed constitutional amendments relating to the Supreme Court&rsquo;s investigation and their potential impact on the investigation.  In conjunction with our European Union partners, we will continue to examine how we may, as appropriate, contribute to the peace process in Colombia.</P>

        <P>The school meals programme is non-statutory.  Priority for funding under the school meals local projects scheme is given to schools which are part of the Department of Education &amp; Science&rsquo;s initiative for disadvantaged schools &lsquo;Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools&rsquo; (DEIS).  The focus of the school meals programme will remain on disadvantaged children and the inclusion of additional DEIS schools in the scheme will continue to be the Department&rsquo;s main priority.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 177 and 184 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of families and representative groups expressed concerns about the impact of the changes to the DA scheme announced in Budget 2009. Having reflected on these concerns the Government, on my recommendation, agreed that the existing arrangements, whereby DA is paid to 16 and 17 year olds, will continue pending completion of a full review of the DA scheme.  The changes announced as part of the Social Welfare Budget were designed to address concerns raised by a number of bodies about the appropriateness of paying young people a social welfare payment in their own right at the age of 16.</P>
        <P>The National Federation of Voluntary Bodies in particular had argued in a submission to the Department&rsquo;s review of the Disability Allowance Scheme that &ldquo;at present the age for receipt of DA is 16 years.  We deem this to be too young. This does not give an incentive for a child to pursue work/education options. Subsequently a child may fall into the dependency trap too early.  Instead parents should receive the Domiciliary Care Allowance for the child until they are 18 years old.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s motivation in making changes to the Disability Allowance was to address these concerns.  This week I met with six different groups representing people with disabilities and disability service providers (namely the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies, Inclusion Ireland, Down Syndrome Ireland, People with Disabilities in Ireland, the National Disability Authority and Rehab).  At these meetings, the underlying principle of the Budget measure, i.e. that it is inappropriate to pay a social welfare payment to a 16 year old in his or her own right, was not seriously contested.  The key concern expressed by the groups related to the loss of expected income at short notice to families of young people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>Following these meetings, I recommended to the Government that the Disability Allowance continue to be paid to 16 and 17 year olds pending a full review of the scheme.  The review is considering a wide range of issues as identified by groups representing people with disabilities and their families, by service providers and will take account of a forthcoming report on disability and illness benefits by the OECD.  It will also draw on new data published by the Central Statistics Office last week from the National Disability Survey 2006.  In the circumstances, the question of a possible entitlement to the Domiciliary Care Allowance in respect of persons aged between 16 and 18 does not now arise.</P>

        <Quest> the way an entitlement to deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit which was an insurance based benefit could be transformed into a means tested payment; if in view of the fact that there is a small number in receipt of this payment she will explain the motivation for such a significant change whereby people who qualified for same anticipated they would continue on this payment as it was insurance based; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The Deserted Wife&rsquo;s Benefit scheme was an insurance based scheme for women whose marriage had broken down.  In 1992 an earnings limit was brought in for the scheme so that resources would be effectively targeted to those deserted wives who required an additional supplement to their income until they were able to support themselves.  The deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit (DWB) scheme was closed to new applications with effect from 2 January 1997, when the one-parent family payment (OFP) was introduced.  Thereafter, both lone parents and deserted wives with qualified children are supported under the OFP scheme. </P>
        <P>The current income disregard of &euro;20,000 was introduced in Budget 2007 and represented a substantial increase on the previous income disregard whereby recipients earning more than &euro;12,697 per annum received a reduced payment and whereby claimants earning more than <Col N="713"/>&euro;17,776 lost entitlement to the payment.  This new arrangement, in effect allows DWB recipients to earn up to &euro;384 per week and still retain full entitlement to benefit of &euro;203.30 per week (&euro;209.80 per week from January 2009).  DWB recipients whose income goes over &euro;20,000 per annum are also entitled to a half-rate transitional payment for 6 months.  I am satisfied that the conditions for payment are equitable and I have no plans at present to change the earnings disregard.</P>

        <P Just="Left">In 2005, the Department introduced a comprehensive Attendance Management Policy which provides for the active management of absenteeism by clearly setting out the relevant roles and responsibilities of all staff and managers in this area.  As part of this policy, the Department works closely with the Chief Medical Officer in managing cases of sick leave.  The Chief Medical Officer plays a crucial role in advising the Department on employees&rsquo; fitness for work from a medical perspective.  In addition, my Department operates a Health Promotion policy and an Employee Assistance Service which provides support to staff in the Department as required.  The measures set out in the Attendance Management Policy are kept under review for the purposes of evaluating and, where necessary, increasing their effectiveness.</P>

	<P>No price increases have been imposed by my Department since 1 January 2008.  During the same period, the only price increase by an agency under the aegis of my Department was an increase in the fees charged by Coiste an Asgard in respect of cruises on board Asgard II.  The fees for the 2008 cruise programme were increased by amounts ranging from 15% to 20%.  The most recent increase in the fees prior to that was an increase of 5% in 2006.  There was no increase in either 2004 or 2005.</P>

        <Quest> the position regarding the military service allowance for members of the Permanent Defence Force who retired prior to August 1990; if his Department has done a costing in respect of the numbers who have been deprived of this allowance; if, in this context and due to the reducing numbers involved, he will take steps to have same granted to these personnel; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from a recommendation made in 1990 by the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces (the Gleeson Commission), Military Service Allowance (MSA) was made pensionable in the case of personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990.  This approach was fully consistent with settled public service pensions policy which provides that the benefit of an allowance being made pensionable for serving personnel does not extend to existing pensioners.</P>
        <P>More recently, the Final Report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions, which was published in November 2000, was considered and broadly accepted by Government.  In that Report, the Commission specifically addressed the issue of the pensionability of allowances (including the MSA) and the consequences for public service occupational pensioners generally. However, having considered the arguments advanced by the groups affected, together with long standing public service pensions policy in that context and the substantial cost implications involved, the Commission did not recommend any increase for the pensioners concerned.  Aside from pre-August 1990 Defence Forces pensioners, the other groups affected include certain retired members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Prison Service and retired teachers.  In the context of the Government&rsquo;s subsequent consideration of the Commission&rsquo;s Report, no change in existing policy on this matter has been authorised or is contemplated.</P>
        <P>At present, there are approximately 10,000 persons in receipt of military occupational pensions under the Defence Forces Pensions Schemes (including some 1,600 spouses and children of deceased personnel).  About 3,330 of these are pre-August 1990 pensioners who do not qualify for the MSA in their pension.  The direct cost to my Department of extending the benefit of MSA to them is currently estimated at almost &euro;7.0 million a year.  While the number of pensioners affected is slowly falling each year &mdash; the corresponding figure this time last year was about 3,500 &mdash; the cost involved remains significant.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the position of these Defence Forces pensioners cannot be looked at in isolation and thus the cost implications for the wider public service must be considered.  Any departure from established pensions policy for one group would give rise to significant cost repercussions in other areas of the public service.  Accordingly, there is no scope for departing from settled public service pensions policy in the case of MSA.</P>

	<P>The European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997, specify that objections to the inclusion of lands within a candidate Special Area of Conservation (cSAC) must be made in writing within three months of public notification.  The proposed boundaries for Magheradrumman Bog cSAC were advertised on 1 March 1997.  This three months time limit has been appropriately applied since November 2006 so that Ireland could finalise the SAC designations process and meet our objectives under the EU Habitats Directive.  Accordingly, the period for lodging objections has expired and I do not propose any extension.  </P>
        <P>A number of landowners and turbary right owners had lodged objections to the proposed designation, and funding was provided by my Department for the preparation of a report on the site by an independent ecologist.  I am considering this report at present, and will make a decision on the boundaries of the cSAC shortly.</P>

	<P>A small proportion of Ireland&rsquo;s peatlands is designated for conservation purposes under the Habitats Directive or the Wildlife Acts.  Landowners and holders of turbary rights on blanket bogs within Special Areas of Conservation or Natural Heritage Areas can cut turf for their own domestic use.  Since 1999, the use of sausage machines is not permitted in these areas.  However, hoppers, or other hand-held machines, are permitted.  There are fewer restrictions on undesignated blanket bogs.  Large-scale peat extraction works may require planning permission, with an associated environmental impact assessment, under the planning code. </P>

	<P>Section 20(4) of the Broadcasting Authority Act 1960 (as qualified by section 65 of the Broadcasting Act 2001) and section 10(3) of the Radio and Television Act 1988 provide that broadcasters cannot accept advertisements that are directed towards any religious or political end or have any relation to an industrial dispute.</P>
        <P>The prohibition on religious advertising does not prevent advertisements, which provide information about a religious magazine or periodical being available for sale, or about a religious event or ceremony taking place.  The prohibition does not extend to religious broadcasting; sections 28 and 45 of the Broadcasting Act 2001 explicitly require RT&Eacute; and TG4 to carry religious programming.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that in 2004, the prohibition on religious advertising on radio and television was retained following a lengthy consultation during which over 150 submissions from the public were received by my Department.  There was a strong argument that religious interests should not be able to buy air-time to deliver an unchallenged message, that a message which, other interests, through lack of resources, might not be able to match or counter.</P>
        <P>Section 41 of the Broadcasting Bill continues the prohibition on religious advertising but does so in a less restrictive manner.  The provision focuses on advertisements that address the issue of the merits or otherwise of adhering to any religious faith or belief or of becoming a member of any religion or religious organisation, as opposed to the existing restriction which relates to advertisements directed towards a religious end.  The section also continues the clarification that permits advertisements which provide information about a religious magazine or periodical being available for sale, or about a religious event or ceremony taking place.  A number of Deputies have raised the issue of religious advertising during the course of the second stage debate on the Bill.  I propose to consider the issues raised by the deputies in advance of committee stage.</P>

	<P>I am well aware of the impact of the measures contained in the 2009 Budget for my Department. Against the background of the deterioration in the national finances, difficult choices had to be made in <Col N="726"/>allocating the resources available to me in 2009. I made these decisions in the best interests of the sector following detailed analysis of my Department&rsquo;s programme of expenditure and careful consideration of the options available.  Despite the economic and budgetary situation, funding of &euro;1.8 billion gross is provided for my Department in the 2009 Budget. When combined with EU funding and co-funding of about &euro;1.4 billion next year, this represents very substantial funding for the support and development of the agri-food sector.</P>
        <P>My priority in framing the 2009 Budget for the Department was to focus available resources on protecting the most productive elements of the agriculture, food, forestry and fisheries sectors and to ensure that they will continue to develop. My objective is to continue to develop the sector within the budgetary constraints to ensure that it is well positioned to achieving its full potential and benefit from future economic growth.  I will monitor all aspects of my Department&rsquo;s expenditure throughout 2009 and, in the normal course, I will review spending priorities in the context of the preparation of the 2010 Estimates.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>In the time available it has not been possible to assemble the information requested on a county basis.  However at National level the position is as follows.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s National Ceiling for 2005 was &euro;1,260 million of which 3% (&euro;37.8m) had been provisionally set aside to fund the National Reserve.   The cost of funding successful applicants under Force Majeure and New Entrants during the reference period has meant that the sum of individual entitlements has exceeded our National ceiling requiring a 1.18% linear reduction of all entitlements.  It was agreed that any linear reduction would be accommodated with the 3% already deducted for the National Reserve.  In effect therefore the cost of funding Force Majeure and new entrants during the reference period amounted to some &euro;15.3m while the sum of money available for the National Reserve was &euro;22.5m.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;6.5m also accrued to the National Reserve in 2005 representing the value of entitlements that were allocated to farmers but not activated (claimed) in 2005.  In addition some &euro;3.5m accrued to the National Reserve in 2007 representing the value of entitlements not used in the three-year period 2005, 2006 and 2007.  Entitlements allocated from the National Reserve must be used in full each year otherwise they are immediately reverted to the National Reserve. <Col N="727"/> Some &euro;1.7m accrued to the National Reserve in 2005, 2006 and 2007 under this usage rule giving a total value of &euro;5.2m unused entitlements.</P>
        <P>The EU regulations allow Member States on a discretionary basis to apply a claw-back on the sale of entitlements with and without land.  Ireland applied such a clawback in respect of entitlements sold in 2006 and 2007.  Some &euro;599,461 accrued to the National Reserve from this arrangement.  Payment Entitlements may be sold with or without land but can only be sold without land once 80% have been used in one calendar year or, if 80% have not been used in one calendar year the transferor has the option of ceding those entitlements that were not used in 2005 to the National Reserve.  Some &euro;134,286 accrued to the National Reserve in 2006, 2007 and 2008 under this arrangement.</P>
        <P>While it is obligatory to deduct Modulation from all Single Payments, the deductions in respect of the first &euro;5,000 of each payment are refundable. The EU Regulations governing the Single Payment Scheme provided for an increase in the rate of Modulation deduction, from 3% in 2005, to 4% in 2006 and 5% in 2007. The total gross value of deductions in respect of Modulation during these years was as follows: 2005: &euro;36.9 million; 2006: &euro;52.1 million; 2007: &euro;65.3 million. The amounts refunded during the same period are as follows: 2005: &euro;14.5 million; &euro;19.4 million; 2007 &euro;24.2 million.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The table sets out information on the sheep sector since 1998.  The difficulties facing the sheep sector have been apparent for some time and prompted the setting up of the Sheep Strategy Development Group. The Strategy Group&rsquo;s report  contained a number of recommendations for action to secure the future of the sector.</P>
        <P>Considerable progress has been by my Department in implementing the recommendations in the report within its remit. These include drawing up a revised pedigree breed improvement scheme and an interim board has been established to oversee the project. Trials have been conducted on the feasibility of introducing mechanical grading for lamb carcasses. An additional supplementary measure to promote mixed grading and assist sheep farmers has been introduced under REPS 4; a lamb quality assurance scheme has been introduced and Bord Bia have strengthened their efforts to promote lamb on the home and export markets. Teagasc has developed a new sheep programme to improve the management and husbandry of flocks.</P>
        <P>All these actions are geared to improving quality and some, of their nature, will take time for the benefits to accrue. An important element is agreement by the processors and farmers representatives to agree on a pricing grid with a base price for a certain quality and bonuses or penalties for variations from this. The introduction of such an agreed grid would bring clarity to the market and would enable producers to see that quality is being rewarded across the board. It is hoped that agreement can be reached on the issue in the near future.</P>
        <P>The decline in the Irish sheep sector is not an isolated phenomenon. Indeed, similar declines are evident in most of the sheep-producing countries of Europe. European production is pre<Col N="728"/>dicted to fall a further 2% this year. There is a deficit of 300,000 tonnes which is mainly filled by imports from New Zealand which has an annual quota of 228,000 tonnes.</P>
        <P>The problems facing the sheep sector are well known at EU level. My predecessor had them discussed at the EU Agriculture Council of Ministers in March. This was followed by the Aylward Report to the European Parliament and a conference hosted by the French Presidency of the EU in September. These initiatives have kept the sheep sector&rsquo;s concerns to the forefront and, in the context of the current &ldquo;CAP Health Check&rdquo; discussions, I continue to pursue possible solutions.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</askee>
        <Quest> the number of farms and the amount of money paid out under the various aspects of the sheep package announced by him in May 2007; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[37627/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The series of measures announced in May 2007 were in response to the recommendations of the Sheep Strategy Development Group. They form a comprehensive package to address the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. The following sets out progress on the measures.</P>
<?oasys _cl13.5- ?>
<P el="10"><i>REPs</i></P>
        <P el="0">Sheep farmers continue to be major beneficiaries under the scheme and account for some 22,500 participants. Payments made to them in 2007 totalled some &euro;332m. In relation to the new mixed grazing supplementary measure, &euro;9,000 has been paid in respect of REPs 4 contracts commencing in 2007. Some 11,600 applications for REPS 4 with 2008 commencement dates were received in my Department by the closing date of 15 May, 2008.  These are currently being processed and it is not possible to say what the cost of the mixed grazing supplementary measure in respect of 2008 will be at this stage.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Single Farm Payment / National Reserve</i></P>
        <P el="0">The sheep sector also continues to benefit from the single farm payment. While that payment is decoupled, it incorporates the previous ewe premium, which ceased in 2004. Ewe premia totalled &euro;107.5m in that year.  Under the 2005 National Reserve some 500 hill sheep farmers will benefit by &euro;400,000 annually or &euro;2.8m over the period until 2012. In addition, a special category was included under the 2007 National Reserve for sheep farmers whose existing Single Payment is less than &euro;10,000 and where individual entitlements are less than the District Electoral Division (DED) average. Allocations are capped at the DED average value of entitlements or a total Single Payment of &euro;10,000 whichever is the lesser and allocations to successful applicants will not exceed &euro;1,000.  It is estimated that this measure is worth some &euro;6m annually or &euro;42m until 2012.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Compensatory Allowances</i></P>
        <P el="0">This is an area-based scheme but it incorporates the previous sheep headage scheme, which ceased in 2000.</P>
<P>Payments under this scheme to 27,000 farmers amounted &euro;27.5m in that year.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Sheep Breeding</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Pedigree Sheep Breeding Programme as operated by my Department, in co-operation with the sheep breed societies, is currently being transferred to &lsquo;Sheep Ireland&rsquo;, a sister company of the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF).  An Interim Sheep Board has been established to manage and oversee the transfer. To facilitate this transfer and to allow for redevelopment of the breeding programme, funding of &euro;163,000 has been provided so far in 2008.  DAFF will provide further financial support to ICBF in 2009 for sheep breeding.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Carcass Classification</i></P>
        <P el="0">A trial to examine the feasibility of mechanical classification for lamb was conducted earlier this year at a cost of &euro;135,000.  Additional funding at a similar level may be made available to carry out additional feasibility work, if required, in 2009.</P><Col N="731"/>
<P el="10"><i>Quality Assurance</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme operated by an Bord Bia has 6,500 participants and involves spending of some &euro;820,00 to date. It is hoped to expand this by a further 6,000 in 2009. This could involve spending of up to &euro;1m depending on uptake.</P>
<P el="10"><i>State Agencies&rsquo; Support</i></P>
        <P el="0">An Bord Bia spends in the region of &euro;1m on the promotion of sheep and lamb at home and abroad per annum.  Teagasc allocated in the region of &euro;1.5m in 2007 and 2008 on sheep research activities. This also covers specialist staff for the sheep programme established following the Sheep Strategy Group&rsquo;s report. It does not include additional funding related to the advisory service, some of which would be directed towards sheep.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>My approach in preparing the 2009 Estimates for my Department was to focus available resources on the measures that allow us to maintain and grow the productive capacity of the agri-food sector. The 2009 Estimates provide over &euro;1.8 billion for my Department, and, when combined with EU funding of &euro;1.4 billion, means that total expenditure in 2009 by my Department will amount to over &euro;3.2 billion.</P>
        <P>While difficult decisions had to be taken in light of the situation of the public finances, account also had to be taken of the very high level of investment by the Government in recent years, when significant additional financial resources were committed to areas such as the rural environment scheme, where the rates of grant had been increased by 17 per cent, the new suckler cow welfare scheme and the farm waste management scheme and, indeed, the 8% increase in rates under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme itself, introduced in 2007.</P>
        <P>With regard to the 2009 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, I decided to reduce expenditure for 2009, by reducing the maximum area limit to 34 hectares (84 acres) and by a small increase in the minimum stocking density requirement. While overall expenditure will fall, almost 67,000 farmers will not suffer any reduction in their payments as a result of the introduction of the 34-hectare limit. Furthermore, these farmers, as well as all claimants under the Scheme, will continue to benefit from the substantial increase of 8% in the rate of aid introduced by the Government in 2007.  In addition, of the 102,500 farmers who benefit under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, in excess of 50,000 of these also benefit under REPS, while in excess of 47,000 also benefit under the Suckler Welfare Scheme, which introduces a new stream of payments to farmers in 2008.</P>
        <P>It should also be taken into account, that in addition to the payments under these Schemes, a further &euro;920 million was paid to farmers with Disadvantaged Area lands under the 2007 Single Payment Scheme.  The total amount payable of &euro;220 million to farmers under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is part of the overall substantial injection of funds paid to farmers situated in the areas and the Scheme continues to be one of the best well funded Disadvantaged Areas Schemes in the European Union.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the difficulties in the public finances and the decisions I have taken against that background, the position is that in excess of &euro;3.2 billion will be spent next year by my Department in support of agriculture, fisheries and food. It is important to get through this challenging period and continue towards achieving the full potential of our most important indigenous industry when the economy begins to grow again.</P>
        <P>The Hill Farmers scheme was a special category under the 2005 National Reserve.  This catered for farmers with commonage land who were prevented from expanding their sheep production during the 2000-2002 reference period pending publication of the Commonage Framework Plans in 2003.  One of the qualifying criteria was that the existing Single Payment must have been less than &euro;6,000.   Some 500 hill-sheep farmers benefit from this measure to the tune of &euro;400,000 annually or &euro;3.2m over the period until 2012.</P>
        <P>In addition, a special category was included under the 2007 National Reserve for sheep farmers whose existing Single Payment is less than &euro;10,000 and where individual entitlements are less than the District Electoral Division (DED) average. Allocations are capped at the DED average value of entitlements or a total Single Payment of &euro;10,000 whichever is the lesser <Col N="733"/>and allocations to successful applicants did not exceed &euro;1,000.  It is estimated that some 7,500 sheep farmers will receive some &euro;6m annually under this measure, or &euro;36m over the period until 2012.</P>
        <P>Under both of these measures the Member State was obliged to apply objective criteria in determining the value of entitlements to be allocated to successful applicants. In Ireland&rsquo;s case it was agreed that the Regional Average value of entitlements would be used for the granting of entitlements to successful applicants. The Regional Average is the average value determined at the District Electoral Division (DED) associated with the applicant&rsquo;s herd number.  In addition it was decided that allocations would not exceed &euro;1,000.  The National Reserve is a scarce resource created by reducing the entitlements of existing farmers and will only be replenished by the relinquishing of any entitlements that remain unused. My Department must therefore be prudent is determining how the funds in the reserve are administered.</P>

	<P>Since 1st January 2008, with the implementation of EU Regulation 882/2004, meat inspection fees have increased for the slaughter of cattle at an EU approved export premises to &euro;5, an increase of &euro;0.50 on the previous rate.  In July of this year, approval was granted to Teagasc for a 4.4% increase for general advisory and education/training charges. In addition, a 15% increase in REPS charges was approved to take account of increased costs associated with the completion of REPS plans.</P>
        <P>My Department also charges chemical companies for the registration of plant protection products. Last revised in 2003, these registration fees were reviewed and agreed with the Chemical Industry in 2007 with an effective date of 1st January 2008.  On average these fees were increased by approximately 50% and I will arrange to forward the deputy a full list of these fees in the coming days.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</askee>
        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the negative impact upon farm families and young farmers of the measures announced in budget 2009 and in particular the decisions to suspend the early retirement scheme and the installation aid scheme, together with changes to the disadvantaged area scheme and the suckler cow welfare scheme which will mean substantial income losses for many farmers; if he will take steps to review same with a view to reversing same; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Against the background of the deterioration in public finances, my approach in preparing the 2009 estimates for my Department was to focus available resources on the measures that allow us to maintain and grow the productive capacity of the agri-food sector.  There has been a high level of investment in developing this sector in recent years, with the commitment of significant financial resources to areas such as the rural environment scheme, where the rates of grant had been increased by 17%, the new suckler cow scheme and the farm waste management scheme. Expenditure for that scheme in 2008 will exceed &euro;375 million following the recent provision of an additional &euro;195 million.</P>
        <P>Because I have chosen to protect expenditure in certain areas, expenditure in other areas has to be curtailed. In relation to the Scheme of Early Retirement from Farming and the Young Farmers&rsquo; Installation Scheme, I have made provision of &euro;56.7 million to meet current commitments but this level of funding means that for the present, new applications for these schemes are suspended.  Despite the reduction in expenditure under the scheme of Area-based Compensatory payments, we will be making payments of over &euro;220 million under this scheme next year and the reduction will be implemented in a targeted way, with the majority of farmers not suffering any loss in their payments.</P>
        <P>As regards the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme, I have ensured that the commitment entered into in Partnership to spend &euro;250 million on that scheme is fully honoured.  The payment rate for 2008 will be &euro;80 per cow. The rate of payment in the remaining years of the scheme will be determined by reference to the continuing rate of participation in the scheme. The rate applicable to 2009 will be advised to participating farmers before the end of this year.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</askee>
        <Quest> the number of applications and payments on a county basis under the single farm payment 2007 and the projected figures for 2008; the corresponding figures for all REP schemes; the status of the modulation proposals tabled for the mid-term CAP review; the other proposals tabled for the mid-term review which will have an impact on payments to farmers; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[37732/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The number of applications and payments made to date, on a county basis, under the 2007 Single Payment Scheme are as at Table 1. The number of applications and advance payments made to date, on a county basis, under the 2008 Single Payment Scheme are as at Table 2.  The number of REPS payments to date in 2008 is set out in Table 3, while the figures for 2007 are set out in Table 4. It is not possible to project the figures forward to the end of the year.</P>
        <P>With regard to Modulation, the present provisions provide for the deduction of 5% modulation on all payments made under the Single Payment Scheme. The funds raised by this measure are transferred to Pillar II of the EU Budget and used to finance Rural Development measures.  The Regulations require that Member States subsequently refund that element of modulation related to the first &euro;5,000 of each payment.  I welcome the abolition of the &euro;5,000 franchise proposed in the EU Health Check, as this means that the requirement to deduct the modulation from all payments and refund it at a later stage will no longer apply.  This means that farmers no longer have to wait for the payment of the refund and the proposed change will also simplify the administration of the Single Payment Scheme. I am opposed to the increases in the modulation deductions from 2009 proposed by the EU Commission as part of its Health Check proposals and I have made this position clear during the on-going negotiations on the proposals.</P>
        <P>There are other proposals in the CAP Health Check, which, if adopted, will simplify the Single Payment Scheme for farmers. These include the following: the abolition of the set-aside obligation; the extension of the use it or lose it rule for National Reserve entitlements from one to two years; the abolition of the requirement that a farmer must have utilised 80% or more of his or her entitlements before the entitlements can be sold without land.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Based on the records of the Central Statistics Office and my own Department, Irish beef has been exported to the following countries in the period from 2003 to 2007. EU Countries: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Non-EU Countries: Albania, Algeria, Angola, Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Aruba, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain, Benin, Brazil, Canada, Comoros, Congo, Ecuador, Egypt, Faroe Islands, Gabon, Georgia, Ghana, Gibraltar, Hong Kong, Iceland, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Mayotte, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Seychelles, South Africa, South Korea, Suriname, Switzerland, Thailand, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, Ukraine, Vatican City, Vietnam, Yemen and Zambia.  It should be noted that not all the countries listed above featured as export destinations in a particular year.</P><Col N="739"/>
        <P>Over 90% of Irish beef production is exported. The distribution of Irish beef exports has undergone significant change since 2000. Only 50% of beef exports went to other European countries in 2000 compared to 97% in 2007.  The principal factors behind this change in market distribution have been the emergence of a significant supply deficit in the European beef market combined with an improved market position for Irish beef in key markets.</P>
        <P>This development represents significant progress for the Irish beef sector as the EU market continues to offer the best returns to Irish exporters on a consistent basis. At the same time, efforts continue to improve access to third country markets and Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates and the Philippines have been re-opened to Irish beef within the last year.</P>
        <P>Regarding the future prospects for Irish beef exports, current indications are positive. Overall availability of beef in the EU has fallen because of declining production and reduced imports from South America. While consumer research indicates that meat purchases are being affected by the economic slowdown, sales of value beef cuts have risen significantly. Although traditional steak cuts and roasting joints are not performing as well, this is being compensated by increased demand for other parts of the carcass.</P>

        <Quest> the countries to which Irish dairy products have been exported in each of the past five years; the number of new markets established; the existing markets lost; his projections for the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Irish dairy products are exported to other EU member states and to over 100 countries worldwide.  The amount of exports to any particular destination varies in accordance with changes in the supply/demand dynamics in particular regions of the world and in respect of the various dairy products involved. In overall terms, Ireland&rsquo;s dairy exports increased in 2007 by 13%, to &euro;2.36 billion, an increase of &euro;270 million on the previous record achieved in 2006.  The UK represented the largest single share of export sales with 23%.  The rest of the EU accounted for 52%, while North America and Africa accounted for 9% and 8% respectively. As international demand changes there will be an increasing emphasis on consumer food markets, particularly in the EU, US and high growth emerging economies, together with strategically expanding marketing and distribution capability worldwide.</P>
        <P>Dairy product output from Ireland and the EU is of course constrained by the limits placed on milk output by the EU milk quota regime. As part of the current negotiations on the CAP Health Check the Commission has put forward proposals to increase milk quotas in order to provide a &lsquo;soft landing&rsquo; towards the abolition of quotas in 2015.  These proposals will provide Irish dairy farmers and processors with further opportunities to respond to global demand and to increase production and capture new market share.</P>

	<P>Irish sheepmeat has been exported to the following countries in the period from 2003 to 2007. EU Countries: <Col N="740"/>Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden &amp; United Kingdom. Non-EU Countries: Ghana, Gibraltar, Switzerland, Tunisia, Vatican City.</P>
        <P>Approximately 70% of Irish sheepmeat production is exported. In 2007, Ireland exported 53,266 tonnes of sheepmeat, of which 99.9% was destined for the high-value EU marketplace. The absence of export refunds together with a production deficit within the EU means that the market focus is on Europe and there is little penetration outside the EU.</P>
        <P>Traditionally, the major export market for Irish lamb within the EU has been France which in 2007 accounted for 26,945 tonnes, or just over 50% of exports. While the French market has been in decline due to a fall in consumption and demand there coupled with strong competition from the UK and new Zealand this has been made up by increases in other markets. Exports to Sweden and Denmark have increased significantly in recent years. Seven countries accounted for 99% of sheepmeat exports in 2003 and the same seven countries also accounted for 99% of sheepmeat exports in 2007, namely: France, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Sweden and the UK.</P>
        <P>The number of new potential markets for Irish lamb is limited due to the relatively high cost of the meat and also due to cultural factors, as lamb is not widely eaten in many countries of Eastern Europe. As a result, promotional efforts are targeted at maintaining and developing existing markets, including the home market.</P>

	<P>Against the background of the deterioration in public finances, my approach in preparing the 2009 estimates for my Department was to focus available resources on the measures that allow us to maintain and grow the productive capacity of the agri-food sector.  Because I had chosen to protect expenditure in certain areas, expenditure in other areas had to be curtailed. In relation to the Scheme of Early Retirement from Farming I have made provision of &euro;47 million in 2009 to meet current commitments but, for the present, it has been necessary to suspend new applications for the Scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Health &amp; Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Under the general labelling Directive (2000/13/EC), the place of origin of the foodstuff must be given only if its absence might mislead the consumer to a material degree.   The European Commission is currently undertaking a major review of all food labelling legislation which will lead to new regulations in this sector.  As part of this process, Ireland has sought mandatory origin labelling for all meats.</P>
        <P>Food products of animal origin imported from an EU source must come from an approved food business establishment and be accompanied to its destination by a commercial document <Col N="741"/>or a health certificate signed by an official veterinarian of the competent authority of the Member State of origin.  In the case of importation from third countries they must originate in a country approved by the EU for trade in such products, have been produced in an approved establishment, be appropriately labelled and transported and must be accompanied by a veterinary health certificate in accordance the models laid down by Community legislation.</P>
        <P>All consignments from third countries must first be landed at a Border Inspection Post (BIP) operated by my Department that has been approved by the Food and Veterinary Office of the EU (FVO) and there undergo documentary, identity and physical checks.  These latter are carried out at frequencies laid down in EU law. In Ireland BIPs approved for the processing imports of animal products are located at Dublin Port and Shannon Airport. The FVO carries out monitoring and inspection of each Member State&rsquo;s BIPs to ensure the conditions for import of animal products into Europe, provided under the harmonized legislation, are being correctly applied.</P>
        <P>Once it has been established that imported animal product has met all the required conditions it is released for free circulation within the community. Copies of the BIP clearance document and the health certificate must accompany the consignment to its destination. Imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination. If non-compliance is established they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed.</P>

	<P>The CAP Health Check proposals are described as a fine-tuning of the 2003 reform of the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP); there are three areas (i) a review of the implementation of the single payment scheme (SPS), (ii) a review of market management measures including the milk quota regime and (iii) a response to the so-called new challenges of climate change, bio-energy, water management and bio-diversity.</P>
        <P>The dossier was presented to Ministers at the Informal May Council.  A full first round examination of the texts has now been completed by the Working Groups and most of the technical and linguistic issues have been addressed.  Trilateral meetings took place at the last two Agriculture Councils to identify the main priorities for each Member State and to refine the political issues outstanding.  The Presidency remains confident that the proposals will be adopted as a package at the November Council of Agriculture Ministers.</P>
        <P>The impact of the whole package of measures on Irish agriculture will clearly depend on what is agreed at the end of the negotiations.  My aim in the negotiations has been and will continue to be to achieve the best possible outcome for Ireland and for agriculture. I have already outlined the issues of concern to Ireland to Commissioner Fischer Boel and the French Presidency, to Commission officials and to colleagues in other Member States. I will continue to take an active role in the discussions at every opportunity and to reiterate our priorities.</P>
        <P>Our priorities for the health check negotiations include: seeking sufficient milk quota increases and appropriate market management arrangements to ensure a soft landing in preparation for the expiry of quotas in 2015; ensuring clear, predictable decisions are taken on milk quotas to give policy certainty to producers and to industry; opposing the substantial increases in compulsory modulation proposed by the Commission; seeking further simplification of the <Col N="742"/>single payment scheme and cross compliance; ensuring national discretion in the adjustment of the single payment scheme and the operation of specific supports funded from the single payment ceiling.  I have established a consultative process with key stakeholders to advise on the main issues arising in the Health Check and the output from this is feeding into Ireland&rsquo;s position in the negotiations.</P>

	<P>The issue of food security has informed the current discussion on the CAP Health Check and the situation relating to agriculture post 2013. I raised the matter of food security with my EU colleagues at the Ministerial Council in Annecy in September. I emphasised the need to maintain a strong sustainable agricultural production base in Europe and to have an appropriately resourced common policy.</P>
        <P>There is an increasing awareness among EU Member States that food security cannot be taken for granted in a world where demand is rising rapidly and expected to double by 2050. The Council concluded that we must maintain a strong agriculture production base in the European Union, and that we must undertake food production and distribution in a manner that is sustainable in all its dimensions, economically, socially and environmentally.  I should add that at the July WTO Ministerial meeting in Geneva, Ireland and a number of other countries raised the issue of the security of food supply on a number of occasions in the context of the EC position.</P>

	<P>One of the key challenges facing us in the medium term will be to ensure that Irish farming and the agri-food sector is at the heart of an evolving high-value food market, which is focussed on quality, competitiveness and innovation.  This is at the core of Government strategy, as evidenced by the National Development Plan 2007-2013, AgriVision 2015 and the Partnership Agreement Towards 2016.</P>
        <P>An important element of this strategy was the Dairy Investment Fund launched in 2007.  My Department provided funding of &euro;114 million towards investment in dairy processing and a total of 19 capital investment projects were approved and awarded Government grant assistance under the Fund, which will generate an estimated capital spend of &euro;286 million at full production.  The purpose of the Fund is to increase the efficiency of the main dairy outputs by supporting the upgrading of plant and buildings.  This will assist operators in capturing new business in global markets and in developing new valued added products.</P>
        <P>At EU level, one of the CAP Health Check proposals is to increase milk quotas in order to provide a &lsquo;soft landing&rsquo; towards the abolition of quotas in 2015.  This will provide Irish and EU dairy farmers with a new opportunity to respond to global demand.  I have consistently pressed <Col N="743"/>for increased quotas to allow Irish dairy farmers to avail of those opportunities to increase production and competitiveness and capture new market share.</P>

	<P>I am well aware of the impact of the measures introduced in the 2009 Budget for my Department. The Budget was framed against the background of a serious deterioration in the public finances and required difficult decisions to be made on the allocation of the resources available. I made these decisions in the best interests of the sector following detailed analysis of my Department&rsquo;s programme of expenditure and careful consideration of the options available. </P>
        <P>Despite the economic and budgetary situation, funding of &euro;1.8 billion gross is provided for my Department in the 2009 Budget. When combined with EU funding and co-funding of about &euro;1.4 billion next year, this represents very substantial funding for the support and development of the agri-food sector.  In framing the details of the Budget for my Department, my priority was to ensure that the available resources were targeted on a range of measures that would maintain the productive capacity of the agriculture, food, forestry and fisheries sector. My objective is to continue to develop the sector within the budgetary constraints to ensure that it is well positioned to achieving its full potential and benefit from future economic growth.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 230 and 231 together.</P>
        <P>The agri-food and fish, or &lsquo;bio-sector&rsquo; remains Ireland&rsquo;s largest indigenous employer with a unique regional spread and accounts for over 32% of our net foreign earnings from primary and manufacturing industries.  The sector is characterized by resilience and a capacity to adapt to meet new challenges and opportunities in changing times following the reform of the CAP.  In 2007, food and drinks exports reached a record level of &euro;8.62 billion a 5% increase on the <Col N="744"/>previous year.  Growth was driven primarily by the dairy and drinks sectors resulting in the export target in the Asian strategy target being reached ahead of time.</P>
        <P>The challenges this year are even greater, particularly in relation to currency.  The Agri-Vision 2015 Report and the Cawley Report have both set out strategies for developing consumer focused, competitive and sustainable sectors capable of meeting the challenges of more liberalised markets and broader societal demands. They identify the delivery of safe, high-quality, nutritious food, produced in a sustainable manner in high value markets as the optimum road for the future of the Irish food industry in the light of the changes which have already taken place or are anticipated over the next decade.</P>
        <P>The Action Plan to implement the Agri-Vision 2015 Report sets out over 160 actions in a coherent implementation strategy.   Over three-quarters of the actions are completed or being implemented on an ongoing basis and these range from on farm measures including huge investment in REPS and particular support for suckler cow producers to support for investment and research and marketing.</P>
        <P>At EU level we are engaged in negotiation on the Health Check of the Common Agricultural Policy. Earlier this week, I met with the EU Farm Commissioner and the EU President to reiterate my priorities in this regard, in particular appropriate market management arrangements to ensure a &ldquo;soft landing&rdquo; in preparation for the expiry of milk quotas in 2015; further simplification of the single payment scheme and cross compliance; national discretion in the operation of the single payment scheme, and  supports funded from the single payment ceiling.</P>
        <P>We will continue to pursue policies with stakeholders to develop agriculture and the food production sector in ways, which build sustainably on the progress achieved so far.</P>

	<P>To encourage the cultivation of energy crops, my Department introduced a number of new incentives in 2007 including a new National Energy Crop Premium of &euro;80 per hectare to supplement the EU Premium of &euro;45 per hectare available under the EU Energy Crops Scheme. The Department also launched a new Bioenergy Scheme in February 2007 to provide establishment grants worth &euro;1,450 per hectare to farmers to grow willow and miscanthus as a renewable source of energy. So far 1,700 hectares of willow and miscanthus have been planted under the Scheme.  Some 5,000 hectares of energy crops were planted in 2008 under the EU Energy Crops Scheme. The varieties of energy crops sown include Oilseed Rape, Miscanthus, Willow, Oats and Wheat. </P>

	<P>The development of multi-school campus arrangements is a stated policy of my Department where conditions are such that this can be achieved. A number of factors have to be taken into account before such arrangements could proceed such as overall accommodation requirements in a centre or area, availability and size of site, value for money, planning permission etc. It is expected that these arrangements will be a feature of the educational landscape into the future with a more signifi<Col N="746"/>cant range of school types on one site.

	<P>The school to which the Deputy refers applied to my Department in 1999 for additional accommodation.  At a meeting with the Department at that time, the school proposed a greenfield site solution to its accommodation needs because the existing site could not facilitate the extent of extra accommodation needed.  A technical examination of the site confirmed this position.  As a result, the Department agreed to the school&rsquo;s proposal and the intention is to provide the school with an 8 classroom building with appropriate ancillary accommodation on a site which has been acquired by the school authority.  In August 2000, a Design Team was appointed and the project is now in the advanced stages of architectural planning.</P>
        <P>Progress on the new school will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the Department&rsquo;s capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.  In the meantime, my Department approved a prefab for the school to meet its September 2008 needs.  I have agreed to meet a deputation from the school on 13th November next at 2.30 pm in Leinster House.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 245, 246, 247, 248, 255 and 256 together.</P>
        <P>The specific information requested by the Deputy in relation to the detailed staffing allocation of the schools in question for the academic year 2009/10 cannot be determined until the allocation process has fully concluded.  There is nothing exceptional in this.  The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  At primary level the final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.</P>
        <P>Schools are currently returning data to my Department in relation to their enrolment as of 30 September.  My Department has commenced processing this data although all schools have not yet made their returns.  The allocation processes including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year.</P>

        <Quest> if, with reference to his D&aacute;il speech of 15 October 2008, he will explain in detail the sections of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 that are being deferred until after 2010; when he expects each of these sections to be implemented in full; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the following sections of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act have been commenced &mdash; 1, 2, 14(1)(a), 14(1)(c), 14(2) to 14(4), 19 to 37 and 40 to 53.  These sections are mainly concerned with the establishment of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and with promoting an inclusive approach to the education of children with special needs.</P>
        <P>The sections of the EPSEN Act that have been deferred are those mainly concerned with the assessment of need process,  preparation and review of individual education plans (IEPs) and appeals in relation to these areas.  A small number of sections refer to interaction between the NCSE and health boards (HSE).  The full list of deferred sections is &mdash; 3 to 13, 14(1)(b), 14(1)(d), 14(1)(e), 14(1)(f), 15 to 18, 38 and 39.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to commence the EPSEN Act incrementally by age cohort, therefore the provisions of the Act especially regarding assessments and IEPs will have to be commenced for all children at the same time.  This imposes a requirement to have the necessary systems and trained personnel in place to deliver, for all children, on the entitlements arising from the Act.  To do this, the NCSE report identified a requirement for incremental additional investment over a period of 4 years of up to &euro;235m per annum across the education and health sectors.  My Department&rsquo;s opinion is that the level of investment required would be greater than that.</P>
        <P>In the light of the current financial circumstances, it is therefore not possible to proceed with implementation.  In the current economic circumstances it is also not possible to state when implementation will occur.  However, services for children with special educational needs will still be available on a non-statutory basis and will continue to be enhanced and strengthened in preparation for the full implementation of the Act at a later date.</P>

	<P>DEIS, (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP).  The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the Inspectorate.</P>
        <P>A review mechanism was put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme.  The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.  As a result of the identification and review processes, 673 primary and 203 second-level schools were invited to participate in the programme.  The school referred to by the Deputy was not identified for inclusion in the programme nor did it make an application for a review.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The planning and organising of school bus routes is an operational matter for Bus &Eacute;ireann.  School bus routes are planned in such a way as to ensure that, as far as possible, eligible pupils have a reasonable level of service while at the same time, ensuring that school transport vehicles are fully utilised in an efficient and cost effective manner.</P>
        <P>A change to an existing route may be necessary for operational reasons or to reflect changing travel patterns in terms of numbers and location of pupils seeking transport.  Such changes could affect the location of pick-up points, the timetable of the service, and travelling and waiting times for some children. However, where changes are necessary, services are generally planned in such a way that these children will have a service within the guidelines of the school transport schemes.  If the Deputy has any specific case in mind, my Department will be pleased to have it investigated.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 258 to 260, inclusive, together.</P><Col N="751"/>
        <P>Figures available indicate that about 30% of the allocation for school transport is being expended on transport, including taxis and grants for children with special needs. The allocation for school transport in 2008 is &euro;175.2 million.  A breakdown of expenditure on taxis and private vehicles is not readily available for the past five years. This type of transport provision will be considered for some children with special needs for whom the general school transport arrangements are unsuitable.</P>
        <P>The number of taxis engaged in the past years has increased from about 250 in 2004 to over 700 in 2008. Some of these taxis would be catering for more than one pupil. In addition grants were paid to over 440 families who use their private vehicles to transport children with special needs to an educational centre.  The cost of employing escorts to cater for children with special needs, whose care requirements are such as to necessitate continuous support, has increased significantly in line with the growth in that service. At present, there are about 1,200 escorts employed at an annual cost of about &euro;13 million.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Notwithstanding the increase of &euro;302 million in the education budget for 2009, which is a real achievement in the current economic climate, a number of tough and difficult decisions had to be taken. These decisions included reducing the level of language support teachers from a maximum of six extra teachers per school to a maximum of two teachers per school, as was the case before 2007.  However, the budget measures also provide for some alleviation for the position of those schools where there is a significant concentration of newcomer pupils as a proportion of the overall enrolment. This will be done on a case by case basis.</P>
        <P>The allocation process for language support teachers is an annual one and existing provision is not rolled over automatically. Schools will be applying afresh in the spring and early summer of 2009 for the 2009/2010 school year, based on their assessment of the prospective needs of existing pupils and any new pupils they are enrolling. The position of schools making application to the Department, including those referred to by the Deputy, will fall to be considered at that stage.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> his views on whether it is value for money to cut funding to the programme for the Centre for Talented Youth in Ireland; if the savings to be made justify the removal of this programme which targets the best and brightest students; if this cut ties in with stated policy to support and promote mathematics and science amongst students; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>Notwithstanding the increase of &euro;302 million in the Education budget for 2009, which is a real achievement in the current <Col N="754"/>economic climate, a number of tough and difficult decisions had to be taken. These decisions included the decision to discontinue the annual funding of &euro;97,000 that the Department made available  to the Centre for Talented Youth (CTYI) at Dublin City University.</P>
        <P>While it is appreciated that the discontinuation of this funding will impact on the Centre, given the current volatile and challenging economic climate, difficult choices had to be made in order to contain public sector spending.  Tax revenues are down significantly and Government expenditure has to reflect this reality. The priority of this budget was to focus on measures to channel as much as was possible of the available resources to the direct funding of our schools.</P>

        <asker>Deputy Mary Upton</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> if it is appropriate to abolish grants for second level schools in respect of physics and chemistry in view of the fact that the promotion of science and technology is identified as a priority in ensuring the uptake of these subjects at third level; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The budget for 2009 must be considered against the background of a difficult international economic situation.  While education remains a priority for the Government, it has been necessary to curtail expenditure in some areas, in order that resources may be targeted more efficiently at areas of disadvantage.  While the grant for physics and chemistry is to be abolished, I am confident that schools will continue to encourage students to study science and technology subjects at second level and consider courses in those fields at third level.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation 2006 to 2013 sets out a range of measures to further strengthen science teaching and learning and improve the uptake of senior cycle Physics and Chemistry. These include ensuring that the project based hands-on investigative approach now in place at junior cycle is extended to senior cycle, that the appropriate type of assessment is used and that there is an emphasis on the inter-disciplinary nature of science in society.</P>
        <P>Other aspects of the Plan include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />reviewing the implementation of the primary science curriculum to ensure its effectiveness in stimulating interest and awareness in science at a very young age,  strengthening teacher training in this area</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />reforming maths and Leaving Certificate Physics and Chemistry curricula</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />promotion of science initiatives in Transition Year; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the provision of information and brochures on science opportunities and careers, linking effectively with school guidance services</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">Taken together, the comprehensive set of measures provided for in the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation will build on the improvements made in recent years and ensure even greater support for science education.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the cutbacks in education announced in budget 2009 will result in the loss of a class teacher at a school (details supplied) in County Limerick and that this will <Col N="755"/>reduce the full-time staff from eight to seven teachers so that there will no longer be a teacher per class and all classes will be in excess of 30 pupils; if he will make special provision for this school; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The specific information requested by the Deputy in relation to the detailed staffing allocation of the school in question for the academic year 2009/10 cannot be determined until the allocation process has fully concluded. There is nothing exceptional in this. The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. At primary level the final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.</P>
        <P>Schools are currently returning data to my Department in relation to their enrolment as of 30 September. My Department has commenced processing this data although all schools have not yet made their returns. The allocation processes including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year.</P>

	<P>The make up and timing of further school bundles in my Department&rsquo;s PPP school building programme will be determined by my Department in consultation with the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA). The issues to be considered in the timing and bundling of these schools include site availability for each school, geographical spread and the estimated total cost of the proposed school bundle.  My Department is examining the feasibility of including a number of schools in the 3rd Bundle of school projects to be procured via Public Private Partnership. This examination is nearing completion and I will be making an announcement about the matter as quickly as possible.</P>
