	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 11, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The National Implementation Body, NIB, which has been in existence since the start of 2001, continues to meet as necessary to oversee delivery of the industrial peace and stability provisions in Towards 2016.  The NIB has met on a number of occasions recently to assist in the resolution of industrial disputes.  Meetings of the NIB also provide opportunities for informal discussions on some of the broader issues relating to the social partnership process and the industrial relations climate generally.</P>
        <P>With regard to Aer Lingus, Deputies will be aware of the extensive processes, both internally between the parties and with the assistance of the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery, which have taken place in respect of transforming the company to meet current and future challenges.  Having considered the concerns expressed by the parties regarding industrial relations issues, the NIB proposed a process, detailed in its statement of 16 November last, which included an analysis on its behalf of various elements of the change agenda to be undertaken by the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, using the technical assistance, as necessary, provided by Grant Thornton so as to clarify the scope and value of a number of issues in dispute.  The NIB invited the parties to engage meaningfully with each phase of the process and requested that they desist from taking any action which might hinder the effectiveness of the process.</P>
        <P>Informed by the outcome of the intensive discussions facilitated by the LRC, the NIB met again the parties before Christmas to assess progress on the process agreed in mid-November.  In its statement of 21 December 2007, the NIB noted that the negotiations on change facilitated by the LRC and those on arrangements at Shannon Airport had resulted in the identification by Aer Lingus management and SIPTU of savings equivalent to those being sought under the programme for continuous improvement, estimated to be in the order of &euro;10 million.</P>
        <P>The NIB also recommended further engagement on the flexibility and mobility agenda and the Shannon issue, and it made other specific recommendations regarding cabin crew, pilots, IAESA, the craft group, future recruitment and grading structures and Towards 2016 and other increases.</P>
        <P>I am encouraged that the parties have been working towards resolving their difficulties.  This joint problem-solving approach will pay dividends for the company, the employees, the travel<Col N="3"/>ling public and the development of Ireland&rsquo;s aviation sector.  I join the NIB and the Labour Court in emphasising the importance for the company and employees alike of managing change through partnership, consultation and agreement, and the development of appropriate structures to promote such an approach and to facilitate the speedy resolution of disputes when they arise.</P>
        <P>Deputies will be aware that the terms of the pay agreement for the private sector under Towards 2016 are due to expire shortly and accordingly I expect that the next plenary meeting to review the agreement this month will provide the basis for the initiation of formal talks, including those on a new pay round.  As provided for under Towards 2016, implementation of the benchmarking report will be discussed by the public service employers and unions in the context of the arrangements on pay and conditions to be put in place on the expiry of the current public service pay agreement.</P>
        <P>In parallel and as agreed under Towards 2016, the steering group, representing Government and each of the social partner pillars, continues to have overall responsibility for the management of the implementation of the Towards 2016 agreement as it applies to the wider non-pay issues.  The most recent meeting of the steering group, the fifth meeting under Towards 2016, took place on 29 January 2008.  The main agenda items for this meeting were a presentation by Professor Brendan Drumm of the Health Service Executive on integrated health services and a presentation by the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Social and Family Affairs on the older people life cycle stage.</P>
        <P>Quarterly plenary meetings, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, will continue during 2008 to review, monitor and report on overall progress in the implementation of the ten-year framework agreement.  Regular progress reports are presented at these plenary meetings.  The most recent progress report was published in November 2007 and is available in the Oireachtas Library.  The next plenary meeting will take place in Dublin Castle on Friday, 15 February.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Taoiseach about the timetable for the proposed national pay talks.  What is the Government&rsquo;s reaction to the recent benchmarking report, which delivered in some cases but did not deliver in a significant number of cases?  Does the Taoiseach believe it creates a great difficulty for him and his Government as members accepted the recommendations of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector?</P>
        <P>These recommendations awarded a range of between &euro;36,000 and &euro;38,000 in salary increases for Ministers.  At the same time, frontline nurses who were encouraged to put their claim before the benchmarking body prior to the general election found the benchmarking report did not deliver bar in a number of nursing cases.  This will make the pay talks extremely difficult given the downturn in the economy, the increase in the cost of living, rising unemployment and leaking confidence in Irish investment.</P>
        <P>What is the Government&rsquo;s plan to arrest that lack of confidence and how is it proposed to enter the next round of pay talks?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is hoped that we can move on the commencement of the talks shortly.  The terms of the pay agreement for the private sector under Towards 2016 are due to expire shortly.  I expect that the next plenary meeting which will review the agreement this month will provide the basis for the initiation of formal talks, including those related to the new pay round.  The preliminary discussions will take place during February and it will be into March before we get into the serious discussions on the issue, but a lot of preparatory work hopefully will be done if we get agreement at the February talks to enter into them. </P><Col N="4"/>
        <P>The Deputy has asked several questions on the benchmarking report.  As provided for under Towards 2016, implementation of the benchmarking report will be discussed by the public service employers and unions in the context of the arrangements on pay and conditions to be put in place on the expiry of the new current public service pay agreement.  We have learned from long experience that while these talks can be onerous in terms of time and effort, the benefits nationally of reaching agreement, in terms of certainty and industrial peace, far outweigh the burden on those who are involved in them.  In preparing for the forthcoming negotiations, it is important that expectations are kept in line with the economic realities we face here and that are being faced throughout the organised world.  National partnership agreements have served us well and I hope that what is a very good and tried and tested approach can once again be relied upon in helping to meet the emerging challenges that we face as a small open economy.  We can see all over Europe the type of pay settlements that were reached, involving few if any increases at all, in country after country in the latter part of last year and the early part of this year.</P>
        <P>Regarding the nurses, the first point is that every organisation was asked to put its case to the benchmarking process.  All parts of the public sector and the wider public service were asked to do so.  The national implementation body&rsquo;s intervention in the nurses&rsquo; dispute was timely and produced comprehensive proposals to address the issues that were in dispute at that stage between the Irish Nurses Organisation, INO, the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, and the Health Service Executive, HSE.  These proposals were the result of many weeks of intense engagement with the parties within the social partnership process in the latter part of 2006 and the early months of 2007.  The proposals were designed to be fair to nurses, to other parties in the social partnership agreements and to taxpayers through cost neutrality, and to ensuring that they involved no reduction in services for patients.</P>
        <P>Nurses were not promised that benchmarking would deliver a pay increase &mdash; nobody was.  Rather they were told that it was the proper way to have their claims addressed.  The parties to the dispute made submissions to the benchmarking body and the body dealt very comprehensively with the nurses&rsquo; claim, probably in more detail than any other case.</P>
        <P>The report went into substantial depth and detail on the nurses&rsquo; claim which it did not do for other groups in the public service.  The benchmarking body examined 38 healthcare sector grades and recommended pay increases for ten of those, including the four senior nursing grades, the clinical nurse manager grade which got 6.8%, the assistant director of nursing in non-band 1 hospitals which got 10%, the director of nursing in band 3 hospitals, 10%, and the director of nursing in band 1 hospitals, 10%.  These increases also applied to 17 other nursing grades, linked to those four grades, which include the directors and assistant directors of mental health nursing, the directors and assistant directors of public health nursing and the advanced nurse practitioners.  A total of 1,800 people in senior nursing posts will benefit from pay increases of up to 10% at a full year cost of approximately &euro;12 million arising from the benchmarking increase.  While the nursing unions may feel that not every issue was helped, any fair examination would show that they achieved far more than other sectors.  That is the reality of the position.</P>
        <P>I answered a question on the pay review last week but it is important to note that the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector, the public service benchmarking bodies and the reports and recommendations have to be considered together.</P>
        <P>That said, the benchmarking body reported five years ago whereas the review body carried out its last analysis in 2000.  Consequently, the same period is not being covered.  As another pay review body is not due to be convened until 2011, effectively this will have been the only <Col N="5"/>review body for an entire decade, since its predecessor.  This should be noted clearly and if the increases are larger, it is because they are for a far longer and more sustained period.  It is also important to note that when making comparisons between comparable public and private sector jobs, the review body made an adjustment of 15% to allow for the advantageous pension rights of public sector workers.</P>
        <P>I do not see the benchmarking report as being other than difficult.  As I noted last week, Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s views the last time were highly critical.  I refer to his point that far higher increases of 8.9% were paid last time.  However, that was based on what was happening in the comparable private sector grades during the late 1990s and earlier this decade.  This time, the examination and analysis of the equivalent grades did not show such an increase.  The position differed at the top end of the private sector, which showed very large increases, albeit for an extremely small number of people.  Such increases do not go through the organisations and this has been highlighted clearly in the report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not want the Taoiseach to go back over the higher remuneration background.  The question I asked pertained to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s point regarding the forthcoming pay negotiations, namely, that expectations should be in line with economic circumstances.  Although the Government has accepted salary increases of between &euro;36,000 and &euro;38,000 for Cabinet members, front-line nurses who work in overcrowded accident and emergency departments and so on were not awarded anything in the benchmarking process.  Will this not pose a difficulty for the Government?  Moreover, other workers experience daily increases in economic pressure, financial stresses and the cost of living, such as a 50% increase in the price of milk, and so on.  It will be highly difficult to keep expectations in line with economic circumstances when ordinary workers see the outcome of the higher remuneration recommendations being accepted by the Government.  What is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s view on wage restraint?  Does he have a view on the level at which it should be pitched?  Does he consider that his opinions regarding expectations can be met?</P>
        <P>I wish to ask a different question in respect of Aer Lingus.  Most Members, to a greater or lesser extent, have an interest in the Irish language.  The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has made highly relevant announcements in this regard including proposals to send teachers to universities in America, site a university at Ballyferriter and so on, all of which are grand plans.  However, the Government owns 23% of Aer Lingus on the people&rsquo;s behalf.  Was it informed of an instruction given by Aer Lingus to all pilots and flight personnel to the effect that all announcements flying out of Belfast were to be made in English only?</P>
        <P>I raised this question with the Minister last week, who replied he had no function in the matter.  While Aer Lingus no longer is the national airline in that sense, the Government is a 23% shareholder.  I fly to Brussels with Aer Lingus occasionally to attend meetings and inevitably short formal announcements are made such as, &ldquo;F&aacute;ilte romhaibh chuig an mBruis&eacute;il&rdquo; or whatever.  The Taoiseach, quite appropriately, visited First Minister Paisley recently as issues arise in respect of cross-Border activities, Scots Gaelic, the Irish language, promotion of our different cultures and such matters.  I find it extraordinary that Aer Lingus, the carrier of the shamrock throughout the world for many years, would issue an instruction to its flight personnel and pilots that all announcements are to be made in English only.  Did Aer Lingus consult the Government on this matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the first issue, that of the review body, I accept what Deputy Kenny said and I will not go back over it all again.  For almost 40 years, the function of the body has been to advise the Government on the general levels of remuneration at the higher level so the Government, political officeholders, senior people in State bodies and agencies, local authorities, health boards, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces and the Judiciary would be <Col N="6"/>dealt with independently of their own system.  In every one of the reports down through the years, the increases have been implemented, but on a phased basis.  In this case, we have made a change in that regard  in that nothing will be paid in the first year and the remainder will be phased over a three-year period.  This, in effect, means that by the time the process comes to its conclusion, it will have covered a 12-year period.  I do not believe that is an unreasonable position.</P>
        <P>The review body&rsquo;s examination was based on the lowest quartile and took into account comparable grades in the private sector.  I agree with its focus on the lowest grades because if one focused on the top grades in the private sector, far bigger increases would have been recommended.  There would be very few people in this category in the private sector but greater numbers in the public sector and therefore the review body was totally right to use the lower quartile.</P>
        <P>It is seven full years since the last report was produced.  It was originally intended that the period should be four years.  One sees what happens when a Government extends the period for another three years; the increases look bigger.  The review should at least coincide with the benchmarking process for the time being because the longer the period between reviews, the greater the increases recommended.  Both the private and public sector unions understand the system and the position and that the two are related so I do not regard this issue as presenting a difficulty.</P>
        <P>On Aer Lingus, Deputy Kenny knows that at all our meetings, including those of the North-South bodies and east-west bodies, those who are fluent in the Irish language use it.  Even those of us who are not are using the c&uacute;pla focal.  It is totally accepted by all the parties in the North.  Some people of the Unionist tradition pride themselves, in respect of their Scottish language and Irish, that they are well able to use their &ldquo;c&uacute;pla focal&rdquo; and I admire them for that.  Recently at the launch of the Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael function, Minister Poots made an effort to speak Irish that impressed everybody.  Why Aer Lingus would believe it is necessary to drop Irish, I do not know.  We were not informed and I do not believe it is any great hardship to anybody.  In any of the meetings I have had, I heard nobody objecting to the effect that Irish should be dropped.  Maybe somebody I do not know about did so.  I agree with Deputy Kenny that Aer Lingus is the national airline and its whole profile should be based around that.  I do not believe the few sentences would harm anyone and I do not believe anybody would object to them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>This batch of questions covers the work of the National Implementation Body and the prospects for the next round of social partnership pay talks.  Has the Taoiseach heard comments by a number of trade union leaders in recent days to the effect that there is no great point in their entering new talks on pay in circumstances where commitments made under the previous agreement, Towards 2016, have not yet been implemented by the Government?  In particular, I draw attention to the complaint that the occupational pensions part of the directive on the transfer of undertakings has not yet been given effect in Irish law.  A fund that was to be established to assist workers doing part-time night courses, including degree courses, has not been established and the Government has not yet published the employment rights compliance Bill, which was to have been published before the end of 2007.</P>
        <P>On workers&rsquo; rights and compliance therewith, a story in last week&rsquo;s newspapers claimed workers on the new Irish Ferries vessel are to be paid &euro;4 per hour.  The Taoiseach will recall the row there was when Irish Ferries sacked its entire Irish workforce to replace it with a workforce from outside the State.  At the time we were told these workers would be paid the <Col N="7"/>minimum wage.  However, several newspapers reported last week that the workers on the new vessel, the <i>Oscar Wilde</i>, which will run between France and Ireland, are being paid &euro;4 an hour, less than half the national minimum wage.</P>
        <P>Can the Taoiseach confirm that this company is now paying its workers &euro;4 an hour?  Where does this leave the national minimum wage?  Where does it leave the enforcement of employee rights?  Where does it leave the work of the national implementation body and the partnership talks?  It is scandalous that any workers in this country or associated with this country would be paid that appallingly low rate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware the trade unions have raised some issues that they are not happy with.  I am aware of the fees issue and some other issues.  I am also aware there are many issues that were not in the agreement but which have arisen subsequently and been implemented.  That is the normal cut and thrust that goes on.</P>
        <P>On the legislation, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, has been ready to go with the employment law compliance Bill for some considerable time.  There are ongoing discussions with some of the unions because they want to move beyond what was agreed.  This is what is holding back the legislation.  That is not to say that the unions do not have some valid points to make.  The Bill is on the A list.  It is a very good Bill and the Minister continues to deal with the issue.</P>
        <P>On the compliance issue, there is not just one Bill but three.  We have reached some good understandings on good, protective legislation that is good for employment law.  We have moved a long way even from the strong legislation already in place.  The social partnership agreement has allowed us to achieve that.  I would like to see that legislation enacted in the course of this year; there is no reason it should not be.</P>
        <P>On the national minimum wage, I remember the Irish Ferries dispute well because I was involved in the discussions on that and the surrounding issues, such as the registering of companies, flags of convenience and so on.  The national minimum wage is binding on Irish companies.  It has been determined by the Labour Court and the requirements in this regard have been set out clearly by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Irish companies know that their employees, regardless of nationality, are entitled to the minimum wage.  I do not know whether Irish Ferries is trying to operate as a non-Irish company because I am not familiar with the latest circumstances.  The Minister, Deputy Martin, and the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, Deputy Kelleher, have been dealing with this issue.  The Irish statute position is clear and well tested &mdash; the employees of Irish companies, regardless of nationality, should be paid the national minimum wage.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate what the Taoiseach said about the general run of this.  However, this comes down to what happens when a clear case of worker exploitation comes to the surface.  By any standards, &euro;4 an hour, less than half the minimum wage, is just out of court.  It is exploitation in anybody&rsquo;s language.  In these circumstances, where the company running this service sacked its entire Irish workforce to replace it with lower paid workers, the agencies of the State must be particularly vigilant to ensure it does not get away with it.  The story that this company is paying &euro;4 per hour has been in the air for over a week.  What steps have been taken to establish the facts or otherwise of it?  I appreciate the Taoiseach does not know.  An employment rights authority was supposed to be established under the Employment Law Compliance Bill, but that is not in place.  The legislation governing agency workers has not been introduced and the Irish Government is one <Col N="8"/>of three governments which have been blocking the agency workers directive for some time at European level.  </P>
        <P>We have a practical case here, on which I wish to focus.  It is all very well to talk in general terms about workers rights, levels of pay, talks, partnership and so on, but this is a hard case where 500 workers on board this vessel are being paid &euro;4 per hour.  What is being done to investigate that and to enforce the national minimum wage in this case?  Is there a loophole in our law which allows the company to get away with this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Let me be very clear about this.  The national minimum wage is a statutory one which is fixed in a process in the Labour Court and which takes account of this country&rsquo;s unique partnership arrangement.  It has been the case since the Labour Act 1946 that employers, the Government, as an employer, and the unions adhere to that.  It is the law and it is illegal for anyone to breach that.  There is now a very large inspectorate with strong legislation being very much enforced over the past few years to examine, investigate and prosecute cases like that.</P>
        <P>As I said, I am not familiar with the latest issues around Irish Ferries.  Is it operating as an Irish company?  Is it an Irish company?  From where is it operating?  These are the issues the inspectorate will examine.  What happened the last time was that it was using flags of convenience and was not operating as an Irish company.  We do not have enforcement powers in regard to a company that is not Irish.  We do not regulate the Spanish fishing fleet that comes into the south west of Cork.  We do not enforce the rights of workers who arrive at docks in Dublin, Cork or elsewhere.  We do not have jurisdiction over that.  We have jurisdiction over, and can enforce, the Irish minimum wage, which is the highest minimum wage in Europe and the only one which is untaxable in the OECD.  We do not have powers of enforcement in regard to non-Irish companies.  We do not have that jurisdiction.  Our laws are very clear in this regard.</P>
        <P>On agency workers, I answered questions on this matter recently but I will do so again.  The Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, Deputy Billy Kelleher, answered questions here on this issue in December and on a number of other occasions last year.  Our system of industrial relations is a voluntary one between the social partners and is fixed by cases in the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission.  We deal with this in a voluntary way.  If we change the system under any directive, it does not suit that system.  We should not be beholden because in one case it is good but in another it is bad and sign up to any directive which takes away the implementation of how we conduct industrial relations.  That is a very important issue.  We have held this position for 62 years.  I would oppose that system and that is what the argument in the debate is about.  It is not that anyone is against it but it is to ensure that the participation in and the voluntarist nature of Irish industrial relations, which was enunciated in 1946 and which has worked quite effectively since then in good days and bad days, is maintained and that a diktat from a directive does not take away the voluntarist nature of it.  Deputy Gilmore knows this better than most people.  That is the issue.  I think sensible proposals will be worked out between our social partners in this, but it should be the social partners who are involved.  We should not be taken by what others believe is a good broad code for Europe as it does not take account of how we operate our system.  That is a fundamental point of negotiation and we should not move away from that.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach makes it sound as if Irish Ferries have nothing to do with this, as if the company was from Honolulu.  Irish Ferries are as Irish as Croagh Patrick.  The company may have found a way of distancing itself from Irish law, especially Irish employment law.  However, it is the privatised successor of the old B&amp;I ferry company.  There have <Col N="9"/>been stories in recent months about the ownership of the company and the Irish players who were involved in it.  By any standards, &euro;4 per hour is not an acceptable rate of pay.  The company is in clear breach of the national minimum wage and the Taoiseach rightly stated that anybody paying under that wage is acting illegally.  It would appear that this company has found a way to circumvent Irish employment law in order to pay these workers &euro;4 per hour.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is the responsibility of the Government to enact whatever legislation and regulation is required to ensure that this does not happen.  Some of the legislation, which the trade unions complain has not been implemented, relates to this area.  This includes the enforcement of employment regulations and employment law, as well as the protection of the rights of agency workers.  The Taoiseach should ask the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to give a bit of urgency to this.  I do not think that anybody in this country finds it acceptable that workers who are sailing ships in and out of this country every second day should be paid wages of this kind.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister informs me that the National Employment Rights Authority is examining this issue.  That body exists on an interim basis and it will have statutory effect with the enactment of the employment law compliance Bill.  The issue is about jurisdiction and that matter is being examined.  We do not have the information on what the company is paying its staff, but the issue is still about the statutory jurisdiction of the company and how it has structured itself.  The National Employment Rights Authority has jurisdiction in this area and those matters are being investigated, as is the recent story.</P>
        <P>Even with new legislation and with European legislation, we still cannot achieve certainty about some of these companies.  This is also happening in other areas, where companies are using flags of convenience and registration from outside the EU.  We have not had many of those companies here, but there are several in Europe that are engaging in this.  The powers of the National Employment Rights Authority will be very strong in dealing with registered companies in our jurisdiction, but we are in a different legal battle when they operate outside the jurisdiction.  I cannot confirm what rate these workers are being paid because it is not clear yet.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach has indicated that he has just been conferring with his Minister of State.  Is the Taoiseach aware that only last Wednesday, in response to a parliamentary question, the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, attempted to defend the Government&rsquo;s position in the European Union in blocking the directive to regulate employment agencies?  In his reply, he claimed it would not be in the industrial relations tradition of this country.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the conduct of employment agencies in cutting wages, exploiting workers and forcing many other workers onto the dole queues is in the tradition only of William Martin Murphy?</P>
        <P>When does the Taoiseach propose to take the relevant steps to tackle the gross abuses being carried out by employment agencies?  Given that the conduct of these agencies is setting worker against worker and subverting the hard won rights and pay agreements, a succession of which the Taoiseach was party to, I have to ask whose side is he on?  What national tradition was the Minister of State referring to in his reply to the parliamentary question only last Wednesday?</P>
        <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the intervention of the National Implementation Body in the Aer Lingus dispute was necessitated as a result of an attempt by management to impose wage cuts?  Does he recall that when the whole debate in relation to the former national airline was taking place here, workers at Aer Lingus clearly indicated that a consequence of privatisation would be wage and job cuts and that voices in this House, then and still opposed to privatisation, cautioned that this was exactly what would materialise?  Is the Taoiseach aware that <Col N="10"/>SIPTU has referred the pay freeze imposed unilaterally by Aer Lingus on its employees to the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court and has clearly stated that it is in breach of the national agreement, Towards 2016?  What is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reaction to the situation pertaining at Aer Lingus?</P>
        <P>This is probably the first opportunity the Taoiseach has had since the resumption of the D&aacute;il to state his position categorically.  I ask him to make it absolutely clear to those in F&Aacute;S who have proposed a reduction in the minimum wage, as well as to all interested parties, including, first and foremost, workers and the trade union movement, that his Government will not countenance any such reduction and let F&Aacute;S take heed of that fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take the Deputy&rsquo;s questions in reverse order.  We should all be proud of the fact that we have a very good national minimum wage in this county.  We should be even more proud that this is the only country in the OECD to have a minimum wage that is high and keeps a large proportion of the workforce out of the tax net.  No consideration whatever is being given to reducing the minimum wage. </P>
        <P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s first point regarding the legal standing, the national employment rights authority is working on an interim basis.  The employment law compliance Bill, when it is enacted, will establish a new employment rights authority.  This is part of the legislation we are bringing forward in this area, which will compromise three Bills, to strengthen the law and make improvements that have been negotiated with the social partners as part of the national agreement.</P>
        <P>On the employment agency regulation Bill, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has correctly given the view of the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher.   It is a view I expressed in reply to an earlier question.  The purpose of the employment agency regulation Bill which is before the House is to regulate the employment agency sector by the establishment of a statutory code of practice setting out the standards for the sector and the establishment of a monetary agency committee.  Representatives of the social partners, the employment agency sector and Departments will oversee adherence to a statutory code of practice.  That is the intention.  There has been a protracted consultation process, as the Minister said last week.  The Ministers involved are considering certain proposals that have recently been submitted by the Department in the context of finalising the revised draft heads of the Bill.  Parliamentary advice has been received from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office in regard to the extent of licensing of employment agencies, having regard to Article 40 of EU law and related matters.  Hopefully, the Bill will be enacted during the course of the year.</P>
        <P>The point I made earlier is that we have flexibilities and the voluntarist nature of industrial relations between employers and trade unions enables them to agree these issues in consultations.  That gives us considerable benefits and flexibilities in gaining employment here, in attracting foreign direct investment and in helping indigenous Irish companies to do so.  For us to slavishly follow what is a centralist approach, that is not in line with our industrial relations, is not the way to deal with these issues.  It is better that we negotiate with our people who are involved in these issues.  That gives us considerable advantages.  Union leaders and the private sector understand that and it is the reason we manage to negotiate, whether in the craft industry, the manufacturing industry or the international services industries, and win.  Quite frankly, from the time I was Minister for Labour, which is a long time ago, I have watched other countries try to get these binding agreements because they do not like what we have achieved in our voluntarist nature.  I have seen this game for a quarter of a century.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, and others to continue to be wise to the fact that we have something that is good and that wins us a lot of investment and we should not change that.  It is an <Col N="11"/>advantage for us.  However, that is not to condone exploitation, or those who abuse it or try to find a way around it.  That is not the issue.  Of course, I agree totally with all of what the Deputy and everybody else has said on that issue but we should not slavishly sign up to things that remove the kind of flexibilities and initiatives we have in place.  It is not what our workforce wants.</P>
        <P>As I said here last week, in the modern world from the time a product is dreamed up in a company to the time it hits the market place is 40 weeks.  The lifespan of most of the products in the wide ICT area is 18 months.  We must have a flexible system that can operate on that basis.  To do otherwise would be to throw away a considerable advantage that wins us all of these things.  I have no time for abusers or users or people who try to exploit others, whether Irish citizens or those who work here, and we will do anything we can in the law.  That somebody comes up with a centralised view, does not mean we should throw away what we have carefully nurtured in this country since the labour Act of the 1940s.</P>

        <asker>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest> if he will establish a register for certain small craft which would, as the Revenue Commissioners have suggested to his Department, be of considerable benefit to Revenue in controlling coastal smuggling, particularly drug smuggling; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[3872/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Mercantile Marine Act 1955 sets out the requirements for registering vessels in Ireland.  Irish-owned vessels over 15 net tons are required to be registered under the Act.  However, for vessels under 15 net tons, registration is voluntary and owners may register such a craft if they so wish.  Small leisure craft would fall into this category.</P>
        <P>The 1955 Act and the system of registration in Ireland are under review in my Department.  The comments received during an earlier consultation exercise are being taken into account in the deliberations on a proposed new regime.  One of the issues being considered is how best to improve provision for the registration of leisure craft, including jet skis and other small craft.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners have indicated their support for a revision of the current system of registration.  Following completion of the current phase of the review, they will be consulted, with other relevant parties, on new outline proposals to replace the existing regime.  It is intended that this consultation process will commence in March.  My officials will continue to develop more detailed proposals for the revision of the existing registration system, taking into account the outcome of the public consultation, with a view to submitting proposals for new legislation to Government by the end of the year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  The then Department responsible for the marine proposed in 2005 that there would be a register for certain small craft.  The Revenue Commissioners wrote to the Minister&rsquo;s Department last October stating they were deeply concerned about this issue and referring to coastal smuggling, in particular drug smuggling.  Deputies Flanagan and Ring will deal with the drug aspects of this issue for my party.</P>
        <P>As I understand it, Revenue has just one boat with which to police drug smugglers and much of its work is based on intelligence it receives.  We are not talking about small power boats or rowing boats but about craft with the capacity to operate some distance out to sea.  Is it not <Col N="12"/>the case that the drug seizures made represent the tip of the iceberg?  We welcome the seizures made in Cork last year but if all the craft capable of smuggling drugs are not registered and if the Minister does not act in line with the proposal made by his Department almost four years ago, we will not get to grips with the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The process of change is under way at present.  As is the nature with all such issues, it is necessary to have consultations, otherwise one would be accused of acting in a unilateral manner.  When the consultation process is complete, proposals will be put forward in line with the Deputy&rsquo;s request.  Following that, it will be necessary to put legislation in place.</P>
        <P>When drafting legislation of this nature, we must ensure, in line with the point made by the Deputy, that we do not end up in a situation where rowing boats, jet skis and so on are also caught by the measures.  It is a question of keeping a balance.</P>
        <P>We expect that all the consultations will be complete and the draft legislation in place by the end of the year.  I believe it will meet the Deputy&rsquo;s requirements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate that it is four long years since this proposal was made by the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  I do not accept the Department or the Minister are dealing effectively with this issue.  The country is awash with drugs.  It is predicted internationally that we are seizing less than 20% of the drugs that come into the country.  Given the nature of the west and south coasts, drugs are being brought in via the coastline and spread throughout Europe.  It is a serious issue and the Revenue Commissioners are very anxious in this regard.</P>
        <P>I am not happy with the Minister&rsquo;s response, which is inadequate in view of the seriousness of the issue and the drugs crisis, particularly with regard to cocaine.  People are dying on the streets of Dublin because of cocaine and gangsters are being murdered on the Costa del Sol as a result of the profits being made.  The Minister&rsquo;s response is too laid back and not good enough.  We do not accept he is doing his job properly.</P>

	<P>I have been in this job for approximately eight months.  As I said to the Deputy, this matter is in hand and legislation will be put in place.

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest> if he has been reviewing proposals for the introduction of a congestion charge in Dublin; if he has absolutely ruled out the introduction of a congestion charge in this regard pending the delivery of key Transport 21 projects for Dublin; his views on the value of congestion charges for dealing with problems of congestion; his evaluation of the quality bus corridor network roll-out; the proposals he will <Col N="13"/>being forward in 2008 to reduce the volume of cars passing through the Dublin canal cordon in the morning peak period; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[3525/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Though specific proposals for the introduction of congestion charging are not being considered at the moment, the National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012 states that consideration will be given to the potential introduction of fiscal measures, including road pricing or congestion charging, to reduce transport demand, once adequate supply-side infrastructure is in place.</P>
        <P>Congestion charges can incentivise the shift from personal car transport and have been successfully adopted in, for example, London and Stockholm.  On its introduction, the London congestion charge reduced congestion by 30% and traffic levels by 18% with a positive net annual revenue.  Similarly, the Stockholm congestion charge resulted in weekday traffic falling by 22% and a reduction of 12% in emissions.  That was introduced initially on a trial basis and was later adopted following a public referendum.</P>
        <P>The success of these schemes is partly due to the availability of public transport alternatives and democratic consensus, following public awareness campaigns.  Various types of charge are feasible, including cordon charges and area licences.  Technological development provides the means for more sophisticated and targeted pricing schemes.</P>
        <P>It is too early to say what, if any, fiscal measures are needed in Ireland.  The Government is committed to delivering a sustainable travel and transport action plan this year and I hope to initiate an intensive public consultation process on the issues in the near future.  The question of congestion reduction and measures in regard to restricting traffic volumes in Dublin city centre will be explored in more detail during that process.</P>
        <P>My Department is in the course of completing a value for money and policy review of the DTO traffic management scheme, which is the basis for the funding of the quality bus corridor, QBC, programme.  I will lay the review before the Oireachtas in the coming weeks.  This review will inform future decisions on the roll-out of the QBC programme under Transport 21, which contains a target of completing or advancing work on 14 QBCs and bus lanes in the greater Dublin area by year-end in the interest of making public transport more attractive to reduce the use of the private car in the city centre area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week at the Committee of Public Accounts, the Dublin city manager, Mr. John Tierney, seemed to refer to imminent congestion charges with regard to the big dig for the development of the Luas and metro.  Has the Minister received any firm proposal from the city manager or Dr. John Lynch of CIE, who referred to congestion charges in the past?  I note the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Transport, Deputy Frank Fahey, was reported in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> as being, with the Government, in favour of introducing congestion charges at an early date.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to London and Stockholm.  Milan, Singapore and Manhattan in New York are also heading in the same direction.  The one factor all these cities have which Dublin does not have is a multifaceted public transport system.  Surely it is pointless to discuss congestion charges given the huge deficit in public transport under Transport 21.</P>
        <P>Have long-range costings been made by the Department with regard to congestion charges or the carbon emissions that could be avoided?  If there were to be charges, is it an ambition of the Government to make them self-financing?  Will this be a cornerstone of any charge?</P>
        <P>The Minister stated there would be consultation on this matter.  When will it begin and who will be involved?  In Edinburgh and Stockholm the people were asked by referendum whether they wanted a congestion charge.  In Stockholm, the city area said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; but all the suburbs <Col N="14"/>said &ldquo;no&rdquo;, and the Swedish Government went ahead.  Edinburgh said &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Will people in Dublin or elsewhere be consulted when congestion charges or other road levies are proposed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has posed a range of specific questions as to what may or may not happen, but this matter has not been given detailed consideration in my Department.  While I am not avoiding the question, I cannot say how much it might cost or whether it will be revenue neutral or self-financing.  The issue has not been dealt with in that kind of detail, although it has been mentioned in the national climate change strategy and in a previous DTO study, both of which are available in the Department.  To my knowledge, however, we have not received any specific proposals on this matter from Dublin City Council or Dr. John Lynch of CIE.  The Deputy&rsquo;s point is well taken, it is not reasonable to talk about congestion charges when no alternative is in place.  However, we must see this in the context of all that will occur in Dublin city centre in the coming years.  Dublin City Council is examining a plan to manage traffic in central Dublin, which will have a major effect further out.  That will obviously require a large number of buses and that is being examined as part of the traffic management plan.  </P>
        <P>As regards consultation on the sustainable travel and transport action plan, in the next two to three weeks I hope to have that discussion document available.  We will have a couple of months in which to discuss that publicly.  The issue will be raised in that document and people will have an opportunity to make their views known.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards the powers of local authorities in this regard, will the Minister be publishing the Dublin transport authority Bill anytime soon?  He told us we would have it in January.  Will powers to impose road levies be included in such a Bill when it appears? </P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of measures relating to transport are included in the climate change strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  These include rebalancing of motor taxes, mineral oil tax relief for biofuels, a modal shift through Transport 21 and the achievement of a 5.75% biofuels blend in fuels by 2010.  In all, the transport sector will provide up to 13% in total national emission savings under that strategy.  Further details of the strategy are available on the website of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government at <i>www.environ.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>Meanwhile, the Government is committed to delivering a sustainable travel and transport action plan this year and I hope to initiate an intensive public consultation process on the issues <Col N="15"/>in the near future.  The question of emissions reduction for transport will be explored in more detail during that process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Since 1990, when we first began talking about Kyoto, transport emissions have increased 165%, which is a massive growth.  I know we have experienced economic growth in that time but cars and heavy duty vehicles are the biggest offenders in this regard.  In 2006, the last year for which we have statistics, greenhouse gas emissions increased by 682,000 tonnes over the 2005 figure.  The Minister&rsquo;s climate change strategy, which was proposed by the Green Party as the greatest thing since the sliced pan, will save 50,000 tonnes of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> per year.   While I welcome that saving, it represents only one thirteenth of the reduction we need to achieve.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is correct in stating that greenhouse gas emissions from transport increased 165%, from just over 5.17 megatonnes in 2005 to 13.72 megatonne equivalents in 2006.  As the Deputy rightly said also, however, those figures are a consequence of our economic success.  So many people are now staying in Ireland, whereas when I started out in politics people were emigrating.  We have experienced huge growth in the economy and as a result, rather than barely having one car, people now have two or three cars per household.  All these factors of our economic prosperity have given rise to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
        <P>The Government is aware that if we continue at the current rate we could be 265% above the 1990 emissions.  Everyone in this House has bought into cutting those emission rates.  The sustainable transport and travel plan to which I referred is designed to examine those matters.  In the discussion document, we have tried to outline frankly and fully where we are going as regards transport sector emissions.  It is not a pretty sight from the viewpoint of health and quality of life, particularly for city dwellers.  Measures will have to be taken and some of them will not be palatable for everyone but those issues must be faced and I look forward to having the Deputy&rsquo;s support in doing so.</P>

	<P>The most important thing the Government could do would be to introduce the Dublin transport authority Bill.  Because we do not have that legislation there are turf wars between Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the Railway Procurement Agency, while commuters suffer.  The Minister is right in saying that people are buying cars due to modern economic wealth but public transport has not kept pace with demand.  The key issue is that we do not have effective public transport initiatives or adequate park-and-ride facilities, while the Luas and metro projects are hit by delays.  Most of all, no one is in charge.  The Minister has refused to accept responsibility for Dublin&rsquo;s traffic chaos.  One of my questions was refused today because the Minister said it was a matter for somebody else.  It is a matter for the Minister, however, but he is not dealing with it.  That is why our transport emissions are so high and why people are queuing up in cars.  The Minister has no regard for the 100,000 motorists who are stuck on the M50, that wonderful parking lot, every day.  He refused to intervene to get a proper plan to deal with public transport, getting cars off the road and reducing emissions.</P>

We are moving ahead with all the public transport infrastructure, including metro north and the Luas lines, so progress is being made.  However, we cannot just wave magic wands and produce new Luas or metro lines overnight.  The Transport 21 programme is a ten-year plan up to 2015, which will provide additional public transport, but it cannot be done overnight.  Neither I, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd nor anyone else can do anything more about that.  Traffic management on national roads is a matter for the NRA, while other roads are dealt with by local authorities.  It is not a matter in which I can directly intervene, although through Transport 21 and other policies I try to make it as easy as possible for everybody to implement.  No rows have delayed the provision of public transport.  The RPA and CIE difficulties have been resolved and the public transport section of Transport 21 is proceeding.  It is not going as quickly as I would like but it is still within the timeline.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest> his views on the calls from the Road Safety Authority to his Department to immediately introduce legislation to give powers to the Garda to seize disqualified drivers&rsquo; licences; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[3874/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Driving while disqualified from doing so is deemed to be the same as driving without a licence.  The Garda has powers under section 38 of the Road Traffic 1961 to deal with the offence of driving a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place without holding a valid driving licence.  A driver detected driving while disqualified can be summonsed to appear before the courts to answer that charge.  Section 102 of the 1961 Act also provides for the penalties on summary conviction for an offence under section 38 of that Act.  The maximum fine for first offence is &euro;1,000; for a second or third offence-subsequent offence a fine not exceeding &euro;2,000; and &euro;2,000 for a third or subsequent offence, where committed within 12 consecutive months, and-or imprisonment to a term not exceeding three months at the discretion of the court.</P>
        <P>Amendments to current legislation to permit seizure of licences is among a number of matters being considered by my officials in the context of the preparation of a road traffic Bill, which will be the subject of consultation with the Garda and my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s intention to introduce legislation to deal with this issue, which was brought to his attention by the Road Safety Authority.  The authority has complained that if a person with a fake driving licence is stopped by garda&iacute;, they can request sight of the licence but cannot take it from him or her.  If garda&iacute; stop a motorist with a fake licence who is supposed to be off the road, they cannot take that licence either.  Is it true that up to 1 November 2007, of the 121 drivers on 12 penalty points, who should be off the road, only 40 had handed in their licence to the local motor tax office, as required by law?  This is a serious issue because these are dangerous, bad drivers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Anybody who has accumulated 12 penalty points should not drive and he or she should surrender his or her licence.  The legislation governing this is the direct responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and it states clearly if the driver is brought before a court, the licence must be handed into the court and the judge should so order.  I am not sure whether that has happened in all cases.  The Deputy is correct that anybody who accumulates 12 penalty points is disqualified automatically and his <Col N="17"/>or her licence should be handed up.  Some motorists are of the view that if they do not hand up their licence, they can still drive but that is not true.  It would be no harm if a message was sent to these people that they could be in serious trouble with their insurance company if they drive with a disqualified licence.  However, the matter was raised during the discussion on the graduated driving licences and it will be dealt with more explicitly in the proposed legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it the case that garda&iacute; are not equipped when they stop a motorist to investigate a number of issues and, for example, to establish whether he or she is disqualified?  Computers in Garda cars should be linked in real time to a database containing such information or it should be accessible on the hand held devices garda&iacute; use.  One of the problems is I could be disqualified from driving but if I retain my licence, I could hire a car or purchase insurance legally and to all intents and purposes I could still be on the road.  The key issue to be tackled is enabling the Garda to have access to a database containing this information so that members can establish whether a driver is disqualified or insured.  The Motor Insurance Bureau estimates 100,000 people driving on our roads do not have car insurance.  Is it the case that people use forged tax discs on their cars to pretend they have insurance?  Will the legislation address these serious and important issues?  If so, will the Garda be resourced accordingly?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The resourcing of the Garda is a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I went to great pains on the day I announced the road safety strategy to point out the format of the strategy was stark and I felt strongly every agency should take its own responsibility in this regard.  I take responsibility for the strategy and its implementation but everybody has bought into that and that is why agencies are identified for its implementation.  I have enough on my hands trying to ensure a number of the targets are met.  I will continue to ensure meetings are arranged between all the relevant agencies so that across the board matters are raised and targets are met.  Each agency and Department is responsible for meeting its own targets.  I am not being facetious but a number of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions could be directed to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I have stated previously in the House that I do not want to distract the Road Safety Authority from the important work it has in hand by directing it to produce safety audits of roads.  I am satisfied with the role being played by the authority, as well as by local authorities and council engineering staff, in highlighting and improving roads where safety is an issue.  Over the past five years, &euro;2.583 billion has been allocated to local authorities by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and &euro;7.175 billion to the National Roads Authority for national roads.  As safety is a fundamental consideration in the provision and maintenance of our road network, this high level of investment is delivering a significant road safety dividend.  In addition, more than &euro;60 million has been spent on national roads and more than &euro;17 million on non-national roads in implementing specific road safety measures over the past five years.</P><Col N="18"/>
        <P>Among the specific measures undertaken to improve the safety of roads, my Department has augmented the powers of local authorities to impose special lower speed limits at road works sites; published a revised and updated edition of chapter 8 of the road signs manual covering temporary traffic measures and signs at road works and the deployment of signage and temporary traffic measures at such locations; regularly updated technical advice to local authorities as regards the correct use of surfacing materials when undertaking road pavement improvement works; and produced comprehensive new guidelines for the control and management of road works sites by local authorities.</P>
        <P>These guidelines were developed under the aegis of the Local Government Management Services Board, LGMSB, with the assistance of my Department and the NRA.  I am satisfied these new guidelines for control and management of road works sites represent best practice and they should address the main concerns which have been expressed by the Health and Safety Authority.  Accordingly, my Department and the NRA have issued the new guidelines by way of circular letters to the local authorities for implementation with immediate effect.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>I am 100% committed to road safety.  Last weekend the terrible carnage on our roads was trying and I was tempted to issue a statement but it might have been picked up as being opportunistic.  The Chairman of the RSA and the Minister referred to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the failure to acknowledge a letter.  That was confirmed for me this morning.  While I am glad Gay Byrne may address that issue, I would like to deal with the quality of our roads.  It is nice to be able to confirm that the targets set out in June for driving licences are being met.  I am delighted more for those involved on the ground than for ourselves or Department officials.  I am aware that billions of euro have been spent but in the past three months our roads have turned into a nightmare.  The campaign against drink driving is beginning to work but many of the accidents occur during the day.  I sent an e-mail to all Fine Gael&rsquo;s Deputies to solicit their views on what might help to push the Government into prioritising the condition of our roads.  I do not accept the proposal to reduce accidents by an average of 21 per month.</P>

	<P>Is the Minister satisfied that our roads are in good condition?  He is aware that what happened last night on the road to Trim in County Meath was the greatest embarrassment that could be experienced by any official.  No Minister could be satisfied with the way our money is being spent on roads, which are a disgrace the length and breadth of the country.  That is why we have to pick blackspots through our new road safety officer.  How can the Minister say he is satisfied?  We will experience failure by the end of the year.  Eight people have been killed already this year, which is three more than the number last January.  When I was first elected three years ago, I asked that an independent audit be carried out on all our roads but only 3% are audited by the NRA.  Does the Minister agree it is time to transfer responsibility for roads from county managers to an independent person in each county so that young people can be safer?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="19"/>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Part of the road safety strategy is based on pursuing a number of different issues, with education, enforcement and engineering comprising three legs of a four-leg strategy.  This concept includes improving roads and ensuring new roads are constructed to the safest possible standard.  Specific moneys are available to deal with blackspots on existing non-national roads in each county.  Our roads are far from perfect, however.</P>
        <P>As Minister for the Environment in 1995, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle instituted the roads restoration programme, which everybody thought would be the bees knees.</P>

	<P>It was very progressive and all the moneys he promised were spent over the past decade.  We are now into the second stage of the programme but difficulties remain on our roads.  Regardless of what happens in the next ten or 20 years, we will always have difficulties on our roads.  That is not to say we should be defeatist because we should target the funding.  Local authorities have significant discretion on their non-national road allocations and we expect them to deal with the most dangerous spots.</P>

        <Quest> when he will receive the recommendation of the advisory panel on the blood alcohol limit; when he expects to be in a position to announce his decision on whether he will lower the blood alcohol limit for drivers to 50 m/g; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[3418/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 166 together.</P>
        <P>The Road Safety Strategy for 2007-2012, which was launched in October 2007, identifies the need to legislate for and introduce a reduction in the legal blood alcohol content, BAC, level for drivers but it does not specify what that level should be.  The Government has accepted the Road Safety Authority&rsquo;s recommendation that the BAC level should be reduced.  The precise level to which the BAC will be lowered will follow consideration by me of the advice of the RSA.  I expect  to receive that advice in the near future.</P>
        <P>A number of issues will inform the recommendations of the RSA, including known driver behaviour, past offending rates, analysis of data held by the medical bureau of road safety, enforcement practicalities and best international practice.  As the current blood alcohol level is set out in the Road Traffic Act 1994, changing that level will require an amendment to primary legislation and I will bring a road traffic Bill to Government as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>Any amended level will also require the recalibration and subsequent recertification of the technology used for testing blood alcohol levels, such as evidential breath testing machines in Garda stations and roadside breathalysers, and this will take some time.  With this in mind I am not in a position at this stage to say exactly when a revised blood alcohol level will be fully operational but I will endeavour to improve on the 2009 second quarter target contained in the road safety strategy.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="20"/>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Every European country has a blood alcohol limit of 0.05% except for Ireland and Britain, which both have limits of 0.08%.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister consider a lower limit in respect of drivers on learner licences?  The evidence clearly indicates that younger drivers with blood alcohol content of above 0.02% are more likely to be involved in accidents.</P>
        <P>This side of the House would support reductions in blood alcohol levels.  The road safety strategy originally set out a reduction to 0.05% but this provision was removed.  The Department of Health and Children wrote to the Minister to express its belief that the 0.05% limit should be included in the strategy.  All the information I have read, from Europe, America and elsewhere, states that driving capacity is reduced when blood alcohol levels exceed 0.02%, whereas there is no evidence anywhere that it is safe to drive with levels above 0.05%.  It is not safe and therefore we should not be drinking and driving.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate for the Deputy that the final version of the road safety strategy did not contain any recommendation other than the limit should be reduced and that the Road Safety Authority should advise me once it conducted its research on the matter.</P>
        <P>In regard to the 0.08% limit in the UK and Ireland, there is a belief that a reduction in the limit would automatically reduce the number of road deaths.  I have investigated the statistics throughout Europe and found that some countries with limits as low as 0.02% have the highest rates of road deaths.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a question of enforcement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no single answer to this problem.  I am not saying blood alcohol levels are not a factor but they are not the only one.  The UK and Ireland are alone in respect of the 80 m/g limit but the UK has some of the best road safety statistics of any country in Europe.</P>
        <P>Unlike older generations, young people are much more careful about drinking and driving, although I may be proven wrong when the statistics are produced.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It has more to do with speed in the case of younger people.  I have no statistics to support my opinion, which is based on experience and anecdotes.  I am of the view that more young drivers are killed as a result of speed and drugs than are killed by the consumption of alcohol and that more older drivers are killed as a result of the latter.  The research carried out by the RSA, with which I am due to be presented before the end of March, will inform my views on this matter.</P>

       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to express my sympathy and that of the Labour Party to the families that were so tragically bereaved in recent days.  In light of the weekend&rsquo;s events, is the Minister not being incredibly lethargic?  Is not the ongoing, terrible carnage on our roads utterly unacceptable?  The buck stops with the Minister and he must take responsibility.  Is it time to declare this matter a national emergency?  If the Minister wishes, later this week, to introduce legislation relating to people who do not possess proper licences, who have 12 penalty points or whatever, the Labour Party, and I am sure Fine Gael, would facilitate its passage.</P>
        <P>The Minister vetoed the proposal to reduce the blood alcohol limit to 0.5.  He decided last October that it would not be possible to introduce what, effectively, would be a non-drink <Col N="21"/>drive limit.  The Minister bears responsibility and he did not have the political courage to take this decision.  Given that alcohol appears to be a factor in approximately 37% of collisions and crashes, is it not incredible that he decided not to take action?</P>
        <P>If one considers the wider picture, the Minister failed to introduce key legislation in respect of driving offences.  Gay Byrne, the chairperson of the RSA, went ballistic yesterday and almost threatened to resign because the Minister will not expedite the placement of additional cameras throughout the country.  Most people agree that speeding is the decisive factor in the majority of collisions.  Does not the Minister bear responsibility and is this not an emergency?</P>
        <P>We welcomed the fact that there was a small reduction in the number of collisions last year.  However, the position in respect of 2003 was similar.  The carnage that has occurred during the past eight or ten years &mdash; the events of last weekend disgusted and dismayed people &mdash; is completely unacceptable.  This is an emergency situation.  The Minister should take responsibility and should stop referring to drink driving limits, road traffic offences and cameras.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to the UK.  The point about that jurisdiction is that the authorities there engage in much stricter enforcement of existing traffic laws.  Is it not time we established a totally separate traffic corps that would be answerable to itself and to the Minister for Transport and that would enforce the traffic laws?</P>

        <P>I will not refer to crashes that occurred at the weekend or at any other time because they are matters for the Garda.  However, I will not take responsibility for accidents that occur because people do not obey the laws relating to speeding or alcohol, because they overtake in places where they should not do so or whatever.  I never will take responsibility for such matters.  I will, however, take responsibility for putting in place the strategy and then, in so far as is possible, trying to ensure it is implemented in respect of the areas for which I and my Government colleagues have responsibility.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Dr. Declan Bedford, an expert residing and working in County Meath, stated, in respect of the analysis he carried out regarding road deaths in Ireland over a particular period, that one quarter of the people who died in the accidents he investigated had taken alcohol of a level between 20 and 50 milligrams.  Does the Minister accept that this is the case?  Does he also accept the results of a survey carried out in the Border counties and County Meath which indicates that alcohol was a contributory factor in 58% of single vehicle accidents involving fatalities in those areas?  It is wrong for the Minister to state that young people do not drink and drive.  It is true that young people, more than any other group of statistically significant individuals, take taxis.  However, they do drink and drive and are killed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say that young people do not drink and drive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister implied it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I said what the Deputy alluded to in his second statement, namely, that young people are more likely to use taxis, select a designated driver or make some other arrangement.  It is unfair to make a blanket criticism of young people because they are making&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not criticising them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;major efforts.  In the debate on this matter, everybody tends to dump on young people and that is grossly unfair.  I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s comments on Dr. Bedford&rsquo;s fine research in this area.  However, that research did not indicate whether the people with the relevant level of alcohol in their blood actually caused the accidents in question.  I am awaiting information and statistics from the RSA in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept what the research indicates in respect of single vehicle accidents?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no doubt that alcohol is a major factor.  It causes or is a factor in approximately 37% of accidents.  There is an argument for reducing the limit to 0.2, or 20 milligrams, for younger drivers on the basis that they have less experience and may not be able to cope with the effects of alcohol as well as others.  There are arguments on both sides.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110, 111 and 115 together.</P>
        <P>Following two independent reviews of the integrated ticketing project in early 2006, my predecessor established the integrated ticketing project board in July of that year.  The board was given responsibility to deliver the technology required to deliver an integrated smart card ticketing system within an agreed specification, timeline and budget.</P>
        <P>The project board submitted a comprehensive proposal to me in December 2006 setting out the timelines, scope and budget.  The proposal put the expected capital cost of the integrated ticketing project at &euro;49.6 million.  The board&rsquo;s proposal was assessed in my Department and I authorised the project to proceed in June 2007, following the receipt of the sanction from the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>A monitoring committee on integrated ticketing was established by my Department in July 2007.  The committee is chaired by an assistant secretary from my Department and includes the chairperson of the project board and the project director.  The committee meets on a monthly basis and monitors financial and implementation progress on the project.  I am kept informed of progress.</P>
        <P>In July 2007, shortly after I became Minister for Transport, I met with the project board to explain the importance I placed on integrated ticketing and the need to establish it as quickly as was feasible.  I met with the chief executives of the various agencies involved as well.  I again met the chairperson of the project board in December 2007 to get an update on progress and reiterate my continued support for the project and desire to see it delivered as speedily as possible.</P>
        <P>The proposed integrated ticketing system will be launched initially within the greater Dublin area on the services of Dublin Bus, Luas and Morton&rsquo;s in September 2009.  It will be extended to Irish Rail, DART and commuter rail services within a further 12 months, and Bus &Eacute;ireann on a pilot basis on a number of its commuter routes.  It is also envisaged that other private bus operators will join the scheme.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, the award of the contract to build the back office of the system is expected by the end of March 2008 and the procurement process for a contractor to operate the system will then commence.  Dublin Bus will launch its interim smartcard scheme in summer 2008 and Irish Rail will follow suit with its own interim scheme in 2009.  Some &euro;12.5 million has been paid out by the Exchequer on integrated ticketing since the inception of the project in March 2002.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>It is 12 years since this project was first mooted, having an initial cost of &euro;30 million.  The expected cost is now &euro;50 million, so there is an appalling waste of <Col N="24"/>public money.  The project is &euro;20 million over budget at the moment, almost as bad as the electronic voting machines debacle, a mess with which the Minister was also involved.</P>
        <P>The Dublin transport authority Bill is not yet in place although we had it in place in the 1990s.  There is no person in overall charge of the transport issues in this project.  Does the Minister accept the technologies exist in many other countries but the personalities are not the same in different countries?  In this case, there have been turf wars between the likes of Bus &Eacute;ireann, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and private operators.  Can the Minister do more in the interim to deal with this issue more effectively and efficiently than as announced in his timeframe?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">When I was at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and this was first mooted, I expected the project to be completed much earlier than today.  With regard to the review of the current project which took place in 2006, all of the timelines have so far been adhered to and all the progress outlined in that has come about.  The timescale is being maintained.</P>
        <P>There is much more co-operation at this stage.  The Deputy may not have been far off the mark when he indicated part of the difficulty was some less than helpful exchanges between those involved in the early stages.</P>
        <P>I would have taken the same view as the Deputy until I examined the matter in much detail since taking up my current portfolio.  It is not quite as simple and straightforward as the Deputy indicated.  Some countries have got it very right but some have got it very wrong.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Broughan has a final supplementary question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is the fourth or fifth Minister who has promised us integrated ticketing.  What amount is needed to deliver the project up to August 2009?  Will the Minister take personal responsibility that in August 2009 there will be integrated ticketing?</P>
        <P>Will the poor commuters of Dublin have to eventually pay for this integrated ticketing debacle, which has gone on for 12 years, in double terms through increased fares and taxes?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the completion date, the integrated ticketing board is currently responsible for the delivery of the project and it reports to me.  It is intended that when the Dublin transport authority is in place, it will take over responsibility for delivering the project.  The expected cost, as I noted earlier, is &euro;49.6 million, with this figure based on pre-tender estimates.  We will have to wait and see what the tenders turn up.</P>

    <Title>Leaders&rsquo; Questions. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I know it is &ldquo;Super Tuesday&rdquo; but we have matters we must attend to in our own country.  I am genuinely concerned at the leaking confidence evident now in the Irish economy.  January saw the largest monthly increase in jobless figures since such records began, up 7,800 or 4.4% since December.  That was the biggest monthly rise in percentage terms since 1980 and the largest increase in numerical terms ever.</P>
        <P>Most commentators believe this comes from the slowdown in the economy, particularly the construction industry area.  There were 6,400 males among the over 7,800 registered in that increase.  F&Aacute;S has predicted that we can expect up to 30,000 job losses this year, a staggering amount, and it has also reported a 50% fall in the number of apprenticeships in what were known as the wet trade.  This includes plumbing, painting, bricklaying and one well known to the Taoiseach, plastering.</P>
        <P>There is anecdotal evidence about firms leaving off apprentices before they have completed training, a matter of genuine concern and hurt.  Job losses are not a funny matter, nor are they limited to the house building sector.  There were more redundancies notified in January from the non-construction sector of manufacturing than for construction, which speaks for itself.</P>
        <P>As a result, almost 8,000 young people under 25 are registered on the live register.  What is the Government&rsquo;s plan to deal with this issue?  The Taoiseach and his anointed one recently stated that if we followed the macroeconomic plans of Government, all would be fine, everything is rosy in the garden and we will weather this storm.  The Taoiseach does not appreciate the level of concern out there; people&rsquo;s lives do not lie and they can smell the change on the streets.  What is the Government&rsquo;s plan to provide job opportunities and careers for young people in Ireland in the future?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Nowhere did I say all is rosy in the garden and there are no problems.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Not since the election anyway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We should be realistic.  Deputy Kenny knows or will at least be aware that since 12 August there has been a financial market crisis throughout the entire world.  That has had a knock-on effect into the last quarter in a very severe way on practically every economy <Col N="26"/>of OECD countries &mdash; effectively the whole world.  From a very strong position in the middle of the year, there have been ripple effects right through all sectors of international economies.  It is not only in the United States, where there has been significant job losses and company closures, but throughout European communities.</P>
        <P>It had long been predicted that we would see a slowdown in our housing market and whether it would happen in 2006, 2007 or 2008 was the only issue of debate.  We had been building at a rate of between 70,000 to 88,000 houses per year, with the latter number the figure for 2006.  It was not sustainable to build houses at four times the rate in the United States of America, six times the rate of the United Kingdom and approximately eight times the rate in the rest of Europe.  That is not a surprise.  While unprecedented numbers of houses are being built and unprecedented numbers are in employment, the figures are pulling back.  House building is a labour intensive industry and I have said several times in the past few months that there has been a deterioration in labour market conditions, which was expected.</P>
        <P>Available data show that employment in construction went well past that peak in the last quarter of last year.  Employment in other sectors, however, is expected to offset the decline in construction, although in aggregate terms only a modest increase in employment is in prospect.  The figure predicted at the beginning of the year was 24,000 net new jobs, equivalent to an increase of approximately 1%.  For the past few years, employment has grown by approximately 3.5%.  When the figures are placed side by side, one can see the difficulty.</P>
        <P>At an aggregate level, there has been some decline in house prices over the past few years.  That appears to reflect several factors, including the large increase in housing supply and the fact that a number of houses &mdash; it is debatable how many because different commentators give different figures &mdash;  in the market, caused by an oversupply, have not been sold which has created a drag in the market.  It will be some time before that moves through.</P>
        <P>In other sectors, employment is still high.  We are the fifth largest exporter of international services in the world.  In manufacturing, we continue to be strong despite what people predicted a few years ago.  We have lost some manufacturers, such as Allergen in Arklow last week, but today Zimmer, one of the top companies in the world, announced that it is coming here for the first time, with a &euro;50 million investment.  This shows an underlying confidence in the Irish market.  Both companies are medical suppliers, one pulling out and going to Puerto Rico, the other coming here for the first time.  We will see some results from that, depending on the product.</P>
        <P>Other countries are putting the financial stimulus and impetus into the market that we have already put in.  We have significantly increased the capital programme, with the State&rsquo;s investment of &euro;8.4 billion which will help to drive the economy in many areas.  That is approximately 1.5% of GDP.  Other countries are considering a similar measure, as well as some of the changes we have made in tax policies for indigenous companies through the business expansion schemes and others.  This is a difficult time, although over 2 million people are working and employment is increasing and we have a strong position on the purchasing index.</P>
        <P>We do not need to knock this country as others in the financial services sector in Europe are trying to do because we are a strong competitor in the foreign direct investment market.  I am not saying Deputy Kenny said that but he is aware that at least two operators in Europe have been doing this for the past few months.  We must be conscious of that aspect.</P>
        <P>Everyone is facing difficulty, and we must manage our difficulties, but this year we are talking about growth at 3%, with a low debt to GDP ratio, the ability to have a high capital programme and to continue to win significant foreign direct investment.  We must manage ourselves through this position and we have already taken action.  In terms of what else we need to do, we need <Col N="27"/>to focus strongly on where the gains are for us.  The issue is not about exports and imports; if our net exports are stronger than our imports, that adds growth.  We get to that position based on productivity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is well over time. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, a Cheann Comhairle.  Productivity equals jobs which equal investment.  That is why we must make sure we maintain and sustain a level of productivity that allows us to hold what we have in this difficult period and be able to move again as the cycle improves. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should take heed when the Ceann Comhairle says he is over time.  It is time for the Taoiseach to go.  That is a warning from the Chair.</P>
        <P>The difficulties in the sub-prime lending sector in the United States did not cause the problem here with house prices because the Taoiseach, his Minister for Finance and the Government have presided over soaring costs and a range of stealth taxes that have created this leaking of confidence in the economy.  The Taoiseach rightly points out that we are the fifth largest exporter in the world, but our broadband rating is 33rd out of 35 countries in the developed world.  There are oceans of euros available to be invested in e-commerce companies, but they will not site here because they do not have access to broadband or do not have the speeds when they do set up here.</P>
        <P>People&rsquo;s lives do not lie.  They can smell the change on the streets, the local chemist shop is going to close down, the price of milk has gone up 20% and post offices and Garda stations have closed down.  People see more parking spaces in shopping centres, the cost of living has increased disproportionately and mortgage repayments have increased, causing many social pressures as houses are re-acquired.  The Taoiseach has presided over that during a decade of an unprecedented economic opportunity to prepare for the future.  While people on the street know what is happening, Governments seem to be completely out of touch.  I know the Taoiseach is not responsible for what happens in the United States or Japan, but there are issues he can deal with here over which his Government should have control.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last week, I asked the Taoiseach whether he was prepared to direct F&Aacute;S, as it in his remit to do, to change tack in terms of training and upskilling to areas where there is a shortage, be it in sustainable development, the health or caring sectors, HGV drivers, chefs and the food industry.  Will he direct F&Aacute;S to shift its resources to training for situations where there is employment and there is still a skills shortage?</P>
        <P>On account of the enormous profits made by the construction industry over the past ten years, most construction firms should, and to be fair probably will, ensure that their apprentices will be allowed to complete that apprenticeship.  Will the Taoiseach see to it that happens?  It would be most unfair to young people who have entered into a chosen career in training or apprenticeship to find that it has been taken away from them because of a decision by the company.</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach change the priorities in the national development programme to double the number of schools provided?  Last Thursday, I saw the unprecedented sight of all the Fianna F&aacute;il chickens gathering round Mama Hanafin&rsquo;s goody bag for the announcement of the schools that was in all the local papers last weekend.  That is not how a democracy or a Government should operate in terms of providing jobs and dealing with the people&rsquo;s concerns.  It should double the number of schools being built and bring the skills from the construction industry into that sector, rather than have parents fighting, as they are today, in the High Court for their children&rsquo;s right to an education.  That is disgraceful.</P><Col N="28"/>
        <P>Although the Taoiseach is presiding over our economy while the fundamentals are still strong, confidence is leaking and the Taoiseach is not addressing that issue.  How does he expect to deal with the 30,000 jobs to be lost this year, according to F&Aacute;S?  The Taoiseach says they will be offset in other employments.  Where will they be?  Burlington, Allergen, Jacobs and Kingspan account for the loss of 1,500 jobs in a short time.  How will the Taoiseach deal with that aspect?  Will he give us a weekly update on how he is going to steer the economy through this crisis?</P>

The Government is ensuring the continuing provision of training in all those sectors in which it believes employment opportunities exist, including the tourism sector.

Pay and rates are good and in a more difficult time they should consider so doing notwithstanding the fact that excellent people of other nationalities can come here.</P>

        <P>As for construction, an enormous amount of development is taking place in major capital projects in the non-residential sector.  We must ensure that this can be sustained.  As I noted at the outset, productivity becomes essential when international markets experience a downturn.  We must ensure that in 2008 and 2009, as we have done many times previously, we get the best value for the resources we invest.  We must achieve high levels of productivity with an excellent workforce that provides good flexibility.  This will see us through a period during which the economy is still growing by 3%, which is greater than in most OECD countries, and will enable us to achieve stronger growth in the medium term.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="30"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week the Central Statistics Office published the headline crime statistics for 2007, which are the worst for several years.  In the last quarter of 2007, headline crimes were 6% higher than the corresponding period in 2006.  As Members are aware, headline crimes constitute the more serious crimes to be recorded.  In 2007, almost 105,000 headline crimes were recorded in this State, which is more than 2,000 serious crimes per week or almost 300 per day.  They included the crime of murder, which has increased from 60 to 78 in 2007, which was the highest number of killings to occur in the State since the Civil War.  This trend has continued in recent weeks.  A gun murder took place in Sligo recently, as did the attempted murder of a well-known criminal in Dublin.  Yesterday&rsquo;s news suggests we have exported our gang wars to Spain.</P>
        <P>I do not subscribe to the notion that whenever a crime takes place, the Government is at fault.  However, it is the Government&rsquo;s responsibility to reverse the trend of increasing crime in the State.  The Government has set this objective for itself a number of times.  I again ask the Taoiseach to take up a number of proposals that have been made by the Labour Party.  Labour has tabled two pieces of legislation on the Order Paper, the first of which is to put on a statutory basis the witness protection programme, while the second is to improve the surveillance in which the Garda can engage.</P>
        <P>In addition, will the Taoiseach take up Labour&rsquo;s proposal to increase greatly the number of community garda&iacute;?  In particular, will he arrange for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to discuss with the Garda authorities the possibility of deploying increasing numbers of community garda&iacute; by drawing on the increased numbers of garda&iacute; who will graduate shortly from Templemore?</P>
        <P>In that context, I remind the Taoiseach of a matter about which I was reminded recently, when the welcome announcement was made of the plans to renew the area of Moyross in Limerick.  I refer to a speech made in this House on 11 March 1992 by the late Deputy Jim Kemmy, in which he described the conditions in parts of that city.  At that time, his simple request was for a 24-hour Garda presence in some of the affected estates.  It is a great pity that the stitch in time approach then suggested by Deputy Kemmy was not adopted, as it might have saved much trouble in the meantime.  However, we can learn from it and I ask the Taoiseach whether he will take up the two approaches the Labour Party has been recommending for some time to deal with the escalating crime problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I certainly will discuss with the Minister the positive suggestions made by Deputy Gilmore.  As he is aware, I raised one of them previously and the previous Garda Commissioner did not consider the mandatory basis to be a priority.  However, I will raise both proposals again.</P>
        <P>I will comment on the figures.  Yesterday, the Minister advised me the Garda works closely with international law enforcement agencies in targeting the activities of Irish criminals who operate outside the jurisdiction.  The offices both of Europol and Interpol also are used extensively to co-ordinate the exchange of intelligence in the targeting of such criminals.  In addition, for a number of years the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has posted liaison officers to London, Paris, Madrid and the Hague.  Their function is to liaise with law enforcement authorities in those jurisdictions in the context of serious criminal activity with an Irish dimension.  Other jurisdictions do the same and it is necessary to so do because many such criminals try to operate on a hands-off basis in this jurisdiction by having others carry out their activities while living abroad themselves.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has appointed liaison officers to Europol, which is based in the Hague, and to Interpol, which is based in Lyons.  It soon is to have a liaison officer assigned to the analysis and operations centre based in Lisbon, which is the drug trafficking, intelligence <Col N="31"/>and interdiction centre.  The Garda works with law enforcement agencies in other jurisdictions as well trying to have exchanges of strategic intelligence on the activities and <i>modus operandi</i> of criminal networks involved in organised crime.  It also conducts investigations within the State at the request of foreign law enforcement agencies in accordance with legislation governing mutual assistance in criminal matters.  In addition, the Criminal Assets Bureau continues its statutory remit on these issues.</P>
        <P>The figures are as outlined by Deputy Gilmore.  The number of homicides has increased from 67 in 2006 to 84 last year.  The Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s reported detection rate in respect of murders and manslaughters last year was 68% and 100% respectively.  The Garda is working hard in respect of firearms and gang-related crime in particular.  The level in this regard was reduced significantly last year and it was not in this area that problems arose.</P>
        <P>There was a doubling of the number of homicides involving stabbing from 18 to 36.  That is where the difficulty lay last year.  It shows that, despite our having had a number of campaigns on knives, particularly in 2005, a knife amnesty and efforts on foot of the policing plan to deal with this issue, they did not prove effective last year.  The figure has doubled and there is no argument about that.  This year&rsquo;s policing plan reflects the intensified efforts of the Garda to tackle knife crime and includes a campaign aimed at discouraging people from carrying knives.  We must get the message across and I will play my part in doing so.  Carrying knives not only attracts heavy penalties but can lead to disastrous consequences.  We must also be conscious that domestic violence can ultimately lead to death and in this regard we continue to support the efforts of COSC, the agency spearheading the tackling of domestic violence.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner has reported that the overall detection rate for headline offences last year, 41%, represents a slight increase, yet the figure needs to increase further.  That there has been a substantial increase in drug-related detections is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>The budget for the Garda in dealing with all these issues and for the policing plan for this year is &euro;1.6 billion.  We must maintain a close focus on trying to reduce the crime rates.  In spite of an increase in population, the figures are still high.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is a great man for quoting statistics to suit his purposes.  He regularly regales us with invidious comparisons between the time he took up office in 1997 and today, particularly in respect of economic matters.  However, I remind him that when he entered office, he did so on the promise of zero tolerance of crime, yet the country is now being asked to tolerate levels of crime that are far higher than they were when he entered office.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach stated many of the crimes, particularly gang-related crimes, are linked to the drugs trade.  He is correct that many of the crimes are now international and that much border-hopping is being done by criminals.  However, in this age surveillance technology should be capable of identifying criminals, the nature of their activities and putting them behind bars.  We have recently seen convictions being secured on the basis of tracking the locations of mobile phones.  It is with this in mind that the Labour Party has proposed to the Government a number of measures to secure convictions, including the improvement of the powers of surveillance of garda&iacute; and the use of their discoveries in court.  These powers would be complemented by witness protection programmes so the criminals will not be able to avoid justice and slip off to the sun or wherever they go to live off the proceeds of their crimes.</P>
        <P>This is an area in which the Government has not delivered on its promises.  I do not want to continue to blame the Government for this but we need to see more action and urgency.  In this regard, the proposals for legislation and on community policing have been on the table for some time and I would like to see some action by the Government to deliver on them.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="32"/>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated, we will certainly look at the legislation.  The Criminal Justice Act 2007, which was enacted in 2006 and came into effect last year, dealt with all the legislative measures the Garda wanted to deal with these issues.  Technology keeps advancing and I will not argue with that.  If there are enhancements that can be made to the technology system, they will be considered, although I know those involved in criminal activity are probably some of the best clients of the mobile phone industries because they change their phones every day.  They discard them so technology cannot trace them.  There is obviously new technology available and I am sure the Garda and its investigative teams are on top of it.  The Government is obviously in favour of this and has provided significant resources for the Garda in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Justice Act 2007 relates to gangland crime and makes it more difficult to get bail.  It deals with people involved in drug trafficking, firearms offences or other serious crimes.  It introduced tighter controls over post-release activity, enhanced penalties for those who reoffend within seven years, mandatory minimum sentences in cases of drug trafficking and firearms offences and the indefinite retention of fingerprint samples.  All these fairly draconian measures are now law and available to the Garda in its activities.</P>
        <P>An enormous number of garda&iacute; are coming out of Templemore and the numbers have increased.  We have been giving preference to the road traffic corps and have built up the number therein.  There are now 800 in the corps and it is to increase to 1,200 in order to deal with the problems under its remit.  Although we are aware of the ongoing difficulties in this regard, the corps has had great successes.</P>
        <P>Obviously it is essential that Operation Anvil and other measures of the criminal justice system designed to target criminal gangs, particularly those in drug trafficking, receive the lion&rsquo;s share of the resources.  That is the Minister&rsquo;s policy.</P>

What is the status of the employment agency regulation Bill?  This Bill was on the pink sheet list last session, indicating that it was due for publication in that session.  This session, however, it has dropped back to section C, which includes those Bills for which the heads have not yet been prepared.  This is the graveyard section for legislation.  Is it the Government&rsquo;s intention to legislate for agency workers?  Why has this Bill been relegated not one but two divisions since Christmas?  When it is likely to be introduced?

That is the Government&rsquo;s policy.</P><Col N="35"/>

However, following the consultation process, proposals were recently submitted by the Department to finalise draft heads of the Bill based on what arose in the consultation process and the discussions with the Attorney General.  These outstanding issues mainly centre around the position of employment agencies having regard to Article 49 of the EU treaty.  It will take some work to find out how the legislation can be compatible with the treaty and also with our system of industrial relations.  I do not have a date for the legislation because I do not know how long this process will take.  It is not the case that it has been put back to the summer or autumn session.

Recently, I tabled a question to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government asking what plans were being rolled out but it was ruled out of order.</P>
        <P>Do we have joined up Government where work conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency is fed back to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government?

This side of the House has called for a proper tax statement outlining how we spend what is now, according to the Revenue Commissioners, &euro;9 billion in tax expenditures, tax reliefs, for which the D&aacute;il receives no report or evaluation.  Effectively, only three Departments have as big a budget under their control, namely, the Departments of Education and Science, Social and Family Affairs and Health and Children, and yet we will vote through the Finance Bill on the nod without any analysis of what we are spending that &euro;9 billion on.  Much of it is spent in an unfair and questionable manner.  We need a more realistic debate about this issue.

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I am glad to be able to introduce my fifth Finance Bill to the House.  In previous Bills I introduced measures that supported business, made the tax system fairer and significantly lightened the burden on low and middle income earners.  In this Bill I will continue with this approach, while also seeking to promote care for our environment through a range of initiatives.  The principal aims of this Bill are to support enterprise and innovation, to advance sustainable development and to ensure a fairer tax system.</P>
        <P>Helping enterprise by reducing the administrative burden to make doing business easier should be part of any finance Bill deliberation.  The Bill builds on measures to assist small business which I introduced in the 2007 budget and it includes a number of business friendly measures such as revised preliminary tax payment arrangements for corporation tax aimed at small and start-upcompanies; an increase in VAT registration thresholds for small business to &euro;37,500 in the case of services and &euro;75,000 in the case of goods; and the extension of film relief for another four years until the end of 2012, with an increase in the cap on eligible expenditure from &euro;35 million to &euro;50 million per project</P>
        <P>I am enhancing the existing research and development tax credit scheme by extending the current base year of 2003 for a further four years to 2013, an increase over the current six years.  The change will provide an additional incentive for increased expenditure on research and development in future years and will help to achieve the targets set out in the strategy for science, technology and innovation for 2006 to 2013.  It will also offer more certainty to industry regarding the tax credit scheme and also assist in competing for new foreign direct investment.</P>
        <P>Sometimes I am criticised for what is not in the Bill.  In this regard I reiterate my recent comments on the use of tax incentives for the development of the Cork docklands and the Limerick regeneration project.  The Cork project is at the beginning of a process of evaluation and we need to assess how best to devise proposals that would meet with EU State aid require<Col N="40"/>ments.  It is an exciting project but at this stage it is still a work in progress.  An early announcement may not assist in clarifying some of the outstanding issues that have yet to be resolved between the various stakeholders.  The special Cork docklands forum is expected to report by the middle of the year and I remain open to looking at ways in which the tax code can be used creatively to encourage investment and change behaviour.  Significant progress has been made in a short period on the Limerick regeneration project, and the regeneration master plans are due to be finalised in June of this year.  I am optimistic that I will be in a position to work with the Limerick regeneration agencies when these plans are finalised.</P>
        <P>Practical measures to help protect our environment are necessary and I am introducing a number of new measures in this area. The new tax initiative for energy efficient equipment will allow companies to claim the full cost, in the year of purchase, of specified energy efficient equipment against their taxable income.  The purpose is to assist in improving cost competitiveness while helping to reduce overall energy demand and carbon emissions.  The incentive is a pump-priming exercise for a period of three years.  Companies should embrace the economic benefits of investing in energy saving equipment.  The incentive will come into effect by order when EU state aid approval is obtained.</P>
        <P>The Finance Bill provides for the most fundamental reform of the vehicle registration system since its inception in 1993.  It will provide people with the opportunity to make choices to help the environment and with financial incentives to do so.  The VRT system is being revised to take greater account of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions, with VRT exemption for series production electric cars, and up to &euro;2,500 VRT relief for certain series production hybrid and flexible fuel cars.  The Bill will make the business expansion scheme more accessible for recycling companies, and also provides for a reduction in the VAT rate applicable on certain supplies used for the agricultural production of bio-fuels from 21% to 13.5%.</P>
        <P>Our income tax system has been made fairer, friendlier and more progressive.  The protection of more vulnerable groups must remain a priority when reviewing the income tax code and various improvements for such groups are made.  The Finance Bill provides for increasing the personal credits and bands to ensure that low income earners are kept out of the standard rate band and average earners are kept out of the higher rate band.  It also provides for a further increase in the ceilings up to which first-time buyers can claim mortgage interest relief and for increases in rent relief.</P>
        <P>Tax credits relating to those in special circumstances, such as lone parents, widowed persons and widowed parents, the elderly and those caring for persons with a disability have increased very significantly in recent budgets.  This Finance Bill makes further improvements in the area.  Age exemption limits have increased by 85% in the last seven years compared with inflation over the same period of about 27%.  For 2008, it is estimated that the top 1% approximately of income earners, namely, those with income over &euro;200,000, will account for about 25% of the income tax take in 2008 compared to less than 15% of the income tax take in 1997.  The most recent data from the OECD for 2006 indicates that for a single worker on average earnings, Ireland continues to have the lowest tax wedge in the EU and one of the lowest in the entire OECD.  These are the hallmarks of a fair tax system.</P>
        <P>This Bill is being presented against the backdrop of a slowdown in Irish economy and weaker public finances.  The Irish economy is estimated to have grown in GDP terms by 4.8% in 2007 and is forecast to slow to 3% in 2008.  While this represents a slowdown compared to recent years, it nevertheless is strong compared to our trading partners.  At the time I indicated that there were a number of risks to this forecast and it is fair to say that these remain.</P><Col N="41"/>
        <P>Against this background, my Department projected tax revenue growth of the order of 3.5 % for this year.  We have now received one month&rsquo;s data and in broad terms revenue growth is in line with expectations.  The profile for tax receipts in 2008 assumes that there will be some weakness in revenue growth in the first half of the year, reflecting the very strong economic activity during the first half of 2007.  As we go through this year, earlier weaknesses in revenues are expected to be compensated for later on, thus achieving the overall budget target of 3.5% tax growth.  Yesterday&rsquo;s figures showing taxes for January down 2.9% compared to January 2007 must be seen in the context of one month&rsquo;s data in 12 months.  While it is too early to draw any firm conclusions, the weakness in January was due primarily to the continuing weakness in the property market, which has been factored in to the projections.  In addition, it is also fair to say that most other taxes, particularly income tax, performed well in the circumstances.  Thus,  the January figures are in line with the budget forecasts.</P>
        <P>Inflation on a CPI basis, which has been higher than we would wish, is expected to ease back over the coming months from an average of 4.9% in 2007 to around 3% for 2008.  It is often said that administered prices are a major contributor to Ireland&rsquo;s inflation, but this is not so.  These services only account for a small fraction of the consumer price index and their contribution to inflation is small.  In the year to last December, the cost of regulated utilities and local charges increased by only 0.8%.  There is also a common perception that inflation in Ireland is worse than in the rest of the EU.  Again this is not so.  It was only 0.1% higher than the euro area average last December and exactly the average of the 27 member states on a comparable basis.  Over the past nine years inflation in Ireland has been on average about 1.25  % above the euro area.  Most of this gap was accounted for by higher increases in services prices due to our rate of economic growth, which was three times faster than the euro area and due to our much lower unemployment rate, with consequent faster wage growth.  I am not in any way complacent about inflation.  While the reasons for Ireland&rsquo;s high rate of services inflation were understandable in a period of rapid economic growth, in the current environment of slower growth such increases would not be consistent with enhancing competitiveness.</P>
        <P>New housing output, which has grown rapidly over the past decade, is expected to revert to more sustainable levels over the next few years.  However, while this contraction in the residential construction sector will result in some losses in employment and will exert a short-term negative drag on the economy, other sectors of the economy are performing well.  Infrastructural investment under the national development plan will increase over the coming years.  Services exports are growing rapidly.</P>
        <P>The performance of services exports in recent years is worth expanding upon.  At the turn of the decade, services exports accounted for one fifth of total exports.  However, exports of computer services, financial services and business services have all performed very well in recent years with the result that services exports now account for two fifths of total exports.  Strong export growth in these sectors means that Ireland is now the fifth largest exporter of commercial services in the world, an astounding figure for an economy of our size.  The shifting of resources into internationally traded, high value-added services reflects the next phase of development for the Irish economy.  In an increasingly globalised economy, internationally traded services will become the main source of highly-skilled, high-paying employment and this is where Ireland&rsquo;s competitive advantage will lie.</P>
        <P>The overall sound position of our economy did not come about by accident.  Ireland&rsquo;s economic development has been aided by sensible economic policies and a pro-business attitude, as exemplified by our low taxes on both labour and business.  The measures in this Finance Bill seek to continue to support business in a focused and pragmatic manner.  In addition, Ireland is internationally regarded as one of the best places in the world to do business, cementing our reputation as an attractive location for foreign investment.  As an accompaniment to our econ<Col N="42"/>omic growth, we have also pursued a prudent approach to the public finances.  We have been able to invest significantly in roads, education and many other types of infrastructure.  At the same time, we have been funding improvements in public services as well as providing greater resources to help those who have not been able to share in the fruits of our economic success.</P>
        <P>The results of our success are clear.  Since 1997, the economy has grown at an average annual rate of over 7%, which is one of the best economic performances in the world.  Employment growth has averaged 4% per annum since 1997 while the number of people at work has risen by more than 600,000.  Immigration has replaced emigration and economic success has allowed us to increase public spending without putting a strain on the public finances.  We have developed a substantial export sector, particularly in the areas of IT, chemicals and financial services.</P>
        <P>As I stated, while the outlook for growth over the short to medium term has deteriorated somewhat, we expect the economy to pick up again once housing output stabilises at more sustainable levels.  However, this relatively benign outlook is of course subject to risks, both external and domestic.  There are several downside risks on the external side, including oil prices, the euro-dollar bilateral exchange rate and the changing conditions in the US economy.  Sterling&rsquo;s recent falls against the euro could cause difficulties for exporters to the UK.  In addition, it is too early to gauge the full extent to which recent conditions in financial markets internationally have affected global economic trends.</P>
        <P>With these challenges in mind, it is important that we focus on addressing the domestic factors to improve competitiveness over which we have some control.  In this regard productivity is all important.  It is by being more productive that we can earn more and enjoy greater leisure.  In other words, our living standards will be raised.</P>
        <P>Ireland cannot, and indeed should not, attempt to compete on the basis of costs with low cost countries such as India or China.  Our competitive advantage must lie in other areas.  This will require us to increase our capital investment and to develop an increasingly skilled and educated workforce.  Our competitive advantage will also be a direct result of how effectively inputs such as capital, energy, materials and employees are utilised.  For example, today&rsquo;s Bill contains pro-business measures that encourage the use of energy efficient equipment which will support our energy policy more generally.</P>
        <P>The key areas that we must address are human capital, infrastructure, regulatory and public service reform, maintenance of stable public finances and a pro-enterprise tax system.</P>
        <P>In terms of human capital, the Government is investing considerable resources in raising the skills-set of the population.  While all levels are being targeted, investment in third and fourth level education is of particular importance to the Government.  Infrastructural investment under the national development plan will help to raise the public capital stock.  Exchequer capital investment in 2007 was approximately &euro;7.8 billion, &euro;l billion higher than in 2006.  The benefits of this extensive investment can be seen all around us.  In relation to private capital, the Government is committed to maintaining an environment conducive to private sector investment through, for instance, improvements contained in this Bill to promote research and development through the tax code and through &euro;8.2 billion in direct spending allocated under the strategy for science technology and innovation.  A relatively light regulatory burden, a low taxation environment which rewards work and enterprise, together with flexible product and factor markets will be essential.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Today&rsquo;s Bill is geared towards supporting enterprise by keeping our tax burden low and the first report of the high level group on business regulation due in July of this year will set the framework for reducing regulatory burden.</P><Col N="43"/>
        <P>All these measures make up the active framework that helps to support productivity growth in Ireland and will help us to meet the challenge of a rapidly changing global economy.  This is how we can enjoy high wages while still being competitive.</P>
        <P>The Bill runs to 133 sections and eight schedules and is structured by taxheads.  Today I will outline some of the main provisions in the time available to me but I will not give an exhaustive list of the minor or more technical issues.  I will listen carefully to the contributions of Deputies and I will try to respond to the points they make when I come to reply to the debate.</P>
        <P>The various income tax measures and reliefs announced in the budget are dealt with in sections 2 to 4, inclusive.  These measures widen the tax bands and increase various credits, including the basic personal credit, employee tax credit and home carer credit. Significant increases in the value of other personal credits and the age exemption limits, which are targeted at certain more vulnerable groups, underline the Government&rsquo;s commitment to look after the needs and welfare of those most deserving in our society.</P>
        <P>When this Bill has been enacted, the increases in the value of the credits and bands ensure that approximately four out of five income earners continue to pay tax at no more than the standard rate and almost two out of every five income earners will remain outside the tax net entirely.</P>
        <P>In order to address the cost pressures of those renting their home, section 6 provides for an 11%  increase in rent relief.</P>
        <P>Section 7 confirms the budget increases in the ceilings on mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers.  The ceiling is increased from &euro;8,000 to &euro;10,000 in the case of a single person and from &euro;16,000 to &euro;20,000 in the case of a married couple or a widowed person.  This means that mortgage holders may receive extra relief of up to approximately &euro;33 per month, if single, or approximately &euro;66 per month, if married or widowed.  This increase fulfils the Government commitment in this area as promised in An Agreed Programme for Government.  The rent-a-room scheme can be a useful measure for cash-strapped first-time buyers.  Accordingly, section 11 increases the income tax exemption limit which applies to rent received under the rent-a-room scheme from &euro;7,620 to &euro;10,000.  This increase takes account of the fact that the limit has not been increased since the scheme was introduced in 2001.</P>
        <P>The social partners have made a number of requests in relation to employee financial participation.  In response to these requests, section 13 increases the aggregate maximum amount of monthly contributions that an employee can make under a certified contractual savings-related share option scheme from &euro;320 to &euro;500.  The existing limit dates from the time the scheme was introduced in 1999.</P>
        <P>In addition, section 14 amends the rules relating to employee share ownership trusts, ESOTs.  Employees can gain access to triple the annual tax relief limit in the year in which an ESOT pays back a loan provided the loan has been held for a period of ten years and at least 50% of the shares have been encumbered for five years.  This measure was introduced in recognition of the fact that a large number of shares could be encumbered to guarantee such loans and thus the shares would not be available for distribution to employees and they would be unable to avail of the annual tax free limit of &euro;12,700 per annum.  The amendment will permit the Revenue Commissioners to allow a loan period of less than ten years, on a case-by-case basis, where an ESOT has sufficient income, from dividends for example, to pay off such loans earlier than expected.</P>
        <P>Section 15 is an amendment that ensures that farmers availing of tax averaging arrangements will not suffer a clawback of tax when they enter a milk production partnership.  As with all Finance Bills, there are a number of measures to address tax avoidance.  Section 16 is one such <Col N="44"/>provision relating to convertible securities.  The provision will ensure that the full value of the securities received by an employee or director will be subject to income tax.</P>
        <P>Section 18 extends the same basis of assessment to certain UK source income which applies to income from other EU and EEA states.  Section 20 is concerned with the spreading over six years of tax arising from the receipt of moneys under the scheme of aid for the restructuring of the sugar beet industry.</P>
        <P>Section 22 introduces provisions that restrict the use of reliefs by high income individuals which took effect from 2007.  It clarifies the correct sequence of the calculations to be made in applying the measure when certain other provisions in the Tax Acts are involved.  The section will ensure that restriction will work as intended in such cases.</P>
        <P>The European Commission gave State aid approval to the business expansion and seed capital schemes changes in the 2007 budget.  As a result, section 23 brings into primary law the amendments made to the schemes by regulations on a temporary basis last year following approval of the schemes by the European Commission.  The section will also make it easier for some recycling companies to participate in the schemes.</P>
        <P>Section 24 is a preventative measure which broadens the meaning of a contribution to an employee benefit trust to ensure that, as intended by existing legislation, the employer will get a deduction for the contribution at the time the employees receive the benefits and no earlier.  In order to assist capital expenditure on buildings and structures used in caravan parks and camping sites section 25 introduces a tourism initiative to allow caravan parks and camping sites registered with F&aacute;ilte Ireland to avail of capital allowances at the rate of 4% over 25 years.</P>
        <P>Section 27 deals with an income tax matter relating to payments for decommissioning fishing vessels.  Where a balancing charge arises as a result of claiming excess capital allowances, the charge will be spread over five years instead of the normal one year.</P>
        <P>As a counterpart to the proposed changes to vehicle registration tax, VRT,  that relate it more closely to CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions, section 28 sets out the changes to the capital allowances and leasing expenses regime for business cars announced in the budget by linking the availability of capital allowances and leasing expenses to the carbon emission levels of cars.  The new provisions will come into effect in respect of cars purchased or leased on or after 1 July 2008.</P>
        <P>On foot of a recently completed independent review of the film relief, section 29 extends film relief for another four years until the end of 2012 with an increase in the cap on eligible expenditure from &euro;35 million to &euro;50 million per project.</P>
        <P>To support the international financial services industry in Ireland, sections 33 to 36, inclusive, with sections 110 and 111, introduce a package of measures designed to provide a competitive boost to the securitisation, funds and insurance sectors by removing impediments to the development of these businesses here.</P>
        <P>Section 37 amends the provisions granting tax relief for certain expenditure on know-how that is bought by a person for use in a trade carried on by the person.  This relief is not available where the know-how is bought as part of a trade that is being acquired or where the buyer and the seller are connected.</P>
        <P>Section 38 is a response to the OECD recommendation to prohibit a deduction for tax purposes of illegal payments made to a foreign official.</P>
        <P>The tax treatment of foreign dividends will be put on the same footing as the taxation of income out of which Irish-sourced dividends are paid by section 39.  Up to now, foreign sourced dividends have been subject to tax at the 25% rate.  The changes mean, in broad terms, that the 12.5% rate will apply to foreign dividends received by Irish resident companies, which are <Col N="45"/>paid out of trading income, and the 25% rate to foreign dividends paid out of non-trading income, where the foreign dividends arise from companies in EU member states or from countries with which Ireland has a double taxation treaty.</P>
        <P>Section 40 amends the close company surcharge rules by also providing for parity of treatment for Irish holding companies that are close companies in respect of dividends received from their foreign and domestic subsidiaries.</P>
        <P>A new profit resource rent tax is introduced in section 41 which may apply to profits arising from a new petroleum lease which follows an exploration licence awarded by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources after 1 January 2007.  Additional taxes of between 5% and 15% will apply depending on the profitability of petroleum fields.  These taxes will be in addition to the 25% corporation tax rate which currently applies to profits from such activities.</P>
        <P>In order to increase the incentive for companies to purchase certain energy efficient equipment, section 42 allows companies to claim the full cost, in the year of purchase, of new energy efficient equipment against their taxable income.  The equipment must be included on a specified list to be drawn up by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in consultation with the Department of Finance.  The incentive is subject to clearance by the European Commission from a State aid perspective.</P>
        <P>Section 43 confirms, among other things, the budget day announcement that the preliminary corporation tax liability threshold for treatment as a small company is being increased from &euro;150,000 to &euro;200,000.  New or start-up companies with a corporation tax liability of &euro;200,000 or less for their first accounting period will not be required to pay preliminary tax in respect of that first accounting period.</P>
        <P>Section 44 amends the provisions associated with taxation issues relating to the acquisition by a company of its own shares, that is, &ldquo;share buy-backs&rdquo;.  This amendment provides that costs incurred by a company in buying back its own shares are not allowed as a deduction for tax purposes.</P>
        <P>In order to provide an additional incentive for increased expenditure on research and development in future years and more certainty to industry in relation to the tax credit scheme, section 46 enhances the existing research and development tax credit scheme with an extension of the use of the base year 2003 for a further four years to 2013.  The period over which any rolled-forward base year will apply on a &lsquo;look back&rsquo; basis is also being extended to ten years.  For example, the base year for 2014 will be 2004 and so on.</P>
        <P>Section 48 makes a number of changes to the capital gains tax retirement relief provisions.  It introduces a preferential regime where an individual receives a decommissioning payment in respect of a fishing vessel.  Under the existing retirement provisions, an individual must be aged at least 55 and have been in business for ten years.  These requirements are being amended and individuals aged 45 or more who have been in business for at least six years will be able to avail of the retirement relief in respect of the decommissioning payments that will be paid under a new scheme.</P>
        <P>A further change provides a relief to farming partnerships on the dissolution of such partnerships prior to 31 December 2013.  The relief provides that a gain will not be treated as accruing in respect of a relevant partnership asset and that the asset will be treated as having been acquired at the same time and for the same consideration as when it was originally acquired by the partner subsequently disposing of the asset.</P>
        <P>Section 49 increases the capital gains tax exemption threshold that applies on a gain arising on the disposal of a site by a parent to a child to build a house.  The new threshold is &euro;500,000. <Col N="46"/> It also clarifies that the threshold applies where both parents make a simultaneous disposal of a site to their child.</P>
        <P>As required under the EU energy tax directive sections 51 to 62, inclusive, provide for an excise duty on electricity.  The tax will be charged to the operator who supplies the electricity to the consumer.  The tax will apply to supplies of electricity made on or after 1 October 2008.  The rates of tax are being set at the minimum rates specified in the directive while electricity used by households will be exempt from the new charge as will electricity produced from renewables and combined heat and power generation.  The overall cost and impact on electricity prices for business will be marginal.</P>
        <P>Sections 63 to 75, inclusive, set out a range of changes in regard to excise duties, including confirming the budget day increases in excise on tobacco and duty payable in respect of an off-licence for the sale of alcohol.  The necessary legislative changes are being made to revise the VRT system to take greater account of carbon dioxide emissions, exempt series production electrical cars from VRT, extend the existing relief for series production hybrid and flexible fuel cars until 30 June 2008 and replace it with a VRT relief of up to &euro;2,500 for such cars from 1 July 2008.</P>
        <P>Arising from European Commission decisions, section 66 includes the legislative changes to withdraw the excise reliefs in respect of fuel used for public passenger transport vehicles; in private pleasure-flying and private pleasure navigation and for recycled waste oil.  The reliefs will be withdrawn with effect from 1 November 2008.  In the case of public passenger transport vehicles alternative mechanisms to direct Exchequer resources towards such services, subject to State aid rules, continue to be explored by the Department of Transport in conjunction with the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>Sections 76 to 100, inclusive, deal with VAT.  Following a review and extensive consultations, sections 79, 80, 82, 85 and 91 contain new rules regarding the application of VAT on property transactions.  The purpose of the new system is to rationalise and simplify the VAT treatment of property, which has become extremely complicated.  There is also a strong anti-avoidance dimension to the new rules to deal with increasingly aggressive avoidance schemes in relation to VAT on property.  The supply of new residential property, building land and undeveloped land will remain unchanged.  The new system comes into effect on 1 July 2008.</P>
        <P>The main changes include ceasing to charge VAT on the capitalised value of leases in excess of ten years, removing old properties from the VAT net by confining the period during which VAT will apply to the supply of new properties to a maximum of five years and making some changes to the treatment of leases.  In addition, a capital goods scheme is being introduced for property transactions.  This will ensure that the amount of VAT deductible will be proportionate to the business use of a property over a 20-year period.  The legislation also includes necessary transitional measures.</P>
        <P>In order to ease the administrative burden on small businesses sections 86, 88 and 93 confirm budget day announcements increasing the VAT registration thresholds for small businesses to &euro;37,500 in the case of services and &euro;75,000 in the case of goods.  These increases will take effect from 1 May 2008.  A reverse charge measure is also introduced in respect of VAT on supplies made by a subcontractor to a principal contractor in the construction sector with effect from 1 September 2008.  This is a simplification measure.</P>
        <P>Section 98 provides for a reduction in the VAT rate for inputs used for the agricultural production of bio-fuels from 21% to 13.5% with effect from 1 March 2008.  This section also provides for the rate reduction for non-oral contraceptive products from 21% to 13.5%.</P><Col N="47"/>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners intend to introduce a computer-based facility in the second quarter of 2009 which will allow a full self-service on-line process where the user can file, pay stamp duty and receive an instant stamp without Revenue requiring to see the deed in up to 90% of cases.  Section 102 introduces enabling legislation to allow for the e-stamping of instruments for stamp duty purposes.</P>
        <P>Section 106 is an anti-avoidance measure to ensure that transfers of shares to a connected company, which would benefit from a stamp duty exemption, will not be exempt from stamp duty where the company buying the shares claimed intermediary relief on the transaction.  Section 108 increases the stamp duty exemption threshold that applies on the transfer of a site by a parent to a child to build a house.  The new threshold is &euro;500,000.  Section 109 amends the provisions relating to the exemption from stamp duty in respect of the transfer of loan stock.  The existing provision that the loan stock is redeemable within 30 years is abolished and the requirement that it is not linked to stock exchange or inflation indices is amended so that relief will not apply if it is linked in any way to an equity index.</P>
        <P>Section 113 amends the stamp duty regime for owner-occupiers who benefit from preferential stamp duty rates and are liable to a clawback of relief if they let the house in the five years after purchase.  This is being reduced to two years.  In addition, in regard to first-time buyers, an anti-avoidance provision is being introduced to address certain abuses that have come to light.</P>
        <P>To help support increased use of electronically-based financial transactions, section 114 reduces the charges on financial cards, as announced in the budget.  In addition, financial institutions will be required to make a preliminary payment of 80% of the duty payable for that year by 15 December.  However, the dates on which the institutions recover the stamp duty from their customers will not change.</P>
        <P>Section 116 amends the First Schedule to the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act and provides for stamp duty on cheques to be increased from 15 cent to 30 cent and increases the rent threshold below which the annual rent on a house is not chargeable to duty to &euro;30,000.  Section 116 also gives effect to the substantial reform of stamp duty that I announced in the budget regarding residential property.  Stamp duty is now charged on the following basis.  The first &euro;125,000 is charged at 0%, with the balance on houses up to &euro;1 million charged at 7%.  In regard to properties valued at over &euro;1 million, the excess is liable to a further duty at 9%.  However, to ensure that no one loses out on this reform, stamp duty will not be charged on houses costing no more than &euro;127,000.  This will result in a much fairer system for house buyers.</P>
        <P>The tax system can and does support our national heritage.  In this regard, section 122 will facilitate the donation of collections of heritage manuscripts and archival material to bodies such as the National Library, while section 123 is intended to enable the Irish Heritage Trust to complete its acquisition this year of an outstanding collection of paintings and furniture for display at Fota House.  The trust has already acquired approximately one third of the collection in question.</P>
        <P>It is important that our tax administration be modern and that the Revenue Commissioners have the power to enforce the law.  In this regard, sections 124 to 128 introduce a number of measures in this area.  These include allowing Revenue officers to question suspects in Garda custody for indictable revenue offences; enabling any Revenue officer to determine residency of an individual for tax purposes; obliging agents in the State in receipt of rental income, on behalf of another person, to also report rental income from foreign properties; and increasing the maximum fines on summary conviction for certain tax offences to &euro;5,000.</P>
        <P>I hope the House has benefited from that explanation of some of the measures in the Bill.  There will be some matters under consideration that I may bring forward on Committee Stage <Col N="48"/>should they receive Cabinet approval and I proceed with them.  I will, of course, also consider any constructive suggestions put forward during our debate today and tomorrow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Later this year the Minister will award himself a salary of &euro;270,000, which will give him more than twice what the US Treasury Secretary, Mr. Paulson, earns.  We will need to apply strict performance rules if the Minister takes that pay increase.</P>
        <P>I would look to his record and ask a serious question on the extent to which he has addressed the economy&rsquo;s needs in the series of budgets he has introduced.  Every one of those budgets was expansionary except this year&rsquo;s and they were introduced against the opposition of groups such as the IMF, which considered their impact on our competitiveness down the road.  These expansionary budgets were introduced at a time when the property sector was booming and we had close to full employment.  The difficulty is that the actions of Government fuelled an unsustainable, debt-driven property boom.  The decision to remove the tax reliefs to the building sector was continually pushed back &mdash; they will not be entirely gone until July next &mdash; when it was plainly obvious in 2000 that these tax vehicles were driving the property sector in a way we did not need.</P>
        <P>A further difficulty is that the Government&rsquo;s repeatedly expansionary approach of increasing public spending by on average 40% more than the rate of growth of the economy has put pressure on prices.  Inflation, as the Minister points out in one part of his speech, has been running approximately 50% faster than in the rest of the EU, although he chooses to highlight the one month in which we appear to have converged.  The difficulty is that the erosion of our competitiveness has happened over a series of years and the fortunate or unfortunate discovery that we happened in one month, December, to have a similar inflation rate to the rest of the euro zone has not changed the reality of our competitiveness problems.</P>
        <P>The issues in regard to public service reform are ones the Minister has totally failed to address.  The elephant in the room, which no one will face up to, has been the drive to implement decentralisation, which was ill thought-out from the beginning.  I do not believe any public servant could stand over the claim that these were strategic decisions based on the best implementation of the public service.  One year after the deadline, we are still struggling to achieve less than 10% of what was projected.  The amount of public service energy that should have been devoted to delivering strategic change on climate change and e-government, strategies which failed, were dissipated in this pointless exercise.  We need a decentralisation programme that is strategically based, well thought-out and implementable.  We do not need what has happened in recent years, when huge energy was devoted to undermining the capacity of the public service to deliver change.</P>
        <P>By its decision to pay itself and top earners huge increases in public pay, the Government has totally undermined its credibility when it turns around to others and suggest this is a time for wage restraint.  How can one ask the ordinary worker on the shop floor to accept it is time for wage restraint when he sees the bosses in the public sector being paid big increases without a demand for performance and without productivity tests being applied?  This is the underlying flaw in the Government&rsquo;s position.  It looks to others to meet the highest standards of productivity and to tighten their belts yet when it comes to applying the same principles to itself and those at the top of the public service, it claims there is no need to consider performance or productivity and states it will simply apply a pay rate calculated and imposed by some outside group.  The Government claims everything in the garden is rosy but this is not the way it works in the real world.  If the Minister is serious in the rhetoric about competitiveness, performance and productivity which was speckled throughout his speech, he would know this <Col N="49"/>must apply to himself and senior public servants, particularly if we are to deliver the agenda he has set out for us.</P>
        <P>The difficulty is that the Government persists in managing its own resources as if productivity does not matter, it does not need to deliver efficiency and the strategic plans it announces do not have to be delivered.  It acts as if someone does not have to be held accountable for the consequences when these strategies go off the rails.  With regard to public transport, the Government has not delivered integrated ticketing or competition, although these were solemnly promised by Ministers, but no one takes responsibility.  The climate change strategy was announced in 2000 but nothing has been delivered and there has been no change in the trend line of Ireland&rsquo;s emissions of carbon dioxide, yet no one took responsibility.  With regard to e-government, the Minister had a high level Cabinet group and a group of Secretaries General and assistant secretaries but nothing happened and no one has taken the consequences.  The Minister and the Secretaries General do not feel they are responsible.  If an important strategic statement was involved, there should have been a roadmap with various milestones to be met.  If a milestone was not met, those responsible should have had to explain why not.</P>
        <P>We seem happy to accept that less than half of what was intended was achieved.  No one bothers to put up a hand and admit that he or she failed.  It is not good enough.  If we are talking about building a knowledge economy and building at the front end &mdash; the Minister&rsquo;s speech referred to how service exports will be built at the front end &mdash; the Government must take the issues seriously and drive e-governance and the application of information technology in government and people must be held responsible for it.  The tragedy is that we have probably reached a stage where there have been so many disasters in this area that public servants would probably see it as the end of their career to take on ICT projects.  No one will put up his or her hand and say &ldquo;I will drive an ICT project&rdquo; because he or she has seen the pattern.  This is a serious reflection on what has been happening and the laxity in the way strategic plans are drawn up, tested and applied.</P>
        <P>It is a serious problem which has run through many areas.  At the end of the day, competitiveness will be driven by the quality of our public service in many areas, and our ability to think strategically and make the necessary reforms.  In communications, for example, we are way behind on broadband because we botched the privatisation of Eircom, which was denuded of resources by a private sector company which wanted fast bucks and did not invest in the network.  We have been left with the consequences.  These were Government decisions yet no one troubles to ask why this was so seriously botched.</P>
        <P>While I am not blaming Ministers for all this, there is a major and repeated underlying failure to deliver in areas where the Government holds the ace cards.  Ireland has slipped in competitiveness, although the Minister&rsquo;s speech says it is regarded as one of the best places in the world to do business.  He should have added that we have slipped 17 places in the rankings in the past six years.  The Minister&rsquo;s scriptwriters did not put that in because they do not want to face up to it.  The sad point is that many of the reasons we are slipping in those places are generated from within the public sector for which the Minister is ultimately responsible.  If the Minister took care to examine reports by the National Competitiveness Council or any other bodies that examine why Ireland is sliding, he would see we are bottom of the league for ports, communications and energy infrastructure, all of which are Government responsibilities.  The same theme is repeated when one talks about competitiveness but the Minister does not mention the issues that must change.  It makes me despair when there is no strategic change of mind that would be necessary for us to survive in a tougher environment.  The property boom is over and it will not recur in the same way so we must now return to basics and survive as a small open economy capable of trading.</P><Col N="50"/>
        <P>From 1995 to 2000, export volumes grew at 20% per annum.  The Minister and his Cabinet colleagues are now lauding achievements at one quarter of that figure.  A little over 5% growth in exports is regarded as something wonderful but that illustrates the measure to which expectations and ambitions have fallen within Government.  The belief that a small open economy no longer needs to be driven by exports seems to have taken hold within Government circles.  If we continue to think in those terms we will pay for it.  I can see nothing in either the Finance Bill or the Minister&rsquo;s statement to show that the Government is doing what the National Competitiveness Council asked, to have a national plan to deliver competitiveness.  There is no such project.</P>
        <P>The Government has addressed regulatory reform but it has not put its money where others have.  It has not said it will reduce costs by 25%, as other governments have done.  The Minister is backing off and is unwilling to put his name on the line to bring about changes and make people accountable for delivering regulatory reforms in different sectors.  He is backing off from that.  Although the Taoiseach said he would aim at the 25% target, no Minister, including Deputies Cowen and Martin, will say &ldquo;Yes, we will set a figure of 25%; here is the baseline and this is our strategy to deliver a 25% reduction.&rdquo;  One must act that way to back up the rhetoric.  I have no problem with the Minister&rsquo;s rhetoric but I do not see the changes being made to match it.</P>
        <P>Perhaps I have been too long in the job as Opposition spokesperson, but I am getting really frustrated with the Finance Bill as a process.  According to the Revenue Commissioners, the amount we are dishing out in tax expenditure, as the economists would call it, apart from PAYE, marriage and other personal tax credits, is &euro;9 billion.  That is more than all but three Departments spend.  It is more than the Department of Education and Science spends but where is the scrutiny?  If the Minister for Education and Science proposed some higher education projects or plans for autistic children or disadvantaged schools, the Minister and his officials would go through them with a fine-tooth comb to see if they were justified.  However, there is no scrutiny for this &euro;9 billion expenditure under the tax code.  We are not even told what the expenditure is expected to achieve.</P>
        <P>No effort has been made by the Minister or his Department to offer a view of the tax code.  For example, why is there &euro;3 billion in relief on pensions this year?  Everyone knows that pension provisions are important but the ESRI recently showed that 80% of that money is going to the top 20% of families, so does that continue to be good public policy?  That matter is not debated in this House; we just pretend that the existing amount of tax relief is, by some strange chance, perfect and so we keep going.</P>
        <P>The Finance Bill and the Minister&rsquo;s speech deal with only a few marginal changes.  I do not object to many of them, which are worthy, and I will support them on Committee Stage but they are not part of the big agenda of how we can reform Ireland Inc.  If we want the tax code to be up to scratch we must be willing to place it under scrutiny, which the Minister has repeatedly been unwilling to do.  The one time he did so, when he commissioned work on tax reliefs, it was found that they cost twice the benefits involved.  It was found that at the time the Minister started to withdraw them, 60% of the costs had not yet been incurred.  It was a commitment over the next 13, 14 or 15 years on something that was not washing its face.</P>
        <P>The Minister and his predecessor delayed an examination of those reliefs, which probably should have been withdrawn in 2000 or 2001, if they were ever justified in the first place.  However, they persisted and we are only seeing the end of them in 2008 after a long property boom when they were totally unjustifiable.  If we had the sort of scrutiny I am talking about, including an obligation on the Minister&rsquo;s officials and the Revenue Commissioners to give us <Col N="51"/>some information, that would not have happened.  The Minister should not have allowed it to happen, yet he is quite happy to come here again and he has not learned the lessons.  The lessons at that stage included introducing a sunset clause on all new ideas, but I see no sign of such a clause in this Bill.  I am sure the Minister spent money on that report, which was a good one in so far as it went, but he has not learned from it.  The Minister is not offering cost benefits on any of the new reliefs.  Why is he willing to allow his officials to get away with something that he would not allow the Minister for Education and Science or the Minister for Health and Children to get away with?  This double standard will not deliver the best methods for public expenditure.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed at the way in which the Minister is handling pensions.  Everyone knows that we need to reform the pension structure.  The ESRI&rsquo;s finding just puts figures on what we have all intuitively known.  Half the population does not have any pension, while the vast bulk of tax relief is going to those who can make big pension contributions of up to &euro;250,000.  I acknowledge the Minister inserted a cap but it is at a very high level.  The truth is that the &euro;3 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money we are using to subsidise pensions is benefiting people who are particularly privileged.  We should examine that situation to see what changes we need to make but such an examination is being put off.  When Deputy S&eacute;amus Brennan was Minister for Social and Family Affairs he said we should have a one-for-one scheme and at least offer a real incentive for people up to a certain income, building on the back of the SSIA&rsquo;s success.  Why have we put that off?  It is not a big cost item and it could be accommodated as part of a coherent strategy.  It could be funded, if necessary, by putting caps elsewhere to take it out of the existing &euro;3 billion expenditure.  I do not see why we should have to keep delaying these issues that are staring us in the face and need to be addressed.</P>
        <P>Once again, this year&rsquo;s Finance Bill persists in not exposing the whole tax system to scrutiny.  We are selling the electorate short because we are not putting the system under scrutiny.  When things go wrong with public expenditure and people realise we spent it badly, we will not be able to say that we did our best to scrutinise it at the time.  We certainly did not do so in respect of all those reliefs that were abolished because they were shown not to be washing their faces.</P>
        <P>Last week, the IMF gave us a fairly timely warning when it showed that a 1% decline in the US economy could result in a 1.75% decline in the Irish economy.  We are exposed and cannot pretend, as the Taoiseach suggests, that it is all business as usual, nothing will happen and we will just continue with our policies.  We must square up to the issue of competitiveness sooner rather than later.  It is not enough to talk about the need for productivity growth unless one starts to drive it from within.  The Minister&rsquo;s approach to top civil servants&rsquo; pay is not consistent with his belief that driving productivity is the way to go.  We have also ducked the reform issue in many markets where the OECD and others have time and again told us that uncompetitive practices are persisting.  We still do not have competition in the public transport market.  It must be eight years since the then Minister for Finance stated this issue had to be addressed.  Why did we have to wait eight years for something to happen in this area?</P>
        <P>The list of areas in need of reform goes on.  Significant challenges are coming towards us.  The climate change issue will hit, hurt and cost unless the T&aacute;naiste is a fast mover.  However, the Government in 2000 moved to come up with a strategy but nothing was delivered under it.  That is not the way to ensure competitiveness and to proof the economy against the tougher winds blowing our way.  This must change, particularly when it comes to the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s own spending of public money.  The test of good governance is not the ability to spend, as a number of Ministers think when they refer to how much their budgets have increased, but the use of that money efficiently to make changes that affect people on the front line.  I have heard the T&aacute;naiste make his case previously and while everything is not deteriorating, a number of basic matters he should be able to get right are not happening.</P><Col N="52"/>
        <P>For example, I refer to the accident and emergency department issue.  The departments in the Mater, Tallaght and Beaumont Hospitals, which are the three largest in the State, cannot guarantee that old, infirm, vulnerable people who turn up for care will be treated in an acceptable way.  There is something radically wrong when the health budget has quadrupled and hospitals cannot do that.  Tests need to be put in place and someone&rsquo;s head needs to be on the line when services are not delivered but that does not happen.  Last week the HSE blamed the hospitals which retorted that they had not been given additional resources commensurate with our population growth.  Someone is right but there should have been a knowledge about what it takes to deliver a health strategy, that does not leave vulnerable people sitting on trolleys for 24 hours but that thinking never took place and everyone is passing the parcel when things go wrong.</P>
        <P>Ireland is entering a much tougher period and the T&aacute;naiste needs to move on from his contribution, which contains an element of self-delusion.  He referred to Ireland being top of the world and the best place to do business.  He said all we need to do is maintain our competitive advantage but we are losing ground in many areas.  The T&aacute;naiste is not putting the system under scrutiny.  I refer again to value for money within the public service.  The first initiative was to deal with one third of public spending through a three year programme.  However, that was completely demolished.  Under the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s predecessor, Charlie McCreevy, 0.25% of spending was scrutinised.  Last June the T&aacute;naiste announced 66 value for money audits would be carried by the end of 2007 but only 18 were completed and none identified a saving to be implemented.  Such audits must be carried out in meaningful areas and they must have an impact.  In addition, people must be accountable if the recommendations are not implemented.  However, that is not part of the process and that culture is not being built in.  The T&aacute;naiste must change that to ensure value for money audits are meaningful.</P>
        <P>Naturally, most of my contribution is critical but I look forward to Committee Stage when we will agree on some issues and disagree on others.  Regrettably, I oppose the Bill because it is not adequate in the context of the challenges we face.</P>

       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is quite apparent that the Government is paralysed, and perhaps the T&aacute;naiste more than most, by the ongoing saga of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s tax situation and his failure to obtain a tax clearance certificate.  Were these the Celtic tiger years, it may be of less economic significance.  However, since the T&aacute;naiste introduced his budget last December, all the economic indicators have been revised downwards, setting the scenario for much more difficult economic times ahead.  Unemployment is increasing, Ireland is close to the top of the European inflation league and the property market, despite the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s botched attempts at stamp duty reform, is as flat as a Shrove Tuesday pancake.</P>
        <P>All this means that families who work hard are worried about meeting their mortgage commitments.  They are wondering whether their jobs will be safe and, if somebody in the family falls ill, what sort of health care they will be offered?  Ireland has one of the highest levels of personal indebtedness in Europe, yet the T&aacute;naiste continues to insist all is well.  I refer to another indicator.  In 2004, 134 summonses were issued by the courts for house repossession.  Last year, 465 summonses issued, an increase of 350%.  This is happening on the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s watch.</P>
        <P>The Bill ought to be an opportunity to think strategically about the economy and to ensure that however difficult the international situation, we look to protect our own people, our economy and our society.  Previous Finance Bills from the Fianna Fail-Progressive Democrats Government created tax loopholes for the very rich when times were very good and now, when good government is required, the T&aacute;naiste has no answers.  The dogs on the street can see the <Col N="53"/>economy is slowing, and has been, since this coalition was returned to government.  The question is: What will the T&aacute;naiste do about it?  The Bill indicates his answer is: &ldquo;Not very much &ndash; let&rsquo;s just hope for the best and mosey on&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The global scenario creates a number of problems for Ireland, which will suffer the knock-on effects of a US slowdown.  The main domestic problem is the property market.  The fall in house prices over the past year has had a major knock-on impact on construction activity.  Employment in construction is falling and the live register is increasing.  Exchequer returns for January highlight the effect in respect of stamp duty receipts &mdash; they have halved &mdash; which is a major source of income for the Government.  The Government parties must be held accountable for their mismanagement of the property market.  They failed to control prices, and, having overheated the market, they were then directly responsible for the stamp duty debacle, which sent it plummeting.  Former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, started the stamp duty debate.  The Minister for Finance failed to address it until after the election.  I recall sitting beside him on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; nine months ago when he said &ldquo;I am the Minister for Finance.  There will be no changes in stamp duty&rdquo;.  He then introduced partial, half-hearted reform, which was unsuccessful.  Having to return to stamp duty in the budget was an abject admission of failure to manage this crucial sector of the economy.  The Government and the T&aacute;naiste have no plan B.  Do they have a view on co-ordinated European fiscal stimulus?  What are they doing to address the needs of construction workers being laid off?  Is the T&aacute;naiste still promising a spend of several billion euro on the decentralisation programme or will he acknowledge that it has run into serious difficulties?</P>
        <P>Having talked about a knowledge economy for so long, action is needed.  In particular, it is time to ensure the tax code promotes high-risk, high-tech activity.  Last week, the IMF offered a serious health warning to Ireland, saying a downturn in US economic activity would have a proportionally greater impact on the economy, while our own Central Bank revised its 2008 GNP growth projections downwards by 0.5%.  Only yesterday, Ulster Bank stated GNP growth could be as low as 2% for 2008, based on a projection of 45,000 residential unit completions.</P>
        <P>Given that downward revisions are trickling through across the board, the Minister&rsquo;s assertion last week that his budget day forecasts were still appropriate does not inspire confidence.  He has tried to claim credit for injecting a greater fiscal stimulus into the Irish economy than George Bush proposes to do in the US when the reason that we are now faced with substantial budget deficits is his prevarication over reforming stamp duty.  This prevarication came before he botched and redid stamp duty, in the process shattering the confidence of those seeking to buy homes.  As a consequence, Exchequer income from property has collapsed.  The fiscal stimulus which he talks about is therefore a result of careless management rather than careful planning.</P>
        <P>While house price moderation will be a welcome development for the many thousands who have been priced out of home ownership in recent years, there is a real danger that people who have bought a home in the past two years using 100% mortgages could find themselves in negative equity situations.  If a rise in unemployment is coupled with heavier debt burdens, we could start to see a lot more home foreclosures.  The number of repossessions has already trebled since 2004, according to figures supplied by the Department of Finance.  This week, <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> reported that the major Irish banks are sharpening their knives, with a prominent UK bad debt specialist licking its fingers at the prospect of profiting from what it called the macro-economic certainty of a steep rise in mortgage default in Ireland.  We could be in line for serious home grown sub-prime problems as those who over-stretched themselves with hefty mortgages during the boom times, egged on by the financial institutions that the Minister did not bother to regulate before last Friday, face a harsher economic climate.  When I spoke about sub-prime tactics in the Irish mortgage market two and a half years ago the <Col N="54"/>Minister did not even pretend to understand me, such was his arrogant confidence that all would be right on the night.  Large numbers of people losing their homes does not sound like the fairy tale soft landing we were promised.</P>
        <P>The flip side of property market instability is the slowdown in house building.  From peak construction of nearly 90,000 units in 2006, we are looking at the possibility of seeing half that number of units completed in 2008.  To put this in perspective, every reduction by 10,000 in house completions has been estimated to cause a 1% reduction in GNP growth and a &euro;1 billion reduction in Exchequer income.  We all knew that an output of 90,000 units per year was unsustainable, particularly given the number of houses lying empty and the near sufficiency of our housing stock.  However, rather than implementing measures to facilitate the transition from an economy which was over-reliant on house building, the Government chose to tinker with stamp duty, not once but twice, in the vain hope that the unsustainable could be made sustainable by waving a magic wand.</P>
        <P>Whatever about past mismanagement, we now have to look to the future.  We have to put in place measures to support the transition from house building to more sustainable and higher value added economic activities.  In this regard, we support the Government&rsquo;s new focus on capital spending.  After a decade of huge tax revenues, we are still left with a striking infrastructure deficit.  If we are to regain competitiveness and provide the world-class infrastructure and public services that the Irish people deserve, this continued investment is essential.  Our chronic traffic gridlock is just one example of how the infrastructure deficit not only curtails competitiveness but also impacts negatively and often severely on the quality of life of Ireland&rsquo;s commuters.  The Labour Party supports the front-loading of expenditure for public transport under the national development plan.  Delivering a public transport system that does not cause us to hang our heads in the company of our European peers is the least the Irish people deserve.  Improving our public transport system, including such overdue initiatives as integrated ticketing in our cities, would help to restore economic competitiveness, improve quality of life for commuters and go a long way toward meeting Ireland&rsquo;s carbon emission reduction commitments.</P>
        <P>While undoubtedly important, the switch from residential construction to infrastructure projects will not on its own provide jobs for all those out of work due to the slowdown in house building.  Young men in particular are at risk of falling into the unemployment trap if clear pathways are not outlined for them to acquire transferable skills.  There must be a significant focus on retraining and educational opportunities for such workers.  Without further up-skilling, many of them will not be able to compete for jobs in expanding areas such as financial services and information technology or develop the specific skills required for NDP investment areas.  The time for action on this is now, not in six months&rsquo; time when the unemployment rate has passed 5%, as the Government predicts.  We expect the Minister and his colleagues to address that issue.  That is the reason they are being paid their overly large salaries and even fancier increases.</P>
        <P>Unemployment is rising at the fastest rate in two decades but it is still far from crisis proportions.  We have a highly educated and productive workforce, a healthy can-do attitude and a spirit of entrepreneurship that has served us well and will do so again.  However, this is not the time to rest on our laurels.  As the economic clouds gather, we have to build on our progress by looking beyond an economy that is over-reliant on low value added construction.  We have to restore competitiveness while striving for social and environmental sustainability, ramp up support for indigenous industry and ensure we have a fiscal and infrastructural framework in place to support a high technology, high value added economy.  In short, we have to lay the foundations for a 21st century knowledge society.</P><Col N="55"/>
        <P>We could begin to lay those foundations with this Finance Bill if only the Minister saw fit to seize the opportunity.  Unfortunately, the most striking aspect of this Bill is its complete and utter lack of imagination.  It is a case of much ado about nothing.  With the construction boom ending, economic growth slowing and unemployment rising, the Finance Bill gives the D&aacute;il a timely opportunity to take the urgent corrective action needed to get our economy back on track.  Ireland has the capacity to ride out this economic storm if we give her half a chance.  We need to start by getting this Finance Bill up to scratch.</P>
        <P>While the Labour Party welcomed the improvements for PAYE taxpayers announced on budget day, it should be noted that they are so modest that with inflation hovering at nearly 5%, combined with recent mortgage interest rate increases, they will have been eaten up before this Bill is even enacted.  Spending power is on the wane for ordinary families, while a respite for workers in the national pay talks looks increasingly unlikely given that the Government is indicating it will take a hard line on pay rises.  This is the Government that awarded its Ministers and top civil servants amazing increases.  I ask the Minister to identify one recruiting agent who has offered to take Ministers or senior civil servants, bar a select few, out of the public service on a salary of &euro;500,000 per year.  I do not know where those people are and I do not see their companies head-hunting many Ministers.</P>
        <P>I admit that there are people who have done great public service in government.  However, I know of few private or public service employers who would pay the kind of money Ministers allocated to themselves in recently announced wage increases.  Why the Government needed to pay almost &euro;1 million in consultancy fees in order to obtain an answer in respect of Ministers&rsquo; grandiose pay increases is beyond me.  Those in government could have done the sums themselves and selected whatever amounts they wanted.</P>
        <P>If the Bill is enacted, a single person earning the average industrial wage of approximately &euro;35,000 will still pay tax at 41% on bonus or overtime earnings.  By the end of the year, very few taxpayers will be removed from the upper tax band and placed on the lower rate of tax.</P>
        <P>Reducing red tape and increasing the VAT registration thresholds will be a welcome boon to the Irish SME sector, which has great potential to be a growth area for indigenous job creation.</P>
        <P>Ireland is set to fall short of meeting its Kyoto commitments on emission reductions.  Those measures in the Bill aimed at reducing carbon emissions are welcome.  The legislation contains several gestures in respect of climate change issues.  However, it is unclear whether these tentative steps will really assist Ireland in meeting its commitment under Kyoto to reduce emission levels.  For example, the Bill proposes a pilot scheme that would give 100% capital allowances to companies for the purchase of energy-efficient equipment, encouraging the replacement of old equipment.  This proposed corporate tax break &mdash; unlike what the Minister promised in respect of such breaks &mdash; is completely uncosted.  All we know is that there will be a three-year pilot scheme, which will be overseen by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan.  Is the Minister for Finance serious about this tax break and will he outline exactly what is involved?  Is it merely a bonbon for the Green Party or is it significant in nature?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It will depend on the level of take-up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>While the thrust of these energy efficiency measures is welcome, will the Minister spell out in detail what they mean?  Measures to improve house insulation or to encourage the micro-generation of energy could have brought benefit to a much greater number of ordinary people but they are absent from the Bill.  There is no scheme to cater for people who insulate their homes, particularly those who live in older houses.  What will the latter get back from the Government?  If they buy pellet-burning stoves, they will benefit but <Col N="56"/>from where will they obtain the fuel for such stoves?  People insulating their homes would do a great deal more to reduce the country&rsquo;s carbon footprint.</P>
        <P>Another supposed green initiative in the Bill is the proposed mechanism to allow carbon credits to be traded as securitised assets on Irish financial markets.  I am concerned that this initiative is not so much about the green of the environment as it is about the greed of speculators.  There is a very real risk that this mechanism will not bring about any reduction in Irish carbon emissions and that the only people who will gain will be polluters and speculators.  Various individuals in the markets have referred to this as a welcome addition to the securitisation legislation.  Those to whom I refer have written about this measure in stockbroking columns, but not one word has been written about its environmental impact.  The Minister failed to refer to it earlier.</P>
        <P>If carbon credits become a securitised asset &mdash; in effect guaranteeing investors an income from carbon emissions long into the future &mdash; it may not be in the interests of the polluter to stop polluting or in those of the investor to see emissions reduced.  Such a misalignment of interests would be tragic for Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to reduce carbon emissions.  I am surprised the Green Party felt comfortable signing off on this matter.</P>
        <P>If it is to proceed, this mechanism will have to be carefully monitored to ensure that it does not become another playground for speculators.  In the context of volatile global financial markets, to which wrongly priced securitised assets have most certainly contributed, and the difficulties faced by the EU carbon trading scheme, one must wonder whether this is the most effective way of achieving reductions in Irish carbon emissions.  When it comes to global warming, markets may be part of the solution.  However, we must be vigilant to ensure they do not become part of the problem.</P>
        <P>In the debate on the relevant Finance Act two years ago, the Minister promised to introduce a very modest stamp duty on contracts for difference, CFDs.  The latter are, as he is now aware, a mechanism for gambling on the Stock Exchange.  When approached by brokers at the time and in the face of contrary advice he received from the Revenue Commissioners in respect of the introduction of this modest reform, the Minister sided with the investment industry.  In the intervening two years, CFDs became one of the reasons that the Stock Exchange has borne more of a resemblance to a casino or a bingo hall than to an institution designed to assist Irish industry.  When the governor of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland refers to poor sentiment towards the Stock Exchange, the Minister must consider what he failed to do and how he backtracked when approached by the financial houses.  I have a feeling that the position relating to the carbon emissions trading scheme is similar.</P>
        <P>To implement the EU energy tax directive, the Bill introduces, for the first time, an electricity tax at the minimum possible rate on non-household use of electricity generated from non-environmentally friendly sources.  This development, aimed at targeting polluting energy sources and promoting energy efficiency by businesses, is to be welcomed and could eventually go some way towards ensuring that 16% of Irish energy will be generated from renewable sources by 2020.</P>
        <P>On a positive note, I welcome measures to support the Irish film industry.  With several Oscar nominations in the bag, the talent inherent in the industry is there for all to see and the extension by four years of section 481 relief, combined with an increase of the ceiling per film from &euro;35 million to &euro;50 million, in line with the recent report prepared by Indecon, should provide a timely boost to the industry.  Continuing and enhanced State support for the cultural development of the country, not to mention the associated economic benefits, are something the Labour Party has supported since its inception.</P><Col N="57"/>
        <P>For too long, oil and gas companies &mdash; often granted exploration licences in dubious circumstances &mdash; have been in a position to extract fossil fuels without having to pay anything approaching the same level of taxes or royalties that are commonplace in other developed countries such as Norway.  While Norway has been able to use its fossil fuel reserves to fund world-class infrastructure, a competitive welfare state and its pension commitments for decades to come, Ireland has taken a very different path.  In effect, we have privatised the profits while socialising the costs of exploration.  The Labour Party welcomes the new measures to tax the super-normal profits of exploration companies exploiting our natural resources as a step in the right direction.  Why will this enhanced corporation tax will not apply to exploration licences granted before 2007?  Why should the measure not apply across the board?  Why should it be restricted to licences granted after some arbitrary date?</P>
        <P>The Labour Party also welcomes the reduction in the rate of VAT on non-oral contraceptives, from 21% to 13.5%, something for which we have long been campaigning.  We would hope to see this rate further reduced to 5% in line with the EU VAT directive.  This would reinforce what is an important development in the fight against the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, STDs.  I hope the Government also envisages enforcement measures to ensure that these VAT reductions are passed on to consumers.  Without such measures, this will merely be another profiteering exercise on the part of vendors.</P>
        <P>I have tried to emphasise the positive aspects of the Bill.  In previous years we discussed the degree of tax avoidance on the part of very wealthy people.  I refer here to millionaires who have large incomes but who pay very little tax.  We spoke about the phenomenon of those people who are non-resident for tax purposes but to all intents and purposes live in this country.  I have suggested strongly on behalf of the Labour Party that in a real republic, it is for everybody to make a contribution and pay a fair share of taxes.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance&rsquo;s Bill has nothing to say about cutting back some of the schemes which continue to unfairly benefit people at the top end of income in this country.  There are very substantial reliefs for pensions and encouraging people to hold pensions is a proper fiscal policy.  However, the Minister has failed to reform the pension code and structure it to ensure those in lower and middle incomes, those most in need of setting aside money for pensions, get the lion&rsquo;s share of the benefit.</P>
        <P>The benefits for pensions continue to go to people such as proprietary directors and others with very large incomes who can afford corresponding investments in pension.  There are also people nearing retirement age who own their own company and can have that company pay very significant sums of money &mdash; &euro;500,000 and upwards &mdash; into pension funds that attract the very highest levels of tax relief at 41%.</P>
        <P>Now the heat of the election is over, the Minister has plenty of time to consider how to retune the tax system so as to incentivise for everybody activities such as pension provisions that are considered not only worthwhile but absolutely essential.  It is very disappointing the Minister has failed to do this.</P>
        <P>He also failed to take into account that of the 2 million people at work in this economy, a significant number pay no tax because their income is so low.  These people are either in part-time employment or on the minimum wage.  Many of these could even get some money back if there was a refundable tax credit system, which would help their position.  The Minister is instead still relying on a very inadequate process of payments through family income supplement, which is not taken up by large numbers of people on low income.</P>
        <P>The Minister is still hiding behind veils or a green curtain with regard to the commission on taxation.  I put forward this Labour Party proposal every year for the past five years and I am glad the Minister accepted it and included it in the programme for Government.  We should <Col N="58"/>hear what the Minister intends to include in this and whether he intends to make the hard and difficult decisions in the harsher economic circumstances that lie ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Finance Bill and congratulate the T&aacute;naiste and his officials on it.  By far the most important challenge facing the country this year is the protection of jobs and all the progress made in our economy in recent years, as well as trying to make further progress against the background of a good deal of financial turbulence in the world economy.  Confidence in times like these is brittle and it is very important that we have a steady hand managing our economy and public finances.</P>
        <P>This Bill&rsquo;s function is in part to implement the budget, which we can view in greater perspective two months on.  The budget was mildly anti-cyclical, without taking undue risks with the public finances.  Inevitably, given the existence of certain urgent spending priorities, such as the new schools in areas of burgeoning population announced by the Minister for Education and Science last week and the need to press forward with the national development plan, including both public and road transport, money will be quite tight in a number of other areas.  I would not contemplate further cuts in taxes and the revenue base until conditions improve substantially again.</P>
        <P>On income tax, the <i>status quo</i> was broadly maintained, with the aim, as the T&aacute;naiste indicated in his Budget Statement, of keeping low income earners out of the standard rate band and average earners out of the higher band.  Equity has been the hallmark of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s stewardship since he took over the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s pledges in respect of stamp duty for first-time buyers and mortgage interest relief were honoured.  Indeed, stamp duty reform went well beyond what was promised and the tax was made more equitable and progressive, removing abrupt step changes which have long been a grievance.</P>
        <P>We should not object to 9% stamp duty on properties worth more than &euro;1 million.  The real incidence arguably falls on sellers, who in almost all cases will have enjoyed a huge capital gain if they have held the property for long.  People who can afford to pay up to &euro;60 million on a large house on Ailesbury Road and those who sell to them can well afford the 9%.</P>
        <P>Everyone is agreed there has been an unhealthy dependence on the housing and construction market, despite the benefits brought by the boom in many respects.  The measures introduced by the Government could not have been easily introduced when the market was overheated.</P>
        <P>As the Governor of the Central Bank told the finance committee last week, the correction taking place is both inevitable and necessary, and he stands over the prediction in the stability report signed off last September that the housing market is destined for a soft landing.  The price falls that have happened, particularly since the second half of last year, will make housing more affordable for first-time buyers and budget measures will reduce mortgage repayment costs for such buyers in recent years.</P>
        <P>Nobody now expects eurozone interest rates to rise and they may later this year begin to fall.  All this is helping to ease some of the inflationary pressure on earnings coming into pay talks.  There is no need for panic measures, without regard to cost or financial and budgetary stability, such as was advocated in a Sunday newspaper recently, which would be far more likely to undermine confidence rather than bolster it.</P>
        <P>Two other criticisms have been made of the Government&rsquo;s economic strategy which I wish to address.  The size of this year&rsquo;s budgetary deficit has been criticised and described rhetorically as the worst deterioration in the public finances in the history of the State.  This is similar to <Col N="59"/>comments just made about the most rapid deterioration of unemployment in 20 years to 4.9%.  Qualitatively, this is all nonsense.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste has kept well within the margins of safety, with a projected general Government deficit of 0.9% of GDP in 2008 compared to the Maastricht guideline of 3%, which many of our European partners have exceeded or are in danger of exceeding.  With the second lowest public debt level in the eurozone, we are entering this period from a very healthy position, in stark contrast to the state of the public finances in the early to mid-1980s.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste did his best to keep the economic debate during the general election on the rails, despite some of it bordering on the surreal, particularly when viewed in retrospect.  I am thankful the country has been spared any repetition of what happened in 1981, when power was captured by a coalition that had promised tax reform on the grand scale, only to realise none of it could be implemented.  The gloom and doom that was spread as an alibi for the non-fulfilment of promises and the large tax increases which went in the opposite direction kept confidence on the floor for the following six years.</P>
        <P>A second criticism expressed by a distinguished former Taoiseach of those times in a newspaper column lamented that more had not been kept in reserve in good times for use now.  As the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s predecessor as Minister for Finance also observed, it is very difficult to justify enormous budget surpluses when there are pressing infrastructural and social development needs.  There was an Exchequer balance of over &euro;2 billion in 2006 and how much larger was that supposed to have been?  It is important to avoid stop-go and abrupt course changes, and the continuity and firmness in economic policy management have been admirable.</P>
        <P>Very germane to the management of the economy has been the issue of benchmarking at all levels of pay.  Benchmarking was a vast improvement on the traditional disputes about relativities and we have been rewarded with some of the most peaceful years in industrial relations.  Claims have been made that the public service is rewarded better than the private sector, but that is certainly not the case at the top end of the scale, in regard to either pay or pensions, where the total pay package of top executives and managers in larger companies far exceeds anything in the public sector.  Even after a deferred pay rise, the Taoiseach and the Chief Justice will hardly figure among the top 13,000, as the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance informed me in a reply to a parliamentary question.  As a very perspicacious correspondent to this month&rsquo;s <i>Village</i> magazine noted, &ldquo;massive inequality of pay&rdquo; is one of today&rsquo;s private sector norms, which top echelons in the public sector should not be tempted to follow.</P>
        <P>The issue is not really whether senior public servants, be they politicians or civil servants, can command high salaries outside.  Many even relatively junior Department of Finance officials can command good salaries in the private sector and there are many examples of former semi-State executives earning large sums of money.  The Labour Party Members should examine how some of their former programme managers, advisers and even a former T&aacute;naiste are doing these days in the private sector.  It is wrong to give the public impression that nobody in this House or in the public service is worth very much outside.</P>
        <P>Public service has a different ethos from private enterprise and while I defended recent pay rises, they should be the last under the current terms of reference.  It is time to decouple pay in the higher public service from private sector norms because we cannot afford them and because they create inequitable and widening gaps.  For 30 years we have tried to follow this course and recent controversy has shown that it is no longer sustainable and is ceasing to be publicly acceptable.</P>
        <P>The closure of the former Barlo&rsquo;s plant in Clonmel brings home also that productivity and competitiveness are not only about pay.  The decisive factor was the failure to invest in modern equipment, which admittedly would have reduced the workforce, but not nearly so drastically. <Col N="60"/> It is highly regrettable and very disappointing when one of the most successful firms and entrepreneurs in Ireland buys up a group, fails to act on many proposals put forward to invest in it and closes it down after four years to shift production to Wales.  No sensible person objects to successful Irish firms spreading their wings and establishing themselves in overseas markets, but could they please keep the home fires burning?  One would like to believe that the best Irish businessmen are, among other things, committed to their own country, and most of them are most of the time, at least by their own lights.</P>
        <P>One of the things that business chiefs seem to underestimate is the value of support and goodwill in the domestic market.  Why should the Irish consumer feel the same loyalty to Irish brands, be they glassware, biscuits, sausages or designer radiators, when their manufacture has been shifted abroad?  I hope that the group in question and indeed any highly profitable Irish-owned firm that closes down manufacturing in a particular town or city in this country, will actively look to reinvest in that place, using the sites they own, their connections and traditions.</P>
        <P>As we all know, on all sides of this House at different times politicians are scrutinised and lacerated at regular intervals in the media.  If businessmen are ruthless and unsentimental in closing down and stripping a good business and shifting it overseas, public representatives have every right to be equally ruthless and unsentimental in questioning and criticising such decisions and those responsible for them.  A former Chief Secretary in Dublin Castle, Thomas Drummond, rebuked Tipperary landlords in 1838, when he reminded them, &ldquo;Property has its duties as well as its rights&rdquo;, and the same applies to the entrepreneurs who have piled up unimaginable quantities of personal wealth today.</P>
        <P>Coming to specific Finance Bill measures, those that assist the maintenance of jobs and investment in all sizes of firms are particularly important.  I welcome the lessening of the compliance burden on small firms in respect of preliminary corporation tax and the tax treatment of dividends received from foreign subsidiaries and the encouragement of e-stamping.</P>
        <P>Making the BES schemes and seed capital scheme more permanent and therefore more reliable and predictable is also welcome.  I welcome the tax incentive for investment in energy-saving equipment, which will contribute to helping us meet more demanding environmental targets.  A more emissions-sensitive VRT system and the excise on electricity tax, albeit not on households or most manufacturing, should also have a positive impact.  Many offices and buildings leave their lights blazing through the night and no doubt other equipment connected that does not need to be.  Anything that would provide an incentive to limit that sort of waste would be welcome.</P>
        <P>Measures have been taken in recent times, including in this Finance Bill, particularly in the light of huge rises in the price of oil and gas, to tighten up the regime governing the exploitation of energy resources.  I was surprised at what Deputy Burton said on that point because one cannot make retrospective changes without severe cost to confidence and something that would be regarded at the receiving end as tantamount to a breach of contract.  Such changes in the regime have been sought, among other things, by the Rossport protesters and I hope they will take it into account in considering when or whether to wind up their campaign, which I hope will be soon.  Several firms in south Tipperary, as well as elsewhere, will welcome the reduction of VAT on agricultural production of bio-fuels to 13.5%.  While food production remains extremely important, we also have spare capacity that could be used, not just for forestry, but bio-diesel production.  Reassurance may be required about the net energy benefit of such production.</P>
        <P>Caravans and camping parks are big business in one of our most important and still buoyant industries, tourism, which has good prospects in this coming year.  The extension of allowances for buildings is very welcome.</P><Col N="61"/>
        <P>Film relief has been debated in recent years, not least in the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  Incentives have to take account of the international competition.  Excellent films have been made in Ireland and we have to do what is necessary to encourage this to continue.</P>
        <P>I am a little intrigued by the reduction in VAT on condoms, which I presume is introduced to promote public health rather than promiscuity and reduce unwanted pregnancies and venereal disease.  Condoms are often extolled for their sensitivity, but I do not know how sensitive they are to price.  Will more potential users be feeling lucky, once they notice, assuming they notice, the reduced price?</P>
        <P>Research and development is vitally important to investment and employment in high grade jobs and I am glad the tax credit scheme is being extended to 2013.</P>
        <P>A final point for the Minister to consider was made to me by a tax practitioner in Tipperary yesterday.  Fines for even slight delays fall on the generally compliant and the uncompliant alike.  It has been suggested to me that such penalties should be applied in proportion to the taxpayer&rsquo;s record of compliance.</P>

	<P>I note that Deputy Mansergh agrees with our suggestion that public sector remuneration should be decoupled from the private sector.  I presume he put that to the Minister personally.  Will the Minister take on board what his party colleague has said and reduce the level of increase that he has taken on the higher remuneration?  The proposed changes are window-dressing because they will not come into effect for three years.  We need to deal with that matter now. </P>

      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
        <P>My point pertained to Government expenditure on the public sector, which went out of control in 1977.  On taking office, the former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, also referred to this point.</P>
        <P>As for the Finance Bill before the House, the main issue I wish to deal with is that Ireland will face into a difficult economic environment in the coming year.  One must ask whether this Bill deals with those issues and the short answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  As for the economy, the Central Bank <Col N="62"/>has stated the unemployment rate will reach nearly 6%.  The increase in unemployment in January 2008 of 7,800 people constituted the highest increase for 17 years.  Moreover, a downturn has taken place in the US economy.  The Dow Jones index fell yesterday, in part because of lower than expected factory orders.  Deputy Bruton already referred to our linkage to the US economy whereby every 1% decline in the US corresponds to a 1.75% decline here.  While the budget forecast for economic growth was 3%, economic commentators now state it could be as low as 2%.</P>
        <P>I tabled a parliamentary question to ask the Minister his budget projections for the number of house completions and the reply was 55,000.  At present, the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, predicts 30,000, other economic commentators predict 45,000 and, anecdotally, I have heard the figure could be even lower.  Every reduction of 10,000 in house completions means a reduction in revenue of &euro;1 billion or a fall of 1% in the growth rate.  A potential shortfall in completions of 20,000 houses corresponds to the loss of &euro;2 billion, which could have major implications for the Exchequer deficit and the general Government balance and could constitute approximately 2% of gross domestic product, GDP.  As the Minister has projected a figure of 0.9%, he could go perilously close to exceeding the Stability and Growth Pact limits.</P>
        <P>I do not intend to hold the Minister to account for issues that are outside his control.  When Ireland joined the euro, it lost control over interest rates and exchange rates.  However, low interest rates have resulted in massive borrowings by people in respect of the housing market despite repeated warning in recent years that 90,000 housing completions every year was not sustainable.  The Government should have done something.  Stamp duty reform was introduced too late and young people now face negative equity.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, almost as many people are employed in the construction sector as in the manufacturing sector.  Approximately 280,000 to 290,000 people are so employed, which is not sustainable.  Ireland is a small open economy and must consider ways to become more competitive.  In the context of the budget, the Minister has noted that the single area over which we have control is competitiveness.  In the House today, although the Taoiseach referred to productivity, I did not hear him mention competitiveness.</P>
        <P>Competitiveness is the key and the Government is partially responsible for our lack thereof.  I would greatly welcome Ireland&rsquo;s recovery of its competitive advantage.  At present, Ireland&rsquo;s exports are growing by between 5% and 6%, which is insufficient.  We must return to the growth rates experienced in the early 2000s, which were in the order of 20%.  The Government must take action.  First, it should implement the recommendations of the National Competitiveness Council that advocated setting up a group to examine ways of bringing about greater competitiveness.  Second, the Government should consider guaranteeing in future that in respect of those areas it controls, it will not allow any increases above the rate of inflation.  In recent years, prices in the energy sector including gas and electricity, increased by well above the rate of inflation, which has had major cost implications for industry.  Third, the Government should promote a knowledge-based economy.  The skills of the workforce must be improved and Fine Gael believes this should be done while people are at work, rather than after they have lost their jobs.</P>
        <P>I will turn to section 39 of the Finance Bill, which pertains to taxation of foreign dividends.  The Minister has introduced a change whereby in effect, such dividends now are being taxed at the same rate, that is, 12.5%.  My understanding is that the Minister has done so because of a requirement arising from a European Court of Justice ruling of last December.  The Minister should make such dividends exempt to enhance our competitiveness and ability to encourage multinational companies to locate their European headquarters in Ireland.  It is purely a cash flow measure.  At present, any company that receives foreign dividends will recoup the money. <Col N="63"/> It is purely a question of timing as such companies are obliged to pay by way of preliminary tax.  I propose a measure that would retain our comparative competitive advantage.  I will table an amendment to this effect on Committee Stage.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The budget was rudderless with regard to measures to deal with the economy&rsquo;s prospects.  However, I welcome some other measures, including the proposals regarding preliminary tax for small companies.  I welcome the increase in VAT thresholds and greatly welcome the extension to 2014 of tax credits for research and development.  While I welcome the accelerated capital allowances on energy-efficient equipment, it has flaws and appears to have been rushed and ill-thought out.  First, it only applies to companies although it also should apply to individuals.  Second, minimum amounts of money are required which means it will be curtailed for large companies.  Third, although it only pertains to specific assets, the assets list is not yet available.  Fourth, the Minister must secure EU clearance in this regard, which means the measure may not come into effect until August 2008.</P>
        <P>I refer to EU directives.  It is clear that many of the measures included in the Finance Bill have been dictated by EU directives.  It will be extremely important for the Government to engage in proper scrutiny of EU directives and the implications they might have for Ireland&rsquo;s economy.  Ireland must be extremely proactive in this regard.  I refer in particular to issues such as water charges, about which steps could have been taken and can be taken in future.  Such scrutiny will be extremely important.</P>
        <P>I refer to capital allowances linked to carbon emissions for motor vehicles and the VRT linked to CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.  Were the Minister&rsquo;s intentions genuine in respect of green policy, he would introduce them immediately.  The delay is creating an element of confusion in the market and I seek such a move.</P>
        <P>My main point is that the Finance Bill is a mishmash.  It provides no answers on the direction that people seek regarding measures to deal with the economy in future.  I have provided a straightforward solution, namely, Ireland must recover its competitiveness and its export industries must be allowed to operate competitively in the international market.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Devins, and express my disappointment that the Minister, Deputy Harney, cannot be present.  This is a very important debate and I find it extraordinary that she is not in the country when we are discussing health services that can be a matter of life or death for many citizens, particularly young people with cystic fibrosis.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks, we have all heard young cystic fibrosis sufferers bravely describe on national radio and in the national papers the deficiencies in services for cystic fibrosis patients and the unacceptable conditions they have been exposed to in our hospitals.  It is appalling that these brave young people have to resort to the national airwaves and newspapers to highlight the difficulties and dangers they face in the hope that they may force the changes that will give them a fighting chance &mdash; this is all they seek &mdash; to achieve the life expectancy of their fellow sufferers in Northern Ireland, Britain and the rest of Europe.  I commend Joe Duffy of &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; for highlighting this matter and giving it airtime.</P>
        <P>A similar media furore ensued, almost three years ago to the day, when the shocking findings of the Pollock report where published.  Dr. Pollock found that people with cystic fibrosis were being treated in facilities that were understaffed and dangerous.  How little has changed.  In response to the Pollock report, the Health Service Executive established a multidisciplinary working group to report on cystic fibrosis services nationally.  Although the group has concluded its work, its recommendations have not been published to date, cystic fibrosis services remain seriously understaffed and patients face the same difficulties in accessing safe services that they faced some years ago.</P>
        <P>The facts remain that more than 83% of sufferers have not seen any significant improvement in the treatment levels of adults with cystic fibrosis since the Pollock report was published.  There are no dedicated adult or paediatric cystic fibrosis beds in the country and every time a patient waits in an accident and emergency unit or is treated in an open ward, he or she risks contracting a potentially life-threatening infection.  Cystic fibrosis patients rely on the health service to keep their condition under control.  The lack of isolation facilities, both for outpatients and inpatients, poses a most serious risk of cross-infection, leaving cystic fibrosis patients vulnerable to contracting MRSA and other potentially life-threatening infections.  The Minister of State knows this well because he is a doctor.</P><Col N="65"/>
        <P>Patients are getting sicker in hospital and are spending longer in recovery because they are being treated in dangerous facilities.  This is why their life expectancy is ten years less than in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  It is disappointing that so little has changed three years after the publication of the Pollock report.  The only way to improve mortality statistics for people with cystic fibrosis is to protect them from cross-infection by treating them in isolation facilities that minimise cross-infection from other patients.</P>
        <P>Under significant pressure, the HSE has reluctantly decided to fast-track the development of St. Mark&rsquo;s Ward in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital to provide six single rooms within the next ten to 18 weeks and an additional eight single rooms by the end of the summer, resulting in a total of 14 &mdash; that is if we can believe its promises.  It has broken so many in the past.  Although the promised beds are welcome, they are insufficient, considering there are currently 18 cystic fibrosis inpatients in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital and ten on the waiting list.  This requires a total of 28 rooms.  We are deficient before we even begin.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Minister can understand our scepticism when we are offered promises and assurances about the delivery of projects, particularly within the health service.  In 2002, we were promised an additional 3,000 hospital beds but we still do not have them.  Instead, there is now talk of pulling 4,000 beds out of the system.  We were promised a permanent end to waiting lists in our hospitals by 2004 but this never happened.  In 2002, we were promised that full medical card eligibility would be extended to 200,000 people but this never happened either.  Can the Minister or the Minister of State, on her behalf, give an unequivocal guarantee to people with cystic fibrosis that six single rooms will be available for use by the end of April 2008 and that an additional eight rooms will be delivered by the end of August 2008?  Will these beds be ring-fenced for cystic fibrosis patients or will they be available to all respiratory patients?  I doubt that the Minister, who is not present, will make this commitment, considering that she told the House last week that she is terrified of giving deadlines.</P>
        <P>Considering that 20% of the 2006 budgetary allocation and all of the 2007 allocation remain unspent, one must ask when the recruitment process for specialist staff will be completed.  It was stated recently that 80% of the appointments have been made or advertised.  Talk about weasel words and doublespeak.</P>
        <P>With over 1,100 cystic fibrosis patients, Ireland has the highest incidence of cystic fibrosis in the world.  It is unacceptable that the average life expectancy for a cystic fibrosis patient in Ireland is the lowest in western Europe and that people with cystic fibrosis in Northern Ireland can expect to live ten years longer than those living in the Republic.  Northern Ireland is a mere 40 minutes up the road.  These appalling statistics are a damning indictment of our health service.</P>
        <P>It is inexcusable that we have no specialist unit, that money allocated in 2006 and 2007 remains unspent, that proper home-care support to prevent hospitalisation is not available and that we have not made any high-frequency oscillating vests available to cystic fibrosis sufferers.  These vests are not suitable for all cystic fibrosis sufferers but we should surely have an assessment system in operation to make them available to those they would help.  We could do this immediately and we do not need to erect buildings to do so.  Some people in Kilkenny have availed of the vests.  It is inexcusable that the HSE working group report remains unpublished, that we have no indication how neonatal screening will be introduced or the timescale and, most important, that we have no isolation beds and en suite facilities for cystic fibrosis sufferers.</P>
        <P>It is not just disappointing that services for cystic fibrosis patients are far below internationally acceptable standards and that patients must wait until 2011 for the new single-room block at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital.  One should forget about 2010 because the contracts are not being issued until the end of the year, as Deputy Shatter pointed out at the end of last week. <Col N="66"/> This means the building will not be finished until late 2010 and will not be commissioned until well into 2011.  It is disgraceful that we continue to imperil the lives of cystic fibrosis sufferers due to lack of political will to implement the clearly defined changes I have mentioned.  The Department of Health and Children is already aware of a company in Tyrone that will build a modular unit in four months rather than two years and whose services have already been availed of in the Mater, Beaumont and Temple Street hospitals.  The technology exists and all that is required is the political will.</P>
        <P>I want to touch on mental health services and the lack of funding in this regard.  My colleague, Deputy Neville, will also address this matter.  It is totally unacceptable that funding allocated for the implementation of the recommendations of A Vision for Change is being diverted to other areas.  The Irish Mental Health Coalition recently revealed that almost half of the &euro;50 million allocated for the implementation of A Vision for Change in 2006 and 2007 was hived off to meet current spending deficits in mental health services.  This is a downright betrayal of patients and a U-turn on the Government&rsquo;s own policy.  In this regard, we have heard more weasel words.</P>
        <P>While speaking on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; some weeks ago, the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, was unable to answer how much of the &euro;50 million was actually spent on mental health services.  Does this sound like a Minister of State who is engaged and in control of his brief?  Is this what we should expect from a Minister of State who has primary responsibility in this area?  The Government cannot pretend that it did not know the funding allocated over the past two years for the development of mental health services was not delivered.  Blaming the Health Service Executive for this is just not an option.</P>
        <P>In January, the Irish Psychiatric Association published a report entitled Lie of the Land which revealed that money realised from the sale of assets in the mental health service was not being ring-fenced for reinvestment in the psychiatric services.  Last week, Deputy Devins stated he had asked the Health Service Executive to prepare a report on The Lie of the Land in so far as it relates to the disposal of assets over the past two years.  Why only the past two years?</P>
        <P>In 1984, a document entitled Planning for the Future, a mental health document&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Section 15.11 of Planning for the Future, published in 1984, was to be Government policy.  The specified funds were to be ring-fenced for psychiatric and mental health services, acknowledging the fact that these services represent the Cinderella of our health service and always have done.  Under this Government, they remain so, and if it is left in power, this will always be the case.  I hope the day is not too far away on which we will have a change of Government, rather than a change of heart on the part of the Minister of State, to the benefit of those who suffer from mental illness.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will let us know when the Minister expects to receive the report on Lie of the Land and if it will be publicly available.  The proceeds of these sales are not being used exclusively for the provision of mental health services.  The Comptroller and Auditor General may have questions to ask about the value for money achieved in regard to certain disposals of psychiatric and mental health institutions.  All this is in contrast to the assertion of the former Minister of State, Mr. Tim O&rsquo;Malley, in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> of Tuesday, 10 August 2004 that despite opposition from the Department of Finance, he had &ldquo;secured Government <Col N="67"/>assurances that all proceeds from the sale of lands would be ring-fenced for funding of mental health services&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Will the Minster of State explain why the Government failed to secure the 2008 allocation of &euro;25 million needed for the implementation of A Vision for Change?  This speaks volumes about the Government commitment to psychiatric services; it is all vision and no change.  All of us are aware of the need for more funding.  Last year, the Inspector of Mental Health Services, Dr. Susan Finnerty, reported that less than 10% of psychiatric catchment areas were able to offer a range of services to people with mental health problems.  She expressed concern that there is no coherent plan for the development of services in the next five years.</P>
        <P>An independent monitoring group chaired by Dr. Ruth Barrington reviewed A Vision for Change and  found &ldquo;little evidence to show a systematic approach to its implementation in the first year&rdquo;.  The group noted that there was no implementation plan with objective action milestones or deadlines, the absence of which is impeding progress.  Meanwhile, the Chief Executive Officer of Mental Health Ireland, Mr. Brian Howard, catalogued a decline in services where, three years ago, there had been 11 suicide resource officers in the State, whereas now there are five.  This decline in service is all the more galling given that Ireland has the fifth highest youth suicide rate among 15 to 24 year olds in the EU.</P>
        <P>Some weeks ago, the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, criticised the continuing use of adult psychiatric wards for the treatment of children, with children admitted to adult psychiatric wards on more than 200 occasions between December 2006 and December 2007.  In 2006, 3,000 children and adolescents waited, on average, 15 months for assessment, with some families waiting as long as four years.  Waiting lists were even longer in 2007, with 3,598 children waiting for assessment, one third of whom waited for more than 12 months.  In 2008, with no money allocated for the implementation of A Vision for Change, the situation is likely to deteriorate.</P>
        <P>The case of the planned psychiatric unit at Beaumont Hospital is an example of the decline in services.  It was originally promised more than 20 years ago and was subsequently built.  It was used, however, as an overflow area for patients from the medical and surgical wards and now lies full of equipment.  A new unit was subsequently proposed and much time and money was spent on its planning.  It was sent out to tender in 2005.  We have since discovered, however, that a new private co-located hospital is to be built on part of the site.  So much for a commitment to mental health services.  It is a case of get back to the end of the queue for mental health patients.  In the eyes of the Government, which has presided over the health services for the past ten years, they are the least worthy patients.  This is because they are the most vulnerable and represent the least threat.</P>
        <P>Patients in north and north-east Dublin are still being admitted to St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital, where there are 24 beds, 23 of which are in an open dormitory.  Twenty-three acutely disturbed patients, many of whom are psychotic, are accommodated in a dormitory with only three feet between beds, in a building that was constructed more than 30 years ago.  These are Ceausescu-like conditions.  Many patients in St. Ita&rsquo;s are kept in chemical strait-jackets and drugged up to their eyeballs, a situation with which most psychiatrists there are unhappy.</P>
        <P>I heard recently of a woman in that unit who was assaulted by another patient who had been out on a day pass.  This other patient returned to the ward, took her pillow and tried to suffocate the woman in question.  It is a tribute to the staff of these units that more patients have not been seriously harmed or even killed.  This is no way to treat the most vulnerable in society in what is supposedly the second wealthiest country in the western world.  Despite all this, I understand St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital is operating a two for one staffing policy, that is, for every two members of staff let go, only one is replaced.</P><Col N="68"/>
        <P>There is no mental health service for 16 to 18 year olds in the Swords area.  Adult psychiatrists do not feel competent to deal with them and the services for children have insufficient resources to do so.  The mental health clinic in Balbriggan is an old prefabricated building with fungus growing on the walls.  What would the Health Information and Quality Authority have to say about nurses taking blood from patients in such conditions?</P>
        <P>This is how people are being treated in 2008.  As she does with every other aspect of the health service, the Minister pays little other than lip service to mental health provision.  It is one of the great scandals of the 21st century that some of the most vulnerable in our society are treated in this way.  Yet the Government continues to preside over this system.  It is time the Minister lived up to her promises instead of consigning the Government&rsquo;s mental health strategy to the rubbish tip.</P>
        <P>Mental health services are not the only services that continue to struggle.  I was alarmed last week to read an internal HSE memo planning wholesale cutbacks in front-line health services in the north east, including a 25% reduction in orthopaedic and elective surgery in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Navan, a scaling back of elective surgical activity in Louth County Hospital, a reduction in outpatient clinics in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, and elsewhere, elective surgery to take place only four days a week within the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group, the closure of ten beds at Monaghan Hospital and so on.  Tallaght hospital is in serious difficulty.  The &euro;20 million taken from its budget last year will not be replaced.  In addition, it faces a fine of &euro;2.1 million.  It is outrageous that the people of Tallaght should suffer because of the ineptitude of the management.  In addition, the HSE midland area plan involves a reduction in expenditure of &euro;5 million.</P>
        <P>It seems the new year is beginning with the same swingeing health cutbacks that took place in the last months of 2007 and which we were told were only a temporary measure.  This should be no surprise given that we were originally told, in the first half of 2007, that there would be no cutbacks.  This HSE memo is further evidence that the teamwork implementation project, the details of which were leaked on 14 May last year, is being put into practice.  This scheme exposed the Minister&rsquo;s plan to close accident and emergency departments in Monaghan and Dundalk in 2008 and Navan in 2009 on the basis that such actions would present &ldquo;major opportunities for savings, efficiencies and staff redeployment&rdquo;.  Nowhere is there mention of patient welfare.</P>
        <P>While the Minister pays lip service to putting patients first, it is telling that both these HSE documents refer to cost efficiencies only and not to patient care.  Hospital management is responsible for the hospital budget and it should take the hit rather than patients.  Members of management take fat increases in salaries as they try to convince us that they are doing a great job.  The reality is that the service is deteriorating.  There are no beds for psychotic patients.  There was no bed for 39 year old Beverly Seville-Doyle, a diabetic mother of three who died alone in a toilet in an accident and emergency unit at 3 a.m.  There is no bed for the mother of seven with a probable brain tumour who must sit at home having mini-seizures.  Up to 400 patients wait on trolleys in hospitals throughout the State.  The shameful list goes on.</P>
        <P>While there are plans to open a medical assessment unit at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Navan, and elsewhere, the true objective is to strip out services before they are replaced.  Last week, I received a copy of a letter by Dr. Finbar Lennon, a consultant at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, outlining his view that the hospital is not capable of dealing with the load that will be placed on it.  The latest we hear is that the HSE is &euro;370 million short on its estimated expenditure for 2008 before the year has even begun.  It is frightening that its solution is to cut back patient services rather than improve efficiencies in its management structures.</P><Col N="69"/>
        <P>The problem with the health service in general is that we have insufficient capacity to deal with the demand.  The solution is equally clear.  First, we must increase capacity.  This can be done by making better use of the beds we have in hospitals.  I have alluded numerous times to the 57,000 bed days lost between the Mater and Beaumont last year alone, the equivalent of a 150-bed hospital.  These patients could be treated in the community if facilities were available, including physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy.  We must also increase capacity by providing more beds.  There is no getting away from this requirement.  The consulting firm employed by the HSE has told the Minister there is a shortfall of 1,200 beds and that this situation will deteriorate unless we change the way we do business.</P>
        <P>The second part of the solution is to reduce demand through prevention.  I have called before for the introduction of an age appropriate annual check-up for every man, woman and child.  This would allow for the earlier detection and treatment of disease and help prevent costly complications.  We must work to prevent the incidence of illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease through education, dietary advice and regular contact between patient and GP.  This approach will take time to yield results, but for every euro spent on prevention, there is a &euro;20 saving in terms of treatment costs avoided.  The Government must have the political courage and vision to implement such an approach immediately because the benefits will be some time in coming.</P>
        <P>The health service has been characterised by failure after failure.  The HSE must report immediately on the proposal to reduce front-line services.  I ask that the Minister fulfil her Government&rsquo;s promise to implement the recommendations of A Vision for Change, that she request the urgent report from the HSE on the proposal to reduce frontline services, that she ensures, at a time when an additional &euro;1 billion is available to the HSE, that frontline services are not further reduced, that she fulfils her commitment on hospital beds and medical cards, that she gives us a site location map for the new psychiatric unit at Beaumont Hospital to replace the unit in St. Ita&rsquo;s for which we have waited over 20 years, and that she gives us the isolation units and isolation beds for our cystic fibrosis suffers so that they have a fighting chance to live as long as their counterparts on the other half of this island, which is all they want.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>It is regrettable the Minister for Health and Children is not here.  The Minister of State, Deputy Devins, might confirm whether her absence is due to her going to the Super Bowl in the United States.  I would have thought a debate in this House on the problems within our health service, particularly those highlighted by my colleague, deserves greater priority than it is being given.</P>
        <P>I wish to concentrate on cystic fibrosis patients and to add to what my colleague, Deputy Reilly, has said.  The manner in which we have treated cystic fibrosis patients and their parents and families is a national disgrace and scandal.  There are over 1,100 patients with cystic fibrosis in Ireland and, as has been said, the highest proportion of patients per head of population of any other country in the world.  It is a damning indictment of Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats health policy over the past 11 years that a person born in this State with cystic fibrosis has an average life expectancy which is ten years less than a patient in similar circumstances suffering from cystic fibrosis anywhere in the United Kingdom or in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>At a time of unprecedented economic success, the Government has failed abysmally to implement the recommendations of the Pollock report published three years ago.  This month we celebrate the third anniversary of the publication of that report.  It recommended urgent action to address the dangerously inadequate staffing levels; the designation of a small number of adequately staffed fully supported cystic fibrosis centres throughout the country; that adult provision outside Dublin should be developed urgently to create a balanced service with broad geographical coverage, thus reducing the excessive burden on St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital; that all <Col N="70"/>beds for cystic fibrosis patients should be in single en suite facilities to prevent cross-infection; that links between the adult and children&rsquo;s units be strengthened; that a microbiology reference laboratory be established &mdash; some have proposed that it be established in Tallaght; and that we have neonatal screening programmes.  Few, if any, of these recommendations have been implemented in the three years since the publication of the report.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;4.7 million in funding was set aside in the 2006 budget, announced in November 2005, for the recruitment of 57 additional specialist staff.  Some 20% of the 2006 allocation remains unspent and specialist staffing levels remain inadequate.  Budget 2007 allocated an additional &euro;2 million to allow for the recruitment of an additional 30 medical posts.  However, according to Godfrey Fletcher, the CEO of the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland, there is no evidence that this funding is being used.  The HSE working group on cystic fibrosis, established in May 2005, finished its work in August 2006.  Over a year later, it has not published its findings.  What is the reason for the suppression of this report?</P>
        <P>As is the position in adult hospitals, many of the cystic fibrosis units, including those relating to paediatrics and the clinic in Crumlin Children&rsquo;s Hospital, do not have ring-fenced, dedicated inpatient wards with single en suite rooms to prevent cross-infection.  There is a need to urgently establish such facilities in tandem with providing them for adult patients who suffer from cystic fibrosis.  This need was highlighted as recently as Thursday last by Dr. Gerard Canny of the cystic fibrosis unit in Crumlin Children&rsquo;s Hospital in a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i>.  When I raised it in the D&aacute;il last Thursday afternoon, the Minister had no short-term solutions to provide the facilities needed for children suffering from cystic fibrosis.</P>
        <P>It is appalling that neither the HSE nor the Department of Health and Children urgently responded to the need for single en suite hospital facilities for adult cystic fibrosis patients until the publicity of recent weeks highlighting the gross inadequacy of existing services and the extent to which lives are being placed at risk.  For cystic fibrosis patients, this is not a debating issue; it is a life and death one.  It is a life and death issue which the Government has to date chosen to ignore.</P>
        <P>The promised new ward to be built in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, contrary to the dishonest perception created by the Minister, will, as Deputy Reilly said, take four years to come on stream.  An announcement was made that construction would start this year.  When I questioned the Minister last Thursday, it emerged that construction would start in November or December 2008.  That was the January 2008 position.  Construction will take 24 months and thereafter the hospital wing constructed will have to be commissioned.  We are four years away from that facility.</P>
        <P>It is also not good enough that we do not yet have neonatal screening of all babies at birth for cystic fibrosis.  This has been provided for all newborn babies in Northern Ireland since 1983, some 25 years.  In the past two weeks, the HSE intimated that there was a possibility that it would commence this year in this State.  When I asked the Minister last Thursday if she could confirm with certainty that it would commence in 2008, we were told by her that she could not.  The benefit of neonatal screening is that cystic fibrosis is detected early and necessary treatments are provided early.  In this country, the average age of detection for children is two years which means treatment starts later than is desirable.</P>
        <P>It is truly nauseating that, in its proposed amendment to the Fine Gael motion, the Government applauds itself on the services provided by it to cystic fibrosis patients.  The truth is it should hang its head in shame.  The truth is that not only Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats, which have now been in continuous Government for almost 11 years, bear responsibility for the inadequacies in our cystic fibrosis services, but so too does the Green Party which <Col N="71"/>failed to make the needs in this area a priority issue in the Agreed Programme for Government.  The truth is that without the recent public furore, the 14 en suite rooms to become available in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital this year would not have been promised or be constructed.</P>
        <P>The tragic reality is that neither the Minister nor her immediate predecessors in the Department of Health and Children regarded the plight of cystic fibrosis sufferers as a priority.  This tragic reality was cruelly expressed by the HSE, I am advised, in replies forwarded by it during the previous D&aacute;il to questions tabled by some Members.  When explaining the HSE&rsquo;s abject failure to provide vital services, it did so in financial terms by referring insensitively to &ldquo;cost benefit analysis&rdquo;, by implication indicating that it would not get value for money by providing essential facilities required to extend the lifespan of cystic fibrosis sufferers and to protect them from cross-infection when admitted to hospital.  It is simply not good enough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the motion tabled by my colleague, Deputy Reilly.  As previous speakers said, Ireland has the highest incidence of cystic fibrosis in the world.  The Pollock report outlined clearly what needs to be done.  If anyone has any issue in regard to the needs that exist, all he or she has to do is to listen to the &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; programmes of recent weeks to hear the appalling reports of people who must deal with this issue on a daily basis and how they must interact with the health service.</P>
        <P>The basic issues which need to be addressed include single en suite rooms to prevent cross-infection.  Everyone who goes into hospital has a huge fear of cross-infection and of being infected with MRSA.  People are afraid to go into hospital as a result.  I can only imagine what cystic fibrosis patients face given that they are prone to infection.</P>
        <P>The funding allocated for cystic fibrosis is not being spent in that area.  In 2006, some 57 additional staff were to be appointed in this area.  One fifth of the budget for 2006 has not been allocated and the situation will be worse in 2007-08 with the ban on recruitment in the health service.  It is not only impacting on cystic fibrosis patients, but it is also impacting on nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, home help, speech therapists and psychologists.  It is impacting on the most vulnerable in our community.  Elderly people who need one or two hours of home help per week cannot get it because the resources are not being provided.</P>
        <P>Last week, there was the announcement about the redefinition of services in the north east.  The same thing is happening in the west.  This month, the Minister for Health and Children and the HSE will make an announcement regarding the review of services at the county hospital in Roscommon.  It will probably see the transfer of surgery, accident and emergency services and intensive care services from Roscommon to Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe, where ward closures have already taken place.  In December 2007, there were 102 people on trolleys in the state-of-the-art accident and emergency facility in Roscommon.  We are now going to transfer those to the prefabs in Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe that cannot even cater for the existing demand there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Deputy Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We are here debating this issue, but when the D&aacute;il was not sitting in January, the media highlighted the lack of services for people suffering from cystic fibrosis.  Orla Tinsley&rsquo;s wonderful article in <i>The Irish Times</i> probably sparked the whole debate.  It is appalling that the Government and the HSE only react when the media raises an issue.  The saddest thing about all those stories is that they involve young people suffering from cystic fibrosis who know that if they were living in another jurisdiction their quality of life and life expectancy would improve.  These young people just do not know what the next infection will bring for them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The media highlighted the case of 12 year old Ann-Marie Kelleher last week, who is suffering from Rett syndrome and scoliosis.  There was a reaction from a private donor, who volunteered <Col N="72"/>to pay for her operation in the UK, but all of a sudden the HSE found the funding and provided the services she needs under the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  It is a sad day for the Government when it only reacts to what is highlighted by the media.  That is no way to run a health service.</P>
        <P>There has been an asset stripping of our mental health services and a lack of funding that should have been in place for 2006 and 2007.  We now have no funding for 2008.  The National Suicide Prevention Office does not have sufficient funding this year.  We have no psychiatric bed facilities for young people.  There have been stories of young people in adult wards.  The situation is appalling and we badly need investment.  The amendment the Government is asking us to support is an insult.  The last paragraph asks us to acknowledge co-location and the fact it is providing beds in the system.  What are private hospitals on public grounds going to do for those who are suffering from cystic fibrosis and those who are suffering mental health problems?  It will do absolutely nothing for them and it is an insult to throw that paragraph into the Government&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
        <P>I support the motion tabled by Deputy Reilly.  We need investment in mental health services, especially community services.  I listened to a woman last week telling me that she was discharged from psychiatric services but that there was no community service and no come back.  Nobody was supporting her or ringing her to find out how she was getting on.  Nobody even knew where she was going when she left the hospital.  That is a revolving door system and the woman will be back again from the lack of support and services in our community.  We need urgent action in this area and we certainly do not need the neglect that has been evident from this Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the sentiments that have been expressed.  I recently went to a briefing of the south Tipperary branch of the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland.  I looked for the briefing in order to inform myself better on something about which many people had come to me as a result of the radio programme where the issue was highlighted.  I cannot remember the last time that I saw such anger, tears, disappointment and utter disillusionment with the work of the Government.  These emotions were universal throughout the room.  I met families who felt utterly isolated by the Government.  They felt the Government had turned its back on their plight.  We have lived through the most extraordinary growth this country has ever known, yet patients have seen no improvement and have only experienced further distress.  Things have not improved this year for patients, in fact they have got worse.</P>
        <P>I heard heart rending stories about people and their struggle with a life-altering illness requiring huge sacrifice from every family member.  These are sacrifices in time, money, comfort, careers and other aspects.  It is time consuming for all concerned.  There are hours of physiotherapy every day, along with over 50 tablets daily, fitness tests, hospital visits, consultant visits, emergency room waits and so on.  The HSE does not come out of this very well.  We have heard enough negativity so I will not go on about it.  We should do more from now on.</P>
        <P>The essential requirement of bypassing the accident and emergency department and providing isolation units for cystic fibrosis patients is absolutely key to this.  I believe some improvements will be planned in this area.  Getting a medical card and a carer&rsquo;s allowance should not be means tested for those patients.  The families affected should not struggle to finance constant medication, doctors&rsquo; visits, standard physiotherapy appointments and varied sports activities so that children can get adequate exercise and diet.  They should not struggle to finance high calorie diets with expensive diet products, transport to hospitals and overnight stays.  The reality is that these people suffer a great amount and we should not allow that to continue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is aware that the HSE is receiving &euro;370 million less than it believed necessary to maintain the existing level of services for this year.  The HSE clearly has been preparing for this, judging by its actions at local level.  I raise this issue because I have been unable to get a satisfactory response from the HSE to questions I asked over the last few days, where I was effectively refused proper information on what it is doing and who will be affected.  There is a widespread rumour circulating that up to 140 staff contracts will not be renewed at the Midland Regional Hospital in Tullamore, as well as a smaller number in Portlaoise.  I cannot verify the figure because nobody from the HSE will tell me.  When I quote a figure they tell me they did not say that.  Their response is that contracts are frequently not renewed and that contracts are often for a specific job only.  This belies the fact that those whose contracts are being examined include nurses, attendants and porters, all of whom are involved in the delivery of front-line services.  The notion that a nurse&rsquo;s work is complete is nonsense and the HSE&rsquo;s actions will have a direct effect on patients.</P>
        <P>There are four orthopaedic surgeons in Tullamore who are each only doing one hip operation per week, because 12 surgical beds and four general beds have been closed to balance the books.  In the absence of the Minister for Health and Children, I ask the Minister of State to direct the HSE to state publicly what contracts are under threat and what effect this will have on services delivered to patients.  What effects will this have on the opening of all facilities in Tullamore?</P>
        <P>I join with Deputy Reilly and my colleagues in their comments on those suffering from cystic fibrosis.  The unimplemented Pollock report was published three years ago this month.  I asked the Minister about her policy on the care of cystic fibrosis patients, about adequate segregation and about comparisons in mortality rates as far back as 2005.  I was told that the HSE multidisciplinary working group&rsquo;s work was at an advanced stage.  This remains the standard response, but the many patients who spoke, often on behalf of those who could no longer speak for themselves, proved all that is at an advanced stage is their own disease.</P>
        <P>Why is the mortality rate so poor here when compared to so many other countries?  What steps will be taken to address this?  We are now told, in incremental stages and depending on the level of negative publicity, that six single rooms will be provided in Saint Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital in the next ten to 18 weeks.  Can the Minister of State provide us with an exact timescale for the delivery of isolation facilities, both for inpatients and outpatients, on a sufficient level and geographical spread, to address the needs of patients across the country?  The urgency of this cannot be overestimated.  It is utterly cruel to leave these young men and women exposed to MRSA and other life-threatening diseases.  I am not sure whether the Government fully grasps the trauma for a young person in a ward with a much older seriously ill patient suffering from a range of illnesses and reacting in different ways.  Adding in the fact that the illnesses of such elderly patients can affect their lives we can get some idea of what a cystic fibrosis patient may have to face.  All Members of the House want to see real and immediate improvements for cystic fibrosis patients.  The difference, however, is the Government has the power to deliver, and patients are definitely not seeing improvements.</P>

	<P>This is an opportunity to debate our health services, the policies we are implementing, and the progress our country is making on the basis of facts. </P>
        <P>If our debates are not informed by facts and a recognition of progress that has been and is being made, then we have no rational basis on which to map out what needs to be done next, to make clear what our priorities should be, how to allocate funding, and how to build sustained improvements and higher performance.  This is the only basis on which those of us involved in doing, rather than commentating, can act.  It is only by recognising real progress that we can address real issues.</P>
        <P>I do not want to rehearse a long list of general statistics, but I want to address particular aspects of the debate this evening.  It is the truth, for example, that life expectancy has increased rapidly in Ireland in the last two decades, one of the fastest rates in the developed world, and especially since 1999.  Our cardiac and cancer services are improving constantly and are far improved from where they were, only ten years ago.  Waiting times for common operations have been cut from years to months.  The number of people with medical cards has been rising again since 2004 and more people can visit the doctor free of charge than at any time since the <Col N="75"/>early 1990s.  Our hospital services are expanding in range, depth and volume with many hundreds more consultants and specialist staff treating tens of thousands more people.  We now have home care for 10,000 older people where we had none a few years ago.  We have breast cancer screening where we had none and we will soon start cervical and colorectal screening.</P>
        <P>These are facts.  It is real progress and we are determined to build on this reality.  We are not where we want to be yet, but we are getting there.</P>
        <P>I will turn to some specific aspects of the debate and first I will address the cystic fibrosis services.  The improvement of services to persons with cystic fibrosis has been a priority for the Government and for my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney.  We are as concerned as anyone in this House to improve services and facilities for people with cystic fibrosis.  We understand the frustration of patients and their families while new facilities are yet to open.  However, we have begun to make progress in services.</P>
        <P>Following publication of the Pollock report in 2005, the Health Service Executive established a working group to undertake a detailed review of cystic fibrosis services.  The group, which was multi-disciplinary in its composition and included representation from the Department of Health and Children, was asked to review the current configuration and delivery of services to persons with cystic fibrosis in Ireland.  It identified a range of service improvements required, including the need to increase the level of clinical, nursing and allied health professional staffing in cystic fibrosis units around the country.</P>
        <P>Arising from the Pollock report and the emerging recommendations of the working group, the Minister for Health and Children allocated additional revenue funding of &euro;6.78 million to the HSE in 2006 and 2007.  This helped in the appointment of 44 additional staff, covering both adult and paediatric services across a number of hospitals, throughout the country.  The necessary funding is available to facilitate the recruitment of a further 37 staff nationally.</P>
        <P>The HSE was asked to place a particular focus on the development of services at the national adult tertiary referral centre at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, here in Dublin.  A number of capital projects have recently been completed at the hospital and have helped to improve facilities.  These include a new ambulatory care centre, the refurbishment of St. Camillus&rsquo;s ward, and a new accident and emergency department which includes single room accommodation.  I accept that these developments do not address the immediate needs of patients.  For that reason, the HSE is currently fast-tracking the re-development of a ward which is adjacent to the main cystic fibrosis treatment area.  The project is to commence within the next few weeks and will provide six single rooms.  On completion, additional work will begin to provide a further eight single rooms.  This will result in a total of 14 single rooms for cystic fibrosis patients by the end of the summer.</P>
        <P>In the longer term, a new ward block is to be built and will include 120 replacement beds in single <i>en suite</i> accommodation, including accommodation for cystic fibrosis patients.  Planning permission has been obtained, financial provision has been included in the HSE capital plan and the contract is to be awarded this year.  It will be a condition of the contract that the design and build period is to be not more than 24 months from the date of contract award.</P>
        <P>Beaumont Hospital operates as a regional centre in providing services to adults with cystic fibrosis.  In the 2008 budget a special allocation of &euro;2.5 million capital funding was provided to enable Beaumont Hospital to provide outpatient facilities for cystic fibrosis patients.</P>
        <P>An independent registry for cystic fibrosis has been established.  As yet, the data is not available to fully inform analysis relating to median survival in this country.  When it is available, the data from the registry will allow for benchmarking against comparable countries around the world to measure the performance of our healthcare system.</P>

	<P>The report of the expert group on mental health policy, A Vision for Change, which was published in January 2006, sets out a comprehensive policy framework for our mental health services over a seven to ten year period.  The report proposes an holistic view of mental illness and recommends an integrated, multidisciplinary approach to addressing the biological, psychological and social factors that contribute to mental health problems.  Special emphasis is given to the need to involve service users and their families and carers at every level of service provision.  Some misconceptions appear to have arisen on the funding requirement for the implementation of A Vision for Change and I welcome the opportunity here this evening to correct them. </P>
        <P>The estimated additional cost of implementation is &euro;150 million, that is,  &euro;21.6 million per year over seven years, or &euro;15 million per year over ten years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>Some &euro;25 million was promised for every year, which was not spent and it is now &euro;27 milllion, as revealed by a freedom of information request. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>The report is clear that new funding should follow implementation, and in this regard a total of &euro;51.2 million has been allocated since 2006. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>Thus, in the first two years of a seven to ten year implementation period, one third of the overall requirement has already been allocated. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not spent. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should deal with the fact that &euro;51 million was not spent on A Vision for Change and that only &euro;27 million was spent. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of this very significant additional investment in 2006 and 2007, it is appropriate, and indeed prudent, in 2008 to ensure consolidation of the investment to date and to make sure that the funding delivers what is intended.  In addition to the extra funding required to fund service developments, the report notes that existing resources within the mental health service should be remodelled and reallocated. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>That is 7% of the total health budget. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>There are of course substantial resources already invested in mental health.  In 2007, an estimated &euro;1 billion was spent on these services. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of &euro;1 billion out of a total health service budget of &euro;14 billion.  One in four people will have a psychiatric condition in the course of his or her life. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>The implementation of A Vision for Change is therefore dependent to a much greater extent on the remodelling of existing resources, rather than on new funding.  It is also clear that both the additional investment and the reorganisation of existing mental health services and resources must be managed in parallel.</P>

      </Speaker>

	<P>That is what the Minister is funding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>The HSE has advised the Department of Health and Children that because of competing expenditure pressures and the overriding obligation to live within the approved overall allocation, some of the planned developments in mental health services in 2006 and 2007 have been delayed.  While this has been disappointing to me and to all involved in mental health services, I note that some of these developments will proceed in 2008, for example, the provision of eight additional consultant child psychiatry teams, the provision of 18 additional beds for children and adolescents at St. Anne&rsquo;s, Galway, St. Vincent&rsquo;s, Fairview and St. Stephen&rsquo;s Hospital, Cork.  The provision of these beds will increase the bed complement from the current provision of 12 to 30 during 2008.</P>

	<P>In the context of the 2008 service plan, the Minister, Deputy Harney, pointed out to the HSE that there can be no question of diverting service development funds to meet expenditure pressures arising in relation to core services.  She expressed her concerns about the development of mental health services in line with A Vision for Change.  The Minister also pointed out that she believes there is scope within the HSE&rsquo;s overall allocation to deliver further service enhancements in 2008, over and above those outlined in the service plan, through improved performance, productivity and realignment of existing resources.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I will meet the HSE and the implementation officer shortly to pursue these issues.  I am pleased to reassure Deputies that the Government is committed to the provision of a high quality mental health service.  The service is underpinned by the comprehensive policy framework outlined in A Vision for Change and in Reach Out, the national strategy for action on suicide prevention.</P>

	<P>Furthermore, it is supported by the legislative reforms contained in the Mental Health Act 2001 and has been in receipt of unprecedented levels of funding in recent years.  Reach Out aims to prevent suicidal behaviour, including deliberate self-harm, and to increase awareness of the importance of good mental health among the general population.  A key component of Reach Out is to develop and implement national training programmes. The HSE&rsquo;s National Office for Suicide Prevention, which oversees the implementation of the strategy, is engaged in a significant level of training including the ASIST, Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training, programme and has already trained 91 trainers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>I assure the House of my personal commitment to the provision of quality care in the area of mental health, to upholding the civil and human rights of those who suffer from mental illness and to encouraging measures aimed at combating the stigma that is so often associated with such illness.  I welcome the establishment of the Office for Disability and Mental Health, announced by the Taoiseach on Wednesday, 30 January 2008.  The office will support me in the exercise of my functions in relation to disability and mental health across four Departments. In regard to mental health, the office will focus in particular on driving the implementation of A Vision for Change and will, I am confident, lead to more coherent policy making and the more effective use of resources.  The establishment of this office makes the political commitment to mental health by the Government a reality.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House in this debate.  In particular I want to build on what the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, has just said in terms of the Government&rsquo;s total commitment to improving the health services and working from the progress we are already making.</P>
        <P>Since 2004, the Government, particularly the Minister, Deputy Harney, have organised the largest ever expansion in services for older people, covering every area from new home care supports, more home help, long term care, palliative care and measures to counter elder abuse.  This is about more services and more innovative services, closer to older people&rsquo;s homes, designed around their needs and resulting in much better support than ever before.  Our plans and our commitment as a Government is to do more, year in, year out, to make steady, constant progress in supporting older people in every way possible.</P>
        <P>I wish to focus some remarks on the financial aspects of the debate, because it shows just how much we are backing up the reform process with high levels of investment.  This year, there is an increase of &euro;1.1 billion in overall health funding.  This is being done when most economic experts are predicting a difficult period internationally which will affect our economy too.</P>
        <P>In 2008 the Government is providing a total of over &euro;16 billion for expenditure on the health group of Votes.  This is made up of the &euro;14.931 billion for the HSE, &euro;695 million for the Office of the Minister for Children and &euro;530 million for the Department of Health and Children.  This represents an increase in health funding of 9%.  Once again, it places Ireland very high in international terms in relation to growth in public health spending.  This funding will enable, for example, the continued prioritisation of services for older people and people with disabilities, and the cancer control strategy.</P>
        <P>To put matters into sharp focus I draw attention to the following facts.  The revenue funding to the former health boards in 2004 was &euro;9.8 billion.  The funding being provided to the HSE for service delivery this year in 2008 is &euro;14.3 billion, an increase of &euro;4.5 billion or over 10% a year for the four years since the HSE&rsquo;s establishment.  In international terms according to the OECD, health spending in Ireland grew in real terms by an average of 9.1% per year between 1999 and 2004 while the OECD average was 5.2%.  Total health spending accounted for 7.1% of GDP and about 8.5% of GNP.  The relevant GNP measure is very close to the OECD average of 8.9% and this is without any adjustment for our generally younger age profile.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In terms of health spending <i>per capita,</i> Ireland spent US$2,596, adjusted for purchasing power parity, in 2004.  This is over the OECD average of US$2,550.  Alongside Norway, in 2004, Ireland had the highest level of public capital investment in health as a proportion of national income.  At 0.6% of GNP, this is twice or more times the level of most OECD countries.  The national development plan will continue a very high level of public investment generally and health capital development in particular.  To illustrate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to high levels of public health spending, in Ireland nearly 80% of health spending is funded by government revenues, above the OECD average of 73%.  This compares to a figure for Ireland of 71.5% in the mid-1990s.  This is the record of Government since 1997, consistent under three Ministers for Health and Children.</P>
     <?oasys _cl13.8- ?>
        <P>Improving the delivery of accident and emergency services continues to be a top priority for the Government and the Health Service Executive.  Considerable improvements have been made during the past two years in the delivery of services in emergency departments.  The <Col N="80"/>number of patients awaiting admission to a hospital bed from accident and emergency departments reduced by 50% between December 2005 and December 2007, from an average of 155 to 78 per day.  While there was an increase in the numbers in recent weeks due, for example, to increased levels of the winter vomiting bug and increased levels of influenza and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the HSE is working intensively with the hospital system to bring about further sustainable improvements.  The HSE and hospitals have our full support in urgently improving known processes that will speed up care and reduce waiting times for patients.  This is as vital as the new investment we have already made in hospital and long-term care capacity.</P>
        <P>One of the key issues being addressed is the system of discharge planning.  A major focus is being placed on ensuring the following: that all patients have an expected date of discharge within 24 hours of admission, that the expected date of discharge is actively managed on a daily basis against the treatment plan and any changes are communicated to the patient, that patients can be discharged in a more proactive manner at weekends, that there is an increased emphasis on nurse facilitated discharges and that ward rounds are scheduled in a way that facilitates a more timely review of treatment plans.  The HSE is also working closely with a number of hospitals which are reporting significant numbers of patients awaiting admission.  This includes a specific focus on the establishment of clinical decision units and short stay units to accelerate the throughput of patients who present at emergency departments.  Additional measures are also being put in place to deal with the issue of delayed discharges.</P>
        <P>I also hope in light of the successful conclusion of talks on the new contracts for consultants that progress will be made in advancing the recruitment of additional consultants under the &ldquo;100 plus&rdquo; initiative previously announced by the HSE.  The initiative is designed to reward hospitals which are operating in line with established performance targets.  The additional consultants are to be employed in specialties which can alleviate the problems which manifest in emergency departments.</P>
        <P>The HSE is also arranging for 200 additional beds to be contracted in private nursing homes with a particular focus on major Dublin hospitals.  The HSE advises that 98 of these places have been filled since the middle of January, with 85 filled in Dublin.  In addition, the HSE advises that it will be opening an additional 100 long stay beds from March onwards in a new community nursing unit at St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital in the Phoenix Park.  These will be used mainly for older people who have completed their acute phase of treatment.  These developments follow on from the opening in December of 94 additional long stay beds at Cherry Orchard Hospital.</P>
        <P>The HSE is proceeding with the implementation of an additional 360 home care packages in 2008 at a cost of &euro;10 million.  It is intended to prioritise these additional home care packages to support in particular the Dublin area and also a number of the other large urban areas and specific acute hospitals in Cork city, Waterford, Wexford, Limerick, Galway and Mayo.  Some 120 of these are scheduled for implementation in the first quarter.  We can be confident that the combination of these measures will lead to continued improvement in emergency departments.</P>
        <P>With regard to acute hospital beds, the health strategy of 2001, Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health System for You, identified a requirement for additional capacity throughout the health system and a need to reconfigure services to achieve maximum efficiency and effectiveness.  This covers acute services, primary care and continuing or long-term care, all of which is being progressed.</P>
        <P>For acute hospitals the strategy estimated that 3,000 beds were needed in the acute hospital system by 2011.  It is well recognised that acute hospital care is just one component of the health care delivery system.  Hospital services cannot be evaluated in isolation from primary <Col N="81"/>care, community and specialist services.  The need for hospital services is influenced by the availability and accessibility of those other services.  In 2001, the average number of inpatient beds and day places available for use in the 53 acute hospitals, now under the National Hospitals Office, was 12,145.  The provisional number of acute hospital beds recorded by the HSE for 2006 was 13,771 &mdash; some 12,574 inpatient beds and 1,197 day places &mdash; based on a total bed complement.</P>
        <P>Significant progress has been made in providing the additional 3,000 beds.  On average, over 1,600 inpatient beds and day places have come on stream since 2002.  Far from falling behind, this represents one the fastest rates of expansion of acute hospital capacity in our country&rsquo;s history.  In the modern era there has never been such a rate of new acute beds coming on stream.  The Government is committed in its programme to providing an additional 1,500 beds.  Approximately 1,000 of these will be provided through the co-location initiative and the balance through the Health Service Executive capital plan.  Both of these tracks are progressing well.</P>
        <P>With regard to the provision of 1,000 beds under the co-location initiative, this will be achieved by freeing up existing public beds through the development of private hospitals on the sites of public hospitals and the transfer across of private activity.  Significant progress has been made so far.  Project agreements for the six hospitals where successful bidders have been approved are due to be signed in the very near future.  Two further hospitals which are participating in the co-location initiative are at an earlier stage of the procurement process.  The co-located private hospitals will most likely open within three years of receiving planning permission.  This means that available public bed capacity in public hospitals will be expanded simultaneously.  Overall, it will mean new public beds being made available fast.</P>
        <P>With these developments, the Minister asked the Department and the Health Service Executive to review public capacity requirements in the acute hospital sector up to 2020 in the light of developments since the health strategy and the progress of this initiative.  The Health Service Executive recently published a review of acute bed capacity which proposes an integrated approach to health service delivery that seeks to achieve the right balance between inpatient, day case and community based care.  The review found that with future challenges, such as our ageing population and the increase in chronic diseases, we will need to plan for a 60% increase in demand for health care by 2020.  It suggests that if current practices and processes continue, the demand for public hospital beds will escalate to nearly 20,000 by 2020.  To meet this need we would have to provide the equivalent of 12 new 600-bed hospitals over the next 13 years.  It concludes that such reliance on acute hospitals for service delivery is neither sustainable nor in the best interests of patients.</P>
        <P>The review examined alternative approaches to meeting this demand.  It recommends an integrated approach to health service delivery involving substantial change in the way care is provided.  Among the measures proposed are significant increases in day beds in hospitals, more long-term care beds, more rehabilitation beds and more services in community-based, non-acute hospital settings.  The report acknowledges that additional beds are planned under the co-location initiative and under the HSE capital plan, and that this will meet the current needs.  The review also advises that services in acute hospitals should not be altered until viable and appropriate community-based alternatives are in place.  We believe the review forms a basis for discussion with key stakeholders on how best to plan for the provision of public health care delivery to 2020.</P>
        <P>The Government is also committed to the continued development of primary care services and community services for older people.  We will be developing and enhancing the range of services available in the community and providing for additional beds in the community for older people.</P><Col N="82"/>
        <P>What I have outlined gives a clear demonstration of the significant progress that has been made by the Government in its commitment to delivering an additional 3,000 acute hospital beds over a ten-year period, a target which, I am confident, will be met.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State moved the Government amendment, which states that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann &ldquo;welcomes the unprecedented level of funding being invested in mental health and commends the Government for the allocation of &euro;51.2 million since 2006, which represents a third of the additional resources required to implement A Vision for Change over the stated 7-10 year period&rdquo;.  This misleads the House because the implication is that the &euro;51.2 million is being spent on implementing A Vision for Change.  Last Thursday, during Oral Questions to the Minister for Health and Children, a number of Deputies about A Vision for Change.  Part of the Minister&rsquo;s reply was as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Department of Health and Children has been advised by the Health Service Executive that the additional &euro;51.2 million development funding was not used as planned because of competing expenditure pressures and the overriding obligation on the Health Service Executive to live within its approved overall allocation.  As a result, some of the planned developments in mental health services have been delayed.</P>
        <P FLI="0">There is a very nice phrase in the paragraph which states: &ldquo;It is appropriate in 2008 to pause and review the situation to ensure consolidation of the investment to date&rdquo;.  In my opinion, that is traitorous to people with mental health needs.  A clear commitment was given in the document A Vision for Change and funding was allocated but it has clearly not been spent.  I share Deputy Neville&rsquo;s frustration and I do not blame him for leaving this debate tonight because he has fought on this issue over a long number of years.  The fact is, however, that the money allocated for mental health was diverted to balance the HSE&rsquo;s books.  That was clearly stated last Thursday in a reply to a number of Deputies from the Minister for Health and Children, so let us not cod ourselves that this &euro;51.2 million, referred to in the Government amendment, has been given to mental health because it has not.  It is shameful considering the patients we are dealing with in this health service sector.  These people have been let down over the years.  They finally got a document that was supposed to address their needs, including a commitment that money would be spent, but it was diverted to other services in order to balance the books.  That is absolutely disgraceful.  On top of that, capital moneys from the sale of old psychiatric hospitals was meant to be ring-fenced.  The former Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, clearly stated on the record that that money would be spent on mental health services but we are now told it will be spent on health services.  Therefore people in the mental health sector have been let down again.</P>
        <P>I wish to reiterate the proposal from the Labour Party and Fine Gael in advance of the general election, which was that we would ring-fence 10% of health spending on mental health.  The only way the needs of that sector will be properly addressed is to ring-fence money in the health budget.  The HSE is leaking money right, left and centre but is not spending money on areas for which it has been allocated.  It is the Minister&rsquo;s duty to ensure that money is spent according to budgetary allocations.  If the Minister, Deputy Harney, was present I would clearly call on her to do that.  I did not get an opportunity to read these replies during oral questions last week as they came in later.  The situation is shameful, particularly as children are in adult psychiatric wards because we do not have enough beds for them.  There are 12 child and ado<Col N="83"/>lescent psychiatric beds in the whole country.  We have been told the number will rise to 30, although the figure in A Vision for Change is 80.  We are going to have such beds in Dublin, Galway and Cork but in the entire mid-west region, including my own constituency, not one single child and adolescent psychiatric bed has been, or will be, provided.  Many moons ago when I was on a health board &mdash; and we keep hearing health boards being castigated &mdash; funding for such beds was to be delivered in the service plan.  That funding was meant to be supplied for beds in Limerick as well as in other areas.  We now have waiting lists for years for young children to be assessed for speech and language therapy by community care teams.  That is disgraceful because it holds children back when we could so easily address their problems when they are young and give them some kind of quality of life.  The mental health services are being treated dreadfully so I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, will fight his corner for funding because there is a big fight to be fought.</P>
        <P>I commend Fine Gael on tabling this motion and in the time remaining I wish to address some other aspects of it.  I agree with Deputy Clune that it is wrong that people should have to campaign in the media for health services.  Young people with cystic fibrosis went on the Joe Duffy show coughing and in obvious distress.  We hope they will now get the required temporary unit of 14 beds before the end of the summer, along with a commitment to a more permanent unit in St. Vincent&rsquo;s by the end of 2010.  I agree with previous speakers that the timeframe is extremely long but it would not have happened if those young people had not gone on the airwaves.  We do our best in here but sometimes I think we are wasting our breath because the battle is all being fought out on the airwaves, which is how people can get their health services.  It is crazy that people must try to climb over others to get attention in the media for their basic health needs.</P>
        <P>I want to highlight the case of Ann-Marie Kelleher in Cork and will read out some of what I read about her in the <i>The Irish Times </i>of Saturday, 2 February 2008.  She has curvature of the spine which, by the time she got to see a specialist in England, was over 100%.  On 6 September 2007, her mother and father wrote a letter to Crumlin Hospital where she is on a waiting list for surgery, which stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">She cannot sit up any longer, she cannot sleep as she is literally wriggling around her bed hoping she will get a comfortable position that will allow her to sleep.  She would need changing three to four times throughout a single night due to the sheer exhaustion of trying her best wriggling about her bed trying to get comfortable for sleep.  She is in a ball of sweat constantly dealing with the sheer discomfort.  It is nothing short of cruel watching over her.  It is heart-breaking when surgery can change her life.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That letter went to the hospital and subsequently she was supposed to have an appointment either on 28 November or 2 December.  It turned out that was never actually pencilled in, even though it was notified to the HSE.  Then she was to have had another appointment which had to be cancelled because an anaesthetist was not available.  In the meantime, she had gone to the media and had visited a doctor in London who said the curvature was over 100%.  He said he was confident the surgery, which would have to be done at two different sittings about a week apart, could be arranged fairly swiftly.</P>
        <P>The waiting list for children in need of spinal surgery in Crumlin is, according to the hospital, up to 12 months long.  The hospital has said that 46 children are awaiting such surgery there.  They cannot go to Temple Street Hospital because there is an excessively long waiting list there also.  This child is one of many waiting for spinal surgery but when she went to the media the problem was suddenly gone and she could have her treatment abroad.</P>
        <P>The HSE says it is getting &euro;370 million less than it needs to maintain services next year, so we will have a continual build up of waiting lists.  Three months before the end of last year, the <Col N="84"/>HSE had to bring in an embargo even thought it received a much increased allocation in 2007.  I do not know what will happen to the health services over the next year.  We were told that many developments were delayed because of the consultants&rsquo; contract negotiations and we are now told that because that situation has been sorted we will suddenly get new services.  The fact is, however, that people in the HSE balance their budgets by using money that was supposed to be for new services.  They could not bring in those new services because they were told they could not employ new contracts because of the consultants&rsquo; contract situation.  If we are to bring in the new consultants and the fair deal, which was another big chunk of money they did not have to spend last but will spend this year &mdash; along with the payback to people who were wrongly charged in nursing homes &mdash; how will the HSE balance its books this year?  How will people on waiting lists get treatment?</P>
        <P>On 31 December 2007, a newspaper article stated that in some cases people were waiting over four years for outpatient appointments in parts of the country.  I fear for the health services in future because I do not think the HSE has the capacity to deal with these issues.  People like young Ann-Marie Kelleher are waiting in distressing pain, yet we will have more and more such stories on the Joe Duffy show because people see that is how they can obtain their health service requirements.  Somebody will have to call a halt to this.</P>
        <P>Last Saturday week, I held a meeting in the Mansion House on universal health insurance.  We must have a system whereby money goes towards treatment.  At the moment, if one is running a big public hospital it does not make sense to have many acutely ill people because they cost a lot of money.  One must balance the budget one gets irrespective of how many patients are treated.  Patients cannot be discharged because there are not enough step-down beds, so it makes sense to have people occupying beds who do not need a large amount of acute treatment.  The whole system is designed to use money badly and not to provide services where they are needed.  I am afraid that more and more people will approach the media in order to get basic health services.  I fear people with mental health problems and others who cannot shout very loudly will be put to the back of the queue.  Money must be ring-fenced, in particular, for mental health services.  Unfortunately, we will have many debates on health issues this year.  I hope solutions will be proposed but given that the HSE has been in existence for three years, we need to go back to the drawing board regarding the delivery of health services.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan for sharing her time.</P>
        <P>There is something deeply sick and shameful about a society where wealth and luxury are valued to such an extent that exclusive hotels, golf clubs and health resorts can be developed and built in a short time and supported by tax breaks for their wealthy owners, while very ill people have to wait for years in dangerous and disgraceful conditions before they see even the prospect of better facilities.  Such is the case with cystic fibrosis sufferers in this State.  The Pollock report was completed in 2004 and published in 2005.  It has not been implemented and people with cystic fibrosis face waiting lists, overcrowding and dangerous exposure to infection, all due to the scandalous neglect of successive Governments.</P>
        <P>I welcome and support the motion in the name of the Fine Gael Deputies and the priority given to cystic fibrosis among the health issues addressed in it.  The response of the Minister for Health and Children to my parliamentary questions and those of other Deputies is not good enough.  Every effort must be made to provide all the facilities required for people with cystic fibrosis, as recommended by the Pollock report.  No excuses will be accepted.  Once again we are debating a Private Members&rsquo; motion highlighting the perilous state of our health services due to the fundamentally flawed policies and mismanagement of the Government and the HSE.  A look back at the past month alone shows the depth of the ongoing crisis.</P><Col N="85"/>
        <P>People in the north east region, comprising Counties Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath, are incensed by the programme of cuts across all hospital services and at every hospital site in the region revealed in the leaked HSE memo.  Yesterday it was confirmed in the <i>Irish Medical News</i> that the plans for the north-east region were discussed at the December meeting of the HSE board and that these plans will be the blueprint for cuts in every region throughout the State.  This is something we in the north east, particularly those campaigning to save Monaghan General Hospital, have repeatedly pointed out.  The knives that will be used to cut services in other regions have been tested and sharpened on the people of our region, particularly the people of County Monaghan.</P>
        <P>What will the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies from Counties Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath do about it because they are the people with the greatest opportunity of making a considered impact on Government, Department and HSE thinking?  There is no use in them shaking their heads or tut-tutting to constituents and blaming the Minister, Deputy Harney, or their own party leadership for the 1980s style cutbacks that the HSE is preparing to impose in our hospitals.  This week in the D&aacute;il they have the opportunity to make their voices heard by supporting this motion or, at least, refusing to support the Government amendment.  They must make a stand.  It is not good enough that Opposition voices are continuously crying out for this to stop while others are clapped on the back and nothing more.</P>
        <P>I challenge these Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies individually and collectively to make their voices heard.  Instead of voting tomorrow night they should meet and devise a common approach to help ensure these cuts do not proceed.  They must take some initiative.  Lobbying the Minister or coming back with a reply to this, that or the other does not make the critical difference.</P>
        <P>The proposed slashing of services includes the closure of ten beds at Monaghan General Hospital, the reduction of outpatient clinics to four days per week in Cavan and Monaghan General Hospitals, the reduction of elective surgery to a four-day week in Cavan and Monaghan and the taking of Monaghan &ldquo;off call&rdquo; completely, rendering its medical and treatment room redundant.  I respectfully challenge Cavan-Monaghan Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies Rory O&rsquo;Hanlon, Brendan Smith, Minister of State, and the newly elected Deputy Margaret Conlon.  Will they support the Government amendment and simply troop in behind the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children while pretending to the people of Counties Cavan and Monaghan that they are doing something to stop these cuts?  I say to them, please do not take the people of Cavan and Monaghan as fools.  I have no doubt that each and every one of us will be judged not by what we say but by our actions.  Those Members have an opportunity and they must grasp the nettle and show leadership on these issues.  Let there be no mistake about it, If they did that, the Opposition voices representative of that constituency would row in fully behind them.</P>
        <P>Cuts are also planned in orthopaedic surgery at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital in Navan, elective surgery at the Louth County Hospital in Dundalk and outpatient clinics at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  What of the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies in Counties Meath and Louth?  What will the Ministers, Deputies Dermot Ahern and Noel Dempsey, Deputies Johnny Brady, Thomas Byrne, and Seamus Kirk and the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, do about the cuts in their counties?  That is what it comes down to, individual Deputies recognising that they are messengers of their constituents.  These cuts are but a foretaste of the full implementation of the Hanly and Teamwork reports in the north east and throughout the State.</P>
        <P>It is all a colossal fraud because to justify the cuts in hospital services and the over-centralisation of services in a few major hospitals, the Minister and the HSE repeatedly cite the key role to be played by primary care services, which they claim to be greatly improving.  However, where are the more than 100 primary care centres we were promised in 2001?  Far from improving, we are now facing a new crisis in primary care because of the shortage of general prac<Col N="86"/>titioners.  The north-east region again has been the first to sound a warning, with the Irish Medical Organisation highlighting the low number of GPs and the pressure they are under.  We have an ageing GP population, not enough trained GPs coming through and not enough GPs choosing to treat medical card patients.  The crisis has been compounded by the HSE&rsquo;s refusal to fund the additional GP training places needed to bring the numbers up to the recommended 150 in 2008.  The number of patients per GP in this State is too high.  The present system and the Government malaise on this issue are a recipe for yet another health care crisis.</P>
        <P>Two years ago A Vision for Change was published and it promised a new beginning in mental health services.  Progress since then has been far too slow and the reality is that people with mental illness are still being badly let down by the Government.  Mental health remains the most neglected sector of our health services.  It is again a scandal that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and the HSE have failed to produce and to carry out an implementation plan for A Vision for Change.  Essential improved services were promised but they are not being provided and staff are not being appointed because of the HSE recruitment embargo, as highlighted by the Irish Mental Health Coalition.  While additional funding for mental health was allocated in 2006 and 2007, no additional money was provided in 2008.  This is doubly damaging, as it was revealed that nearly half of the &euro;50 million allocated in 2006 and 2007 to implement A Vision for Change was spent in other areas.</P>
        <P>Despite all their fine words, the Government is failing to deliver for people with mental illness and it must continue to be challenged on this until A Vision for Change is fully implemented.  I cited the tightening of the recruitment ban by the HSE and the damage it is doing in the area of mental health.  That is true across all the front line of health care and is leading to further hardship for patients and a further lowering of morale within the health services.  I could cite many other specific and pressing health issues if time allowed but I will conclude with just one.  The Irish Family Planning Association revealed last month that the number of Irish women dying from cervical cancer continues to increase every year, despite the fact that this disease is entirely preventable through screening and vaccination.  There is still no sign of a national screening programme in this State nor a decision on whether the vaccine is, in the Minister&rsquo;s own words, &ldquo;cost effective&rdquo;.  What does she mean by that?  How many women&rsquo;s lives are worth the cost to this Government?</P>
        <P>All I ask is that the situation is changed.  I urge everyone concerned with our health services to unite in the demand for equality, excellence and the care that all our people deserve.  I hope Government Deputies will accept my challenge.</P>

	<P>Every Member of this House has had representations on this issue since we returned in October.  It is time that the dispute between the HSE and the IPU is resolved once and for all.  We were given assurances before Christmas that an independent process would be initiated to properly adjudicate the varying claims made by both sides.  Everybody agrees reform is needed to the general medical scheme and the drug payment system and that prices should be reduced, but the manner in which the issue is being approached is akin to hammering the community pharmacy sector.</P><Col N="87"/>
        <P>Two specific issues arise, the pharmacy discount scheme and the contract which affects the fee per item.  The current proposal from the HSE, known as the interim contract, provides that pharmacists will be paid 8.2% less for medicines supplied by community drugs schemes, including the medical card scheme and the drug payment scheme.  That any organisation would make such a crazy suggestion reveals a lack of willingness to engage in meaningful discussions.  Any discount or rebate scheme received by pharmacists is used to subsidise the current community drugs schemes.  The proposal that the discount scheme be attacked means pharmacies will be required to operate schemes on behalf of the Government at a loss.  No sector can be expected to manage such a scenario, regardless of how successful it is perceived to be.</P>
        <P>Each pharmacy has different discount arrangements with its wholesaler depending on its level of business.  The discount identified by the HSE is not necessarily the amount given to most pharmacies.  A small rural pharmacy, for example, would have a smaller discount than one in a large town.  The proposal for using one discount rate for the entire operation is a false one and it is leading to serious concerns about the future viability of community-based and rural pharmacies.  In recent weeks, I have met pharmacists in my county to examine their audited accounts, which they willingly presented.  The current interim contract proposal, which proposes a minimum fee of &euro;5 per transaction, could result in the loss of three jobs in every rural pharmacy in the county.  The pharmacists are willing to make their figures available for inspection.  Nationally, approximately 3,500 jobs could go in the pharmacy sector, with an annual wage loss of &euro;15 million.</P>
        <P>The town from which I come, Ballina, has a proud history of wholesaling.  United Drug was established in the town 60 years ago by local GPs who wanted a different way of supplying drugs.  The company is now one of the biggest drugs wholesalers in Ireland and Britain and employs 120 people.  It is important to note that United Drug does not own any individual pharmacies.  Its ethos is to support local pharmacies.  I am concerned that the HSE&rsquo;s current attitude will have an impact on the company&rsquo;s 120 employees who provide annual wages to our town of &euro;3.5 million.</P>
        <P>Since I was elected last June, the one issue that regularly arises in this Chamber is that the HSE is not working.  However, the one part that works very well is the local pharmacy.  As I travelled here today, I listened to an advertising campaign by the HSE encouraging people to attend their local pharmacies or GPs before presenting to accident and emergency units, yet, at the same time, the executive proposes to undermine the sector.  On 11 January, the HSE issued a letter to Oireachtas Members indicating its intention to enter into discussions with the IPU and other parties.  However, before doing so, it is proposing to undermine the sector by forcing people into this interim contract.  I am aware that all sides of the House are anxious for a resolution.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party held a vigorous meeting on the issue earlier this evening and asked the Minister for Health and Children to meet us.  The Joint Committee on Health and Children will also discuss the issue next week.  Given the 1 March deadline for acceptance of the interim contract, it is important this House is seen to act.</P>

	<P>I will respond to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
        <P>Following the completion of new IPHA and APMI agreements with drugs manufacturers in 2006, the HSE announced new arrangements for the wholesale margins on 17 September 2007 which affect the price basis for the supply of drugs and medicines to the State.  This is distinct from the dispensing fees paid to community pharmacists under the GMS and the drugs payments scheme.  The new pricing arrangements for community supply were planned to take effect from 1 January 2008 for wholesalers and due to the structure of the reimbursement system would have come into effect from 1 December 2007 for community pharmacists.</P><Col N="88"/>
        <P>The Minister has previously outlined in detail to the House the legal issues arising under competition law in regard to the collective negotiation of fees, prices or margins by undertakings or associations of undertakings.  A process of dialogue was established under Mr. Bill Shipsey, SC, to address concerns expressed by the IPU about the implications of legal advice on competition law on the right of the IPU to negotiate fees or margins with the HSE on behalf of community pharmacists.  In view of the engagement under Mr. Shipsey at the time, the HSE decided to defer the implementation of the new reimbursement rates which were planned to take effect for community pharmacists on 1 December 2007.  The HSE continues to keep community pharmacists informed of its intentions regarding implementation of the new arrangements, which is now planned for 1 March 2008.</P>
        <P>In consultation with the Attorney General, other relevant Departments and the HSE, the Minister has been exploring the best way of progressing the development of a new contract with pharmacists.  To this end, a process was proposed to the IPU at a meeting on 5 December 2007 by the HSE under Mr. Shipsey&rsquo;s aegis to address pharmacists&rsquo; immediate concerns regarding the alleged impact of the proposed revised wholesaler arrangements on GMS dependent pharmacies and provide a basis upon which discussions on a new substantive contract could commence.  The IPU was not prepared to accept this proposal from the HSE and, accordingly, no further discussions have taken place under Mr. Shipsey.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Notwithstanding the failure to reach agreement, the HSE has offered a draft interim contract to pharmacists to address their main concerns regarding the alleged impact of the proposed revised wholesaler arrangements on the GMS dependent pharmacies.  The details of the draft interim contract, and the HSE&rsquo;s other intentions in this regard, were set out in a letter to individual community pharmacists on 2 January 2008.  The HSE intends to implement the deferred revised wholesaler arrangements from 1 March 2008.  The executive also recently held preliminary discussions with the IPU on the development of a new substantive pharmacy contract.</P>
        <P>The Minister has asked me to assure the House that the Department is working to develop appropriate arrangements for the negotiation of contracts and setting out the fees payable in respect of contracts with private sector undertakings for the provision of health services on behalf on the HSE.  These arrangements may include the establishment of an independent body which would consider the nature of the services to be provided and all other relevant factors in each case and make recommendations in regard to the fees it considers appropriate.  The composition of such a body, its terms of reference and the timescale for its work are among the matters to be considered.  In line with the legal advice received, the HSE may enter into discussions with community pharmacists on the non-fee aspects of their contract with a view to developing a new substantive pharmacy contract.</P>
        <P>The Minister wishes to find a way of adapting the traditional process to arrive at revised pricing arrangements for pharmacy contract, consistent with the legal advice she has received.</P>

	<P>I am grateful of the opportunity to raise this matter in the hope of advancing a long outstanding matter to conclusion by the end of this year.  The lives of emergency services personnel are being put at risk because of the failure on the part of the Government to advance and progress the provision of a national digital radio service.</P>
        <P>I wish, in particular, to refer to the position as it relates to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is more than ten years since the Garda first requested a new radio communications network because its members could not communicate safely via the old network, which was then already 20 years old.  On 4 February 1999, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and <Col N="89"/>current Ceann Comhairle, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, in reply to parliamentary questions tabled for written answer stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The new Garda radio network will be introduced on a phased basis over the period 2000 to 2003, at an estimated cost of &pound;75 million to &pound;85 million.  To facilitate this ambitious replacement programme, a pilot trial of the new TETRA technology will commence this year, and the lessons learned will be usefully applied in the national replacement programme.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In 2005, his successor, former Deputy Michael McDowell, was asked when the long-promised digital radio system would arrive following a Deputy&rsquo;s description of how one of his constituents was burned out of his house when drug dealers listening in on the Garda analogue network heard his address being given as the source of a complaint about their suspicious activity.  Very little action was taken in the aftermath of these events and further pilot projects were promised.</P>
        <P>On 26 March 2007, Mr. McDowell, who was then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, announced:</P>
<?oasys _cl14- ?>
        <P LI="1">Tetra Ireland Ltd have been selected as the preferred bidder for the provision of the National Digital Radio Service and are currently working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other Departments and Agencies on the rollout of the service which will be delivered in two phases:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A service performance evaluation in an area covering parts of Dublin including the Port and Airport and north into Co. Meath.</P>
          <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Nationwide rollout.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The emergency services have been seeking the provision of a digital radio system for many years.  The old analogue system is neither secure nor reliable.  However, the Tetra system has still not been rolled out nationally despite the promises made by the two previous holders of the office of Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>The deficiencies of the existing analogue system are well known.  Communications can be intercepted, with dangerous consequences for personnel.  The radios do not always work, which has already endangered the lives of garda&iacute; and other emergency services staff.  No fewer than two pilot programmes have been rolled out in the same area of Dublin, and using the same technology, in 2001 and 2007.  However, the Department of Finance has seemingly refused to progress a contract for the nationwide expansion and development of the system.</P>
        <P>Failure to supply the Garda with up-to-date technology is tantamount to expecting it to take on sophisticated criminals with one hand tied behind its back.  The absence of modern technology for the force has been highlighted by the Garda inspectorate, which expressed its concern in respect of the current situation.  Regardless of whether it is cars, mobile telephones, e-mail or broadband, it is unacceptable that this matter has not been dealt with in an adequate fashion.  It is also not acceptable that the project to provide a national digital radio system is to disintegrate into another billion euro over-budget fiasco at the hands of the Government, which is famous for its inability to deliver projects within budget and on time.</P>
        <P>A spark of light appeared at the end of the tunnel during the speech on the Estimates by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who stated that progress will be made and that he has made a sum of money available to resolve this matter.  I would like the Minister opposite to indicate the exact amount of money available and what has been approved.  There should be no more pilot schemes.  When will the Garda be provided with the new national digital radio system?</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  </P>
        <P>The Government is committed to ensure that the Garda Commissioner has the necessary resources available to him in his fight against crime.  In addition to increasing the strength of the force, this includes the resources to provide a range of support services.  Chief among the latter is the provision of a new digital radio service for the force.  Almost &euro;100 million has been provided for Garda technology related projects this year alone and this includes significant financial provision for the new radio service.</P>
        <P>Significant progress has been already made in the planning for the provision of the national digital radio service for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Department of Finance has selected a preferred bidder &mdash; Tetra Ireland &mdash; for the service and is currently conducting detailed contract negotiations with the company.  I am advised that these negotiations are nearing completion, enabling a framework agreement to be put in place in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>In tandem, detailed planning and preparatory work by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is ongoing.  This includes participation in a service performance evaluation, whereby a live working system covering a significant geographical area in the Dublin and surrounding areas was put in place by Tetra Ireland and was tested by the Garda and other emergency services to ensure the company was capable of delivering a fully working solution meeting all of the requirements of an emergency services network.  National roll out by Tetra Ireland will commence immediately after the framework agreement is signed and is expected to be fully completed within a two-year timeframe.</P>
        <P>The provision of the digital radio service will provide a number of advantages for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There will be increased security of digital radio services because digital radio transmissions are secured against eavesdropping and interception, which is a major concern with analogue radio systems.  There also will be increased protection for Garda officers on operational duty.  For example, digital radios come equipped with emergency &ldquo;single push&rdquo; buttons, which will transmit an emergency signal to the user group and to the dispatcher in the event of an emergency.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will have the facility to dispatch assistance immediately to the relevant location.</P>
        <P>Another advantage will be improved voice quality and increased radio coverage.  The new digital radio service will offer An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na a minimum of 96% hand-held radio coverage in any one square kilometre of the country, with most areas having more than 99% coverage.  The new digital radio service will also provide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the ability to allow person-to-person or group communication between locations nationwide, as well as providing coverage for air support and off shore operations.</P>
        <P>Communication with other emergency services will be improved so that, for emergencies and other operational reasons, a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can be in direct communications with his or her counterparts in the other emergency services.  Additional services such as communications with mobile and land line telephone systems and data services such as the transmission to officers in the field of photographs of wanted or missing persons will also be provided.  The final advantage is that there will be interoperability with other police forces, such as with the digital radio system used by the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, as provided for under the intergovernmental agreement on North-South police co-operation.</P>
        <P>The Government has consistently given its commitment that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will receive every support to assist it in its fight against crime.  The Garda budget across all areas for 2008 is more than &euro;1.6 billion, which represents an 11% increase on the 2007 allocation.  This will enable the early implementation of the national digital radio service, as well as a broad range of other technology projects being introduced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

      <sTitle>Electricity Interconnector.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources for being present.  It is not that often that Ministers appear in the Chamber to answer questions directly.  He should not be too intimidated that four Members on this side have all raised the same matter.</P>
        <P>The Minister will be aware that this has become a major political issue in three counties.  The purpose of our raising it is to establish the Government&rsquo;s approach to it.  We are getting conflicting messages from senior Ministers in respect of that approach.  At an Oireachtas committee meeting last week, the Minister stated that he does not have a role in directing Eirgrid to do anything, that this matter falls within the company&rsquo;s remit and not his and that it is its responsibility to build a North-South interconnector.  He also stated that Eirgrid would also be obliged to undergo the process relating to consultation and planning but that, outside of this, he does not have a role to play.</P>
        <P>At the weekend, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, who happens to represent the constituencies concerned, called for the interconnector to be laid underground.  He even suggested that he had obtained advice from the National Roads Authority, NRA, on the feasibility of the interconnector being laid underground adjacent to the route of the M3 motorway.  A number of weeks ago, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, scoffed at the idea that this item of infrastructure could be laid underground.  He dismissed the idea as being far too expensive and stated that it should not be even considered.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources outline the Government&rsquo;s direction to Eirgrid on this issue?  The Fine Gael position is clear.  For more than three months we have been stating that a debate should take place following the compilation of an independently commissioned and paid for study.  We could at least begin the conversation with credible and independent facts detailing whether it is possible to put a 400 kV line as part of new grid infrastructure underground, overground or partially underground.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister will tonight announce that his Department will sponsor such a study so we can have an informed and educated debate on what is possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak to this important issue and I thank the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, not only for coming here but for listening to us at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources last Tuesday.</P>
        <P>Few issues apart from the Monaghan General Hospital matter have caused as much anger and annoyance as the proposed new power line to come across Meath, Cavan and Monaghan.  It is vital we get an answer tonight on whether the Government or EirGrid will pay for a totally independent person or company to give us a true indication of whether it is possible to place this power line underground, and if it is, at what cost.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance has already suggested it would cost at least ten times as much to place the line underground as it would overground.  Others have used even wilder figures.  It is interesting that the local Minister in County Meath, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has stated that the line must go underground and should be put along the M3 motorway.  If ever there was a clear indication of the lack of Cabinet cohesion or joined-up thinking, that is surely it.</P>
        <P>Why could this line not have gone either along the coast or through County Louth, where the land would be much more flat and less difficult to deal with?  One must question where the responsibility lies.  Does it lie with the Minister for Communications, Energy and National Resources, the board of EirGrid or both?  One cannot forget the board of EirGrid was mostly appointed by the then Minister responsible for this area, Deputy Noel Dempsey.</P><Col N="92"/>
        <P>People are clearly worried for many reasons, with health of major importance.  There are so many so-called experts in this field that is difficult to know the facts.  The land over which the line would go, and that adjacent to the line, would clearly be frozen and be beyond consideration for industrial and private premises.  The property of some people will not even be eligible for compensation if EirGrid uses its significant financial backing to try to buy out individuals.</P>
        <P>I beg the Minister either to agree to fund an independent study himself or ensure EirGrid does so immediately.  This is clearly the first of many proposed lines by EirGrid throughout the island of Ireland and if we can get this one right, with a realistic and common sense approach, it will ease the way for all other projects to be moved forward.  This is important for the sake of better power structures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Minister is here as it demonstrates he is at least open to debate on this subject.  I have some quick comments because we are very short on time.</P>
        <P>I will not enter the health debate in this matter as we will have it another day.  People have serious health concerns about this project nonetheless.  Neither the Government, EirGrid nor anybody else can guarantee everybody will be safe with these lines.  Conversely, nobody can say that lives are in danger, as neither side can provide proof.  I cannot point to a child anywhere in the world who died because of magnetic fields, although there are reports that raise serious doubts.  EirGrid cannot state that the power lines are safe either.  We owe it to the people to check every possibility before we spend taxpayers&rsquo; money putting this line over their heads.</P>
        <P>A person speaking on radio recently implied that he advised the Italian Government years ago that it was okay for four or five children to die over a 20 or 30-year period.  That person claimed to be speaking in regard to EirGrid and should be sacked on the spot for saying such things.  It is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>All we are asking is that the Minister should check the matter.  It is possible, using modern technology, to go underground.  Private companies have built such lines underground very cheaply in Estonia, South America and Australia.  I accept that companies such as EirGrid across the world do not want to take the option of going underground.  They do not want to even consider it, for whatever reason.  These companies should be forced to consider the option so we can have a proper debate.</P>
        <P>EirGrid&rsquo;s claim that it will cost ten times as much to put the line underground is an untruth.  The company does not know what that would cost, so it cannot make such a claim.  For EirGrid to stand in front of the people of Meath and argue it is not possible to go underground is also a lie.  It is not good enough that a State company is telling mistruths when the issue involves people&rsquo;s health and their community.</P>
        <P>EirGrid is an arm of Government, so this Government &mdash; including the Minister and his Department &mdash; has a duty to check out the issues, including new technology and proper costs.  We should have a real discussion on the matter.  I have spoken to representatives of companies who can put this line underground for nearly the same price.  That is not five times or ten times the estimated cost.  We should at least consider such options.  If the project went to tender, companies would offer to put the line underground for a cheaper price than EirGrid&rsquo;s estimate for over the ground.  The Minister should at least consider these options.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>Like my fellow Deputies, I appreciate being given the chance to speak and it is good that the Minister is here.  I have been in the D&aacute;il for three years but I have not enjoyed anything as much as the meeting we had last week in committee.</P><Col N="93"/>
        <P>We know plans for Ireland&rsquo;s energy over the next 20 years must be put in place and we cannot depend on oil any longer.  That we are in a position to provide so much energy of our own, and even become an exporter of energy, is crucial to the programme set in front of us by the Minister.  The last comment I made to the Minister at our meeting asked him to take control of this issue as a Minister outside the three counties who knows there are 20 other programmes of this type to go into place.  Neither the Minister nor any other Deputy wants what we have in our counties.</P>
        <P>EirGrid has not been straight with the people and it has tried to railroad us.  Our local Minister spoke last week for votes and was not very genuine about the matter.  It is only three months since he told the people in County Meath, when they first went to him, that this matter would never even be discussed in the D&aacute;il or at Cabinet level.  He was wrong and it was wrong of him just to go for votes last week when he spoke to the <i>Sunday Business Post</i>.  It was a stupid action and the people of Meath definitely did not fall for it.</P>
        <P>I will back the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to the hilt and he has the full backing of the Irish people for his programme.  However, he should not try to put it through without giving us a proper price.  Everyone knows it is not a case of &euro;1.8 billion versus &euro;180 million.  ESB International carried out its own study on the matter and somebody should look at it.  The people employed by ESB International are quite surprised at the new technology that will help to bring down the cost of this project.</P>
        <P>Before the people descend on this city in their thousands, the Minister should give them what they are entitled to, a price on overground versus underground projects.  He can then sit down with these people, and as I previously stated, he will be pleasantly surprised by the co-operation he receives.  If the Minister does not do this, we will still be looking for oil at $150 a barrel ten years down the road.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the four Deputies for raising this issue, which is rightly the subject of extensive debate, both here and in the Oireachtas committee where the discussion has already started.  It is part a broader discussion which is of vital national importance.  This is the need to ensure our electricity transmission system is adequate to meet current and future electricity demand and how we can deliver on the critical infrastructure required to meet this need.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s overriding policy objective is to ensure energy is consistently available at competitive prices with minimal risk of supply disruption in order to meet the needs of businesses and domestic customers.  The availability of a reliable, secure and competitive electricity supply requires ongoing investment in transmission and distribution networks.  The Government&rsquo;s White Paper on energy policy commits to the development of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity transmission and distribution network to meet current and future electricity demand.</P>
        <P>There are currently approximately 6,000 km of high voltage electricity lines in Ireland, of which 439 km are 400 kV lines.  Development of the electricity grid will require further investment in transmission and distribution lines.  EirGrid plc is a State-owned company which has responsibility for operating the electricity transmission system in Ireland and the wholesale electricity trading system.  It delivers connections, transmission and market services to generators, suppliers and customers using the high-voltage electricity system.  EirGrid is also responsible for the development of a transmission system which comprises the high voltage lines.</P>
        <P>As part of its ongoing grid development programme and in line with the Government&rsquo;s energy White Paper, EirGrid is currently planning the construction and reinforcement of the transmission system by means of constructing a number of transmission lines, including the North-South line, the Meath-Cavan line and the proposed East-West interconnector.</P><Col N="94"/>
      
        <P>The new transmission lines are very important to the north-east region.  They will bring critical infrastructure to the region, that is, the power lines will help ensure the delivery of high quality and highly reliable services.  The new lines will also facilitate competition as part of the all-island electricity market, and will ultimately supply the needs of new householders and commercial customers who have connected in recent years.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The existing transmission lines in the region are expected to reach full capacity over the coming years.  If they are not upgraded the electricity supply to the area will eventually fall below the specification required by many industrial and service companies when deciding on local investments.  Specifically, the new lines will help ensure a future secure supply of electricity throughout the north east, facilitate cross-Border sharing of electricity, assist in promoting better competition and thereby reduce electricity costs, facilitate increased connection of renewable energy, upgrade existing electricity supplies and facilitate inward investment into the region.</P>
        <P>The North-South 400 kV transmission line will more than double the current power transfer capacity between the North and the South.  This new line will span approximately 80km and will extend from Cavan to Tyrone.  It is being undertaken in co-operation with Northern Ireland Electricity.  The line will be routed from a proposed new sub-station near Kingscourt in County Cavan, through County Monaghan and onwards to County Tyrone.</P>
        <P>Linked to this North-South transmission line are plans for the upgrading of the existing transmission system in Meath and Cavan through the building of a new 400 kV transmission line between Woodland, County Meath, and Kingscourt, County Cavan.  This line will be a further 58 km long and will reinforce the power system in the north east, facilitating competition and securing supplies of power for all customers.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies are aware, EirGrid has proposed three possible route corridors for both projects and published these three routes in October 2007 as part of its public consultation process.  EirGrid&rsquo;s aim is to select a final route in early 2008, following the consultation process, and then to submit a final proposal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</P>
        <P>Last month, I secured the agreement of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to hold a series of meetings on transmission line infrastructure generally, with a view to providing an appropriate and constructive forum in which public representatives could debate issues around transmission line infrastructure and address concerns about specific projects.  I am glad to see members of the committee here tonight to discuss the matter further and hope they have active and positive engagement with EirGrid when the committee meets tomorrow morning.  The first meeting of the committee was held on 29 January, at which the Department&rsquo;s chief technical adviser provided an overview of the recent all-island grid study and options for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity grid over the medium to long term.  EirGrid will address the committee on the specific Cavan-Tyrone and Meath-Cavan proposals tomorrow.</P>
        <P>In response to public concerns and the convening of the Oireachtas committee meetings on the issue, EirGrid will tomorrow publish a briefing document on the relative costs and technical issues surrounding overhead versus underground options for transmission lines.  I hope this will facilitate tomorrow&rsquo;s discussion further.  EirGrid is also preparing a detailed consultants&rsquo; report on the issue for the purposes of its application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for planning permission for both projects.</P>
        <P>In any consideration of the underground versus overground issue, it needs to be borne in mind that we are not just talking about the proposed new lines from Cavan to Tyrone and from Meath to Cavan, but a whole programme of investment in new lines and upgrading of <Col N="95"/>existing transmission lines.  That is why I asked the joint committee to address the issue in the context of transmission infrastructure generally.</P>
        <P>The building of these transmission lines is an operational matter for EirGrid, which has the statutory function to plan the high-voltage transmission network.  The construction of transmission lines is also subject to the rigours of the planning process.  I have no direct role in relation to routes and planning of lines.</P>
        <P>As EirGrid plans to publish tomorrow a briefing document on the relative costs and technical issues regarding overhead versus underground options for transmission lines, it may be more appropriate to wait until tomorrow to discuss the merits or otherwise of each option.  I have, however, been previously advised by EirGrid that there are many reasons why they opted for overhead lines in these two projects.  EirGrid informs me that 97% of Europe&rsquo;s high voltage transmission network is carried by overhead lines and that underground is generally only used for short distances.  Sub-sea cables have different operating characteristics and are not necessarily appropriate to land-based transmission systems.  The reasons put forward by EirGrid for preferring overhead lines include technical feasibility and ongoing technical requirements for operation of transmission lines, the requirement in any underground AC transmission system to return above ground on average approximately every 20-40 km for system re-balancing, involving the construction of overground substations, the length of time required to identify and repair faults, and the significant impacts of such delays where entire regions depend on the transmission line operation, the increased costs of building and maintaining underground networks, and environmental impacts associated with construction and maintenance of underground cables.  Noting public concerns in relation to overhead lines, EirGrid also says that it has endeavoured to keep as far away from communities and houses as possible, with a minimum of 50 m clearance.</P>
        <P>The overhead versus underground routing of transmission lines has also been raised in the context of health concerns.  I am advised that EirGrid complies with all authoritative international and national guidelines on electromagnetic fields, EMF, exposure and notes that despite extensive worldwide research, no conclusive evidence has been found that extremely low frequency EMF exposure is harmful to public health.  In response to the concerns that have been raised, however, EirGrid has recently engaged an internationally renowned expert in this field to provide advice on the many queries it has received about EMF exposure.  This expert, Professor Michael Repacholi, was previously radiation specialist with the World Health Organisation.  The committee may wish to call on Professor Repacholi to address Oireachtas representatives on this issue at their next meeting, after they meet EirGrid.</P>
        <P>In planning for the two projects in the north east, EirGrid has engaged in public consultation in the region.  Public open days have been held in each of the three counties, Meath, Cavan and Monaghan, meetings have been held with groups of residents and individuals, a telephone information line and e-mail service have been set up, advertisements have been placed in local newspapers and on local radio, and information is available on EirGrid&rsquo;s website.  I expect that tomorrow EirGrid will make available the briefing note it has prepared on underground and overhead transmission line issues.  This should enhance the information available to public representatives and to local residents.</P>
        <P>I am at all times keen to ensure an open and frank debate on issues of public concern and have engaged with representatives of all parties, including my Government colleagues, who have briefed me fully on public concerns about these particular projects.  I am mindful that the issue of underground versus overhead lines is not one which is confined to these two projects.  I have already taken the initiative in facilitating a broader public discussion on the issues through the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources <Col N="96"/>and I welcome the active and constructive engagement of my Oireachtas colleagues on this matter.</P>
        <P>I am sure that tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting with the committee will provide a further opportunity for EirGrid and public representatives to address important issues around transmission line infrastructure and in particular the overhead and underground line issues.  I will continue to facilitate and encourage active debate on all of the issues, to ensure a better understanding of the technical, economic and environmental aspects to transmission system development.  To this end, I have written to the Chairman of the Oireachtas joint committee committing my Department to a further supportive role in this area.  I believe that the Chairman will make these details available to the committee tomorrow.  Out of courtesy to him, I will allow him to make known what should be the Department&rsquo;s further role and what further action we intend taking to assist this debate.  Ultimately, our electricity grid will need to be upgraded and expanded if we are to continue to stimulate economic growth, meet current and future electricity needs, and facilitate greater integration of renewable energy.  This is a shared goal, and we need to work together to strive for consensus and understanding of the optimum way forward.</P>

	<P>Transport 21 provides for a Luas line to run from St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green to Liffey Junction, with the project being delivered in two phases.  The first phase, known as Luas Line Bx, runs from St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green to the City Centre and the second phase, known as Luas Line D, runs from the city centre to Liffey Junction.  This is consistent with the long-term transportation strategy in the Dublin Transportation Initiative (1994) and in the Transportation Office&rsquo;s A Platform for Change (2001), both of which envisaged the old Broadstone alignment being used for Luas or Metro rather than suburban rail.  The longer term strategy for light rail in Dublin envisages the extension of the line from Liffey Junction to West Finglas and possible onward extension to connect with Metro West.  </P><Col N="98"/>
        <P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann submitted a proposal in 2007 to my Department in relation to an alternative use of the Broadstone alignment for suburban rail services.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann proposed using Broadstone to address capacity limitations for suburban services in city centre stations, notwithstanding proposals in Transport 21 for the Interconnector.  In this context, my Department engaged transport consultants Booz, Allen and Hamilton to review the proposal from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>As I have indicated on a number of occasions previously, I remain committed to the strategy set out in Transport 21 for the use of the old Broadstone alignment, unless the independent consultants confirm there are very strong strategic, transport and operational arguments, which require consideration of an alternative use.</P>
        <P>I recently received the report of the independent consultants and am considering it at present.</P>

        <Quest> if he will reform the penalty points system to address the issue of up to two thirds of drivers who accumulate twelve penalty points failing to voluntarily give up their driving licences as they are legally obliged to do; the consultation he has undertaken with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Courts Service to reform the present mechanism for the collection of fines for motoring offences and to permit garda&iacute; to arrest disqualified drivers at road checks; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision in the Road Traffic Acts in this context is not a voluntary one.  Where a person has accumulated 12 penalty points and is to be disqualified for holding a licence for a period of 6 months, they are required to submit their driving licence to the issuing licensing authority within 14 days, and failure to comply is an offence.    </P>
        <P>The penalties on summary conviction for that offence are, in the case of a first offence a fine of up to &euro;1,000 and in certain cases to a fine of up to &euro;2,000, or imprisonment for up to three months, or both a fine and imprisonment.</P>
        <P>Enforcement of this and other provisions of the Road Traffic Acts is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the realisation of fines is a matter for the Courts Service.  Any reform of the fine collection system is a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Courts Service.</P>
        <P>Comprehensive reporting arrangements are in place under the present penalty points system to ensure that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are notified of all drivers disqualified on the basis of having accumulated 12 penalty points.  It is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to follow up with the issue of summons to drivers who have failed to surrender their licence to a motor tax office within the statutory 14 day period.</P>
        <P>A person who drives while disqualified from holding a licence commits the offence of driving without a licence. The Garda can prosecute the driver in respect of that offence in addition to prosecution of the separate offence of failing to surrender their licence where disqualified on the basis of having accumulated 12 penalty points.</P>
        <P>As I indicated in my response to the priority question, my officials are eliciting proposals for possible inclusion in the forthcoming Road Traffic Bill. Any proposal to arrest disqualified drivers can be considered in that context.</P>

	<P>The Commission for Taxi Regulation published new National Vehicle Standards &mdash; Requirements for Small Public Service Vehicles on 26 November 2007, which include new accessible vehicle standards for licensing as wheelchair accessible taxis and wheelchair accessible hackneys.  </P>
        <P>My Department is in discussion with the Commission for Taxi Regulation in relation to a proposed subsidy arrangement to assist taxi and hackney operators with the purchase of wheelchair accessible vehicles that will meet the new accessible vehicle specification developed by the Commission.  This recognises the fact that by their very nature such accessible vehicles will cost more than standard saloon cars. The recent announcement of the new accessible vehicle standards by the Commission facilitates further detailed examination of the subsidy proposal, which continues to be the subject of discussion with the Commission. A final decision will be made on the proposal for a subsidy scheme as soon as possible having regard to the overall budgetary context.</P>
        <P>The development of the new accessible vehicle standard by the Commission forms the basis for the further promotion of accessibility in taxi and hackney services, and will facilitate a first step in delivery on the Programme for Government commitment in relation to accessible taxi services.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118, 134, 169 and 174 together.</P>
        <P>The State Airports Act, 2004 provides the framework for the establishment of Shannon and Cork as independent airports. Under the Act, both the Minister for Finance and I will have to be satisfied as to the state of operational and financial readiness of the three airports before any vesting of assets can take place.</P>
        <P>I have no intention of privatising either airport.</P>
        <P>The actual timing of airport restructuring will depend on the creation of the appropriate conditions that will ensure the financial sustainability of each of the three State Airports. The restructuring process will require coordinated strategies for the achievement of operational and financial readiness of each airport. In this regard, the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) has a key role to play in finalizing the financial framework and coordinating the individual business plans for the three airports that will enable airport separation to take place.</P>
        <P>Both the Cork and Shannon Airport Authorities recently submitted their draft business plans to the DAA and I understand that discussions are underway between the parties on the content of the plans.</P>
        <P>The airport authorities&rsquo; plans and the DAA&rsquo;s views on them are currently being considered within my Department and I hope to be in a position to progress these matters in the near future.</P>

	<P>My objective in relation to public transport fares is, taking account of underlying cost factors and inflation, to secure a good balance between anticipated revenues, cost control and compensation for loss making services by way of Exchequer subvention. This approach is intended to make public transport an attractive option for the travelling public and to ensure that the public transport companies continue to operate on a sound financial basis. </P>
        <P>It is not anticipated that the recent increase of an average 5% in Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann fares will have any significant impact on a modal shift to public transport. Factors such as reliability, frequency and punctuality usually score highly in determining levels of demand for public transport and accordingly allow the companies the opportunity to grow market share by offering reliable and innovative public transport.</P>
        <P>The regulation of public transport fares, routes and service levels in the Greater Dublin Area is set out in the Programme for Government as among the proposed functions of the Dublin Transport Authority.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 and 167 together.</P>
        <P>At the launch of Transport 21, the Government identified the projects in the national roads, public transport and regional airports sectors that it wished to see prioritised for development in the ten-year period from 2006 to 2015 and provided indicative completion dates for the major projects contained.</P>
        <P>Significant progress has been made on Transport 21 in its first two years and a number of projects have been completed, are under construction or are well advanced in planning terms.</P>
        <P>Most national road projects are now being completed ahead of schedule and almost all of the projects opened in 2007 were on or ahead of time.  These included the Newry-Dundalk motorway, which was three months ahead of schedule, the Tyrellstown to Kilbeggan project which was six months ahead of schedule and Phase 1 of the Arklow &ndash; Gorey Bypass which opened four months early.  The five major inter-urban motorways are on schedule for completion by end 2010.</P>
        <P>In public transport, the new Docklands station opened in March 2007, well ahead of its 2009 indicative target date, new rail carriages were introduced on the Dublin-Cork route facilitating the introduction of hourly services on the route, while the first of the 183 new Intercity railcars have been delivered on schedule and in accordance with the Transport 21 indicative timetable and have entered service on the Dublin-Sligo route.</P>
        <P>While the majority of projects will be delivered ahead of or in accordance with the indicative timetable published at the launch of Transport 21, the huge scale of the programme is such that adjustments to the timescale for individual projects is inevitable. The value of the ten-year financial framework is that it gives us the flexibility to deal with this in an effective way.</P>
        <P>The necessary revisions have arisen for a range of reasons including changes to the scope of projects arising from public consultation, planning issues, procurement issues and archaeological difficulties and are set out below for individual projects.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Portlaoise Train depot will be completed in the first half of this year, rather than end 2007; the short delay arose because the planning approval process took longer than anticipated.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Cork Commuter Rail Service to Midleton: The construction timetable is yet to be finalised with the contractors, but Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is optimistic that passenger services will start in early 2009.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Linking of the existing Luas lines: Dublin City Council is in the process of completing traffic modelling work as part of its examination of revised traffic management arrangements in the city centre, which will be required for the delivery of the Luas city centre link (line BX) and the further extension to Liffey Junction (line D).  Following completion of further detailed design work and subject to a satisfactory outcome to the city centre traffic management planning work, the RPA plans to submit a Railway Order application for Luas Line BX to An Bord Plean&aacute;la this year.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Tallaght to Citywest Luas project involves a longer alignment than originally planned and the timescale for completion has, therefore, been revised to 2010.</P><Col N="102"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The revised completion date for the Connolly to Docklands Luas is 2009, rather than late 2008 as originally scheduled mainly because the RPA devoted a substantial period to addressing and resolving the concerns of businesses in the IFSC about the impact of construction on their operations.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Metro West: The projected completion date for the entire project remains 2014. The project has been identified as a PPP and the RPA, when announcing the emerging preferred route alignment, indicated that the possibility of phasing implementation would be discussed with prospective PPP bidders.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />There were delays in the start of the Limerick Southern Ring Road due to tendering issues, which meant that the contract award process did not progress as quickly as was originally hoped. Completion is now scheduled for 2010. Although Construction on both the M3 and the N25 Waterford City Bypass were delayed because of archaeological issues at Tara and Woodstown respectively, the completion date for both projects remains 2010.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Dublin City Centre rail resignalling project was expanded to include the Maynooth line, resulting in a longer construction period and a 2011 completion date.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Due to a slight delay in the submission of the Railway Order application, Phase 1 of the Navan Line will now be completed in 2010.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Metro North: The scheduled completion date is now 2013 to take account of scope changes made arising from public consultations.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The overall budget for Transport 21 is &euro;34 billion and I am satisfied that the projects identified will be delivered within this budget.  Both my predecessor and I have consistently taken the view that, in the interest of the taxpayer and in ensuring that Transport 21 is achieved within budget, the cost of individual projects should not be released until the public procurement processes have been completed. I propose to maintain that policy.</P>
        <P>I have undertaken to provide relevant economic and financial information on projects at an appropriate time but without compromising the commercial sensitivity attaching to the projects.</P>

	<P>It is my intention that the Irish Coast Guard and Maritime Administration will be strengthened on an ongoing basis over the coming years. My ambition is to put in place a service that will fully meet the needs of this country well in the 21st century. The recent decisions have been taken to reflect the future optimal configuration of <Col N="104"/>co-ordination centres whilst ensuring that the detailed technical knowledge and experience of the Coast Guard Watch Officers is retained and fully utilised. I want to restate again that no Officer will be forced to move or lose their jobs. The transition arrangements for new centres, including the functions to continue at Malin (and Valentia), will be negotiated with staff to ensure there is no loss of expertise.</P>
        <P>The Deloitte and Touche Irish Coast Guard Study was published in 2002. This report has provided a backdrop to ongoing improvements and developments in the Coast Guard over the last 6 years. I have arranged that both this document and the submission to me on which recent decisions were based be published on the Department&rsquo;s website www.transport.ie.</P>
        <P>I purposely outlined a long-term scenario to provide structure to negotiations, which are now taking place, on how best to implement this particular step in the modernisation of the Irish Coast Guard. I have given direction to the tendering process, where a Request for Tender is now in preparation, and given enough notice to enable difficulties to be identified and resolved before equipment has to be installed. I have made it clear that these discussions, which are underway, must take account of the safety needs of local communities, and ongoing improvement of the service to the public, and the concerns of individual staff members. As I indicated previously the proposed restructuring was raised at the relevant committees on which the relevant organisations that have an interest in search and rescue are represented.</P>
        <P>I also want to take this opportunity to make two general statements related to the issue. Firstly, I am concerned that there is confusion in the public mind between the work done in Co-Ordination centres and that undertaken by local volunteers. A significant element of &lsquo;local knowledge&rsquo; is from the local Coast Guard Coastal Units and lifeboat crews strategically positioned around our coast. Their local knowledge of tides, currents, bays and local historical incident locations is invaluable to the Watch Officers of the Coast Guard. I would like to put on record again my appreciation of their selfless voluntary efforts of the Coast Guard, RNLI Lifeboat and Community Rescue Boat crews in rescuing those in trouble on our coasts, cliffs and offshore islands.</P>
        <P>Secondly, the Coast Guard restructuring that is being worked on is aimed at improving the efficiency of a key public service. The position in relation to Coast Guard services is being considered with the benefit of the many comments that I have received since the restructuring proposal was announced. I can assure the Deputy that all views expressed will be taken into account before a west coast location is determined.</P>

	<P>I propose to takes Questions Nos. 125 and 129 together.</P>
        <P>This issue of a setting a specific blood alcohol level for learner drivers was one of a number of proposals made to me in February last year by the Road Safety Authority (RSA), in the context of the introduction of a Scheme of Graduated Driving Licensing (GDL).</P><Col N="105"/>
        <P>I took the decision at the time that the best and most practical approach was to introduce such any such Scheme on a basis of a progressive roll-out of appropriate measures.  Deputies will recall the introduction of the first phase of the Scheme in relation to learner driver permits in October last year.</P>
        <P>The current review of the Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) level for drivers generally, which is being carried out by the Advisory Panel of the RSA, changes the context in any case for the RSA&rsquo;s earlier proposal relating to learner drivers specifically.  Consideration of this matter in isolation would not now be a sensible approach.</P>
        <P>I am awaiting the advice of the RSA on reducing the current BAC, as envisaged in the Road Safety Strategy 2007-2012.  I will take this and other relevant matters into account in the roll-out of subsequent phases of the Graduated Driving Licence Scheme.</P>

	<P>The Agreed Programme for Government foresees feasibility studies being completed within two years into LUAS-style light rail systems in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.</P>
        <P>My Department has agreed with the Limerick local authorities that the terms of reference for the proposed Limerick Planning, Land Use and Transportation Study will include an examination of the feasibility of introducing light rail transit and/or bus rapid transit.  I understand that the Limerick local authorities hope to engage consultants by the end of April to work on this study.</P>
        <P>The Cork local authorities have, in recent weeks, commissioned consultants to update the Cork Area Strategic Plan.  At the request of my Department, the terms of reference for this update include a requirement that the review of the transportation strategies should include consideration of the feasibility of introducing light rail transit and/or bus rapid transit.</P>
        <P>It is my expectation that both Cork and Limerick will have completed feasibility studies on light rail and bus rapid Transit by mid 2009.   The publication and consultation on the feasibility studies will be a matter for the relevant local authorities.</P>

	<P>&euro;9 million was provided by my Department for the Rural Transport Programme (RTP) in 2007. Funding is also available to the RTP from the Department of Social and Family Affairs in respect of the Free Travel Scheme and from other sources that support the initiative.</P>
        <P>Thirty-four community transport groups around the country are being funded under the programme and I understand from Pobal, which administers the Programme on behalf of my Department, that over 120,000 services were operated in 2007.</P><Col N="106"/>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The extension of the existing Luas Green Line from Sandyford southwards to Cherrywood will be designed to light rail standards but, as with the existing line, appropriate provision will be made for its subsequent upgrade to Metro when required. This is in line with long-standing Government policy.</P>
        <P>The Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) are currently carrying out initial preliminary planning  for this upgrade, which will be considered for funding in the successor investment programme to Transport 21.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, to provide additional capacity, I understand that the RPA has placed orders for 4 additional trams for the existing line and for 8 trams for the extension to Cherrywood.  In <Col N="107"/>addition, the Agency is examining options for a further expansion of capacity, such as extending tram length from 40 metres to 53 metres.</P>
        <P>There are currently two private bus operators licensed in accordance with the Road Transport Act, 1932 to provide dedicated bus passenger services to the LUAS lines.  One operator is authorised to operate services between Sandyford LUAS Line and Bray and the second operator provides services between Sandyford LUAS Line and Cherrywood and also services between the Tallaght LUAS Line and Citywest Business Park.  Details of all current licences are available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The Department has on hand a number of applications from private bus operators that are not dedicated feeder services but include stops at the LUAS lines.  The Department has no outstanding proposals from Dublin Bus or Bus &Eacute;ireann for dedicated feeder services to and from the LUAS lines.</P>

	<P>The tabular statement is compiled from non-authenticated CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emission data on the National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF) for <Col N="109"/>currently taxed private cars registered as new since May 2004 when collection of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> data for such vehicles commenced.  A total of 1,882,901 private cars were currently taxed at 31 December, 2007 and this statement covers 525,273 (28%) of that total. The data has been divided into CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> categories reflecting the proposals to apply for VRT and motor tax purposes for cars registered on or after 1 July next. The CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> data available relates to vehicles designated as Category &lsquo;A&rsquo; within the meaning of section 130 of the Finance Act 1992 i.e. passenger car types.  Equivalent data is not available for other categories including commercial vehicles which will not be affected by the proposed CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> based VRT and motor tax charges.</P>
        <P>Matters relating to the levels of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions produced by motor vehicles are appropriate to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and agencies under his aegis.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that as a general rule, all vehicles imported permanently into the State must be registered for VRT purposes. However, section 135 of the Finance Act, 1992, and Regulations made thereunder, provide for a range of circumstances in which foreign-registered vehicles, brought temporarily into the State, are exempted from the registration requirement.  Foreign residents working and studying here temporarily are permitted to use foreign-registered vehicles in the State, normally for a period not exceeding 12 months. The exemption also extends to include vehicles brought into the State by tourists or by other non-residents who are in the State on a casual basis e.g.  UK and NI residents on business or shopping trips.</P>
        <P>These provisions are required to be in conformity with Article 39 of the EU Treaty, which provides for the free movement of EU workers between member states, and a reciprocal arrangement also applies to Irish residents who bring their cars temporarily to other member states.</P>
        <P>I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there is no requirement for vehicles imported under the temporary exemption provisions to be presented to them to avail of the relief. Details of such vehicles are not captured or held in the registration system or passed to the NVDF and consequently data on the number of foreign registered vehicles in circulation is not available.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department had discussions recently with the EU Commission about air connectivity from the West of Ireland and in particular about the possible imposition of a Public Service Obligation (PSO) on the Shannon-Heathrow route.</P>
        <P>The Commission&rsquo;s position, as clarified as a result of those discussions, is that the relevant Regulation is an exception to the general rule of free provision of air services and that any such exception should be considered as restrictively as possible and should only be applied as far as necessary.  In order to be eligible for a PSO, a route must not only be vital for the economic development of the region concerned but the existing services must be inadequate.  In assessing whether services are adequate, account has to be taken of all existing air transport services, direct and indirect.</P>
        <P>In relation to Shannon to London, the Commission has noted that there are already regular direct air services by Ryanair between Shannon and London airports, Gatwick, Stansted and Luton.  Allowing for these connections, along with the Cityjet service to Paris, the Commission has indicated that it would be difficult to justify a PSO on the Shannon to London route. In any case, I recently raised the matter of a Shannon &mdash; London PSO link with Mr. Jim Fitzpatrick, M.P., UK Parliamentary Undersecretary of State for Transport. In subsequent contact by my Department with the UK Department for Transport on the subject it was confirmed that the UK would not favour a PSO link to London from another member state.</P>
        <P>I think it is important to now focus on the commercial services from Shannon and I do not propose to comment on approaches to particular airlines, which are the direct responsibility of the airport authority.  Cityjet&rsquo;s decision to launch the new Shannon-Paris route is a very positive development in this regard.  This new route and the other services from Shannon indicate that Shannon can attract a range of commercial air services to support the business and tourism sectors.</P>
        <P>An important element of the Economic and Tourism Development for the Shannon Airport Catchment area is a new tourism-marketing initiative for the area. This initiative amounts to an anticipated &euro;15 to &euro;20 million over the next few years and will be implemented by Tourism Ireland in close consultation with key tourism industry interests in the area, Shannon Development and the F&aacute;ilte Ireland Regions.</P>
        <P>Finally, the question of allocating public funding directly to airlines for route support is severely constrained by EU State Aid Rules and I have no proposals to develop such a scheme at present.</P>

	<P>It is not the case that my Department instructed Dublin Bus to reduce the number of buses servicing the Route 25X route to Lucan on foot of a complaint from a private bus operator. My Department has made no demand on Dublin Bus to cease any of its authorised services.  </P>
        <P>The initiation or alteration of a bus service by Dublin Bus is subject to compliance with the requirement of giving advance notice to my Department and to compliance with the provisions of Section 25 of the Transport Act 1958 concerning competition with licensed private operators.</P>
        <P>My Department wrote to Dublin Bus on 4th October, 2007 indicating that three Route 25X departures which the Company was operating from the Newcastle Road Area, were not the subject of an authorisation by my Department and should, therefore, cease.  The letter indicated that an application for the authorisation of those services should be made and would be considered. To date no such application has been received in my Department.</P>
        <P>The Road Transport Act, 1932, as amended, provides the statutory basis for regulating the provision of public bus services by private bus operators.  In accordance with that legislation, private bus operators apply to my Department for licences to operate scheduled bus passenger services within the State.</P>
        <P>All licences issued have standard conditions associated with them and compliance with those conditions is the responsibility of the service operator in each instance. A condition of all licences includes the requirement whereby the service must be in operation in its entirety within 4 months from the date of issue of the licence. In exceptional cases the four month deadline may be extended subject to the prior written approval of my Department.</P>
        <P>It is also a condition of all licences that the licensee adheres to the approved timetable as listed on the licence.</P>
        <P>There are currently 611 valid passenger licences on issue to private bus operators and details of these licences are available on my Department&rsquo;s website. The introduction of all authorised services by Dublin Bus is an operational matter for the Company itself and all services in operation by Dublin Bus are published in the Company&rsquo;s timetable and are available on the Company&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>My Department is not aware of any licences being held by private operators that are not being operated save in the limited number of cases where the period of introduction has not yet expired or where the operator has applied to my Department and has been granted an extension to that period in accordance with the provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932 as amended.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>There is substantial ongoing current and capital Exchequer funding in the development and operation of the railway network.  Total Exchequer funding allocated to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for 2008 amounts to more than &euro;720 million.  While I have no proposals to introduce a rail freight subsidy on a per tonne basis for materials transferred from road freight to rail freight, the potential to expand rail freight will be con<Col N="112"/>sidered as part of the consultation process I intend to launch shortly on the development of a Sustainable Transport Action Plan.</P>
        <P>A number of new railway lines &ndash; the Western Rail Corridor, the Cork-Midleton rail link, the Navan rail link and the Interconnector &ndash; are currently being developed.  These will enhance the overall capacity of the network for passenger and freight traffic.</P>
        <P>The position regarding the Limerick to Foynes railway line is that no rail freight traffic has operated on the Foynes branch line since December 2000.  Since that time, the line has been maintained on a care and maintenance basis.  In the meantime, I understand that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has undertaken some track renewal and realignment works in the Limerick area.  It is normal practice when such work is undertaken not to renew or replace sections of line not currently in use.  I have also been informed by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that the connection to the Foynes line was life-expired and, as there is no current requirement for it, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann concluded that it would be unnecessary to incur the cost of renewing it.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann advises that there are potential hazards from having long-term unused sets of points on the network.</P>
        <P>However, the company state that if a viable business case emerged which justified traffic on the line, the connection could be easily reinstated at little cost. No works have been done or will be done in the Limerick area which would prevent reinstatement in the future.</P>

        <P>A number of measures relating to transport are included in the National Climate Change Strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  These include rebalancing of motor taxes, Mineral Oil Tax Relief for biofuels, modal shift through Transport 21 and the achievement of a 5.75% biofuels blend in fuels by 2010.  In all, the transport sector will provide up to 13% in total national emissions savings under that Strategy. Further details of the Strategy are available on the website of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government: www.environ.ie.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The recent Government proposals in relation to rebalancing VRT and Motor Tax to reflect carbon dioxide emissions is in keeping with the National Climate Change Strategy. An updated analysis, to reflect the actual measures announced in the Budget, will be presented by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, in the annual report on the implementation of the Strategy.  This annual report will also include updated projections of greenhouse gas emissions for all sectors.</P>
        <P>In the meanwhile the Government is committed to delivering a Sustainable Travel and Transport Action Plan this year and I hope to initiate an intensive public consultation process on the issues in the near future.  I would expect that the question of emission targets for transport will be explored in more detail during that process.</P>

        <P>Following recent disposals of Great Southern Hotels and the DAA&rsquo;s interests in Birmingham and Hamburg Airports, the DAA net debt levels have fallen sharply in the short term, resulting in a temporary net cash position at the end of 2007.  They are likely to rise steadily again over the period referred to by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>Precisely what the DAA&rsquo;s debt levels will be over this period will depend upon a number of factors.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149, 158, 161 and 163 together. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Transport 21 provides for the construction of the Navan Rail Line in two phases: Phase 1: Clonsilla to Dunboyne by 2010, and Phase 2: Dunboyne to Navan by 2015, subject to studies.</P>
        <P>The current position on Phase 1 is that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has applied to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for a Railway Order in respect of the Clonsilla-Dunboyne section. I understand that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are aiming to start work before the end of the year, subject to the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and any issues arising.</P>
        <P>The position regarding the Dunboyne-Navan section (Phase 2) is that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has completed a scoping study and is now proceeding with the preparation of a full preliminary design and business case. The more detailed design work now to be undertaken by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will provide a better basis for estimating the final cost of the project. The actual cost of the project will only be determined when tenders are approved by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>Both phases of this project are subject to appraisal in accordance with the Department of Finance Guidelines for the Appraisal and Management of Capital Investment and the Department of Transport Common Appraisal Guidelines. These guidelines require a full Cost Benefit Analysis to be carried out for projects costing in excess of &euro;30m before a final decision is made to proceed. The results of initial and high level cost benefit analyses carried out to date in respect of both phases indicate internal rates of return in excess of the Department of Finance threshold rate. Once An Bord Plean&aacute;la has decided on the Railway Order application for Phase 1, the Board of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will make a formal application to my Department to proceed with the project, with details of a full Cost Benefit Analysis and financing arrangements. A full cost benefit analysis will be prepared for Phase 2 as part of the further design work and business case development now being undertaken by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>My Department and I sought and was given details of the presentation made to Meath County Council by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann on 7th January in respect of phase 2 of the project. It should be noted that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has indicated that the scoping study shows a positive Net Present Value for the project and an Internal Rate of Return in excess of the in the Department of Finance guidelines threshold rate.</P>
        <P>My Department has allocated &euro;10m to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann this year to advance work on the project and the projects are progressing in line with the target completion dates.</P>

	<P>Section 88 of the Railway Safety Act 2005 requires rail companies to draw up a code of conduct for safety critical workers in relation to intoxicants (i.e. drugs and alcohol) and including sampling procedures in that regard.</P>
        <P>Veolia (as operator of the Luas) has a code of conduct in place and the Railway Safety Commission has accepted this as part of the approval of the Safety Case for Luas.</P>
        <P>In relation to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, the Railway Safety Commission has asked the Company to implement its draft code of conduct pending clarification of some outstanding issues.</P>
        <P>With regard to bus services, the position is that it is illegal to drive while under the influence of drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle.  Section 49 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 prohibits the driving of a mechanically propelled vehicle by a person while under the influence of an intoxicant.  Enforcement of the law on drug driving is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When a member of the Garda suspects that a driver of a vehicle is driving under the influence of any intoxicant, the garda may arrest the suspect under Section 49 of the Road Traffic Act 1961.</P>
        <P>In addition to this, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann are considering the introduction of drug testing as envisaged in Section 13(1) of the Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.</P>

        <P>However, for the purposes of reporting to the Office of Emergency Planning, my Department maintains an ongoing liaison with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the other public transport agencies under my aegis in relation to their emergency response plans.  Through these contacts, my Department is aware that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann periodically reviews its emergency response handbook which sets out guidance procedures for its staff in the event of an accident or emergency. I am advised that each year the Company carries out test exercises in conjunction with the emergency services and my Department is made aware of all such exercises.</P>
        <P>In relation to the recent derailment on the Northern rail line, I am informed by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that the procedures as set out in the Company&rsquo;s operational Rule Book and emergency response handbook were correctly applied throughout the management of the event.</P>

        <P>One of the actions in the Road Safety Strategy 2007 &ndash; 2012, which was launched in October last year, is for the RSA to review and expand the national speed survey on Irish roads and to publish the results annually on a national basis.

	<P>Since 10 January 2001, Bus &Eacute;ireann is required by Ministerial direction to notify my Department of any proposed new services, or proposed changes to existing services, at least four weeks prior to their introduction.  </P>
        <P>Where there is no competition from services provided by a licensed private operator, Bus &Eacute;ireann is advised that the Department has noted their proposed service change and the company is free to proceed.</P>
        <P>Where my Department considers that a proposal has the potential to compete with a prior application from a private operator under the Road Transport Act, 1932, Bus &Eacute;ireann is informed and the company is required to defer the proposed service until the prior application from the private operator concerned is decided upon.</P>
        <P>When the prior application is finalised and a licence has issued my Department then reverts to consider Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s proposals taking into consideration the newly licensed service.</P>
        <P>Where the proposed new amended Bus &Eacute;ireann service would compete with a licensed service, the company must obtain my consent under section 25 of the Transport Act 1958 before proceeding.</P>
        <P>With regard to proposals for regulation of Bus &Eacute;ireann, as stated in the Programme for Government, the Dublin Transport Authority will have overall responsibility for surface transport in the Greater Dublin Area. I am examining legislative proposals for the proposed DTA with the intention of bringing them to Cabinet for approval and to publish the DTA Bill in due course.  While I do not wish to pre-empt the consideration of the provisions of the Bill by this House, given the geographical area for which it is envisaged the DTA will be responsible, the majority of the services provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann, with some exceptions, will not be subject to regulation by the DTA.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government also includes a commitment to examine the need for a National Transport Regulator in the context of the proposed review of the economic regulatory environment and to reform bus licensing to facilitate the optimum provision of services by providing a level playing field for all market participants. Any new licensing regime will be designed in a manner consistent with the new EU Regulation on Public Service Obligations in the transport sector, which was adopted in 2007 and will come into force next year.</P>
        <P>While it is not possible at this time to indicate a precise time as to when the legislative proposals on regulatory reform of the bus market will be published, applications for bus licences and notifications from bus operators will continue to be processed under the provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932, as amended, and the notification system with reference to the Transport Act 1958, as appropriate.</P>

        <P>All drivers are subject to road traffic law and enforcement is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The realisation of any fines or penalties imposed by the Courts is a matter for the Courts Service.</P>
        <P>While foreign licence holders do not have an Irish driving licence record, a separate record of any penalty points incurred by them in this State is kept in the National Driver File.</P>
        <P>The enforcement on foreign registered drivers of penalties for road traffic offences is a complex legal and administrative matter for many States, and my Department is pursuing this question at European, British/Irish and North/South levels.</P>
        <P>We are working with the United Kingdom with the objective of having a bilateral agreement on mutual recognition of driving disqualifications in place later this year, under the framework of the relevant EU Convention.</P>
        <P>The mutual recognition of penalty points is however a much more difficult matter which is not covered by the EU Convention.   In particular it involves complex legal questions which have yet to be determined and which will require the passage of primary legislation both here and in the United Kingdom in due course.  While both jurisdictions are working on this, it will be a number of years before a bilateral agreement can be put in place.</P>
        <P>I met the U.K. Minister responsible for this area in London last week and discussed these issues with him. I intend to meet with him and the Northern Ireland Minister for road safety on a tripartite basis in the coming months to review progress.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 157, 170, 352 and 353 together.  </P>
        <P>It is my intention that the Irish Coast Guard and Maritime Administration will be strengthened on an ongoing basis over the coming years. My ambition is to put in place a service that <Col N="121"/>will fully meet the needs of this country well in the 21st century. The recent decisions have been taken to reflect the future optimal configuration of co-ordination centres whilst ensuring that the detailed technical knowledge and experience of the Coast Guard Watch Officers is retained and fully utilised. I want to restate again that no Officer will be forced to move or lose their jobs. The transition arrangements for new centres, including the functions to continue at Malin and Valentia, will be negotiated with staff to ensure there is no loss of expertise.</P>
        <P>The Deloitte and Touche Irish Coast Guard Study was published in 2002. This report has provided a backdrop to ongoing improvements and developments in the Coast Guard over the last 6 years. I have arranged that both this document and the submission to me on which recent decisions were based be published on the Department&rsquo;s website www.transport.ie.</P>
        <P>I purposely outlined a long-term scenario to provide structure to negotiations, which are now taking place, on how best to implement this particular step in the modernisation of the Irish Coast Guard. I have given direction to the tendering process, where a Request for Tender is now in preparation, and given enough notice to enable difficulties to be identified and resolved before equipment has to be installed. I have made it clear that these discussions, which are underway, must take account of the safety needs of local communities, ongoing improvement of the service to the public and the concerns of individual staff members. As I indicated previously the proposed restructuring was raised at the relevant committees on which the relevant organisations that have an interest in search and rescue are represented.</P>
        <P>I also want to take this opportunity to make two general statements related to the issue. Firstly, I am concerned that there is confusion in the public mind between the work done in Co-Ordination centres and that undertaken by local volunteers. A significant element of &lsquo;local knowledge&rsquo; is from the local Coast Guard Coastal Units and lifeboat crews strategically positioned around our coast. Their local knowledge of tides, currents, bays and local historical incident locations is invaluable to the Watch Officers of the Coast Guard. I would like to put on record again my appreciation of their selfless voluntary efforts of the Coast Guard, RNLI Lifeboat and Community Rescue Boat crews in rescuing those in trouble on our coasts, cliffs and offshore islands.</P>
        <P>Secondly, the Coast Guard restructuring that is being worked on is aimed at improving the efficiency of a key public service. I can assure the Deputy that all views expressed will be taken into account before a west coast location is determined.</P>

        <P>Figures in respect of carbon emissions from aviation can be got from the following websites:The Environmental Protection Agency: http://www.epa.ie Sustainable Energy Ireland: http://www.sei.ie</P>
        <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland estimate that aviation in Ireland accounted for 2,953.4 kilotonnes CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> or 18.3% of total transport emissions in 2006.</P>
        <P>The National Climate Change Strategy proposes the introduction of a carbon offsetting scheme for all air travel on Government business, including flights by Ministers and by civil servants.</P>
        <P>Practical arrangements will be put in place by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to enable each Department to compute annually the emissions associ<Col N="123"/>ated with its air travel and to make a contribution to an appropriate fund to secure verified emission reductions of an equivalent amount.</P>
        <P>On a broader level, given the international dimension to aviation, it is likely that emissions savings and environmental improvements will require inter-government agreement. Ireland is playing a positive role in the European Union&rsquo;s consideration of extending emissions trading to the aviation sector.</P>

	<P>In October 2007 Dublin City Council published for public consultation a wide-ranging study of economic, amenity, recreational and environmental issues linked to Dublin Bay, including the port area. I understand that the outcome of the consultation will be reported back to the Council shortly.</P>
        <P>As part of the preparation of the study my Department made a submission to the consultants carrying out the study. This pointed out that Dublin Port currently handles the vast majority of trade for the Greater Dublin Area and beyond and as such is of vital strategic importance to the economy. Some 79% of the State&rsquo;s RoRo trade and some 62% of the LoLo trade was handled at Dublin Port in 2006.</P>
        <P>The National Spatial Strategy identifies strategic merit in relieving pressure on Dublin through targeted interventions in building up port capacity elsewhere.  The National Development Plan proposes a comprehensive study of the role of Dublin Port, taking account of locational considerations, in the context of overall ports policy on the island of Ireland, wider transport policy, urban development policy, the National Spatial Strategy and national economic policy.</P>
        <P>My Department is in the process of initiating this study and is liaising closing with Dublin City Council and the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government in this regard.</P>

	<P>Responsibility for vehicle testing was transferred to the Road Safety Authority (RSA), under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 (Conferral of Functions) Order 2006.

I recently accepted recommendations from the Road Safety Authority (RSA) on reforming the roadworthiness testing regime for commercial vehicles, for implementation as quickly as possible.  </P>
        <P>Before publication by the RSA of the details of the reform agenda it is important that the relevant stakeholders are apprised of the position.  I understand that the RSA is in the process of doing this and publication can be expected in the near future.  Requirements for legislative reform may arise from this process in due course. Any such proposals would be developed by RSA in the first instance and recommendations made to me in relation to new Regulations or primary legislation as the case may be.  Enforcement of road traffic law is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na while the Health and Safety Authority is responsible for enforcement of health and safety regulations.</P>

The objectives of the Commission under the Act include the promotion of access to small public service vehicles by persons with disabilities.

	<P>The examination of the alleged continued use of vehicles which are written off by insurers has been progressing on two fronts.  The first relates to the establishment of a framework going forward so that there is an effective system in place which ensures that all write off instances are notified and properly recorded. My Department has been informed of the initial deliberations of an informal review group established to examine this issue chaired by the RSA and representative of the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF). Further consultation with relevant stakeholders is required. </P>
        <P>The second task relates to obtaining details of vehicles which have been written off in recent years for comparison against the NVDF to seek to determine the extent to which written off vehicles may still be in circulation. At a recent meeting with the Irish Insurance Federation I sought and was given a commitment that they will use their influence with individual insurers to have the necessary data made available voluntarily.  The alleged importation of write offs from abroad is a matter in the first instance for the Revenue Commissioners who are responsible for the registration of vehicles.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 186 to 188, inclusive, together.Taskforce on Active Citizenship:The Taskforce on Active Citizenship was established in April 2006 and completed its work in March 2007 following a phase of public consultations on the extent to which citizens engage in the issues that affect them and their communities.  This Government has committed, in principle, to implementing the recommendations contained in the Report of the Taskforce which are intended to promote a continued sense of community and greater civic participation by our citizens in every aspect of our national life and culture.</P>
         <P>The recommendations focused on five key themes which reflect what emerged in the course of the national and regional consultations.  These are:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="is0p4" />(i) Participation in the Democratic Process;</P>
   <P LI="1"><Miles com="is0p2" />(ii) The Public Service and Citizens;</P>
       <P LI="1">(iii) Community Engagement and Promoting a Sense of Community;</P>
      <P LI="1">(iv) Education for Citizenship; and</P>
     <P LI="1"><Miles com="is0p2" />(v) Ethnic and Cultural Diversity and the Challenge of Engaging Newcomers.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The key recommendations include:</P>
        <P el="5" LI="1">Participation in the Democratic Process:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Establishment of the independent Electoral Commission &ndash; to encourage everyone who is eligible to register and vote through organisation of voting, for example, the timing of voting, postal voting etc.  Provision of appropriate publicity campaigns and explanatory material on registering to vote and the voting process itself.</P>
       <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Taskforce has emphasised that the Commission&rsquo;s role should focus on promoting participation in elections and voter education.The Public Service and Citizens:</P>
     <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The ethos of the public service, based on the respect for the citizen, needs to be reinforced and strengthened and continue to be a core objective of public service reforms.  This should include a renewed emphasis on effective consultation with associated training for public servants.  This recommendation will build on current public service modernisation initiatives such as Quality Customer Service and the Guidelines on Consultation for Public Service Organisations.  Introduction of a programme in the Public Service to promote community engagement and participation:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The programme could be run on the basis of recognising some time off for volunteering effort as was done by many employers for the Special Olympics.   It could also include treating verifiable areas of community activity and volunteering as relevant items for inclusion and recognition in job applications and evaluation of performance.</P><Col N="131"/>
     <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Such an initiative could also extend through to retirement through pre-retirement courses offered in the public service.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The group insurance scheme open to members of Local Community and Voluntary Fora should be promoted widely amongst relevant organisations and groups.  Insurance was one of the recurring barriers to Active Citizenship cited at the public consultation meetings.  This scheme has assisted with insurance issues for community and voluntary groups in securing considerably cheaper premiums.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />An initiative to help community and voluntary groups meet compliance costs (i) when providing programme funding and (ii) ensuring that compliance costs are proportionate and that administrative burdens on community and voluntary organisations are streamlined and standardised across the public service to the greatest extent possible.</P>
       <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Funding schemes be strengthened to support capacity development amongst community and voluntary organisations particularly in the area of training at both national and local level.</P>
     <P LI="1">Community Engagement and Promoting a Sense of Community:</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Introduction of a National Active Citizenship theme culminating in a National Active Citizenship Week &ndash; to stimulate local Active Citizenship activities and events, for example, &lsquo;get to know your neighbour&rsquo;.    The themes will be selected to promote localcommunity involvement and would draw on existing community resources and initiatives.  This initiative would culminate in an Active Citizenship Week and would be a focal point for local community engagement.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Introduction of National Presidential Citizen Awards &mdash; this award system would be introduced to recognise outstandingcontributions made by individuals to Irish society.   They would be given to a limited number of people selected through an independent process based on nominations from members of the public.   Presentation of the awards could tie in with the National</P>
        <P LI="1">Active Citizen Week.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Development of a certificate/award which would be earned through completing at least three months volunteering or community involvement activity &ndash; this award would be earned by completing at least three months of voluntary activity either in Ireland or overseas.   This could be done either during further education or in the early stages of working life.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Local Authorities should prioritise the provision of community and recreational facilities as part of Development Plans and subsequent planning decisions.   An audit of the implementation of this approach should be undertaken by the Department of the Environment, Heritage &amp; Local Government.</P>
     <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />An audit should be undertaken by end 2008 by the Local Authorities through the County/City Development Boards of existing community facilities to identify (i) gaps in the provision of facilities and (ii) opportunities for improved use/sharing of existing facilities.</P>
       <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Better use be made of schools at evening and weekend time to act as community hubs.  As a first step, a pilot project should be undertaken in a number of post primary schools in partnership with the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund.</P><Col N="132"/>
        <P LI="1">Education for Citizenship:</P>
       <P LI="1" el="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Expansion of education for citizenship in the school system and in the youth and adult education sectors through (i) ensuring that every transition year student has the opportunity to take part in an active learning community-based project (ii) strengthen the status and role of the Civic, Social and Political Education programme in the junior cycle and introduce a citizenship programme as an exam subject at senior cycle and (iii) include workshops on Active Citizenship/Voter Education as a constituent element in Adult/Community Education Programmes.</P>
       <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Higher Education Authority (HEA) should lead an initiative to promote, support and link together citizenship initiatives across the Higher Education sector.</P>
        <P LI="1">Ethnic and Cultural Diversity and the Challenge of Engaging Newcomers:</P>
       <P LI="1" el="0"><Miles com="bull66" />All forms of community and voluntary organisations should be encouraged to undertake proactive initiatives to reach out and engage with newcomers to Irish society.</P>
 <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Introduction of a formal Citizenship Ceremony and Development of material and short education courses on Irish Citizenship &mdash; formal ceremony be introduced to mark entry to Irish citizenship and allow new citizens to publicly demonstrate their commitment to Ireland.  Information and short education courses should be developed on Irish citizenship to include Irish history, democratic institutions, culture, language etc.</P>
        <P LI="1">Local Civic Participation:</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0"><Miles com="bull66" />the County/City Community and Voluntary Fora in each Local Authority be strengthened and renewed with additional support as required; in particular, they should be organised on the basis of local electoral areas (where this is not already the case) and these local area fora should be renamed the Civic Fora.</P>
       <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />public agencies at local level should be required to consult the Civic Fora in relation to the development and implementation of their policies at local level.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />all Local Authority Area Committees should, in line with guidelines issued by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, include representatives of the Civic Fora for the purpose of community development and also contributing to the work of the County/City Development Board. The Taskforce recommends that this requirement to engage with the Fora should be expanded to further issues.</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">As well as enhancing the Community and Voluntary Fora, there are also a range of community councils, residents&rsquo; associations and similar local participative structures operating locally. The Taskforce recommended that:</P>
      <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Local Authorities be requested to provide recognition to these structures under the Local Government Act, 2001;</P>
     <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />where there are identifiable gaps in local community structures, Local Authorities should support the establishment of local civic participation structures and, where appropriate, include seed funding;</P>
       <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />challenge funding should be made available through County/City Development Boards to match locally raised funding for suitable projects; and</P><Col N="133"/>
     <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Local Authorities should experiment with other forms and modes of local democracy which facilitate community engagement.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Taskforce also recommended the establishment of a National Observatory to act as a focal point for research and analysis on civic engagement in Ireland. This is intended to facilitate better monitoring of progress and trends, which will in turn allow policies to be developed and refined.</P>
        <P>The cost to the Exchequer of the work undertaken by the Taskforce on Active Citizenship in 2006 was &euro;275,000 and in 2007 was &euro;108,000.  This expenditure was met under Subhead S of my Department&rsquo;s Vote and is broken down as follows:</P>

        <P FLI="0">The cost of support staff pay was met from the Administrative Budget of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department Vote (A1).  The total pay related expenditure in 2006 was &euro;124,000 and in 2007 was &euro;49,000.</P>
        <P>Primary responsibility for follow up to the report of the Taskforce rests with the Departments whose areas of responsibility are relevant.  In addition, as recommended by the Taskforce, an Active Citizenship Office has been established under the aegis of my Department, with a secretariat comprising staff assigned from the Department.  The Office is currently developing an implementation plan in consultation with relevant stakeholders, including Heads of Government Departments who have examined the implications of the task force&rsquo;s recommendations and identified how their existing strategies and programmes take account of the Taskforce recommendations.  The implementation plan will also take account of related commitments in the Government&rsquo;s Agreed Programme for Government.</P>
        <P>In addition, the work of the Active Citizenship Office will be to develop further initiatives to bring a European and North/South context to its work.  There will also be a requirement to generate as much public support as possible from individuals, community groups and the corporate sector to provide maximum opportunity for all sectors of society to become involved in the important issue of active citizenship.</P>

	<P>Under the revised VRT system, the VRT rate applicable to both new and used imported cars registered on or after 1 July 2008 will be determined by the CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emission rating of the car and will no longer be related to engine size.  The VRT rate will continue to be applied to the Open Market Selling Price of the car.  There will be seven CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emission bands with VRT rates ranging from 14% to 36%.  The certificate of conformity will normally be used to determine the CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions of cars registered in the State.</P>
        <P>In respect of pre-owned used cars imported after 1 July 2008, the CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions will have to be declared to the Revenue Commissioners on form VRT4 (declaration for registration of a used vehicle) by the person registering the vehicle.  The declaration will be required to be supported by documentary evidence of the CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.  Acceptable documentary evidence (provided the CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions is shown) will include:a certificate of conformity for the particular model, (since 2001, EU law requires CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emission levels to be recited in this document), or a previous registration certificate, or a certificate from the manufacturer or distributor, or a certificate from an organisation approved by the Revenue Commissioners to provide such certificates.</P>
        <P>Where a certificate or a measurement confirming CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> levels for a vehicle is not available or does not satisfy the Revenue Commissioners, VRT will be charged on registration at the maximum rate allowable i.e. 36%.  Such a VRT rating would be open to appeal through the VRT appeals system.</P><Col N="137"/>

	<P>The stamp duty code does not contain any provisions that would allow for an exemption or reduced rates in the circumstances described.</P>
        <P>I would point out, however, that all owner-occupying purchasers of new residential property are exempt from stamp duty where the property has a floor size of 125 square metres or less.  Where the property is bigger than 125 square metres, stamp duty is only charged on the greater of the site value or 25% of the property value.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, in the recent Budget, I announced a fundamental change to the stamp duty system for residential property which reduces the Stamp Duty burden for all purchasers of residential property.</P>
        <P>Purchases of residences with a value of less than &euro;1 million will be charged to stamp duty on the basis that no tax will be payable on the first &euro;125,000 of the consideration and the balance will be charged at 7%.  A rate of 9% on the portion of the price in excess of &euro;1 million is charged.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there is a permanent customs presence at all major ports and airports where goods are brought into the State.  These staff are responsible primarily for operating all necessary controls and for dealing with any trade facilitation needs that arise.  In the case of smaller ports/airports, where the type and volume of business conducted does not justify the <Col N="138"/>deployment of a permanent customs presence, staff attend regularly as a check against the landing (or exportation) of prohibited goods, in particular, controlled drugs.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>I am further advised that as a general rule, customs clearance for compliant businesses is an electronic transaction which takes place via Revenue&rsquo;s Automated Entry Processing (AEP) System.  The AEP system was completely re-developed in 2007 and embraces modern technologies, allows traders direct access via the Revenue on Line Services (ROS) and permits greater scope for flexibility and trade facilitation.  The principal objective is to permit legitimate trade to move goods with minimum interference from Revenue, subject to compliance with relevant EU and national rules. 98% of all customs declarations at import, and 99% of export declarations are made using the AEP system.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that vehicle registration tax (VRT) is charged on the open market selling price (OMSP) of a vehicle in the State.</P>
        <P>OMSP is defined in Section 133 of the Finance Act 1992 and is the price, inclusive of all taxes and duties, which a vehicle may reasonably be expected to fetch on a first arm&rsquo;s length sale in the open market in the State by retail.</P>
        <P>The OMSP of new vehicles in the State is declared to the Revenue Commissioners by a wholesale distributor, while the OMSP of imported second hand vehicles is determined by the Revenue Commissioners, based on factors such as age, mileage and vehicle condition.</P>
        <P>With regard to the registration of both new and second hand vehicles, VRT is charged at the appropriate rate on 100% of the open market selling price.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, as same-sex couples are not separately identified in tax statistics, it is not possible to provide the precise information requested by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>However, in the event that a formal registration scheme for same-sex couples were introduced, it is estimated that the cost of extending married treatment under the income tax code to such couples could be of the order of &euro;3 million per annum for every 1,000 same-sex couples registered.</P>
        <P>With regard to inheritance tax, inheritances from spouses are exempt from Capital Acquisitions Tax.  In the case of same-sex couples, class 3 threshold applies which provides an exemption of &euro;26,060 with the balance taxable at 20%.  The cost of extending the benefits for married couples to same-sex couples is therefore &euro;20,000 in respect of every &euro;100,000 inheritance above the current threshold.</P>
        <P>However, it must be borne in mind that there is an existing exemption in respect of a dwelling house which is transferred to an individual who has resided in the house for at least 3 years and continues to reside in it for the following 6 years.  The value of this house is not taken into account for Capital Acquisitions Tax, nor is there a requirement for any relationship between the both parties.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 211 and 212 together.</P>
        <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that statistics maintained by them on the incomes of taxpayers do not distinguish between incomes derived from full-time employment and part-time working.  It would not be possible to arrive at meaningful figures for average incomes without conducting a protracted re-development of the underlying computer system.</P>
        <P>To the extent that official data on average earnings may be available, the Central Statistics Office produces statistics on earnings in the economy, including average earnings.  My understanding is that such information is produced in accordance with the European Classification of Economic Activities (NACE) which is the European reference framework for the production and the dissemination of statistics related to economic activity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The implementation of the modernisation agenda has been, and continues to be, driven by the various social partnership agreements across the public service.  The current social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, builds on the progress made under previous agreements and ensures continued co-operation with change and modernisation initiatives as well as improvements in productivity right across the Public Service.   It provides an important framework for meeting the economic and social challenges ahead and builds on previous achievements in areas such as quality customer services, better management of performance, better financial and human resource management, and greater flexibility and openness to change.</P>
        <P>Critically, Towards 2016 sets out a mechanism for the verification of progress at sectorial, organisational and grade level in the Public Service through the establishment of a Performance Verification Group for each of the sectors &mdash; health, education and local authority sectors, and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Defence Forces. Under the terms of Towards 2016, payment of each of the public service pay increases is dependent on verification of satisfactory achievement in relation to co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change, including co-operation with satisfactory implementation of the agenda for modernisation set out in the Agreement, maintenance of stable industrial relations and the absence of industrial action in respect of any matters covered by the Agreement.</P>
        <P>The requirement for staff at all levels in the public service to be multi-skilled and flexible is fundamental to the capacity of the civil and public service to deal with the challenging new issues and areas of work created by economic, societal and technological change.  In particular, these skills are necessary prerequisites for delivering services in a joined up and integrated way.  This means that the civil and public service must increase its focus on the nature and balance of skill mix required.</P>
        <P>We have increased the focus on performance and accountability at organisational level and for managers at all levels across the civil service.  At the level of the organization, there is now a requirement that annual output statements be submitted to the Oireachtas, along with the annual estimate.  This is aimed at clearly linking resources with outputs and outcomes, and demands a rigorous approach to the management of all resources across the civil service.</P>
        <P>We have good quality public services and many improvements have been made in recent years but the agenda for change, for enhancing the efficiency of public services and the quality of service to our citizens, is not a static one. It needs to be regularly reviewed and adapted as needs and demands change.</P>
        <P>We are taking a range of initiatives in this regard: the efficiency reviews of public service organisations announced in the Budget, the study by the OECD to benchmark the public service in Ireland against other comparable countries and to make recommendations as to future directions for public service reform, and the programme of organisational reviews to examine the capability of individual Departments and Agencies to meet their current service delivery requirements and to deal effectively with future changes in direction and new challenges.</P>
        <P>Pay settlements must reflect the economic fundamentals. With strong economic growth and productivity increasing strongly, as we experienced over the last decade, there was scope for greater flexibility in the level of pay increases. Pay developments in the period immediately <Col N="146"/>ahead must reflect the more challenging economic and competitiveness scenario that we now face and be more directly linked to changes in productivity.</P>
        <P>The current public service pay agreement under Towards 2016 expires in September 2008 and talks on a new agreement are due to commence soon. Public service pay levels can only increase at a rate that is consistent with budgetary discipline and national competitiveness. In addition the productivity and efficiency of the public service needs to be improved on an ongoing basis.</P>

        <Quest> his views on carrying out research to examine the influence of fiscal policies on consumer purchasing and their impact on overweight and obesity, for example, risk benefit assessment of taxation that supports healthy eating and active living, subsidies for healthy food such as fruit and vegetables; if he will carry out such research; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume the Deputy is referring to one of the 93 recommendations of the National Taskforce on Obesity report &ldquo;Obesity: the Policy Challenges&rdquo; published in 2005.  Primary responsibility in relation to policy on health promotion including healthy eating, active living and obesity rests with the Minister for Health and Children and the HSE.  I understand that the Department of Health and Children is currently finalising a National Nutrition policy which will provide strategic direction on nutrition for the next ten years. The policy will be published in the coming months.</P>
        <P>As regards tax, I would be of the strong view that little value could be gleaned from such research since the tax system, through the VAT regime, already favourably differentiates between different food products. Ireland applies a zero VAT rate on the purchase of unprepared food products and to fresh fruit. A positive VAT rate is applied for example to biscuits, takeaway food, chocolate and soft drinks. In this context Irish VAT law must comply with EU VAT law. Ireland also uses price signals for e.g. cigarettes and alcohol through excises and VAT at 21%.</P>

	<P>The National Climate Change Strategy required the public sector to use energy efficient lightening solely, in all public buildings.  This was already very much in practice in buildings for which the OPW has responsibility, where fluorescent lighting has been the lighting of choice in almost all circumstances except in a very small number of instances for technical or aesthetic reasons.</P>
        <P>Also the strategy proposed the exclusive purchase of compact fluorescent lighting in conjunction with a levy on incandescent lamps.  The use of incandescent lighting is not practical in commercial or similar buildings because of the frequency of lamp replacement as well as for energy efficiency reasons and the Office of Public Works has ensured that such lighting has been used only in exceptional applications for many years now.</P>
        <P>It is the policy of the Office of Public Works to use energy efficient lighting throughout its portfolio of buildings and every opportunity shall be used to improve efficiencies and reduce waste with the proper and economic use of technologies and heightening awareness.</P>

It also plays a central role in the development and monitoring of the programmes/projects through which the Funds are drawn down.  Ireland has qualified for Structural Funds since we joined the EU in 1973 and for the Cohesion Fund from 1993 when it was established.  However, due to the economic progress the country has made, Ireland no longer qualifies for Cohesion Funding since 2004.</P>

	<P>In May 2006, the Government formally approved the development of a new national forensic mental <Col N="151"/>health facility at Thornton Hall, Co Dublin, adjacent to the new prison.  The new hospital facility will provide a therapeutic, forensic psychiatric service to the highest international standards, in a state-of&ndash;the-art building.   This decision was consistent with  &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; &mdash; the report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, which recommended that the Central Mental Hospital (CMH) should be replaced or remodelled to allow it to provide care and treatment in a modern, up-to-date humane setting and that the capacity of the CMH should be maximised.</P>
        <P>The redevelopment of the CMH will constitute a separate capital development project independent of the prison complex to replace Mountjoy Prison, and will be owned and managed by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The new hospital will be built on its own campus and will retain its identity as a distinct therapeutic health facility with a separate entrance and address to the prison complex.</P>
        <P>The development of the new CMH is the responsibility of the HSE and at present, a project team is progressing the development of the new hospital.  It is understood that the land at Thornton Hall is currently zoned for agricultural use and that preliminary discussions have taken place between the HSE and Fingal County Council regarding the planning process for the project;  I am advised that the project will require planning permission.  The HSE will seek planning permission at the appropriate time and will engage in the normal process of public consultation in this regard.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 229 to 231, inclusive, 233 to 235, inclusive, and 281 together.</P>
        <P>The National Taskforce on Obesity published its report in 2005. The Taskforce recommended a multi-sectoral approach involving State agencies, Government Departments and the private sectors.</P>
        <P>The Taskforce saw the school as a key setting in tackling overweight and obesity in children and recommended that schools should be encouraged to develop consistent policies to promote healthy eating and active living. My Department has published &ldquo;Food and Nutrition Guidelines for Preschools&rdquo; and &ldquo;Food and Nutrition guidelines for Primary Schools&rdquo; and guidelines for post-primary schools are currently being finalised. These guidelines are designed to assist schools to develop a healthy eating policy and promote the concept of healthy eating through a supportive school community. The guidelines will be available as part of a training resource for teachers &ndash; trained jointly by Community Dietitians and SPHE Co-ordinators.</P>
        <P>My Department is engaged with other Departments to ensure that the impact on health is considered in policy development and to ensure progress in implementation of those recommendations of the Taskforce which are outside the remit of my Department.</P>
        <P>A key recommendation of the Taskforce was the development of a National Nutrition Policy. My Department is currently finalising this policy, which will provide strategic direction on nutrition for the next ten years. The target group is young people, 0-18 years, and the priority actions are intended to reduce obesity and food poverty. The policy will be published this spring.The HSE has established a Working Group to implement the health sector recommendations of the Taskforce on Obesity for which the HSE has the lead responsibility and for which &euro;3 million has been allocated. Funding has been provided by the HSE to University College Dublin to record height and weight in children at school entry point as part of an EU initiative to counteract obesity. The development of a national database to monitor prevalence trends of growth, overweight and obesity was also funded. The HSE is working with the Irish Universities Nutritional Alliance to research food and nutrition in children. Funding has also been allocated to the Irish Heart Foundation to undertake a project on marketing of foods to children.</P>

	<P>Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) is a monthly allowance administered by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  Eligible children from birth to the age of 16 who are living at home and who <Col N="153"/>have a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention which is substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age may qualify for DCA.  The condition must be likely to last for at least one year.</P>
        <P>Eligibility is determined primarily by reference to the degree of additional care and attention required by the child rather than to the type of disability involved, subject to a means test.  While no condition is debarred, conditions such as Asthma, Diabetes or Epilepsy are not normally considered unless there is a very high degree of additional care and attention required.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 238 and 256 together.</P>
        <P>The National Cancer Registry has advised my Department that the number of deaths from cervical cancer has been increasing on average by about 1% per year.  However, when adjusted for population growth, there has been no overall increase, and when also adjusted for age there has been a 1% average decrease in mortality rates.</P>
        <P>The roll-out of a national cervical screening programme is the most efficient population approach to preventing and controlling cervical cancer.  The National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) is planning to roll out such a programme on a national basis around the middle of this year.   Women aged 25 to 44 years old will be screened every 3 years; women aged 45 to 60 will be screened every 5 years.  The service will be available free of charge to eligible women everywhere in the country.  Approximately 230,000 women will be screened annually, assuming an 80% take up by eligible women.</P>
        <P>All elements of the programme, call/recall, smear taking, laboratories, colposcopy and treatment services will be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated national service.  The NCSS is in the process of procuring quality assured internationally accredited laboratory capacity.  The laboratories will be required to meet turnaround times of ten working days.  This process is due to be completed by end March.   In terms of smeartaker capacity, the NCSS completed a stakeholder consultation process in November 2007 and published a draft smeartaker contract for consultation in the first week of January this year.  This consultation process will end on 28 February next and the actual smeartaker contract will be published shortly thereafter.  The programme will be based on a turnaround time of four weeks for smear testing.  The NCSS is also carrying out a baseline quality audit of existing clinical colposcopy services in the State to establish their fitness for purpose in the context of a national cervical screening programme.</P>
        <P>Additional revenue funding of &euro;5.0m was allocated to the NCSS in 2007 for the roll-out of the programme and an additional &euro;15.0m has been allocated in 2008.  An additional 30 posts have been approved to facilitate integration and roll-out of the programme.</P>

	<P>Since the announcement of the Fair Deal in December 2006, information leaflets and frequently asked questions outlining the proposals of the scheme have been available on the Department&rsquo;s website. In addition, the Department has  endeavoured to address all queries, concerns and representations from interest groups, public representatives and members of the public.</P>
        <P>The Bill providing for the Fair Deal is at an advanced stage and being finalised by the Office of the Attorney General at present. The Minister proposes to publish the Bill as soon as possible following Government approval. Once the Bill has been published additional information will be made available.</P>

        <Quest> if she will explain the proposal that 80% of disposable income be charged to patients admitted to nursing homes; if it will be 80% of gross or net income; the way business people and the self-employed will be assessed; if the 80% will be the full contribution or if further financial help will be sought from the family; the way the charge on the estate of the deceased person will be estimated and collected; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Fair Deal, individuals who require long-term residential care will contribute a maximum of 80% of their net assessable income whether for public or private nursing home care. In calculating an individual&rsquo;s net assessable income, it is proposed that account can be taken of specified items of expenditure.</P>
        <P>Depending on the amount of a person&rsquo;s assessable income, there may also be a contribution of up to 5% of a person&rsquo;s assets. The State will meet the balance of cost thereafter in public or private nursing homes and an individual&rsquo;s family and/or friends will not have to contribute towards the cost of their care. An individual can choose any nursing home subject to a) its ability to meet their care needs and b) availability.</P>
        <P>The payment of the portion of the contribution relating to assets can be paid at the time when care is received, or may be deferred until the settlement of the individual&rsquo;s estate if they <Col N="156"/>so wish. If an individual opts to defer this portion of the contribution, the Revenue Commissioners will collect it upon settlement of their estate.</P>
        <P>Where the contribution is based on the principal private residence, it will be capped at a maximum of 15%, or 7.5% in the case of one spouse going long-term residential care while the other remains in the home. This means that after three years in care, an individual will not be liable for any further deferred contribution based on the principal residence.</P>
        <P>Where a spouse or certain dependants are living in the principal residence, the contribution may be further deferred until after the death of that spouse or dependant, or until such time as a person previously qualifying as a dependant ceases to qualify as such.</P>
        <P>Finally, individuals will be required to submit information on their income and assets in a manner and format specified by the HSE for the purposes of the financial assessment. This requirement will apply to all who wish to avail of the scheme including the self-employed.</P>

	<P>The development of Services for Older People is a priority for the Government.  This is reflected in the funding committed to services for older people in Budgets 2006, 2007 and 2008. In 2006, the Government a significant  expansion of services for older people with a full year cost of &euro;150m. In 2007 a full year package of &euro;255m was allocated for services for older people. Budget 2008 provided an additional &euro;135m bringing the total spend over the last three years to &euro;540m.</P>
        <P>Government policy in relation to older people is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and, where this is not possible, to support access to quality long-term residential care.  This policy approach is renewed and developed in the latest partnership agreement, Towards 2016.</P>
        <P>During the period from 2005 to 2007 the Health Service Executive secured 1,995 private contract beds. A further 200 private contract beds will be made available in the early part of 2008.  These 200 contract beds, together with 100 new public beds due to come on stream early this year in St. Marys in the Phoenix Park, will result in an additional 300 beds being made available in the near term.  The public fast-track initiative provided for 860 new public beds by the end of 2008.  This work commenced in 2007 and is continuing throughout 2008.</P>
        <P>Home Care Packages are an additional support over and above existing mainstream community services and are used to maintain an older person at home via additional supports and therapy services.  They are designed to be flexible and are particularly targeted at those at risk of admission to long-term care, inappropriate admission to acute hospital or requiring discharge home from acute hospital.  The Packages are playing an increasing role in supporting people to remain in their own homes and communities.  Over the years 2006 and 2007, additional funding of over &euro;110m was made available to develop the Home Care Package initiative.</P>
        <P>Budget 2008 provided an additional &euro;22m revenue funding for a range of community based service initiatives including:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />360 new Home Care Packages, benefiting and estimated 800 people</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />over 200,000 additional Home-Help Hours</P><Col N="157"/>

        <Quest> the waiting time for approval for an appointment for chiropody in County Roscommon; the steps she is taking to address this backlog; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 247 and 311 together.</P>
        <P>There is no statutory obligation on the Health Service Executive (HSE) to provide chiropody services to GMS patients; however, in practice, arrangements have been made in several regions to provide these services.  Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of any arrangements for community chiropody services and the level of service provided were a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time.  I understand that priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over.  In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently preparing legislation to clarify and update existing legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services.  The Bill will define specific health and personal services more clearly; define who should be eligible for what services; set out clear criteria for eligibility; establish when and in what circumstances charges may be made and provide for an appeals framework.</P>
        <P>I consider that it is inappropriate for private chiropodists who are providing services on behalf of the HSE to charge patients a top-up fee, and I have conveyed this view formally to the HSE.   My Department requested the HSE to review the fee arrangements in place for the provision of chiropody services, with a view to ensuring that such additional fees will no longer be levied on persons in receipt of this service.  While considerable work has taken place to develop arrangements which would ensure that no top-up charges are applied, it is necessary to ensure that any such arrangements and the process by which they are arrived at comply with the terms of the Competition Act 2002.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for Primary Care services, it is the appropriate body to consider the specific matters raised by the Deputies. My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have these matters investigated and to have replies issued directly to the Deputies.</P>

        <Quest> when her office will request an application for capital grant funding under the National Child Care Investment Programme 2006 to 2010 by a person (details supplied) in Dublin 16 and send it to Pobal for examination; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Prog<Col N="161"/>ramme 2006 &mdash; 2010 (NCIP), which will invest &euro;575 million over five years, with &euro;358 million of this in capital grant aid for childcare services.</P>
        <P>Initially when seeking capital funding under the NCIP applicants approach the City/County Childcare Committees who assist in the development of applications and assess the local need for the project.  When developed, the CCCs forward the application in a portfolio to Pobal, which is engaged to administer the grants, for their examination and assessment.  Following Pobal&rsquo;s assessment of the application, it is forwarded to the Childcare Directorate of my Office for final consideration and recommendation to the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the NCIP came into effect from 1 January 2006, with an allocation of &euro;358 million for capital projects during the 5 year period of 2006 &mdash; 2010.   This funding is allocated for each year subject to the rules governing capital expenditure and the multi-annual investment framework, which are conditions of the sanction given by the Department of Finance each year for capital expenditure, including expenditure under the NCIP.  Due to the success of the programme to date, the approved ceiling in 2007 for capital commitments was reached in June.  While capital projects continued to be processed during 2007, it was not possible to approve further capital project before January 2008.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the projects processed in 2007 were considered by the Secretary General in January 2008 and additional capital funding amounting to &euro;39 million was approved.</P>
        <P>With regard to the application for capital grant assistance under the NCIP referred to by the Deputy, I understand this is currently with the South Dublin County Childcare Committee and is expected to be submitted to Pobal as part of their June 2008 portfolio of capital projects.  It is anticipated that a further &euro;120 million in NCIP capital grants will be processed during 2008.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has designated University College Hospital Galway and Limerick Regional Hospital as <Col N="162"/>the two cancer centres in the Managed Cancer Control Network for the HSE Western Region, which includes Sligo.  The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while at the same time allowing local access to services, where appropriate.  Where diagnosis and treatment planning is directed and managed by multi-disciplinary teams based at the cancer centres, then much of the treatment (other than surgery) can be delivered in local hospitals, such as Sligo General Hospital.  The decisions of the HSE in relation to four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  Prof. Keane is currently engaging in detailed planning to facilitate the orderly phased transfer of services between locations.</P>

	<P>The HSE maintains a common list of reimbursable medicines for the General Medical Services and Drug Payment schemes.  This list is reviewed and amended monthly, as new products become available and deletions are notified.  For an item to be reimbursed, it must comply with published criteria, including authorisation status as appropriate, price and, in certain cases, the intended use of the product.  In addition, the product must ordinarily be supplied to the public only by medical prescription and should not be advertised or promoted to the public.  Products are considered for reimbursement on application to the HSE by a supplier.</P>
        <P>Only drugs and medicines which are licensed for dispensing in a community pharmacy, on foot of a doctor&rsquo;s prescription, qualify for reimbursement under the schemes. As the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine for screening for cervical cancer vaccine would require a clinical administration, it would not meet the criteria for reimbursement.</P>
        <P>As is being done in other jurisdictions, Ireland is now considering the potential role of HPV vaccination in addressing cervical cancer prevention.  The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) has undertaken a scientific assessment of the public health value of HPV following a request from my Department.  NIAC and the National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) agreed that this work needed to be complemented by a study of the cost effectiveness of the vaccine in the current Irish context.  Accordingly, both organisations requested that the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) undertake this study. When I have received the results of this work I will then be in a position to take the necessary policy decisions based on the best available national and international evidence.  In the meantime, the NCSS is planning to roll-out the National Cervical Screening Programme on a national basis around the middle of this year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 259 and 268 together.</P>
        <P>Following publication of the Pollock Report in 2005, the Health Service Executive established a Working Group to undertake a detailed review of cystic fibrosis services.  The Group, which was multi-disciplinary in its composition and included representation from my Department, was asked to review the current configuration and delivery of services to persons with cystic fibrosis in Ireland.  The Group identified a range of service improvements required for persons with Cystic Fibrosis, including the need to increase the level of clinical, nursing and allied health professional staffing in Cystic Fibrosis units around the country.</P>
        <P>Arising from the Pollock Report and the emerging recommendations of the Working Group, I identified the development of cystic fibrosis services as a policy priority in the Estimates process. In 2006 and 2007, additional revenue funding of &euro;6.78 million was provided to the Health Service Executive (HSE) to develop services.</P>
        <P>44 additional staff dealing with cystic fibrosis have been appointed to date across a number of hospitals, including St Vincent&rsquo;s, Beaumont, Temple Street, Crumlin, Tallaght, Cork University Hospital, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. The necessary funding is available to facilitate the recruitment of a further 37 staff nationally.</P>
        <P>The HSE was asked to place a particular focus on the development of services at the National Adult Tertiary Referral Centre at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital. A number of capital projects have recently been completed at the hospital and have helped to improve facilities. These include a new ambulatory care centre, the refurbishment of St. Camillus Ward, and a new Accident and Emergency Department which includes single room accommodation.</P>
        <P>However, it is accepted that these developments do not fully address the immediate needs of patients. The HSE has been working intensively with the Hospital and with representatives of the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland to progress options for further interim improve<Col N="165"/>ments. My Department is advised that the option of developing a modular unit is being examined in this context and the position will be clarified shortly.</P>
        <P>The HSE advises that it is fast-tracking the redevelopment of a ward which is adjacent to the main cystic fibrosis treatment area. The project is to commence within the next few weeks and will provide six single rooms. On completion, additional work will begin to provide a further eight single rooms. The HSE advises that this will result in a total of fourteen single rooms for cystic fibrosis patients by the end of the summer.</P>
        <P>In the longer term, a new ward block is to be built and will include 120 replacement beds in single en-suite accommodation. The new facility will accommodate cystic fibrosis patients and will include appropriate isolation facilities.  Planning permission has been obtained and financial provision has been included in the HSE Capital Plan. The HSE advises that contract notices will be published by the end of February 2008 and the contract is to be awarded in 2008. It will be a condition of the contract that the design build period be not more than 24 months from the date of contract award.</P>
        <P>The hospital has also introduced a Home Treatment programme for cystic fibrosis patients which has enabled up to 60% of patients receive certain aspects of their treatment at home.</P>
        <P>Beaumont Hospital operates as a regional centre in providing services to adults with cystic fibrosis.  In the 2008 Budget, a special allocation of &euro;2.5m capital funding was provided to enable Beaumont hospital to provide out patient facilities for cystic fibrosis patients.</P>
        <P>An independent registry for cystic fibrosis has been established.  As yet, the data is not available to fully inform analysis relating to median survival in this country. When it is available, the data from the Registry will allow for benchmarking against comparable countries around the world to measure the performance of our health care system.</P>
        <P>My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to respond directly to Deputies on the additional issues raised.</P>

While this continues to be my objective, the existing accounting process within the HSE does not support this optimal format.  The HSE has been working on the design of a unified accounting system and proposals in this regard will be submitted to my Department and the Department of Finance shortly.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 267 and 269 together.</P>
        <P>There are approximately 1,100 people with cystic fibrosis living in the Republic of Ireland.  Approximately 45% are adults and 55% are children.  The Minister identified the enhancement of services to persons with cystic fibrosis as a key priority.  Development funding of &euro;4.78m was provided in 2006 and a further &euro;2m was provided to the Health Service Executive (HSE) to facilitate the recruitment of additional medical, nursing and allied health professional staff to improve services.  According to the most recent report from the HSE 44 additional staff have been appointed and funding is available to facilitate the recruitment of 37 additional staff across a range of disciplines. Provision has been included in the HSE Capital Plan 2008- 2013 for a new ward block to provide 120 replacement beds in single en-suite accommodation in St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital.</P>
        <P>It is intended that the proposed 120 bed development will include dedicated facilities for patients with cystic fibrosis.  These facilities will include single room accommodation with en-suite bathrooms, together with appropriate isolation facilities.  In addition, the Project Team, <Col N="168"/>which is overseeing the scheme, is giving consideration to the need for separate access routes to the unit.</P>
        <P>The HSE advises that contract notices for Design Build Contractors and for Project Managers are to be published by the end of February 2008. The design brief is to be completed by the end of March 2008. The Design Build contract for the project is to be awarded by the end of 2008. The design build period is to be not more than 24 months from the date of contract award &mdash; this will be a condition of the contract.</P>
        <P>In order to alleviate the more immediate service difficulties for cystic fibrosis patients, the HSE is working intensively with the hospital with a view to identifying and progressing additional improvements. The St. Mark&rsquo;s ward project is an interim solution and will provide additional capacity pending the completion of the 120-bed extension. This area is adjacent to the existing main treatment area for cystic fibrosis patients (St. Paul&rsquo;s Ward).  The project is to commence within the next few weeks and will provide six single rooms. On completion, additional work will begin to provide a further eight single rooms. This will result in a total of fourteen single rooms for cystic fibrosis patients by the end of the summer.</P>
        <P>My Department has asked the HSE to reply directly on any additional operational issues raised in the Deputy&rsquo;s questions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 271, 308 and 313 together.</P>
        <P>At a meeting between the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union (IPU) under Mr. Bill Shipsey SC on 5 December 2007, a process was proposed to the IPU to (i) address their immediate concerns regarding the alleged impact of the proposed revised wholesaler arrangements on GMS-dependent pharmacies and (ii) to provide a basis upon which discussions on a new substantive contract could commence. The IPU was not prepared to accept this proposal from the HSE and, accordingly, no further discussions have taken place under Mr. Shipsey&rsquo;s auspices since then. Notwithstanding the failure to reach agreement, the HSE has offered a draft interim contract to pharmacists to address their main concerns regarding the alleged impact of the proposed revised wholesaler arrangements on GMS-dependent pharmacies. I am informed that the HSE intends to implement the deferred revised wholesaler arrangements from 1st March 2008. The Executive also recently commenced discussions with the IPU and other parties on the development of a new substantive pharmacy contract. The details of the draft interim contract, and the HSE&rsquo;s other intentions in this regard, were set out in a letter to individual community pharmacists on 2nd January 2008.</P>
        <P>In the light of the legal position previously outlined in the House, and after further consultation with the Attorney General, the other relevant Departments and the HSE on the best way of progressing the development of a new contract with pharmacists in compliance with competition law, my Department is working to develop appropriate arrangements for the development of contracts and for the setting of the fees payable in respect of contracts with private sector undertakings for the provision of health services on behalf of the HSE.  These arrangements may include the establishment of an independent body which would consider the nature of the service to be provided and all other relevant factors in each case and make recommendations to the Government in relation to the fees it considers appropriate. The composition of such a body, its terms of reference and the timescale for its work are amongst the matters to be considered in this regard. In line with the legal advice received, the HSE may enter into discussions with community pharmacists on the non-fee aspects of their contract, with a view to developing a new substantive pharmacy contract.</P>

	<P>I am happy to say that the Home Care Package programme has not been terminated and has, in fact, been expanded this year.</P>
        <P>Home Care Packages are an additional support over and above existing mainstream community services and are used to maintain an older person at home via additional supports and therapy services. They are designed to be flexible and are particularly targeted at those at risk of admission to long-term care, inappropriate admission to acute hospital or requiring discharge home from acute hospital.  The initiative formally commenced in 2006, following a pilot programme in 2005.</P>
        <P>Very significant funding of &euro;110 million was provided over the years 2006 and 2007 to develop Home Care Packages. In 2007, the Health Service Executive had put in place 4,350 packages, which benefitted in excess of 10,500 clients.</P>
        <P>In Budget 2008, an additional &euro;10 million was allocated to provide 360 extra packages this year, which should benefit in the region of 800 additional people.  The Government specifically <Col N="173"/>highlighted community based services for older people, and the expansion of Home Care Packages in particular, as a priority for development funding in the Budget.  The the total projected provision by the HSE is over 4,700 packages for this year, benefiting approximately 11,000 people.</P>

	<P>A Vision for Change,  the report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, which was launched in January 2006, has been accepted by Government as the basis for the future development of our mental health services.  The Report recommends <i>inter alia</i> that a plan to bring about the closure of all mental hospitals should be drawn up and implemented, and that the resources released by these closures should be protected for reinvestment in the mental health service.  The Health Services Executive (HSE) has primary responsibility for implementing the recommendations of A Vision for Change.</P>
        <P>The HSE has confirmed that progress is continuing on the closure of hospitals in accordance with the recommendations in A Vision for Change.  A comprehensive programme for the valuation and sale of mental health facilities is being developed, with a view to selling a number of properties in the next two years.  All revenue raised from these sales will be directed towards improving mental health services.</P>
        <P>The Irish Psychiatric Association launched a report recently which claims that the proceeds of the sale of assets has been lost to psychiatric services over a 20-25 year period.  A small number of assets which have disposed of in the last two years are identified.  A Vision for Change is very clear on this issue and recommends that resources, both capital and revenue, should be retained in the mental health service, with the reconfigured mental health services having priority in their disposal.  It also recommends that the full economic value of psychiatric hospital buildings and lands should be professionally assessed towards identifying appropriate future use and maximum value and benefit.  The value of these assets significantly counterbalances the capital cost of the new mental health services infrastructure requirement.  I have asked the HSE to provide me with a report on &ldquo;The Lie of the Land&rdquo; Report particularly insofar as it relates to the disposal of assets in the past two years.</P><Col N="174"/>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, has also made it clear to the HSE, in the context of their Service Plan for 2008, that there can be no question of diverting capital or development funds to meet expenditure pressures arising in relation to core services.</P>

	<P>The Post Budget gross provision ( both current and capital expenditure) for the Health Services Executive for 2008 is &euro;14,931 million.  When the provision for the Health (Repayments Scheme) Act is excluded the increase in 2008 is over &euro;1.1 billion or almost 9%.  The HSE has received very substantial additional resources from the Exchequer in the three years since its establishment. The revenue funding for the health services in 2004 was &euro;9.8 billion. The revenue (non-capital) funding provided to the HSE for service delivery in 2007 was &euro;13 billion &mdash; an increase of &euro;3.2 billion in three years or 10% a year.</P>
        <P>It is not the case that funds are issued to the health services by Government in the full knowledge that they were not sufficient to meet the cost of planned services. Each year, the Government decides what level of funding should be made available to the HSE following consideration by the Minister for Finance of the expenditure proposals submitted by all Ministers across the full range of expenditure areas.  In the case of health, information and views provided by the HSE are taken into account, as well as my own priorities as the Minister for Health and Children in relation to service developments.</P>
        <P>Once the Vote has been determined, it is a matter for the HSE to develop a national service plan within this budget which reflects these priorities. It has to plan and arrange, as necessary, its service/activity levels to meet the obligation on it to provide the most effective services possible within approved resources.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, revised and improved service planning and expenditure management arrangements are being put in place this year by the HSE.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 287, 289 and 290 together.</P>
        <P>The Government decided in July 2005 that the best option for improving geographic access for patients in the North West to radiation oncology services is to (i) facilitate access to Belfast City Hospital (BCH) and (ii) progress consideration of a joint venture for the provision of oncology services in the medium term to patients in the North West from a satellite centre in the North West linked to BCH.</P>
        <P>The Minister met with Minister Michael McGimpsey of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Northern Ireland on 28 November last.  The potential for further cross border co-operation and collaboration in relation to cancer care, and specifically, provision of a satellite centre for radiation oncology in the North West, linked to BCH was discussed.  It was agreed that both Departments would progress this issue through the Joint North/South Feasibility Study on the potential for future co-operation.</P>
        <P>Cancer patients in the North West requiring radiation oncology treatment are referred to either St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital Dublin or to University College Hospital Galway.  A Service Level Agreement, between the Health Service Executive (HSE), Belfast City Hospital Trust and Altnagelvin Area Hospital is also in place for the referral of radiation oncology patients from Donegal to BCH.</P>
        <P>The specific question raised by the Deputy in relation to this Service Level Agreement relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the HSE under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department  has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this regard.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 291 and 304 together.</P>
        <P>BreastCheck commenced the screening process in the Western Region last May, with the provision of a mobile unit on the grounds of Roscommon County Hospital.  I officially opened the BreastCheck static unit for the Western Region at University College Hospital Galway last December.   The expansion of the BreastCheck programme to the West covers counties Clare, Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo and Tipperary North Riding.</P>
        <P>An additional &euro;26.7 million capital funding was provided for the construction of  two new static units, eight additional mobile units and the provision of state of the art digital equipment.  A total of &euro;15 million additional revenue funding has been allocated to cater for national roll-out of the programme.  The full complement of 111 staff for roll-out has been approved and recruitment is underway.  Staffing already appointed include Clinical Directors, Consultant Radiologists, Consultant Surgeons, Consultant Histopathologists, Consultant Anaesthetists, Medical Scientists, Breast Care Nurses and Radiographers.  The screening sequence for roll out to individual counties will be dictated by BreastCheck&rsquo;s operational considerations such as maximising uptake, most efficient use of mobile and static units and radiographic personnel.  The Programme is designed to offer repeat screening within an interval of 21-27 months.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s specific questions in relation to timeframes for roll-out of the Programme to Donegal and Mayo are the responsibility of the National Cancer Screening Service.

	<P>The 1996 and 1997 Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations referred to by the Deputy, were replaced, with effect from 3rd September 2007, by the new and revised Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations 2006.</P>
        <P>Under the new Regulations and associated explanatory guide, measures to support healthy eating and active living are provided for.

Moreover, the explanatory guide refers that providers take account of the &lsquo;Food and Nutrition Guidelines for Pre-School Services&rsquo; published by the Department of Health and Children in 2004 when providing nutritious food and drink.</P>
        <P>&lsquo;Active living&rsquo; is also expressly addressed in the Regulations; Regulation 28 (b) provides that the pre-school service should have &lsquo;adequate and suitable facilities for a pre-school child to play indoors and outdoors during the day.&rsquo;.  The accompanying explanatory guide also provides guidance on outdoor play and states that &ldquo;Children in part-time or full-day care services should have access to the outdoors on a daily basis, weather permitting.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>It is considered that the new Regulations provide an effective framework for the continued development and advancement of healthy eating and active living in pre-school services.</P>

	<P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy. My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to assure the Deputy that tackling all Health Care Associated Infections (HCAIs), including MRSA and C Difficile, continues to be a priority for the government and for the Health Service Executive (HSE). </P>
        <P>MRSA is not a notifiable disease.  However, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre of the HSE collects data on MRSA.  In 2007, 43 Irish laboratories serving 64 acute hospitals (public and private) participated in their data collection system representing an estimated 98% coverage of the Irish population.  At present we do not have the relevant statistics for each individual hospital.  However the total number of MRSA cases recorded over the last five years was 445 cases in 2002, 480 cases in 2003, 553 cases in 2004, 592 cases in 2005, 588 cases in 2006 and 432 cases by the end of the 3rd Quarter in 2007.</P>
        <P>Clostridium difficile, which is another significant HCAI, is not a notifiable disease and, as a result, it is difficult to quantify the extent of infection in the health care system.  However, Clostridium difficile infection was examined in the Third Prevalence Survey of Health Care Associated Infections (HCAIs) in acute hospitals in 2006.  The survey found that thirty-six patients had Clostridium  difficile representing 0.5% of patients studied.</P>
        <P>The extent to which hospitals are affected by HCAIs such as MRSA varies with the type of hospital.  In the 2006 prevalence survey of healthcare associated infections, the prevalence of MRSA was 0.5% in tertiary/regional and general hospitals, and was zero in specialist hospitals.</P>
        <P>A National Surveillance System has recently been established by the HSE to collect data and provide information on a quarterly basis on four key areas, to monitor HCAIs in our healthcare system:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">1. Staphylococcus bacteraemia;</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">2. Antibiotic consumption;</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">3. Alcohol gel use;</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">4. MRSA surveillance in Intensive Care Units.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The data for 2006 is currently being finalised and a report will be released by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre in the near future.  This report will include rates of MRSA <Col N="179"/>bloodstream infection, listed by individual hospital.  Data for 2007 will be available in early 2008 and MRSA bloodstream infection rates for all publicly funded hospitals will be published quarterly thereafter. All of this will greatly assist in the monitoring of improvements in infection control.</P>
        <P>The HSE launched a National Infection Control Action Plan in March 2007.  An Infection Control Steering Group, chaired by Dr. Pat Doorley, National Director (Population Health) is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the plan.  Over the next three to five years, the HSE aims to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infections by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%.  Achievement of these targets will benefit all patients who are at risk.  These targets will be achieved through the development of national and local level action plans to reduce the potential for spread of infections between persons in healthcare settings, and, in addition, will focus on reducing antibiotic use in Ireland.  The Steering Group is supported by eight Local Implementation Teams which will ensure that all local facilities are focused on achieving the national targets.</P>
        <P>Improvements on hygiene are critical to effective infection control.  The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) undertook a comprehensive review of hygiene in our hospitals in 2007 against hygiene standards developed by the Irish Health Services Accreditation Board.  HIQA published its report, the National Hygiene Services Quality Review, on 13th November, 2007.  The report represents a thorough assessment of how hygiene services are provided and managed in 51 HSE-funded acute care hospitals.  Hospitals generally performed well on hygiene in the service delivery area.  Most hospitals achieved either extensive or exceptional compliance with the standard in the service delivery section of the report.  However, the results were poor on governance.  While the good hygiene practice of front line staff highlighted in the report is vital, real improvement in this whole area also depends heavily on good leadership and a system of governance.  HIQA is currently working with managers and clinicians to develop national standards for Infection Prevention and Control.  When completed these, along with the national hygiene standards, will provide a comprehensive framework to help reduce the spread of infection and improve the quality of our health care.</P>

        <P>The availability of isolation facilities is an important factor in the overall solution to the issue of reducing incidence of infection.  I have instructed the HSE that designated private beds should be used where isolation facilities are required for patients who contract MRSA and this policy has been adopted by the HSE.  New environmental building guidelines are being prepared by the HSE to inform infection control policy in all new builds and refurbishments and the HSE is committed to ensuring that such facilities are in line with international best practice including the provision of adequate numbers of single units.</P>
        <P>While accepting that not all HCAIs are preventable, I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of infections and to treat them promptly when they occur.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has responsibility for administering the health repayment scheme in conjunction with the appointed scheme administrator KPMG/McCann Fitzgerald.  The Scheme provides a mechanism to repay recoverable health charges for publicly funded long stay residential care.  Repayments include both the actual charge paid and an amount to take account of inflation (using the Consumer Price Index) since the time the person involved was charged.</P>
        <P>The scheme also provides for an independent appeals process to allow applicants to appeal the decision of the scheme administrator.</P>

	<P>Over 36,000 applications for living and deceased patients have been received under the Health Repayment Scheme.  Over 16,500 of the claims received by the Scheme Administrator have been concluded, which includes over 9,650 offers of repayment totalling more than &euro;182 million.  Further offers continue to be issued every week.  Of the 9,650 offers made, almost 7,200 payments in the sum of &euro;142m have been made to date.</P><Col N="184"/>
        <P>The Health Repayment Scheme Appeals Office is an independent office established to provide an appeals service to those who wish to appeal the decision of the Scheme Administrator under the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006.</P>
        <P>Up to 1 February 2008 the Health Repayment Scheme Appeals Office had received 1,756 completed appeal forms.  Decisions have issued in 546 cases and 98 of these decisions will result in an increased offer to the claimant.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has indicated that the Scheme is progressing as speedily as possible and every effort is being made to settle claims as quickly as possible.  A very high number of deficiencies have appeared on claim forms which must each be rectified before they can be processed.  It is estimated that approximately two thirds of all claim forms were submitted without some critical piece of information which meant that the claim could not be processed until the Scheme Administrator had written to the potential claimant and received the information required.</P>
        <P>The Scheme Administrator has given assurances to the HSE that the vast majority of claims submitted by the public will be dealt with within the 2 year time frame allotted for the scheme which is due to end in June 2008.  If there are any outstanding claims at the end of June 2008, such claims will be kept to an absolute minimum and will be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 330 and 350 together.</P>
        <P>The Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) is responsible for delivery of Metro North and for discussion on the location, detailed planning and design of individual stations such as that at Mater Hospital.  In October 2006, the RPA announced the preferred alignment for Metro North, which included an underground station at the Mater Hospital.  Since then the RPA has undertaken significant detailed design work and engaged extensively with local communities, businesses and the Mater Hospital authorities in the case of the station referred to by the Deputy.  This consultation is ongoing with the Hospital.</P>
        <P>The Agency hopes to be in a position to lodge an application for a railway order to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the coming months.  The railway order, where granted by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, will determine the final alignment for Metro North.</P>

	<P>44 civil servants from my Department have transferred to posts which were due to move out of Dublin under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme. Of these 44 staff, 6 have relocated to their decentralised location in Loughrea as either Department of Transport or Road Safety Authority staff. Of the 6 staff who transferred to Loughrea, 4 went as Road Safety Authority staff, thus becoming public servants. The transfer of the remaining 38 staff to their decentralised location is a matter for the new parent Departments.  410 public service posts are required to decentralise in respect of the following four agencies under the auspices of my Department -National Roads Authority (90), and Railway Safety Commission (20) to Ballinasloe, Irish Aviation Authority (100) to Shannon, and Bus Eireann (200) to Mitchelstown.  My recent decision to move the Maritime Safety Directorate and the Irish Coast Guard  to Drogheda is likely to lead to an increase in the number of posts to be transferred over and above the original 37.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 337 to 340, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The road traffic offences that are scheduled as penalty point offences focus on driving behaviour that adversely impacts on road safety.  The only parking offence that is scheduled as a penalty point offence is the offence of parking a vehicle in a dangerous position and this serious <Col N="193"/>offence incurs 5 penalty points on conviction in court.   It is not proposed at present to extend the penalty point system to offences that involve the illegal parking of vehicles.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has power under section 103 (19) of the Road Traffic Act 1961 as amended by the Road Traffic Act 2002 to authorise persons to perform the functions of traffic wardens. Persons authorised under section 103 are under the control of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and operate out of Garda stations.</P>
        <P>Local authorities have power to employ traffic wardens under the Local Authorities (Traffic Wardens) Act 1975. Persons engaged under that Act operate under the control of the relevant local authority.</P>
        <P>The 1975 Act does not impose any limit on the number of traffic wardens that may be employed by a local authority. The post of traffic warden is, as is the case with any other local authority post, subject at any given time to the prevailing policy as regards overall staffing numbers and recruitment in the local authority public sector.</P>
        <P>Some local authorities avail of the present enabling powers that are in place, since 1987, under section 101B of the 1961 Act to engage authorised persons to enforce parking law on public roads in their area through the clamping of illegally parked vehicles.</P>
        <P>Local authorities have not made any request to my Department to be enabled to outsource traffic warden functions so there is no indication that there is any demand for a revision of the law in that direction.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 341 to 343, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The construction of the Kildare Rail Project, including the provision of car parking, is a matter for Iarnrod Eireann.  I understand from the company that work is underway on all main contracts and that the project is on target for completion in 2010. I understand also that the estimated cost of the project is almost &euro;360m.</P>
        <P>I am informed by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that the Park West Station will open in autumn of this year and that the cost of the station is being funded in full by the developers of ParkWest. Accordingly there is no cost to the Exchequer. I understand from Iarnrod Eireann that as ParkWest will be at the heart of a high density development, there is no requirement for car parking at the station, as users will largely be within walking distance of the station, with cycle facilities and interchange with other public transport also provided. In accordance with the <Col N="194"/>Railway Order for the Kildare Rail Project, ParkWest Station will replace Cherry Orchard Station and is approximately 900 metres west of the current Cherry Orchard Station.</P>

	<P>The proposed integrated ticketing system will be launched initially within the Greater Dublin Area on the scheduled services of Dublin Bus, LUAS and Morton&rsquo;s in September 2009.  Dublin Bus will launch its interim smartcard scheme in summer 2008 and Irish Rail will follow suit with its own interim scheme in 2009.  It will be extended to Irish Rail DART and commuter rail services within a further 12 months, and Bus &Eacute;ireann will implement a pilot scheme on a number of its commuter routes.  It is also envisaged that other private bus operators will join the scheme over this timeframe.  In the meantime, the award the contract to build the Back Office of the system is expected to be awarded by end March 2008 and the procurement process for a contractor to operate the system will then commence.  &euro;12.5 million has been paid out by the Exchequer on integrated ticketing since the inception of the project in March 2002.</P>

	<P>Transport 21 provides for the completion of Luas Line F, the Luas line from Lucan to the city centre, in 2013. Last September, on behalf of RPA I launched the public consultation process on the two route options for the new Luas Line from Lucan to the city centre.  The RPA asked the public and all interested stakeholders to submit their views to the RPA by 31st January. It is expected that a preferred alignment will be identified this year, taking account of the results of this stage of public consultation. </P>
        <P>Following completion of the route selection and design work, the RPA will submit a Railway Order application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. The construction timescale will be dependent on the outcome of the above processes.</P>

	<P>As I stated, in my reply to PQ3401/08 and PQ3480/08, the Agreed Programme for Government includes a commitment to expediting the establishment of a statutory Dublin Transport Authority.  The principal functions of the proposed Authority are set out in the Programme for Government and will include strategic transport planning; procurement of public transport infrastructure; procurement of public transport services; allocation of current and capital Exchequer funds for the provision of public transport infrastructure and services; regulation of public transport fares, routes, and service levels; delivery of integrated ticketing, integrated passenger information and integrated fares; better integration of transport and land use planning; ensuring effective traffic management.  This is in <Col N="195"/>line with the recommendations made in the report of the Dublin Transport Authority Establishment Team. </P>
        <P>I intend that the new Authority will have overall responsibility for surface transport in the Greater Dublin Area subject to direction by Government in respect of significant policy issues.  The Greater Dublin Area comprises the city of Dublin and the administrative counties of South Dublin, Fingal, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.  Preparation of the necessary legislation is in its final stages. I will bring a Memorandum to Government when this important work is completed. However my overriding priority remains to establish a statutory Authority that will be effective.</P>

        <Quest> the extent to which it is intended to improve or increase the number of scheduled commuter rail services from Sallins, Hazelhatch, Confey, Leixlip, Maynooth and Kilcock, County Kildare morning and evening, <Col N="200"/>with a view to providing greater and accessible choice for commuters with the objective of alleviating road traffic congestion; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The position in regard to the improvement of railway services on the Maynooth line is that capacity has been trebled in the last five years.  I understand from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that it is currently reviewing its plans for resignalling in the city centre area as part of its broader plans for the upgrade of railway infrastructure in the Dublin area and that in this context is considering the removal of level crossings and resignalling of the Maynooth line as a means of substantially increasing capacity on the line.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Kildare line capacity has increased by 160% on this line in recent years, along with platform extensions allowing for longer trains, introduction of Sunday services and the turnback facility at Newbridge that provides for Newbridge specific trains to operate.  Furthermore, the Kildare Route project will see four-tracking between Cherry Orchard and Hazelhatch that will allow intercity trains to bypass the commuter services serving the outer Dublin area leading to more efficient use of the rail network.  The Interconnector and the associated electrification project will also provide a significant increase in capacity and service on both the Kildare and Maynooth lines.</P>

The initial selection of projects or works to be funded under the various grant categories is also a matter for local authorities.</P>
        <P>In 2007, grants totalling &euro;23.531 million were allocated to Kildare County Council for works on regional and local roads.  This included a Discretionary Maintenance grant of &euro;694,000 and a Discretionary Improvement grant of &euro;587,000.</P>
        <P>The funds available to local authorities for improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads are intended to cover contingencies arising from severe weather conditions.

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>On 24 January 2008, I jointly announced with the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, that the Government has approved an Economic and Tourism Development Plan for Shannon Airport and its wider catchment area.  The Report is available on the websites of both departments.</P>
        <P>The Economic and Tourism Development Plan will facilitate the completion of a package of measures leading to improved road and rail access for the Shannon region and the continued rollout of broadband infrastructure throughout the region.  There is very significant investment planned for the region under the NDP and Transport 21.  In transport infrastructure alone &euro;2 billion has been committed by Government to road projects in the region while approval for the development of the first phase of the Western Rail Corridor from Ennis to Athenry has also been given.</P>
        <P>An important element of the Action Plan is a new tourism-marketing initiative for the area.  This initiative amounts to an anticipated &euro;15 million to &euro;20 million over the next few years and will be implemented by Tourism Ireland in close consultation with key tourism industry interests in the area, Shannon Development and the F&aacute;ilte Ireland Regions.  The continuing commitment to funding beyond 2008 will, as is the case with all tourism marketing plans, be finalised in the roll out of this new initiative each year.  The primary objective of the initiative will be to promote the wider catchment area of Shannon Airport by highlighting the attractions of the region through additional publicity and promotional activity.</P>
        <P>Under the 2008 Estimates of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism an extra &euro;5 million has been invested in the Tourism Marketing Fund, bringing it to &euro;50 million.  This includes incremental funding of &euro;3 million to specifically address the challenges of Open Skies in 2008.  When combined with the renewal of the Super regions and Air Access marketing initiatives, the result will be &euro;5 million for the Shannon Catchment Area in Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s 2008 overseas marketing programme.  The new tourism marketing programme will concentrate on highlighting the attractions of the Western regions, additional targeted publicity and promotional activity, developing markets around new gateways, including the Shannon-Paris CDG route, and striving to maintain good flows of business through existing routes.</P>
        <P>In drawing up this Plan, I consulted with colleagues Ministers for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Enterprise Trade and Employment, Finance, and Communications Energy and Natural Resources.  I also had regard to the report entitled &ldquo;Mid-West Tourism and Economic Development Plan&rdquo; submitted in 2006 to my Department by a group under the aegis of the Mid-West Regional Authority and comprising Clare County Council, Shannon Development, Shannon Airport Authority, SIGNAL and IBEC.</P>

This is the only task force which has been established under the auspices of my Department in the past five years.</P>
        <P>The establishment of a Hunger Task Force was one of the recommendations of the White Paper on Irish Aid published in September 2006. The aim of the Hunger Task Force is to identify the additional, appropriate and effective contributions that Ireland can make to international efforts to reduce hunger.  The first meeting of the Hunger Task Force took place in Dublin on 14th September 2007 and the second in University College Cork on the 16th of <Col N="205"/>November 2007. The next meeting is a field visit to Malawi which will take place from the 27th to the 29th of February 2008. It is estimated that the total cost of the Task Force will be in the region of &euro;250,000.</P>
        <P>The report of the Hunger Task Force is due around the middle of 2008 and it will outline a number of key actions which Ireland can take to give practical leadership internationally on the attainment of the Millennium Development Goal of halving the proportion of those who suffer from hunger by 2015. It is expected that the report will also result in Ireland taking a more effective and focused approach to tackling hunger.</P>

	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 383 and 384 together.</P>
        <P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, the Development Cooperation Directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is Irish Aid&rsquo;s Headquarters, will decentral<Col N="206"/>ise to Limerick. Good progress has been made and personnel have either been assigned to, or identified for, 103 posts or approximately 83% of the 124 posts scheduled to be decentralised.  An advance party involving 57 staff has already decentralised to interim office premises in Limerick, with most officers being in place since May 2007. It is expected that the remaining staff of Irish Aid will transfer to Limerick in June 2008, on completion and fit-out of the permanent accommodation.</P>
        <P>There are still a number of issues to be worked out with regard to the specialist posts which are scheduled to move. Discussions are on-going at a very senior level with representatives of the specialists, with their union IMPACT and with the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs in order to resolve the outstanding issues. Progress has been made and I hope that these discussions can be brought to a successful conclusion at an early date.</P>
        <P>In June 2005, the Department started reporting quarterly to the Department of Finance on non-property costs associated with the decentralisation programme. Table 1 below sets out the costs incurred by this Department during the period 2004-2006. The costs incurred during this time mainly related to training and subsistence.  Table 2 below sets out the costs incurred in the first three quarters in 2007, mainly arising from the move to interim premises in May of that year. The Department will be reporting shortly to the Department of Finance on the final quarter of 2007.</P>

On request, a passport may also be issued to a person in a new name following marriage. Such applications require the provision of a civil marriage certificate and either the long form of the applicant&rsquo;s certificate of birth or a previous passport issued in the name that applied before marriage.  Should the person in question require further information or assistance, she may contact Ms. Joan Fitzpatrick at the Cork Passport office on 021 4944722. </P>

	<P>Applications to the Reconciliation Fund are reviewed on a periodic basis by an Inter-Departmental Advisory Committee. After considering each application on its merits, the Committee forwards its recommendation to me for final decision. The overriding aim is to ensure as widespread and equitable distribution of funding as possible, giving consideration to the strength of the cross-community and cross-border elements in the application; the level of funding available each year; and the number and quality of applications received. </P>
        <P>An application was received by the Reconciliation Fund from the Mayo Peace Park on 29 January 2008. This was after the closing date for the current tranche of funding, which is due to be decided later this month. The application will however be fully considered by the Inter-Departmental Advisory Committee in the context of the next tranche of grants, the closing date for which is likely to be 19 May 2008.

	<P>The Government is committed to expanding Ireland&rsquo;s Overseas Aid programme. We have set a target of spending 0.7% of GNP on Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) by 2012 and we are well on track to meeting this UN target.  For 2008 the Government has allocated &euro;914 million to ODA. The majority of this funding &mdash; &euro;814 million &mdash; comes under Vote 29, International Cooperation, which is managed by my Department. A further estimated &euro;100 million will be spent by other Government Departments and through Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the EU Development Cooperation Budget. </P>
        <P>Expenditure on ODA in 2008 will be the highest in the history of the programme and will represent 0.54 % of GNP. This level of spending will ensure that Ireland remains one of the most generous donors in the world on a per capita basis.  As with all exchequer funding, the <Col N="208"/>ODA allocation for future years will be decided through the Estimates process. Figures for expenditure on ODA in the period 2009 to 2012 cannot be stated at this point as they are normally linked to estimated GNP growth at the time of the Estimates process. However, I can assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to meeting the target of 0.7% of GNP by 2012 in a planned and phased manner and that Ireland&rsquo;s ODA allocation will grow strongly year on year as we move towards that target.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The funding administered by Irish Aid is delivered through a wide range of partners including government, non Governmental organisations, missionaries, UN funds and programmes, international organisations and humanitarian agencies. Funding is delivered via local, regional and national government systems aimed at, inter alia, building health, education and local government systems. Irish Aid uses a number of modalities and funding mechanisms to manage ODA ranging from sector wide supports, mainly in the social sectors of health and education, to projects and general budget support.</P>
        <P>A significant proportion of Irish Aid funding is delivered through our Multi Annual Partnership Scheme (MAPS) with the main Irish NGOs. In 2007 almost &euro;63 million was provided to the five participating Irish NGOs under MAPS (Concern &euro;23 million, Tr&oacute;caire &euro;18 million, GOAL &euro;14.7 million, Self Help Development International (SHDI) &euro;4 million and Christian Aid Ireland &euro; 3.2 million). In the years 2007 through to 2011, we plan to support our MAPS partners by approximately &euro;387 million as follows: Concern &euro;148 million, Tr&oacute;caire &euro;116 million, GOAL &euro;100 million, Christian Aid &euro;17 million and SHDI &euro;6.5 million.</P>
        <P>As the deputy will be aware Irish Aid has consistently supported the work of Irish Missionaries. &euro;16 million was provided to the Irish Missionary Resource Service in 2007 which will increase to &euro;20 million next year.  As far as future spending is concerned, the ODA allocation will be decided through the Estimates process. Figures for expenditure on ODA in the period 2009 to 2012 cannot be stated at this point as they are normally linked to estimated GNP growth at the time of the Estimates process. However, I can assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to meeting the target of 0.7% of GNP by 2012 in a planned and phased manner and that Ireland&rsquo;s ODA allocation will grow strongly year on year as we move towards that target.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid will continue to focus on the world&rsquo;s poorest countries where need is greatest. As stated in the White Paper on Irish Aid, Sub-Saharan Africa will remain the principal geographic focus. Irish Aid will continue to focus on the world&rsquo;s poorest countries where need is greatest. As stated in the White Paper on Irish Aid, Sub-Saharan Africa will remain the principal geographic focus. However, Ireland places particular emphasis on long term support to eight programme countries: Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania, Mozambique, Zambia, Lesotho, Timor Leste and Vietnam. In 2007 an Embassy was opened in Malawi, which will become Ireland&rsquo;s ninth programme country. These countries are amongst the poorest in the world and Ireland&rsquo;s assistance to them is directed primarily to the social sectors of health, education and rural development in order to make a real difference to the lives of ordinary people. ODA funding to these <Col N="210"/>countries is allocated in accordance with the Country Strategy Papers (CSPs), which have a duration of five years. Five year CSPs were agreed in 2007 for Uganda, Vietnam, Zambia,  Tanzania and Mozambique. CSPs for Ethiopia, Timor Leste and Malawi are under negotiation and the amount to be allocated will be announced once they are agreed.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s official programme of development assistance, Irish Aid, has as its primary aim the reduction of poverty. Africa is the primary geographic focus of Irish Aid. </P>
        <P>The White Paper on Irish Aid sets out the principles and policies underlying the aid programme. It outlines the vision for the future and a number of key initiatives.</P>
        <P>The White Paper was the subject of extensive consultation with the Irish public, with aid agencies and other stakeholders including UN agencies and Ireland&rsquo;s partners in the developing world.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid delivers assistance to over 30 countries in Africa, but has a particularly deep relationship with seven countries called programme countries. These are Tanzania, Zambia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Uganda, Ethiopia and Malawi. In Asia, Vietnam and East Timor are also designated as programme countries.</P>
        <P>The first three countries listed were designated as programme countries in the 1980s based on their poverty, links with Ireland and with Irish missionaries and on the comparative advantage which Ireland had in relation to their needs. The latter three were designated in the mid 1990&rsquo;s based on visits by appraisal teams which looked at the respective poverty indices and on the emergence of these countries from years of conflict.</P>
        <P>Malawi has now become the 7th programme country in Africa on the basis of poverty indices, susceptibility to food insecurity and prior humanitarian operations and experience by Irish Aid there. An Embassy has now been opened in Malawi and work is in hand on setting up a comprehensive bilateral assistance programme.</P>
        <P>Vietnam and East Timor were designated as programme countries on the basis of poverty levels, but also with a view to transferring the lessons from the development experience in Asia, where appropriate, to Africa.</P>
        <P>The overarching objectives of the aid programme are poverty reduction and sustainable development. We address fundamental human needs such as food security, basic education, primary health care and safe water supplies.</P>
        <P>We also place a particular emphasis on building good governance. This includes assistance for enhancing parliamentary oversight, building democratic systems of government that are underpinned by free and fair elections, strengthening the rule of law, enhancing respect for human rights, improving transparency and accountability through initiatives to enhance public financial management and building civil society.</P>
        <P>A guiding principle of Irish Aid&rsquo;s policy is that Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with the developing world is based on a spirit of partnership and equality. The governments and peoples of our partner countries are primarily responsible for their own development and will lead the development process. Ireland will offer advice, expertise and assistance but decisions on development planning must, to the greatest extent possible, be locally owned and led.</P><Col N="211"/>
        <P>The Irish Aid programme is growing rapidly. The commitment of the Government to reach the UN target of 0.7% of GNP by 2012 presents an important opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of millions of poor people in Africa and beyond. This practical and tangible assistance will also be matched by strong international advocacy for poverty reduction and a fairer global order.</P>

	<P>Ireland provides development support to some of the poorest countries in the world, some of which are ranked as having a significant level of corruption. Working in countries with corruption and weak governance generates a risk for donors, including Ireland. </P>
        <P>Corruption affects the poorest in society. We are committed to addressing it through improving transparency and accountability, supporting public oversight institutions, parliamentary reform, the independent media and building the capacity of civil society to influence and monitor public policy decisions.</P>
        <P>For example, in Ethiopia, Ireland supports the strengthening of internal and external audit functions within the Government of Ethiopia. In Uganda, Ireland provides direct support to oversight bodies actively engaged in preventing and addressing corruption, such as the Inspectorate General of Government and the Directorate of Ethics and Integrity. In Zambia, Ireland supports the work of a special Task Force on Corruption. We also provide assistance to the public financial management system, as well as supporting parliamentary oversight of budget implementation and the work of civil society institutions engaged in anti-corruption activities.</P>
        <P>In addition, Irish Aid has in place rigorous accounting and audit controls which are essential to ensuring a transparent, effective and high quality programme. Irish Aid programmes are regularly and intensively audited and evaluated by independent audit firms, by Irish Aid&rsquo;s Evaluation and Audit Unit and by the independent Audit Committee of the Department. Programmes are evaluated to ensure that funds are used for the purposes intended, in particular in respect of outcomes and value for money.</P>
        <P>While we are working in some of the most difficult operating environments in the world, I am satisfied that the monitoring, evaluation and audit systems which we have in place provide the best protection possible against misuse of Irish taxpayers&rsquo; funds.</P>

        <Quest> if the Government plans to ratify the United Nations Convention against Corruption; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy to previous replies to similar questions concerning the United Nations Convention against Corruption, most recently on 27th November 2007. The Convention was adopted by the UN General Assembly in October 2003 and was signed on behalf of Ireland, when it opened for signature, in December 2003. The Convention entered into force on 14 December 2005. </P><Col N="212"/>
        <P>As with all international agreements, before ratification can take place it is necessary to put in place any domestic legislation required to give effect to the agreement.</P>
        <P>In consultation with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and other Government Departments, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (which has responsibility in this area) has examined the Convention and identified what domestic legislation is required to give effect to its provisions. The Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Bill, which completed Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il on 21 January, will enact certain necessary measures. I understand that it is intended to make whatever additional provision in Irish law is required, to enable ratification, in the forthcoming Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill.</P>
        <P>A number of other issues in the civil and administrative area will also have to be addressed in advance of Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the Convention. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be pursuing these matters with the relevant Departments and Agencies.</P>
        <P>The importance of ratification at the earliest date is appreciated. The Convention is a broad and comprehensive treaty which provides internationally-recognised measures to prevent and combat corruption. More generally, it aims to promote integrity, accountability and proper management of public affairs and public property.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>Sixty four volunteers were invited to become members of the Rapid Response Corps in 2007 following a rigorous selection and interview process. Fifty two of this group completed their pre-departure training and checks in the past year, and seven of those have already been deployed to various humanitarian crises worldwide. A further member will be deployed shortly. </P>
        <P>A new campaign to recruit further members will be launched in February. The campaign will seek to recruit volunteers with the logistics, engineering and humanitarian skills most requested, together with new skills profiles identified to us, by our partner agencies.</P>
        <P>The level of funding assigned to the Rapid Response Corps will be dependent on the number of deployments of the Corps and the requested needs in the field. In 2008, it is estimated that the Corps will absorb approximately &euro;1 million and the Deputy can be assured that the necessary funding will be made available to fund the Rapid Response Corps in the period to 2012.</P>

        <P>My Department had responsibility for two measures under the EU Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation (Peace I) which was targeted at Northern Ireland and the <Col N="213"/>six border counties and ran from 1995 to end-December 2001, although funding continued to be drawn down by approved projects until the end of 2005. The first of these two measures was entitled Measure 3.3 on Cross-Border co-operation between Public Bodies and had an expenditure of approximately &euro;11 million. The second was entitled Measure 3.1 on Cross-Border Business and Cultural Linkages and had an expenditure of &euro;12 million. The latter measure was implemented by an intermediary agency, Co-Operation Ireland, under the supervision of this Department.</P>

        <P><i>Name of Group</i></P>
<P>The Enterprise Strategy Group</P>
        <P>The Enterprise Strategy Group published their report &ldquo;Ahead of the Curve &mdash; Ireland&rsquo;s Place in the Global Economy&rdquo; in 2004.  The membership of the group, which was established in 2003, together with their terms of reference are set out below.  The group made more than 50 recommendations directed at a wide range of Departments and agencies.  During the period of the Enterprise Strategy Group study, which ran from July 2003 to July 2004, administrative support was provided by Forf&aacute;s from within its normal allocation. No additional funding was sought or required for this task.  The members of the group gave their time pro bono.  The recommendations of the group were considered by Government and it was agreed to fully implement 70% of the 51 recommendations made in the ESG report, and deliver partial or modified implementation in all except 2 recommendations.  It was decided on the basis of international experience not to proceed with the recommendation to &ldquo;replace the existing regulators for networked sectors with a new regulatory body covering all networked sectors&rdquo; and in addition, a recommendation on the introduction of carbon tax was not adopted.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Group will take account of long term international trends, in globalisation, EU enlargement, technology and regulation, as well as in the structure of industries and markets.  It will recognise Ireland&rsquo;s increased prosperity and changing cost and competitiveness base, while taking account of trends in demography, of the regulatory environment, and of our physical, R&amp;D and technological infrastructures.  Against this background, the Group will produce a strategy based on a vision which recognises the desirability of appropriate balance:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />between Business sectors in the economy</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />between foreign and domestic enterprise ownership</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">The recommendations of this group were considered by Government and an Action Plan with 37 action points was approved in 2005.

        <P FLI="0">The Consumer Strategy Group (CSG) was established in March 2004 with a remit to advise and make recommendations for the development of a national consumer policy strategy.  The Group published its report in May 2005.  The report contained 33 separate recommendations directed at a number of Government Departments.  A full list of the Group&rsquo;s recommendations can be downloaded from the Department&rsquo;s website at: http://www.entemp.ie/publications/ commerce/2005/consumerstrategy.pdf.  The Taskforce is no longer operating.  A High Level Interdepartmental Committee established to consider the implementation of the CSG recommendations endorsed all but one of those recommendations.  The majority of the CSG&rsquo;s recommendations directed at this Department have been implemented.  The implementation of those recommendations directed at other Departments are matters for the Departments concerned.  The secretariat of the CSG was provided by Forfas.  A total of &euro;195,000 was given to Forfas in 2005 in relation to the preparation of the CSG&rsquo;s report.  The cost of providing the secretarial support to the CSG was met from within Forfas&rsquo; budget.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Secretariat to the Forum was provided by Forf&aacute;s.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Terms of Reference of the Small Business Forum:</i></P>
        <P>The terms of reference of the Small Business Forum were as follows:</P>
        <P>The over-arching task of the Forum is to consider in broad terms the current environment for conducting small business in Ireland and to advise on the adequacy and appropriateness of the public policy responses in the context of that environment, including the interventions by the enterprise development agencies.  The Forum should consider whether there are new or revised strategies that would be beneficial in assisting small business to contribute to the growth of the economy.  Any proposals for such new or revised strategies should be complementary <Col N="222"/>to, and be consistent with, the revised enterprise strategy adopted by the Government in response to the Enterprise Strategy Group report.  In particular, the Forum should:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Consider whether the strategies being followed to support and develop the spirit of entrepreneurship in Ireland are effective and appropriate;</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Consider how the pattern of growth of small businesses in Ireland compares internationally and seek to identify the particular characteristics that tend to lead to the growth of small businesses or inhibit such growth;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Review the existing environment for accessing finance by small businesses at each stage of development;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Review the propensity of the small business sector to conduct research and development and to innovate and to consider the capacity of the sector to access the programmes aimed at the promotion of such activities; and</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />In the light of the foregoing, consider what additional or revised actions could be taken to help more small enterprises grow their businesses in a manner that contributes to the overall growth of the Irish economy.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In conducting this review, the Forum should take account of the relevant priorities for action set out in the revised Lisbon Agenda, including the actions contained in the European Charter for Small Enterprises.  The Small Business Forum published its Report in May 2006, which is available at the following website link: http://www.forfas.ie/publications/2006index.htm.  Considerable progress has been made on the Implementation of the SBF Report&rsquo;s Recommendations. A copy of the Third Progress Report of 10 December 2007 on the implementation of the SBF Recommendations, is available at the following website link: http://www.entemp.ie/ publications/enterprise/2007/THIRDPROGRESSREPORT(FINALVersionof10December2007). pdf</P>
        <P>The Taskforce is still operating in the form of an Implementation Group, which meets with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment twice yearly, to discuss progress on the implementation of the recommendations.  The costs of the work of the Small Business Forum are being met from Forfas&rsquo; agreed annual Budget allocation.</P>

	<P>My Department is required to relocate a minimum of 250 posts to Carlow under the Government&rsquo;s Decentralisation Programme and this is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2009.  In order to accommodate staff who wished to move earlier than the projected building completion date of late 2009, officials of my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the OPW, as well as decentralising staff and Business Units, opened an advance office in Carlow on July 30 2007.  The number of staff in this decentralised advance office is 99.  As well as the 99 posts already decentralised to Carlow, my Department has 189 posts in Business Units due to decentralise in the substantive move to Carlow scheduled for 2009.</P>

	<P>The Department made allocations of &euro;100,000 in 2006 and &euro;75,000 in 2007 to the National Irish Safety Organisation (NISO).  There is provision for a further &euro;100,000 in the Department&rsquo;s Estimate for 2008.  NISO is a not for profit registered charity, headed up by a voluntary tripartite Executive supported by a small full time administrative unit.  It has a part-time network of trainers whose main occupation is working in a safety capacity in industry and it provides safety services in eight regions of the country:  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 requires that all actors in the workplace be more safety aware and assigns specific responsibilities to them.  Training is vital to achieving this and can be very effectively delivered via the low cost model employed by NISO.  Following a strategic review, it&rsquo;s financial position would not allow it to expand its training activities and the Department has provided assistance.  This assistance is not to give NISO an unfair competitive advantage but is to assist the restructuring of the organisation and therefore does not act as a subsidy to the provision of training with which NISO also competes with other organisations in the marketplace.</P>

	<P>The Irish Technology Leadership Group was established by a group of Silicon Valley business leaders of Irish origin.  The Group is led by Palm Inc. (PALM) Senior Vice President John Hartnett and is dedicated to helping Ireland take advantage of the opportunities in new technology.  It also includes current and former executives from firms including Sling Media, Intuit Inc. (INTU), Apple Computer Inc. (AAPL), Intel Inc. (INTC), Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) and Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ).  In addition to serving as a think tank, the group will also cultivate a social network for members.  As part of an extensive investment promotion visit to the West Coast in October 2007, I visited Palo Alto to meet with the founding members of the Irish Technology <Col N="229"/>Leadership Group for the formal launch of the new organization.  While I welcome the contribution that the Group will make to raising the profile of Ireland as a location for investment, no funds have been allocated by my Department, or by the development agencies under its remit, to fund the activities of the Group.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 411 and 412 together.</P>
        <P>The matter of Irish law applying to locally recruited personnel working for a foreign embassy accredited to and located in Ireland is a matter that has been the subject of Supreme Court decision such as in the case of the Government of Canada v the Employment Appeals Tribunal and Brian Burke  (1992) 2 I.R. 484 S.C. to which I would refer the Deputy. The Deputy will note that in its judgement the Court had regard to principles of international law, to the nature of the duties and the position of confidence that attaches to locally recruited personnel that <Col N="230"/>determines the nature of the employment relationship between locally recruited personnel and the ambassador, and to the question of sovereign immunity attaching to such activity.</P>
        <P>Practice suggests that in the case of Irish persons working for an embassy in a position of confidence, who would be privy to business of the embassy, the embassy normally applies the law of its home country &mdash; the country which the embassy concerned represents. In other cases, the embassy concerned may apply Irish labour law in respect of their employment contracts with Irish personnel.</P>
        <P>In the event of a dispute between a foreign embassy here and one or more of its Irish staff, where such personnel do not hold a position of confidence, the aggrieved staff may seek redress through the medium of representation to the ambassador concerned, to the authorities in the home country or through media publicity here or abroad, either through their own efforts or that of a trade union. In Ireland, the parties may utilise the expert services of the State&rsquo;s dispute settling machinery such as the Labour Relations Commission to assist them. There is also the option of going to a Rights Commissioner in regard to alleged breaches of Irish employment rights law although there may be a problem in enforcing any findings from such a process.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>

        <P>A range of strategies, programmes and financial incentives are in place to promote economic development that will give rise to sustainable employment throughout east Cork.</P>
        <P>The strategies and programmes of the development agencies are very much in line with the National Development Plan and the National Spatial Strategy, which have been specifically designed to overcome any impediments that may exist to economic development and job creation across the country as a whole.</P>
        <P>The enterprise development agencies have seen the emergence of an economic corridor along the N25 with the initial development of Little Island many years ago followed by new developments at Eastgate, Fota Business Park, Carrigtwohill and Midleton. IDA has also been instrumental in attracting additional client investment to the area with the development of the IDA Business and Technology Park in Carrigtwohill. More recently, Apex &mdash; a fund administration financial services company announced their decision to locate in Midleton with the creation of 40 jobs. IDA Ireland has found that the availability of quality property solutions in the East Cork area has proved attractive to visiting IDA clients.</P>
        <P>In general, the east Cork area has benefited greatly from investment in recent times and, in order to build on our existing successes, the focus should be on building critical mass at regional, as opposed to local, level.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>That National Framework Committee for Work-Life Balance, which has its origins in Social Partnership, comprises representatives from IBEC, ICTU, the Equality Authority and various Government Departments and is chaired by my Department.  During 2007 it continued its remit as set out in Towards 2016 and the Programme for Government where it is charged with supporting and facilitating the development of family friendly policies aimed at assisting in the reconciliation of work and family life at the level of the enterprise.  The Committee had a budget of &euro;278,000 in 2007, of which just under &euro;220,000 was spent.</P>
        <P>Work Life Balance Day, an annual initiative first developed by the Committee in 2001, fell on March 1st.  In the lead up to the day the Committee ran a national media campaign in press and radio to raise awareness of the whole issue of work life balance with employers and employees alike.  It also distributed posters and leaflets to over 15,000 employers/organisations all across Ireland for use in the work place.  A seminar was hosted by the Committee on the day when the then Minister for Labour Affairs formally launched the booklet A Planned and Systematic Approach to Work Life Balance, which was developed by the Committee to assist employers to successfully introduce or enhance work life balance arrangements in the workplace.</P>
        <P>In 2007, the Committee also established a Panel of Consultants to assist employers in the development of that planned and systematic approach to work life balance at enterprise level.  Under the scheme an experienced consultant can be made available to work with small to medium sized enterprises in developing and implementing work life balance policies and arrangements.  For successful applicants to the scheme, the Committee will fund up to a maximum of 5 days consultancy. I formally launched the initiative in November, 2007.</P>
        <P>The Committee continued to host and update the website www.worklifebalance.ie. The Committee secretariat also dealt with a wide range of queries from employers and employees &mdash; these queries varied between phone, letter and via the work life balance website.</P>
        <P>In 2007, the Committee also began planning for Work Life Balance Day 2008, which falls on Friday February 29th.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am conscious of the need to ensure that employment grants are restricted to additional jobs and am satisfied that the schemes operated by the industrial development agencies under my Department, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development reflect this need.</P>
        <P>A condition of approval obliges recipient companies to maintain employment at specified levels. Where employment falls below these levels it gives rise to grant recovery for non-compliance. First time applications from eligible companies submitting eligible investment programmes will be considered and evaluated on the basis of their prevailing employment base at the time of consideration/approval.</P><Col N="232"/>
        <P>Regardless of strategic decisions applicant companies might have made in the past, once the applicant company falls within the agency&rsquo;s legislative and policy requirements the proposal for funding will be considered on its particular merits. This includes the impact it will have on future employment and value creation within the State.  Past employment levels and sustained profitability prior to a first time application would not therefore necessarily militate against the applicant company.</P>
        <P>In the light of the eligibility criteria already in place and the thorough assessment process engaged in by the agencies, I see no need to introduce additional criteria along the lines envisaged in the Question.</P>

        <Quest> the reason a work permit application for a person (details supplied) was refused; if his Department took into account that, despite extensive efforts including prolonged advertising campaigns and assistance from F&Aacute;S, all efforts failed to yield an eligible candidate for the position on offer; and if in this circumstance he will re-examine this work permit application. </Quest>

	<P>The Employment Permits Section of my Department has informed me that the application in respect of the above named was initially refused as her immigration status precluded her from entering full-time employment. The decision was appealed and upheld. However, it is intended that the Employment Permits Section contact the employer in question this week, on the basis of new information received from that employer, in order to clarify what would be required to submit a completed, valid application in this case.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to campaign for a complete ban on the use of cluster munitions.  Pending the establishment of effective international instruments to address humanitarian concerns regarding their use, the Government is actively seeking agreement on an immediate freeze on the use of cluster munitions.   In this regard, I welcome and fully support the initiative of my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs to host a Diplomatic Conference at Croke Park from 19-30 May 2008 at which it is hoped to finalise the first-ever international agreement on cluster munitions.</P>

	<P>No data is kept in my Department on the cost of answering parliamentary questions.  Answering parliamentary questions is an activity which is integral to my Department&rsquo;s activities, and the costs are spread across a wide number of divisions and systems; there are also costs arising in the Oireachtas for which my Department would not be accountable. </P>
        <P>However, it is estimated that the staffing cost of answering a parliamentary question in my Department is not less than &euro;200 per question.  However, for complex questions requiring coordination across all Divisions in the Department and requiring also an input from all Agencies under the aegis of my Department, the average is likely to be many multiples of this amount.</P>

	<P>The Work Visa/Work Authorisation Scheme was replaced by new Work Permit and Green Card schemes following the enactment of the Employment Permits Act 2006.  A key feature of the new system involves the issuing of permits which are employer-specific, with a view to this Department having the ability to track such positions for the purposes of ensuring employee rights are being met and that the conditions of the permit are being complied with. </P>
        <P>In general permit holders are expected to remain with their initial employer for 12-months unless there are exceptional circumstances involved.  After 12 months, permit holders may submit an application for a new employer, which will be considered on its merits.</P>

	<P>The sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations and, in certain circumstances to schools and colleges, throughout the country.  It is the main vehicle for development of sports facilities at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  Under the programme priority is given to the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of sports facilities.</P>
        <P>Primary and post-primary schools wishing to be considered for funding under the programme may apply for funding jointly with local sports clubs or community groups and must meet other conditions including a requirement that the local community will have significant access to the proposed facility, at least 30 hours a week throughout the year, when it is not being used by the school itself.  Any sports facility proposed for funding by a sporting organisation and which would be located within school grounds would have to meet these same conditions.</P>
        <P>Applications from primary and post-primary schools and colleges on their own are not considered under the programme. Responsibility for the provision of sports facilities in schools and colleges is a matter in the first instance for my colleague the Minister for Education and Science.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 386 of 27 November 2007, his plans to review the operation of waiting days in respect of claims with a view to either abolishing or reducing the number of days; the cost to the Exchequer if the number of waiting days were reduced by one day; the cost to the Exchequer if waiting days were abolished in their entirety; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>Under the legislation, a person who claims Disability/Injury Benefit or an Unemployment payment is not normally paid for the first 3 days, which are known as waiting days. Where, however, the person had a recent claim in respect of any of these schemes, payment may be made from the first day of the claim. </P>
        <P>Waiting days have been a feature of these schemes since their inception and are a feature of similar social security schemes in many countries.</P>
        <P>The cost of abolishing waiting days is estimated at some &euro;36m, while the cost of reducing waiting days by one day is estimated at &euro;12m. There would also be additional unquantifiable costs related to illnesses of three days or less duration, as well as administrative costs involved in processing claims.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to change t he qualifying conditions at this time and any changes in the future would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE), an exceptional needs payment (ENP) may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which the applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources. There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is determined by the Executive based on the particular circumstances of the case.  Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health service executive payment.  </P>
        <P>The Dublin/Mid-Leinster Area of the Executive has advised that a final decision has not been made in relation to a request for an exceptional needs payment from the person concerned.  It further advises that while a payment had been made by the community welfare office responsible for the area in which the person concerned previously lived, his current request for an exceptional needs payment is being examined as his circumstances have changed since the previous payment was awarded.  The Executive will be in contact with the person concerned shortly when a decision has been made regarding his entitlement to a payment.</P><Col N="242"/>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the reason for the apparent anomaly surrounding the transition pension, whereby individuals in receipt of this pension may earn no more than &euro;38 a week, but when in receipt of a contributory pension the following year there is no limit on their earnings; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[3336/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The state pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension. It was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement at age 65. A key qualifying condition for the scheme is that a person has to be retired in order to qualify for a payment. Retirement was defined as not engaging in insurable employment, which today means earning less than &euro;38 per week. The social welfare pension age was reduced over a period of years until it reached 66 years of age, which means that the retirement condition is now only effective for 1 year.</P>
        <P>I consider it important that those who wish to continue in employment after normal retirement age should, as far as is possible, be facilitated and supported.  Longer working can play an important role in ensuring that our pensions system is sustainable in the future and it can also be beneficial to the individual.</P>
        <P>The retirement condition associated with the state pension (transition) is only one aspect of a much broader agenda which will need to be addressed if we are to create the conditions where people can continue in employment past what we now regard as normal retirement age.</P>
        <P>As the House is aware, I published the Green Paper on Pensions on 17th October and this includes an examination of all the issues surrounding retirement age, the barriers faced by older workers who wish to remain in employment and the incentives in this regard which can be considered.   A consultation process on the Green Paper is now underway and will remain open until mid 2008.  The Government will respond to the process by publishing a framework for future pensions policy and I expect that this will happen towards the end of the year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The policy of this and previous governments has concentrated on providing real increases in primary social welfare rates, to help improve the ability of people who depend on social welfare to meet their basic living costs including food. </P>
        <P>The Department through its various social insurance and assistance schemes provides income supports to people to meet their basic living needs, including food, clothing, heat and light.</P>
        <P>In recent years, budgetary increases in social welfare payment rates have consistently exceeded increases in the cost of living. This key policy is the primary focus of Budget allocations to my Department each year, and it has helped ensure that those depending on social welfare experience real improvement in their ability to meet their basic needs, including provision of adequate food, heating, etc.</P>
        <P>In addition to basic payments, supplements are also payable in certain circumstances for specific needs, for example fuel allowances, rent supplements, living alone allowance for older people or the household benefits package for pensioners, eligible disabled people and carers.  Where people on low incomes have particular medical conditions or dietary requirements, diet supplements are available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive.  Expenditure on diet supplements in 2007 amounted to &euro;5.5m with over 10,000 people benefiting.</P>
        <P>Revised diet supplements arrangements were introduced in April 2006 and subsequently updated in January 2007.  These revised arrangements reflected the findings of a study commissioned from the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute on healthy eating. The objective is that all social welfare recipients, including those with special dietary needs, should be able to purchase an appropriate diet at a cost of no more than one third of their income.  The study on healthy eating and specialised diets &mdash; Examination of the Cost of Healthy Eating and Specialised Diets for a Single Individual in Ireland &mdash; was carried out to inform policy on diet supplement arrangements and incorporated a costing for a healthy eating diet.  It was published in January 2006.  This report was updated in November 2007 in the light of changing prices and ongoing research on nutritional issues. One of the key findings in this update is that a balanced healthy eating diet can be purchased for between 18% and 30% of a person&rsquo;s social welfare allowance.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the policy of providing substantial real increases in primary social insurance and assistance payment rates has been effective in ensuring that those who depend on social welfare income have sufficient income for healthy food and I do not consider that a review of social welfare payments in this regard is required.</P>

	<P>Access to a healthy diet and tackling food poverty is a clear priority for this Government and the approach being adopted is linked to a wide range of policy initiatives which are reinforced in the Agreed Programme for Government. </P>
        <P>Towards 2016 contains targets relating to the development of the Schools Meals Programme, a new Health Promotion Policy and action on children&rsquo;s food poverty and obesity. Building on this, the NAP inclusion 2007-2016 contains a number of targets aimed at providing access to a healthy and affordable diet. Commitments in relation to food and nutrition include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a National Nutrition Policy to address children&rsquo;s food poverty and obesity &mdash; this will be launched shortly by the Department of Health and Children; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the initiation, by the Department of Health and Children working in partnership with other stakeholders, of specific community and sectoral initiatives to encourage healthy eating and physical activity among adults, with a particular focus on adults living in areas of disadvantage.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The school meals schemes for children in disadvantaged areas funded by my Department &mdash; the urban school meals scheme and the local projects scheme- can make an important contribution to ensuring that children receive better nutrition. It is a criterion of schemes that funding is used for healthy, nutritious food only and schools are encouraged to include fruit with each meal. In 2007, some 185,000 pupils in 1,800 schools benefited from the scheme at a cost of some &euro;27m. The number of meals being provided on a daily basis through the school meals local projects scheme doubled from 89,915 in the school year 2005/2006 to 179,660 in the school year 2006/2007.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department is involved with a Healthy Food for All initiative to develop a code of best practice for school meals. Healthy eating is affected by dietary and nutritional awareness, cultural attitudes and access to good quality grocery shopping, as well as to the adequacy of social welfare income supports. A costing for a healthy eating diet was incorporated in the study entitled the Examination of the Cost of Healthy Eating and Specialised Diets for a Single Individual in Ireland which was undertaken by the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute for my Department to inform policy on diet supplement arrangements. Over 10,000 people received such supplements through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme at a cost of &euro;5.5 million in 2007.</P>
        <P>The study was updated in November 2007 in the light of changing prices and ongoing research on nutritional issues. One of its key findings is that a balanced healthy eating diet can be purchased for between 18% and 30% of a person&rsquo;s social welfare allowance.   In line with the Government&rsquo;s targets in the NAP inclusion, increases in social welfare payment rates have consistently exceeded increases in the cost of living in recent years. This has helped to ensure that those depending on social welfare experience real improvement in their ability to meet their basic needs, including provision of adequate food, heating, etc.</P>
        <P>There is no one indicator or measure of poverty that gives a complete picture of the situation regarding deprivation, poverty and social exclusion. The official Government approved consistent poverty measure was developed independently by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI). The main objective of this poverty measure is to clearly identify those who are most deprived and vulnerable in society i.e. the proportion of people, from those with less than 60 per cent of median income, who are deprived of goods or services considered essential for a basic standard of living. Deprivation of food is reflected in two out of the eleven indicators used to obtain the measure of consistent poverty measure.</P><Col N="245"/>
        <P>The overall goal in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion (NAP inclusion, is to reduce the proportion of the population experiencing consistent poverty to between 2 per cent and 4 per cent by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016. The latest results from the EU SILC survey, released November 2007, indicate that the Government is on target to achieve this goal. It showed that the rate of consistent poverty in the population in 2006 was 6.5 per cent, down from 8.2 per cent in 2003. A reduction in food poverty is being achieved as part of the overall reduction in consistent poverty.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest> the reason for the delay in processing child benefit applications; and the steps he is taking to address same. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no delay in processing the majority of Child Benefit and Early Childcare Supplement awards.  Awards on behalf of Irish &mdash; born children are processed either automatically or in a partially automated way using the child&rsquo;s birth details when they are registered with the General Registrar&rsquo;s Office.  Parents are contacted by the Child Benefit office within two days of the registration of their child&rsquo;s birth. The Early Childcare Supplement is paid automatically when Child Benefit is awarded.  Payments on behalf of some 65,000 children were paid this way in 2007.</P>
        <P>Currently there are delays in processing Child Benefit for children born outside Ireland &ndash; both where the children are living here with their parents and for children living in other EU countries who have a parent or parents working in Ireland.  These cases are slower to process as the customer must satisfy the Habitual Residency condition test and this may entail contacting employers, Department of Justice and other relevant bodies to confirm their status in the state. The residency of the children in Ireland must also be confirmed.</P>
        <P>EU nationals who come to work in Ireland but whose families remain in their home country may have an entitlement to Family Benefits in Ireland under EU Regulation 1408/71. Before payment of Child Benefit is made for non-resident children it is necessary to contact the authorities in the country of residence of the children to confirm details and establish what, if any, family benefits are payable in the home country as this will determine entitlement to Irish payments.</P>
        <P>The process in respect of EU nationals with non resident children can take a number of months to complete in normal circumstances and, as a result the number of claims that have been finalised to date is relatively small.</P>
        <P>The number of claims received from EU nationals for non resident children is down approximately 50% on the same period last year. Additional temporary staff and overtime work is being applied to process these claims and this, along with the reduction in the number of claims, will result in an improvement during 2008.</P>

        <P>The Office of Public Works (OPW) is charged with securing accommodation in Carrick-on-Shannon for this Department. Following an examination of the availability of accommodation in Carrick-on-Shannon, it was decided, following consultation with this Department, that a building which was under construction would provide the most suitable solution in the short-term and would allow the Department progress its decentralisation programme. To date, 113 employees have relocated to this building in Carrick-on-Shannon. A further 27 posts will transfer during the first quarter of 2008. The annual rental cost for this office space is &euro;800,000 and fit-out costs have totalled &euro;4,331,000.</P>
        <P>At this time, there is no indicative timeframe from the OPW regarding the availability of further accommodation in Carrick-on-Shannon. The Department is, however, fully committed to fulfilling its obligation under the programme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 453 to 455, inclusive, together.  </P>
        <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to high level committees that Departments establish from time to time to consider and advance particular strategic issues.  In this context, my Department has set up no such task force since it was established in June 2002.</P>
        <P>However, the Deputy may wish to note that my Department supports the work of 14 Local Drugs Task Forces and 10 Regional Drugs Task Forces.  The Task Forces include representatives of the relevant statutory agencies as well as the community and Voluntary sector.  Each Task Force is currently implementing an action plan for their areas, supporting a broad range of community based projects in the areas of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation.  The budget for the Task Forces in 2008 is &euro;35m approx.</P>
        <P>Although the questions refer to task forces, for completeness sake, I would like to also inform the Deputy that my Department also has a number of advisory groups, amongst which are Forum na Gaeilge and Comhairle na Tuaithe.</P>

	<P>To date, 76 of the 140 staff of my Department originally due to relocate to Co. Mayo have transferred to an interim location in Tubbercurry, Co. Sligo, pending the acquisition of a site and the building of a new headquarters at Charlestown, Co. Mayo.  It is planned to increase the number at the interim location to just over 100 from March 2008.  The Department has already fulfilled its commitment to relocate 10 officers to Na Forbacha, Galway.</P>
        <P>Pobal have filled 25 posts in Clifden, Co. Galway. The remaining 15 positions will relocate when a permanent building is in place, which is expected in late 2009.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no statutory power to regulate the hours that leaflets and other items may be delivered to households. However, in a broader sense, I am well aware that the common practice of persons and organisations collecting goods, and particularly clothing, door-to-door, purportedly for charitable purposes, is an issue of concern both to genuine charities and to the general public. </P>
        <P>Measures in the Charities Bill 2007, which recently completed Committee Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, will lead to increased transparency in relation to the operations of charities and should help to ensure that the public will be able to make more informed decisions about the organisations to which they choose to donate.</P>
        <P>At the present time, the activities of persons and organisations purporting to collect goods for charitable purposes are unregulated. However, it will be mandatory under the Charities Bill for a charity wishing to operate in the State to register with the proposed Charities Regulatory Authority. It is envisaged that the register will be accessible to the general public on the Authority&rsquo;s website, thus enabling members of the public to easily check the charitable bona fides of a body operating here. The Bill also provides that charities on the register must state they are so registered in all public documents or such other publications as may be prescribed by regulations and that a person who holds out a body as being a charity, but is not registered here, will be guilty of an offence punishable, on conviction, by a fine and/or imprisonment. It will be within the remit of the Regulatory Authority to take steps to make the public aware of how to determine the veracity of door-to-door collectors.</P><Col N="251"/>
        <P>I am also taking advice as to whether additional legal provisions are required in the Charities Bill to restrict the practice of non-charitable organisations holding themselves out as charitable organisations and will introduce such further provisions at the Report Stage of the Bill, if necessary.</P>

        <Quest> if she is satisfied that the Irish coastal community with particular reference to families dependent on the fishing industry are being fairly treated through the EU fisheries policy with particular reference to conservation measures which appear to have the least impact on major fishing fleets that have caused serious depletion of the fish stocks; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the EU&rsquo;s Common Fisheries Policy.  It is not clear from the Deputy&rsquo;s <Col N="253"/>question whether he has specific conservation measures in mind that he believes are impacting unfairly on families of those working in the industry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In general terms, it is clear that many of the fish stocks of importance to Irish fishermen in Irish and other European waters are already seriously depleted or are seriously at risk of it.  In order to address that problem, with the objective of trying to ensure the viability of the fishing industry going forward, a range of conservation and recovery measures are already in place or are being introduced, both at national and EU level.  These include for example:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />technical measures such as specifications for net and mesh sizes for different fisheries;&middot;	specifications for minimum landing sizes aimed at protecting juvenile fish;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />area and temporal closures to protect spawning, and to promote stock recovery;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the establishment of Total Allowable Catches (TACs) on an annual basis to provide inter alia that fishing pressure on stocks is kept to a sustainable level; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />reduction of the size of the European fishing fleet as a whole in the interest of sustainability of fish stocks and a more viable industry for the remainder.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">As well as our responsibility to conserve and protect our oceans and seas for their own intrinsic value, a key theme underpinning all of these conservation measures, and one which informs national policy here in Ireland also, is the economic, social and cultural impact of the fishing industry on the small coastal communities who depend on it.  If strong measures are not taken to conserve fish stocks now, it is clear that there will be no fishing industry in the future and that prospect is indeed a bleak one for both those particular communities and the community as a whole.   I will continue to work closely with our fishing industry to deliver strong and effective conservation measures that ensure a sustainable and profitable fishing industry and protects, going forward, the livelihoods of coastal communities dependent on fishing.</P>

	<P>There are still questions to be resolved with the European Commission regarding processing of payments in REPS 2, REPS 3 and REPS 4 and whether we can continue with the previous practice of making up-front payments to all REP scheme participants at the start of the contract year.

        <Quest> if she will make the REP scheme package more flexible for the sheep sector, particularly for hill sheep farmers with designated lands; if she will include the &euro;2,000 top up for hill sheep farmers in designated areas as a supplementary payment measure in REP scheme four; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>REPS 4 includes a new mixed grazing supplementary measure specifically targeted at the sheep sector.  Farmers availing of this new supplementary measure can draw down an additional annual payment of up to &euro;1,000.  In addition, payment rates in REPS 4 are 17% higher than those in REPS 3, in accordance with the partnership agreement with the farming organisations.</P>
        <P>I have recently had discussions with farmers&rsquo; representatives who made certain suggestions about the supplementary measure.  I undertook to have these examined and I hope to respond shortly.  However the European Commission&rsquo;s agreement for this measure in REPS 4 was secured on the basis that it would deliver specific environmental benefits and the scope for amendment is limited.</P>
        <P>I understand that the reference to the &euro;2,000 payment to certain hill farmers relates to a specific arrangement in County Mayo operated by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  REPS farmers in this area received payment for undertaking a new grazing regime which was necessary to deal with serious environmental problems caused by overgrazing.  The agreement was confined to farmers in REPS 2 and REPS 3 on the grounds that the specification for REPS 4 would contain a requirement for a grazing regime to include a sustainable stocking requirement to protect against both undergrazing and overgrazing.  Such a provision is included in the current REPS 4 specification.  Consequently there are no grounds on which an additional payment under REPS 4 could be justified.</P>

	<P Just="Left">There are a number of applications for foreshore licences being processed in respect of applications from Waterford County Council.</P><Col N="256"/>
        <P>The current position regarding the applications is as follows.  Regarding the Outfall from Stormwater/Surfacewater Collection system at Cappoquin (Application received 29 April 2005), my Department&rsquo;s Engineering Division, having reviewed additional information provided by the Council in respect of the application has advised that the application in respect of this outfall should be amended so that the outfall would consist of an appropriate type pipe buried to discharge point with protection provided against scour etc by appropriately sized rock armour. Revised drawings have been received from the consulting engineers acting for the Council and these are being examined by Engineering Division. In addition, I understand that the consultants acting for the Council are in communication with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding concerns expressed by that Department in relation to the Quay Wall at Cappoquin.</P>
        <P>Regarding Outfall from Wastewater Treatment Plant at Cappoquin (Application received 29 April 2005), the Engineering Division, having reviewed additional information supplied by the Council requires that a rock layer be put in place at the outfall. Revised drawings have been received from the consulting engineers acting for the Council and these are being examined by Engineering Division.</P>
        <P>Regarding Outfall from Stormwater/Surfacewater Collection system at Ardmore (Application received 29 April 2005), the revised proposal by the Council to construct a new outfall is currently being assessed by Engineering Division. In addition I understand that the consultants acting for the Council are in communication with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding archaeological issues associated with the proposed works.</P>
        <P>Regarding Outfall from Wastewater Treatment Plant at Ardmore (Application received 29 April 2005), the Engineering Division has examined additional information supplied by the Council in respect of this application and remains of the view that the outfall should be protected by a rock layer, revised drawings have been received from the consulting engineers acting for the Council and these are being examined by Engineering Division.</P>
        <P>Regarding Outfall from Stormwater/Surfacewater Collection System at Stradbally (Application received 29 April 2005), this application is being examined by Engineering Division.</P>
        <P>Regarding Outfall from Wastewater Treatment Plant at Stradbally (Application received 29 April 2005), the Engineering Division having examined the application and supplementary information supplied has indicated that it remains of the view that the outfall should be protected by a rock layer. Revised drawings have been received from the consulting engineers acting for the Council and these are being examined by Engineering Division.</P>
        <P>Regarding Outfall from Wastewater Treatment Plant at Ballyduff/Kilmeaden (Application received 31 July 2006), this application has been examined by Engineering Division and as the proposed discharge point is above High Water Mark, a foreshore licence will not be required.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding Dunmore East &ndash; Outfall from Stormwater/Surfacewater and Wastewater Treatment Plant (Application received 18 April 2005), Draft specific conditions have been issued to the Council in respect of these two applications.  Additional conditions received from the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government have been communicated to the Council and the Council has indicated its acceptance for same. However, the Council has indicated that it wishes to have amendments made to some of the other specific conditions included in the draft licence and this request is being examined by my Department.</P><Col N="257"/>
        <P>Regarding Cheekpoint Sewerage Scheme (Application received 27 May 1999), following extensive correspondence between my Department and Waterford County Council, the Council has agreed to accept proposed specific conditions to be included in the licence and I have given consent to the grant of a licence in respect of this scheme.  The formal licence document is being prepared by the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office.</P>
        <P>Regarding Dungarvan Sewerage Scheme (Application received 12 February 1999), following extensive correspondence with the Council, revised draft specific conditions in respect of the licence for the Dungarvan sewerage scheme were issued to the Council.  The Council has indicated that it has concerns about a number of the proposed conditions and the matters raised are being examined by my Department.</P>
        <P>Regarding Stormwater flood relief scheme &ndash; Tournore Detention Pond (Application received 8 March 2007), this application was circulated to the Department&rsquo;s consultees and responses are awaited from our Engineering Division and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.</P>
        <P>Regarding Stormwater flood relief scheme &ndash; River Colligan (Application received 8 March 2007), this application was circulated to the Department&rsquo;s consultees and responses are awaited from our Engineering Division. Nature conservation observations from the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government are also awaited,</P>
        <P>My Department considers these applications as being of high priority and will continue to make every effort to ensure that they are expedited having due regard to the requirements of good foreshore management.</P>

	<P>There is only one Taskforce currently operating in my Department as follows:</P>
        <P>In response to the threat posed by the spread of avian influenza and the need to coordinate the development of a robust range of contingency measures, a Government Taskforce on Avian Influenza was established in 2006.  It is chaired by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries &amp; Food and, apart from my Department, includes senior representatives from the following Departments/Agencies: Arts, Sports &amp; Tourism; Health &amp; Children; Environment, Heritage &amp; Local Government; Transport; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; Taoiseach; Defence Forces; Foreign Affairs; Defence; Finance; Health Service Executive; Health Protection Surveillance Centre; and Justice.</P><Col N="258"/>
        <P>The Taskforce has been required to meet on very few occasions, though members are kept advised of developments by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food from time-to-time.  Because its membership is drawn exclusively from other Government Departments and State Agencies and given the relatively few occasions on which it has met, there have been little or no costs associated with its establishment.  As required, secretariat services are provided by my Department&rsquo;s Animal Health &amp; Welfare Division, as part of their day-to-day work in maintaining contingency arrangements.</P>

        <P el="10"><i>Mushroom Taskforce</i></P>
        <P el="0">The taskforce was set up in December 2003 to arrive at a consensus on the major issues facing the mushroom sector and to devise a time bound action plan to address those issues in order to secure the future viability of the sector. The task force published its report in May 2004 and its 36 recommendations, which had a time frame of up to 36 months, related to supply arrangements, price transparency, cost reduction, marketing and promotion, training and advisory, research and the environment. A review group met on four occasions to review the implementation of the recommendations by the industry and the State Bodies concerned.  The period since publication of the Taskforce Report has been marked by major consolidation in the sector. Increasing the supply of Phase III mushroom compost is the only issue which is still being actively pursued.</P>
        <P>Over the five-month duration of the Taskforce, administrative support/secretariat services were provided from existing staff resources within my Department and Plant Health Division. Expenses amounting to &euro;9,620 were incurred for the printing of the Report, a stipend for travel expenses of the Chairman and refreshments at meetings.</P>
       <P el="10"><i>Government Taskforce on Avian Influenza</i></P>
        <P el="0">In response to the threat posed by the spread of avian influenza and the need to coordinate the development of a robust range of contingency measures, a Government Taskforce on Avian Influenza was established in 2006.</P>

It is accounted for under Land Use Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF), which includes sequestration from forestry, and emissions from net land use changes such as putting grassland into cereals.  Net sequestration by the Kyoto-eligible forests currently amounts to an average of 2.1 million tonnes of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> equiv per annum and land change from grassland to tillage amounts to approximately 2.5 tonnes of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> equiv per hectare per year depending on the soil type.</P>

Emissions associated with the use of fertiliser, whether used on grassland or tillage, are accounted for under Direct Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Synthetic Fertilisers and are counted under the Agricultural Soils category, but are not accounted for separately. There are further emissions from cereals under the heading of Crop <Col N="261"/>Residues which amounts to approximately 130, 000 tonnes of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> equiv. per year.   There is an additional emission associated with nitrogen lost through leaching and nitrogen lost through ammonia volatilisation. These emissions are not broken down between grassland and tillage crops in the inventory accounting system.</P>

	<P>Under the Musk Rats Act, 1933 (Application to Mink) Order 1965, the keeping of mink is prohibited except under licence, obtained from my Department.  Licences are issued under this legislation only if the applicant, following an inspection, is found to be compliant with a number of key conditions.  There is no legislation requiring the licensing of fox farms.</P>
        <P>Licensed fur farms are also inspected to assess compliance with the Council of Europe recommendations concerning fur animals and Council Directive 98/58/EC concerning the protection of animals kept for farming purposes. These inspections have to date found that the licensed fur farms have been operating in compliance with current legislation. Inspections have also found that the slaughter methods employed by the licensed fur farms are permitted under the Sixth Schedule of the European Communities (Protection of Animals at Time of Slaughter) Regulations, 1995.</P>
        <P>Fur Farming is considered to be a legitimate farming activity throughout the greater majority of Member States of the European Union, the exceptions being the UK where fur farming was banned from 01/01/2003 and Austria or Luxembourg where fur farming is not permitted.</P>
        <P>Given that the licensed fur farms operating in this country meet current national and EU requirements there is no reason why what is, after all, a legitimate farming activity, which is permitted in the greater majority of EU Member States, should be banned.</P>
        <P>My Department continues to monitor the operation of the licensed fur farms.</P>

Section 16 also provides that the licensee shall, by virtue of, but subject to the conditions of, the licence and the requirements of any regulations made under section 71, have the exclusive right to do within the boundaries or limits specified in the licence anything authorised by the licence or necessary or expedient to conduct the operations specified in the licence.</P>

	<P>The information sought for the period 1973 to 2006 is set out in the tables. Further details are available in the Compendium of Irish Agricultural Statistics, 2007, which is published on my Department&rsquo;s web site.</P>
        <P>For the duration of the current EU financial perspective and programming period, 2007 to 2013, the European Agriculture Guarantee Fund (EAGF) will continue to finance the Single Farm Payment, Export Refunds and Market Intervention for a range of agricultural products, the Sugar Restructuring Fund, the Operational Programmes for Fruit and Vegetable Producer Groups and a number of smaller schemes. EU receipts in Ireland in respect of these schemes in the 2007 EAGF financial year amounted to approximately &euro;1.388 billion of which &euro;1.256billion was in respect of the Single Farm Payment.</P>
        <P>In addition, under Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme 2007-2013, the European Agricultural Fund For Rural Development (EAFRD) co-funds the Early Retirement Scheme, the Young Farmer Installation Aid Scheme, the Farm Improvement Scheme, the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and the Scheme of Compensatory Allowances in Disadvantaged Areas. EAFRD co-funding amounted to &euro;365million in 2007.</P>
        <P>My Department also received some &euro;10.46m in respect of the BSE and other veterinary eradication programmes and &euro;39.8m in respect of on farm investment schemes under the 2000-2006 round of Structural Funds. In the fisheries sector, EU receipts in 2007 in respect of aquaculture and other fisheries development projects amounted to approximately &euro;5.2million.</P>

<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Inform my Department if mink cease to be kept at any premises covered by this licence and of any change in ownership.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Allow authorised officers (of the Department) to inspect the premises at all reasonable times.</P>

Application forms for large scale capital must be submitted by the management authority of the schools involved.</P>
        <P>Architectural assessments would have to be carried out on all the existing school buildings to determine which, if any, would be suitable to act as hosts for the proposed rationalisation and what are the longer term accommodation needs of the area. These assessments will enable my Department to take a view on how infrastructure can properly be developed to facilitate the proposals.</P>

	<P>Under the prescribed terms and conditions of my Department&rsquo;s student maintenance grant schemes grant assistance may not be awarded in respect of a repeat period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether or not funding was previously awarded. The awarding body may, however, waive this provision in exceptional circumstances such as certified serious illness. In such instances decisions are made by the assessing authority on a case by case basis. It should be emphasised, however, that this discretion would only be exercised where a candidate is repeating a period of study on the same course. </P>
        <P>My Department understands, from the information provided by the Deputy that the candidate has already pursued an undergraduate course, which he did not complete and is now pursuing a different course at undergraduate level. It would appear that the decision made by the deciding body is in line with the provisions of the grant schemes.</P>
        <P>The decision on eligibility for repeat year funding is a matter for the relevant assessing authority.  The assessing authorities do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired.</P>
        <P>If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant assessing authority. Where an individual applicant has an appeal turned down by the relevant assessing authority, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, an official appeal form (available from the assessing authority) outlining the position may be submitted by the candidate to the Higher Education: Equity of Access unit in my Department.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 505 and 506 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that while individual institutions in the education sector have varying degrees of autonomy according to their status and statutory provisions, the Minister has an overarching responsibility for education policy across all levels of the education system and responsibility for funding provided from the Education Vote.</P><Col N="284"/>
        <P>The compilation of the information sought by the Deputy in relation to the annual operating cost for each statutory body for each of the past five years would involve an inordinate amount of administrative time.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that information on staffing and budgets is available in annual reports and other documents published by various bodies.    Many of these reports are available in the Oireachtas Library or can be downloaded from the websites of bodies concerned. Also information on expenditure for a number of bodies is included in my Department&rsquo;s Audited Appropriation Accounts published annually.  If the Deputy has any queries in relation to a particular body then officials in my Department would be more than happy to discuss these with her.</P>

        <Quest> if under special extenuating circumstances, her Department would agree to providing funding for a maintenance grant for postgraduate studies in England to a student who would have qualified for such a grant had they studied for their postgraduate studies here; if she will make an exception in order to promote her Department&rsquo;s equity of access ethos; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Third Level Student Support Schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to eligible students pursuing approved full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration (pursued in a university or a third level institution which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds) in other EU Member States with effect from the 1996/97 academic year. The extension of the Schemes at that time did not include courses at postgraduate level and, accordingly, there is no grant aid available under the schemes for students pursuing postgraduate studies outside of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Any extension of the current arrangements to provide for students pursuing postgraduate courses outside of Ireland could only be considered in the light of available resources and other competing demands within the education sector. At present, there are no plans to expand the provisions in the grant schemes in relation to postgraduate study abroad.</P>
        <P>However, Section 21 of the Finance Act 2000, as amended by Section 29 of the Finance Act 2001, provides for the introduction of tax relief for postgraduate tution fees paid in colleges outside of Ireland. This relief, which is available from the tax year 2000/01 onwards, applies at the standard rate of tax. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from an individual&rsquo;s Local Tax Office.</P>

	<P>There are a number of different types of post-primary school in the Irish education system. The second level sector is comprised of voluntary secondary schools, community schools and comprehensive schools, which are generally denominational (for example, Roman Catholic or Protestant). Vocational schools and community colleges are non-denominational.</P>
        <P>All of these schools provide courses in accordance with the curriculum prescribed by my Department, enter their pupils for the State examinations and are subject to evaluation by my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate. Approximately 340,000 students are enrolled in about 750 second-level schools.</P>
        <P>Voluntary secondary schools are privately owned and managed. They are under the trusteeship of religious communities, boards of governors or individuals. The Education Act, 1998, requires secondary schools to have boards of management that include parent and teacher representatives. Voluntary secondary schools may be fee-paying or non-fee paying. In the past, voluntary secondary schools provided a more academic education but increasingly, they provide a range of academic, practical and vocational subjects.</P><Col N="290"/>
        <P>Community and comprehensive schools were established in the 1960s in order to provide a broad curriculum for all the young people in a community. Many of these schools were established as the result of the amalgamation of voluntary secondary and vocational schools.</P>
        <P>Comprehensive schools combine academic and vocational subjects in a wide curriculum. They are managed by a board of management representative of the diocesan religious authority, the VEC of the area and the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
        <P>Community schools are managed by boards of management representative of local interests. These schools offer a broad curriculum embracing both practical and academic subjects. They also provide facilities for adult education and community development projects.</P>
        <P>The remaining schools in the sector are Vocational Schools and Community Colleges. These schools are administered by 33 Vocational Education Committees established as statutory bodies set up under the Vocational Education Act, 1930, as amended. The boards of management for these schools are sub-committees of the VEC. Membership of the boards include, VEC representatives, parent, teacher and community representatives. Initially, the main thrust of these schools was directed towards the development of manual skills and preparation of young people for trades. Today, they generally provide a wide range of both academic and practical subjects. Vocational schools and Community Colleges are the main providers of adult education and community education courses.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, special needs assistants (SNAs) are sanctioned by special education needs organisers (SENOs) to schools specifically to assist in the care of pupils and students with disabilities in an educational context. SNAs may be appointed to a special school or a mainstream school to assist school authorities in making suitable provision for children who have been assessed as having such needs. Applications for SNA support are made by schools to the local SENO and the SENO conveys a decision on the application directly to the schools without recourse to my Department. The SENOs operate within the policy outlined in my Department&rsquo;s circular for allocating such support.</P>
        <P>In allocating SNA support, I can confirm that there have been no cutbacks in relation to the allocation of SNAs to schools and any SNA posts that have been terminated was as a result of the pupils for whom such support was originally granted no longer requiring such support or transferring from the school system. In fact the number of SNAs in our schools has increased significantly and there are now over 9,800 SNAs in the primary, post-primary and special schools supporting children with special care needs. I understand that the local SENO is due to carry out a review of the current SNA allocation in the school referred to in the correspondence on foot of an appeal from the school.</P>

	<P>Section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998 requires the Board of Management to publish the policy of the school concerning the admission to and participation in the school.</P>
        <P>In summary, Section 15, subsection (2) of the Education Act states that:</P>
<P LI="1">&ldquo;A board shall . . . publish, in such a manner as the board with the agreement of the patron considers appropriate, the policy of the school concerning admission to and participation in the school, including the policy of the school relating to the expulsion and suspension of students and admission to and participation by students with disabilities or who have other special educational needs . . . and ensure . . . that . . . the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents&rsquo; choice are respected . . .&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 (as amended by Section 50 of the Equality Act, 2004).</P>

	<P Just="Left">As the Deputy is aware a specific function of the National Council Special Education, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is to identify appropriate educational placements for all children with special educational needs. The SENO is a focal point of contact for parents and the school and is available to parents to provide support and advice. My officials have been in contact with the NCSE and I can confirm that the pupil in question is on a waiting list for the special school referred to by the Deputy.  I wish to advise the Deputy that the matter of the enrolment of a pupil in a school including a special school is a matter for the Board of Management of the school and my Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment by schools. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil.</P>

	<P>This government is determined to do all that is possible to ensure that every child gets all the opportunities and support they need to enable them to achieve their potential and participate fully in education. Through increased investment and improved services we are determined to optimise access, participation and educational outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups. The programme for government is committed to providing these educational supports to the most vulnerable sections of our society.</P>
        <P>In addition to the programme for government, the partnership agreement &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; includes provision for an additional 100 posts in total for the NEWB and the National Educational Psychological Service by 2009. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that under the Ist Phase of the agreement, an additional 15 staff were allocated to the NEWB during 2007. I have been informed by the Board that the recruitment process is ongoing and will be finalised shortly. This allocation brings the current authorised staffing of the Board to 109 posts of which 90 are working directly in the service delivery area. The staffing complement is comprised of 19 HQ and support staff, 5 Regional Managers, 13 Senior EWO&rsquo;s and 72 EWO&rsquo;s. The financial allocation to the Board in 2008 is &euro;10.119million.</P>
        <P>With regard to the recruitment of psychologists for the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), as the deputy will be aware all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</P>
        <P>I can inform the Deputy that the number of NEPS psychologists increased from 128 to a current level of 139 during 2007. As I have previously announced, my Department is committed to increasing psychological service staffing further, so that by 2009 there will be 200 NEPS psychologists in the service. In this regard, and following a national recruitment process put in place in late 2007 by the Public Appointments Service, interviews are currently being held to form regional panels from which appointments will be made as soon as possible, leading during 2008 to an expansion in NEPS psychologist numbers to 169.</P>
        <P>The recruitment of extra staff to both services will continue to strengthen local delivery and contribute to improving the coverage in respect of services provided by both NEPS and the NEWB. The ongoing allocation of posts will continue to be evaluated in light of operational experience and identified need.</P>
        <P>It must also be remembered that these services are just two aspects of the comprehensive framework that this Government has put in place to support schools, families and young people themselves. In this regard, extra supports targeted at young people in disadvantaged areas include both educational initiatives such as intensive literacy programmes and the provision of breakfast and homework clubs. In fact, in addition to the NEWB, there are currently in excess <Col N="296"/>of 620 staff within the education sector in education disadvantage programmes of which over 130 are additional posts allocated under DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion which provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP). The School Completion Programme (SCP) is a preventative measure designed to combat issues of poor attendance and early school leaving. The Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL) works to involve parents in their children&rsquo;s education which is a crucial component in convincing young people of the value of education. School attendance is a central objective of School Completion Programme with targeted interventions for children at risk of early school leaving through a variety of extra supports aimed at encouraging them to stay in school. The supports cover both educational and non-educational interventions and are provided during and outside of school time. Work is ongoing to develop appropriate protocols for all agencies and services to work together in collaboration and to ensure that optimum use is made of the resources deployed.</P>

        <Quest> when she will implement the Educate for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 as promised in the programme for Government; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will know, the legislature, in passing the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, 2004, recognised that implementation would require a considerable change agenda, to develop and support inclusive schools to deliver on the provisions of the Act. For this reason, the EPSEN Act, 2004 specifically refers to a five year implementation period. The National Council for Special Education was required, by the Act, to make a report on the implementation of the Act and I accept the core thrust of the principles and recommendations set out by the Council in its Implementation Report.  I am anxious to implement the Act in full in the quickest time possible. However, following consideration of the issues raised in the Council&rsquo;s implementation plan, and the consultations to date with the Education Partners, I consider that the five year timeframe acknowledged in the legislation is the appropriate period in which to implement the provisions of the Act.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of sections of the Act have been commenced, principally those establishing the National Council for Special Education and those promoting an inclusive approach to the education of children with special needs.  Specifically, the following sections have been commenced: 1, 2, 14(1)(a), 14(1)(c), 14(2) to 14(4), 19 to 37, 40 to 53.</P>
        <P>The remaining sections have not yet been commenced. As the EPSEN Act does not provide for phased commencement by age cohort the education sector must be in a position to provide the required services to all children before the relevant provisions are commenced. My Department&rsquo;s priority, therefore, has been to put in place the resources required for children with special educational needs, and to ensure that the necessary supports are in place to facilitate the commencement of the remaining sections of the Act. It must also be acknowledged that, during this necessary period of preparation and planning for the roll-out of the EPSEN Act, my Department continues to expand capacity and services for students with special educational needs. I am committed to continue this expansion of services to ensure that schools have the necessary capacity to support students with special educational needs.  It is envisaged that proposals for the implementation of the Act will be completed shortly by a working group in my Department with a view to the full implementation of the Act by 2010.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 540, 548 and 561 together.</P><Col N="298"/>
        <P>Our schools already promote, support and encourage healthy eating and physical exercise in a range of ways.</P>
        <P>Physical education is part of the curriculum at primary and at post-primary level and plays a key role not just in giving students an opportunity to exercise during the school day but also in encouraging a positive attitude towards physical activity which students will hopefully carry with them into adult life.</P>
        <P>With regard to educating students about making good food choices, a curriculum in Social, Personal, and Health Education (SPHE) is mandatory for all primary students and its implementation is also being assisted by a full-time support service. Health and well-being along with food and nutrition are two areas dealt with under the &ldquo;taking care of my body&rdquo; unit of that curriculum. The objective is that by fifth and sixth class, pupils should be enabled to realise that they, as individuals, have some responsibility for adopting a healthy balanced diet and for taking regular and appropriate exercise.</P>
        <P>All second level schools have been required to provide SPHE as part of the junior cycle curriculum since September 2003. The aims of this programme include preparing students for responsible decision-making and promoting their physical, mental and emotional health and well-being.</P>
        <P>Quite apart from curricular provision, schools can implement measures to encourage physical activity during school breaks and schools already play a major role in promoting the involvement of students in sporting activities in the wider community. Sports organisations such as the Gaelic Athletic Association, Basketball Ireland, the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) provide extensive opportunities for schools to participate in sport.</P>
        <P>Together, the above initiatives ensure that children not only get opportunities to exercise at school but also learn about balanced nutrition and making good food choices. I believe that schools are playing their part in terms of promoting a healthy diet and adequate physical exercise for children. However, it is important to remember that children spend just 20% of their waking hours at school so schools can only do so much with regard to promoting exercise and healthy eating and the main role must rest with parents.</P>
        <P>The provision and sale of certain foods in schools, is primarily a matter for the Board of Management of individual schools who may devise policies around the types of food that are available on the school premises and such policies should be driven by the needs and the welfare of the students. I know that many schools have developed healthy eating policies in co-operation with their parents&rsquo; associations, and I would encourage others to do so.</P>

	<P>In accordance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work, Act 1989, it is the responsibility of school management authorities to have a safety statement in place in their schools. Schools are obliged to identify possible hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and to put appropriate safeguards in place.</P>
        <P>It is open to school management authorities to have the type of survey referred to carried out and the Department would not necessarily be aware of this.  Results are issued to the management authorities of schools in the first instance.</P>
        <P>Having said that, the Department is keenly aware of the need to provide a permanent building for the school in question.  In this regard, agreement has been reached to provide permanent accommodation for the school on a V.E.C. owned site. The site was recently master planned <Col N="299"/>to ascertain if it would be feasible to facilitate both this school and two other all-Irish schools on the site.</P>
        <P>With the completion of the masterplan, progress on the project can now be considered in the context of the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.</P>

        <Quest> if she will specifically state if the scheme for the compulsory purchase of reckonable service which is currently being offered to institutes of technology, vocational educational colleges, local authority and semi-State organisations is based on the current income of the employee or on the salaries that were paid to such employees some years ago for the period that they are now purchasing the pension; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that an employee who started in an IT establishment in 1995 as temporary whole time and was subsequently made permanent in 1997 is now asked to buy back pension rights for the years 1995 to 1997 based on a current salary and not the salary that the employee was in receipt of from 1995 to 1997; her views on whether the system is fair; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the relevant pension schemes for VEC and Institutes of Technology officers, a person on appointment to a permanent post is required to purchase previous temporary whole-time and part-time service where this was not pensionable. In the case of an officer who becomes liable on permanent appointment to Class A rate PRSI, the cost of purchasing such prior service is determined on the officer&rsquo;s rate of pay applicable to the permanent post at the time the payment is made.</P>
        <P>In the past, where a delay occurred on the part of the employer in notifying the officer of the contributions payable, through no fault of the officer, the cost could have increased.  It has recently been agreed, following the outcome of a determination by the Pensions Ombudsman within the general area covered by the Local Government Superannuation Scheme, to amend the charging mechanism for prior service in the case of officers appointed to permanent pensionable positions who are liable to pay class A PRSI.  In such cases the cost of purchasing prior service, where purchase is compulsory, will be determined on the person&rsquo;s current pay applicable not later than 3 months from the date of appointment to the permanent post.</P>
        <P>While payment  of main scheme contributions is compulsory on appointment to a permanent pensionable post, a number of options for the payment of  the contribution to the Spouses and Children&rsquo;s Scheme exists. Where a person opts to pay the Spouses&rsquo; and Children&rsquo;s contribution immediately on appointment to a permanent post, then these contributions fall to be determined in the same manner as contributions under the main scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department is preparing a circular for issue to VECs and Institutes of Technology advising them of the revised position and this will be issued later this year.</P>
        <P>I should point out that this compulsory feature is confined to a very specific period. More recently introduced improvements in superannuation terms means that compulsory purchase will no longer arise in the case of newly appointed permanent personnel as temporary and part-time service in approved posts is now considered pensionable on an ongoing basis.</P>

	<P>Physical Education is one of the seven curriculum areas within the revised Primary School Curriculum (1999). A minimum of one hour of physical education per week is recommended for all primary school pupils.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools, all second-level schools should provide Physical Education as part of the curriculum. The programme that each school plans and delivers should be based on my Department&rsquo;s approved syllabuses and the teaching hours should be registered in the school timetable. The syllabuses have been developed on the basis of a time allocation of two hours per week.</P>
        <P>In addition to this, schools have a long and proud tradition of promoting the involvement of students in sporting activities in the wider community. Sports organisations such as the Gaelic Athletic Association, Basketball Ireland, the Football Association of Ireland, the Irish Sports Council and the Local Sports Partnerships  provide extensive opportunities for schools to participate in sport.</P>
        <P>The achievement of a minimum of 30 minutes dedicated physical activity every day in all educational settings, excluding PE time, is unrealistic at both primary and post-primary levels in the context of a number of factors:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the length of the school day and the challenge to cover all the subjects in the curriculum adequately.  Any changes to the length of the school day would require negotiation with the teachers&rsquo; unions allied with the commitment of significant additional resources</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the necessity to use games/sports facilities to provide for all pupils in each school.  There are limitations to the numbers that can use some resources at any one time; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the fact that primary school pupils have just half an hour for lunch and need to spend at least half of that time eating a proper lunch.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">It is important to realise that children spend just 20% of their waking hours at school and so their level of physical activity during the rest of the week in just as important. Indeed, the &lsquo;State of the Nation&rsquo;s Children&rsquo; report published by the Minister for Children recently, found that children in Ireland are doing well on physical activity, ranking second across the 32 WHO countries in being physically active for at least 4 hours per week.</P>

        <P>The most extensive in-service provision in relation to PE has been happening in Ireland in recent years in the context of implementation of revised curricula in PE at primary and junior <Col N="302"/>cycle level. The curriculum support services at primary and post primary level provide professional development for teachers as well as school based support.  School-based support is a very rich form of support and allows the teacher explore the possibilities and limitations of the environment in which they teach. Through modelling of lessons and professional dialogue, the quality of teaching is enhanced and teachers are further enabled to develop their teaching skills.</P>
        <P>The Irish Primary PE Association and the PE Association of Ireland (Subject Associations) have been active in organising conferences where teachers can avail of an opportunity to witness the latest thinking in physical education. My Department continues to provide funding for workshops and courses on PE related topics run in conjunction with the Education Centre network across the country.  The Primary School Sports Initiative (PSSI) launched a CD of lesson plans for primary teachers in Spring 2006 and these have been distributed to all schools in the country. The lessons correspond with the content objectives of the Primary School PE Curriculum.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above, my Department has invested heavily in resources for schools through the inclusion of PE facilities as part of major capital projects, through an unprecedented level of capital spending, and through grants at primary and post primary level in 2006 and 2007 to provide for upgrading and replacement of PE equipment.</P>

	<P>My Department is committed to the provision, maintenance and modernisation of physical education and physical activity facilities in our schools for our children and young people.</P>
        <P>The Physical Education curricula at both primary and second level have been developed on the understanding that facilities available to schools vary.  Consequently, they offer a level of flexibility that allows each individual school to design a programme that can be delivered using the resources and supports available to it.  Many primary schools have a general purpose room and practically all schools have outdoor play areas which are used for teaching different aspects of the PE programme.  A similar situation with sports halls and outdoor facilities applies at second level. In addition, many schools use adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.  Where schools decide to provide pupils with swimming classes in school time, they are expected to fund them from resources already available to them.</P>
        <P>The extent and quality of local sports facilities has been improved dramatically in recent years, with more than &euro;450 million invested by the Government since 1998 in over 5,000 projects through the Sports Capital Programme.  At the same time, PE, general purpose and outdoor play facilities have been provided for schools all over the country through the School Building Programme.  Over &euro;2.6 billion has been provided for school building infrastructure between 2000 and 2006 and a further &euro;4.5 billion is to be invested under the new National Development Plan 2007-2013.</P>
        <P>New curricula for PE in primary schools and at Junior Cert level have also been put in place.  Primary schools received &euro;2000 each in PE equipment grants last year, at a total cost of &euro;6.5 million. A similar grant of &euro;4,000 per pupil, at an overall cost of around &euro;3 million, issued to post-primary schools earlier this year. In addition, since 2000 my Department has provided in excess of &euro;5.5m in grant-aid to primary schools to facilitate the provision of coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or to purchase resource materials associated with the provision of physical education. Such materials and equipment would normally have a useful life of several years.</P><Col N="303"/>
        <P>So, through an increased focus on exercise in school and in the community, the Government is working to encourage more children and young people to get active.</P>
        <P>Indeed, the &lsquo;State of the Nation&rsquo;s Children&rsquo; report published by the Minister for Children, found that children in Ireland are doing well on physical activity, ranking second across the 32 WHO countries in being physically active for at least 4 hours per week.</P>

	<P>My Department is currently funding initiatives at both Primary and Post Primary levels to train teachers to support healthy eating and active living.</P>
        <P>Currently at primary level, there is an Assistant National Co-ordinator working with the Primary Curriculum Support Service (PCSP) who has responsibility for leading a team of 17 Physical Education/Social Personal and Health Education Cuiditheoir who are involved in supporting teachers in schools in the promotion of physical activity and healthy lifestyles. This Co-ordinator also takes responsibility for co-ordinating the Active Schools Awards, another Department of Education and Science initiative which aims to raise the profile of PE and co-curricular physical activity in the context of the Primary PE curriculum and to promote lifelong involvement in sport and physical activity.</P>
        <P>At post primary level the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a part of the post-primary curriculum which aims to support the personal development, health and well-being of young people and helps them create and maintain supportive relationships.  Section 9 (d) of the 1998 Education Act places an obligation on schools to promote the social and personal development of students and to provide health education for them.  SPHE has been a requirement on the Junior Cycle Curriculum since September 2003, with Circular M11/03 requiring all post-primary schools to timetable SPHE at Junior Cycle.</P>
        <P>The implementation of the SPHE curriculum by schools is a very important strand of Government policy in addressing a range of social and health issues covered by a wide range of policies/strategies.</P>
        <P>The broader remit of SPHE includes its potential role in health promotion, in whole school policy, in cross-curricular linkages, and its relationship with the Health Promoting School process.</P>

	<P>Our schools promote, support and encourage healthy eating and physical exercise in a range of ways.</P>
        <P>All second level schools have been required to provide Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) as part of the junior cycle curriculum since September 2003. This course builds on SPHE in the Primary School Curriculum.</P><Col N="304"/>
        <?oasys _fp><?oasys _cl14- ?><P>SPHE, when considered both at primary level and in the junior cycle, provides all students with opportunities to develop skills and competences to enable them to engage in responsible decision-making and to promote their physical, mental and emotional health and well-being. Nutrition and physical activity are specifically addressed in the SPHE module on &lsquo;Physical Health&rsquo;.</P>
        <P>Physical education is also part of the curriculum and plays a key role not just in giving students an opportunity to exercise during the school day but also in encouraging a positive attitude towards physical activity which students will hopefully carry with them into adult life.</P>
        <P>Quite apart from curricular provision, schools can implement measures to encourage physical activity during school breaks and schools already play a major role in promoting the involvement of students in sporting activities in the wider community. Sports organisations such as the Gaelic Athletic Association, Basketball Ireland, the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) provide extensive opportunities for schools to participate in sport.</P>
        <P>Together, the above initiatives ensure that students not only get opportunities to exercise at school but also learn about balanced nutrition and making good food choices. I believe that schools are playing their part in terms of promoting a healthy diet and adequate physical exercise for students.</P>

	<P>The subjects Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) and Physical Education (PE), cover, among elements of the syllabus, the areas of healthy eating, healthy lifestyle, physical health, body care, exercise, relaxation and diet. They are evaluated in schools by the inspectorate, using indicators specific to primary and to second-level schools as appropriate.</P>
        <P>In the development of Whole School Evaluation over the past five years, the inspectorate has sought to ensure that its inspection processes support the full implementation of Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) at both primary and second-level.</P>
        <P>Thematic evaluations in schools examine, in a focused way, particular aspects or organisational issues in schools. A number of thematic evaluations of Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) were conducted in primary schools in the last year. Reports on some of these evaluations are already on my Department&rsquo;s website, and others will follow shortly. These inspections included evaluation of the schools&rsquo; work in promoting healthy eating, exercise, and healthy lifestyle. SPHE has been routinely included as an important element of Whole School Evaluation as well as in thematic evaluations in schools. Inspectors evaluate the course and also the environment of the school and the school&rsquo;s policies on promoting healthy eating and a healthy lifestyle.</P>
        <P>In spring 2007, I requested the Inspectorate to develop and conduct subject inspections of SPHE in second-level schools also. These subject inspections commenced in the past year and are continuing. Reports of these inspections will also be on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>Within these evaluations, inspectors focus, as part of the inspection, on &lsquo;Physical Health&rsquo;.  This forms a specific module in SPHE in second-level schools. Inspectors use specific indicators to evaluate healthy eating and healthy living in primary schools. In second-level schools, whole-school support for students is evaluated which includes students&rsquo; health and well-being. The Physical Health module referred to includes topics such as body care, healthy eating, exercise, relaxation and diet.</P>
        <P>The inspectors of Physical Education (PE) also stress these areas in their inspections in schools, as they form an important part of the PE syllabus. These inspections comprise both subject inspections of PE and also PE evaluation within Whole School Evaluation (WSE) in schools.</P>
        <P>My department has, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, prepared a publication promoting Healthy Eating Policy in second-level schools. This book complements the earlier publications on Food and Nutrition Guidelines for Pre-Schools, and Food and Nutrition Guidelines for Primary Schools, published by the Health Promotion Unit of the Department of Health and Children.</P>

        <P>The Senior Cycle will build on the knowledge gained from participation in the primary and junior cycle programmes.  In primary school, the SPHE unit &lsquo;Taking care of my body&rsquo; specifically addresses the need for regular exercise and activity as well as the whole area of nutrition and food and the need for a balanced diet. This unit is built upon from Infants classes onwards, so that by Fifth and Sixth classes, students have the skills to realise and accept responsibility for making wise food choices and adopting a healthy, balanced diet, and in that context, exploring and examining the food pyramid. These themes are continued in the SPHE programme which is mandatory at junior cycle.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Home School Community Liaison (HSCL) is a major mainstream preventative strategy under DEIS and the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion focuses directly on the salient adults in children&rsquo;s educational lives and seeking indirect benefits for the children themselves.</P>
        <P>450 local HSCL coordinators serve 651 schools (281 post primary and 370 primary) addressing the development of the parent-teacher relationship in collaboration with the local community in order to enhance the nurturing of the whole child &mdash; this implies noting personal and leisure needs, the curricular and learning needs of parents so as to promote their self-worth and self-confidence and secondly, addressing the development of staff and teacher attitudes and behaviour so that the school becomes a place where all young people can reach potential.</P>
        <P>HSCL initiatives are focused primarily on adults including parents, teachers and others whose roles or responsibilities impact upon or influence the lives of children. The initiatives are concerned with:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />promoting parents&rsquo; education, development, growth and involvement.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the participation of parents in their children&rsquo;s education including homework support.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />providing a parents&rsquo; room and child care facilities for parents who attend programmes in the school.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />developing principal and teacher attitudes towards partnership and a whole-school approach. Parents and teachers are encouraged to collaborate in sharing their complementary skills, experiences and knowledge.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Almost all HSCL activities, including courses and classes for parents, are organised as a direct result of a needs identification process conducted by the local HSCL coordinators. Examples of HSCL activities for parents, organised by coordinators, can be categorised on four broad levels as follows:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Leisure time activities, which are a non-threatening starting point for marginalised parents.</P><Col N="307"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Curricular activities, which enable parents to come closer to their children&rsquo;s learning.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Personal development courses including parenting, leadership skills development, and involvement in formal learning take place.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Parents support and become a resource to their own child/children, to coordinators and to teachers by organising activities.  These parents pass on their skills to children by acting as teacher aides in the classroom and as support persons in the community.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Developing life-skills which lead towards and promote healthy lifestyles involves working at many levels with schools, communities and families as well as with other agencies in an integrated way. Co-ordinators commonly work at school level through their involvement with SPHE teachers and through their engagement with the Stay Safe Programme. Coordinators also engage with Early Start teachers and childcare workers and all pre-schools.</P>
        <P>The promotion of positive healthy life-skills is a key objective in the context of home visitation as well as at the community level where the Local Committee (LC) of the HSCL Scheme arrange courses on school attendance issues, substance misuse, self-image courses, health and environmental issues, healthy eating and sports activities.</P>
        <P>The Scheme also works in close collaboration with the National College of Ireland in its national outreach of &lsquo;Parents in Education&rsquo; &mdash; including parenting programmes and The Early Learning Initiative. Further collaboration with agencies such as the Drugs Task Force, Public Health Nurse, Sporting Agencies and clubs is also an essential feature of the scheme.</P>

	<P>Under Section 27 of the Education Act 1998, the boards of management of post primary schools are encouraged to facilitate and promote the establishment of student councils.  In 2002, my Department  issued guidelines on the establishment and operation of student councils, &lsquo;Student Councils: A Voice for Students&rsquo;. An Assistant National Co-ordinator with responsibility for Student Councils has been appointed to the Citizenship Education Support Team of the Second Level Support Service to design and deliver a programme of professional development to support teachers and schools involved in establishing and developing student councils.</P>
        <P>In November 2005, a curriculum development project on the setting up and development of student councils, entitled Giving Young People a Voice, through the Civic, Social and Political Education (CSPE) curriculum was established.  This was a partnership project between the Office for the Minister for Children and the City of Dublin VEC Curriculum Development Unit.  The Project has  assisted and supported schools, teachers and students in the establishment of Student Councils in schools through the development and piloting of a teaching and learning resource for the CSPE curriculum.  It is important that schools engage with the issues which student councils themselves highlight as matters of concern.</P>
        <P>A curriculum in SPHE is a mandatory part of all programmes for primary students, and its implementation is also being assisted by a full-time support service. The programme begins in the infant classes and specifically addresses the need for regular exercise, and examines food and nutrition issues and the need for a balanced diet. The objective is that by fifth and sixth <Col N="308"/>class, students are equipped to take responsibility for making wise food choices and adopting a healthy balanced diet, and in that context, exploring and examining the food pyramid.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 560 and 564 together.</P>
        <P>Within a broad health promotional framework, higher education institutions develop policies to create and maintain an environment which is conducive to the health and well-being of students and staff.  Guidelines in this regard have been published by the Higher Education Authority.  All Higher Education Institutions have or are developing policies on Alcohol in line with the Framework launched by the Minister for Health and Children in October 2001.</P>
        <P>All of the Institutes of Technology provide medical staff on campus (nurses and doctors) who frequently hold events promoting healthy lifestyles and make literature available to all students on exercise, diet, alcohol, safe sex etc. Institutes also provide financial and other support to clubs and societies and encourage all students to take part in exercise and sports. Institutes have policies on the use and abuse of alcohol &mdash; particularly in relation to events organised by the Students&rsquo; Union.</P>
        <P>In the University sector a number of College Health Services have part-time Health promotion officers who run Health promotion weeks and develop educational material, both paper and online, focusing on Mental health, Sexual health, Nutrition, Exercise and on issues re Alcohol and Drugs and run workshops. A typical Health promotion week would involve Sport, Peer Supporters, catering etc. The health promotion officer at TCD runs a smoking cessation programme.</P>
        <P>Many University counselling services also run workshops focused on mental health issues such as Stress management, resilience and coping skills. Some but not all counselling services have addiction counsellors.</P><Col N="309"/>
        <P>A National Food and Health Collaborative Research Programme has been funded under the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions. The collaborative programme is a formal joint venture between University College Dublin, University College Cork, the University of Limerick, Trinity College Dublin, University of Ulster, Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast and Teagasc.</P>
        <P>The objective of the programme is to establish a cohesive and integrated national framework for research and training in the area of food and health and associated agri-food related areas.</P>

	<P>Three official Circulars (i.e. Circulars 23/84, 7/87 and 38/91) have issued from my Department to school authorities concerning the promotion and marketing of commercial products through schools. The Circulars noted concern at the pressure on schools from time to time to become involved in the marketing and promotion of commercial products.</P>
        <P>Private companies are free to promote their business in accordance with accepted marketing practices. There are also accepted marketing standards, such as compliance with advertising regulations which guide, inform and control the relationship between the vendor and the potential customers. My Department recognises the sensitivities attached to the issue of promotion initiatives linking schools, pupils and parents to commercial activity. However, it would be inappropriate to prohibit marketing or sponsorship initiatives, provided that such schemes do not place undue pressure on parents in terms of additional expenditure, that children are protected from engagement in inappropriate promotional activity and that the schemes are linked to desirable projects serving national educational initiatives.</P>
        <P>School authorities are required to ensure, as is outlined in the circulars to which I have already referred, that pressure is not placed on parents to purchase or engage in activities in respect of particular commercial products.</P>
        <P>In this context, Circular 38/91 specifically requests school authorities, following consultation with staff, to formulate agreed school policies in relation to commercial promotions. Such policies can assist school authorities to act prudently in taking steps to ensure that certain commercial products are not promoted and marketed through their schools.</P>
        <P>In view of this, I am satisfied that due awareness and vigilance already exists in relation to this matter.</P>

	<P>The question of whether children walk to and from school is a matter for decision by their parents. However, it is clear that walking to school can make an important contribution to children&rsquo;s health and to developing their sense of road safety, as well as decreasing traffic congestion around school routes.</P>
        <P>Many local authorities have developed schemes to encourage walking to school, through initiatives such as the organisation of a &lsquo;walking bus&rsquo;, the provision of school traffic wardens, the organisation of Walk to School Weeks, and the development of &lsquo;park and stride&rsquo; initiatives. Local authorities are also involved in promoting car pooling initiatives.</P>
        <P>An Taisce&rsquo;s Green Schools Initiative includes measures such as the Safer Routes to School Project, which aims to increase the number of children who walk and cycle, increase the number of families who &lsquo;park and stride&rsquo; or &lsquo;car-pool&rsquo;, and reduce school-related congestion.</P>
        <P>The Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) Programme in all primary schools includes a specific &lsquo;safety and protection&rsquo; strand which is designed to develop in children an increasing sense of personal responsibility for their own safety and that of others. The learning objectives of this strand specifically include such provisions as safety strategies for crossing the road, using the bus or being a pedestrian, crossing the road with an adult, and being familiar with the rules for travelling in a car or bus, or on a bicycle.</P>
        <P>SPHE is also a mandatory junior cycle subject at second-level. The SPHE curriculum at both primary level and in the junior cycle at second-level stresses the importance of daily exercise and a healthy diet to maintaining health and well being. The &lsquo;personal safety&rsquo; strand of the junior cycle programme includes such issues as road safety and is supported by a range of curriculum materials. In addition, a road safety programme for use in Transition Year has been developed and is currently being piloted by the Road Safety Authority in collaboration with my Department, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the Second Level Support Service.</P>
        <P>In addition, school transport services operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf my Department provide a safe means of access to school for pupils who, because of where they live, might otherwise have difficulty in attending regularly. Some 135,000 children are carried annually under the scheme, of which approximately 8,500 are children with special needs. Transport is provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann and private contractors with a mix of large, medium and minibuses, as well as a number of car/taxis. One of the effects of provision on this scale is to lessen the amount of children being transported to school in cars.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to review the school transport system, including catchment areas, and my Department is currently progressing this matter.</P>
        <P>I should point out, also, that my colleague, the Minister for Transport, has begun the process of developing a Sustainable Travel and Transport Action Plan, which will provide the basis for public policy aimed at the achievement of a sustainable transport system by 2020. As part of the process, a Steering Group, on which my Department is represented, has been established to guide the delivery of an issues document for public consultation, leading to the preparation <Col N="311"/>of the Action Plan.  It is envisaged that the Plan will require a considerable shift to public transport and other sustainable forms of travel, including cycling and walking.</P>
        <P>Finally, in February of last year, the Road Safety Authority launched the RSA MACE &ldquo;Safe to School&rdquo; campaign at primary level, which is aimed at helping primary school children learn effective road safety lessons. The first part of this campaign was about walking to school safely and the current year&rsquo;s programme will cover cycling to school. As part of this initiative educational packs and DVDs have been distributed to all primary schools and Walking / Cycling to School Guides have been produced. A dedicated website, www.safetoschool.ie, has also been launched as part of the campaign.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> her views on increasing opportunity for physical activity in schools that are inclusive and appropriate to age, gender and ability, such as those that concentrate on increasing physical activity among teenage girls; if she will develop and implement such a policy; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>Physical education is a core part of the curriculum at primary level, and at post primary level all schools are required to offer physical education.  A revised Junior Cycle Physical Education syllabus was introduced in 2003,  and the Leaving Certificate syllabus in PE and the Health and Leisure module of the Leaving Certificate Applied programme are also available. In addition, Social Personal and Health Education which is mandatory at primary and junior cycle level stresses the importance of regular exercise, and the need for a balanced diet as essential to physical and mental well being.</P>
        <P>Schools also play a major role in nurturing and promoting the involvement of students in sporting activities in the wider community. Sports organisations such as the Gaelic Athletic Association, Basketball Ireland, the Football Association of Ireland provide extensive opportunities for schools to participate in sport. The Irish Sports Council, in co-operation with bodies such as the FAI and Local Sports Partnerships, has developed a national Bunt&uacute;s Primary Schools Initiative through which additional supports &mdash; training, resource cards and equipment &mdash; are provided to support teachers and others in introducing young people to sport, and to complement the Physical Education curriculum. The initiative aims to raise the profile of physical activity and sport, improve inservice training opportunities for teachers, assist governing bodies of sport to develop and deliver appropriate supports for teachers, and provide enjoyable and meaningful activity for children which supports the delivery of the curriculum.</P>
        <P>For practising teachers, curriculum support services at primary and second level provide training and school based support for teachers. School-based support is a very rich form of support and allows the teacher explore the possibilities and limitations of the environment in which they teach. Through modelling of lessons and professional dialogue, the quality of teaching is enhanced and teachers are further enabled to develop their teaching skills. Teachers must also aim to include all students in PE lessons &ndash; irrespective of gender, or physical and/or learning deficits. The Irish Primary PE Association and the PE Association of Ireland (Subject Associations) have been active in organising conferences where teachers can avail of an opportunity to witness the latest thinking in physical education, and my Department also funds programmes on PE through the network of education centres.</P>
        <P>The Primary Curriculum Support Programme (PCSP) and the School Development Planning Support (SDPS) have prepared planning templates (with prompts) for schools to assist them <Col N="312"/>in school planning for the implementation of the PE Curriculum and the wider aspects of physical activity and school sport. A key element of this approach is aimed at ensuring that gender and intercultural issues are addressed, and that PE is accessible to all, irrespective of gender or physical or learning abilities.</P>
        <P>This Government has worked hard to improve the opportunities for young people to get physical exercise both in school and in their local communities.  In a new school building or refurbishment/extension, PE facilities are included as part of the design.  Between 2000 and 2006 a total of 516 large-scale projects were delivered in primary and post-primary schools by the Department as part of a record overall investment of &euro;2.6 billion in modernising primary and post-primary school facilities throughout the country. Many more large-scale projects are under construction or due to go to construction in the near future. New PE equipment such as balancing benches and gym mats are funded as part of any major building programme. The Department also provided &euro;6.5m in 2006 and &euro;3m in 2007 for primary and post primary schools respectively, for replacement and updating of PE equipment.</P>
        <P>So, through an increased focus on exercise in school and in the community, we are working to encourage more children and young people to get active. Indeed, the &lsquo;State of the Nation&rsquo;s Children&rsquo; report published by the Minister for Children recently, found that children in Ireland are doing well on physical activity, ranking second across the 32 WHO countries in being physically active for at least 4 hours per week.</P>

	<P>In the Home Economics curriculum at post-primary level, the concepts of &lsquo;Balanced Eating&rsquo; and &lsquo;Healthy Exercise&rsquo; underlie the Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle syllabi. These are addressed in the core content areas of Food Studies and Social and Health Studies at Junior Cycle.</P>
        <P>At Senior Cycle, the issue of obesity is addressed within the areas of dietary and food requirements and the Irish diet.  The study of obesity includes identifying risk factors, considering what it is, the inter-relationship of dietary excesses and diet related problems, how to prevent obesity and the corrective measures required.  Menu planning and the food studies practical course work areas enable students to plan and prepare meals for the prevention and control of obesity.  Home Economics in the post-primary curriculum promotes the current dietary guidelines from the National Nutrition Survey.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with autism, receive an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings where children may have access to individualised education programmes, fully-qualified professional teachers who have received additional training in autism, special needs assistants, the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible and appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Furthermore, as each child with autism is unique, such children should have access to a range of different interventions including ABA to meet their individual needs.  My Department funds training for teachers in ABA through the Special Education Support Service and it provides funding for the ABA pilot programme which facilitates a number of stand-alone units providing ABA specific methodologies.  I am arranging for the figures on the amount of funding spent in relation to the pilot scheme to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>My Department does not retain information in relation to the percentage of the population below 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with autism.  However the Task Force on Autism (2001) considered that the national prevalence rate was 56 per 10,000 (20 per 10,000 for Autistic Disorder and 36 per 10,000 for Asperger&rsquo;s Syndrome).</P>
        <P>The international statistics requested are not readily available in my Department.</P>

	<P>The Back to Education Initiative commenced in October 2002 to provide for flexible part-time options across Further Education. Its priority is to those adults with less than upper second level education. The programme&rsquo;s aim is to give adults who wish to return to education an opportunity to combine their return to learning with family, work and other responsibilities. Programmes are offered on a part-time basis in the mornings, afternoons, evenings or at weekends.</P>
        <P>The Back to Education Initiative comprises two strands:</P>

	<P Just="Left">Under the prescribed terms and conditions of my Department&rsquo;s student maintenance grant schemes, grant assistance may not be awarded in respect of a repeat period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether or not funding was previously awarded. The deciding authority may waive this provision in exceptional circumstances such as certified serious illness. In such instances decisions are made on a case by case basis. It should be emphasised, that this discretion would only be exercised where a candidate is repeating a period of study on the same course.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The candidate referred to by the Deputy submitted an appeal to my Department, the decision of Waterford VEC the awarding body in this case was upheld as maintenance grants may not be paid in respect of a second period of attendance at the same level for a course approved for the purposes of the schemes, irrespective of whether or not a grant was paid previously.    Where funding for a repeat year of study is awarded in respect of a period of attendance at the same level on medical grounds, it would only be in relation to a repeat year on the same course.  As the candidate in question is pursuing a different course, the decision of the awarding body was upheld in accordance with the terms and conditions of the grant schemes.</P>
        <P>On 26th October 2007, a reply was issued to the candidate in question informing her of the outcome of her appeal.</P>
        <P>You will appreciate that the terms of my Department&rsquo;s Schemes of Student Support must be applied impartially and it is not possible to make exceptions in individual cases, regardless of the circumstances.</P>

	<P>The Athlone element of the decentralisation of my Department involves the relocation of approximately 90 posts to Athlone. Twelve of these posts have already relocated to Athlone and the balance will relocate as soon as the new building in Athlone is ready for occupation. I understand that the building could be fully ready for occupation within the next 2 to 3 months.  In addition to the relocating posts the new building will also accommodate in the region of 100 posts that are currently located in a temporary building on the campus in Athlone.</P>
        <P>The new building in Athlone is sited on the same campus as my Department&rsquo;s existing offices in Athlone on land that was already in State ownership. The OPW is charged with the responsibility for the property aspects of the programme of decentralisation &mdash; including the procurement of property for decentralising organisations and the disposal of property in Dublin that will become surplus &mdash; so the management of and reporting on this aspect of the programme is a matter for the OPW.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Higher Education Authority (HEA) is not one of the State agencies under the aegis of my Department that has been designated as an &ldquo;early mover&rdquo; by the Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG). The acquisition of property for the programme of decentralisation is a matter for the Office of Public Works (OPW). I am not aware that any property has been acquired in connection with the decentralisation of the HEA. The timeline to the availability of accommodation in Athlone for the HEA will be a significant element in determining the timescale to its decentralisation. At present it is not possible to predict a timetable for the decentralisation of the HEA.</P><Col N="320"/>
        <P>The decentralisation of the HEA will involve the relocation of approximately 64 posts to Athlone.</P>

	<P>My Department funds three maintenance grant schemes for third level students which are administered by the Local Authorities and the Vocational Education Committees.  These are the Higher Education Grants Scheme, the Vocational Education Committees&rsquo; Scholarship Scheme, the Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees and the Maintenance Grants Scheme for Students attending Post Leaving Certificate Courses.</P>
        <P>The Higher Education Grants Scheme is administered by the Local Authorities.  The other three schemes are administered by the Vocational Education Committees.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the maintenance grants schemes, grant assistance is awarded to students who meet prescribed conditions of funding including those which relate to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.</P>
        <P>The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant assessing authority &mdash; i.e. the local authority or VEC.  These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is required.</P>
        <P>If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of maintenance grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
        <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the level of resources being made available by my Department to support students with special educational needs (SEN) in mainstream education nationally, including those in Co Meath, has grown significantly in recent years. In relation to supporting pupils with dyslexia, my Department implemented a new scheme for allocating learning support / resource teachers to schools to cater for the needs of children with high-incidence special educational needs including dyslexia in all primary schools in September 2005. The general allocation model was designed to ensure that each school has learning support/resource teaching support available to meet the needs of children with high incidence special needs.</P>
        <P>There are now over 8,800 teachers at primary and post-primary schools working directly with children with SEN, including those requiring learning support, compared with fewer than 1,700 <Col N="321"/>in 1998. In addition, significant progress has been made in relation to increasing the number of special needs assistants (SNAs) in our schools who specifically cater for children with care needs. There are currently in excess of 9,800 SNAs in primary, post-primary and special schools supporting pupils with special care needs compared with approximately 300 in 1998.</P>
        <P>At primary level, where a pupil&rsquo;s condition is of a more serious nature, provision can be made in one of the 4 special schools, or 23 special classes attached to ordinary mainstream schools, dedicated to the needs of children with dyslexia. All special schools and special classes for such children operate at a reduced pupil teacher ratio of 9:1 and pupils attending such facilities attract a special increased rate of capitation grant.</P>
        <P>At post-primary level, pupils with dyslexia are normally integrated into ordinary classes with appropriate intervention to meet their needs delivered in the class setting. In such situations they may receive additional support from the remedial/learning support teacher, guidance counsellor and individual subject teachers. All second level schools in the free education/block grant schemes have an entitlement to an ex-quota teacher allocation in respect of remedial/learning support teaching and guidance provision.</P>
        <P>My Department also allocates additional teacher support and SNA support to post-primary schools to cater for the assessed needs of pupils with SEN, including, where appropriate, pupils with dyslexia. Where a pupil with SEN is enrolled in a post primary school, it is open to the school to apply to the local SENO for additional teaching support and/or SNA support. All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the terms of circular letter M10/94, pupils with dyslexia may also meet, depending on an educational assessment, the criteria for exemption from the learning of the Irish Language on the grounds of having a learning disability. Depending on the degree of the condition, they may also be eligible for special arrangements in the Certificate Examinations.</P>
        <P>My Department provides funding to the Dyslexia Association to facilitate the operation of dyslexia workshops. This funding helps the organisation operate an information service for members and the public. In addition, part of the funding assists in meeting the costs associated with the attendance of some children from disadvantaged backgrounds at workshops and programmes organised by the association. Part of the funding also goes towards the cost of the adult education activities such as literacy training, pre-course assessment, teaching materials and educational and administration support.</P>
        <P>My Department also provides funding to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers to assist pupils with SEN, including children with dyslexia, with their education once relevant professionals recommend the equipment.</P>
        <P>In September 2003, my Department established the Special Education Support Service (SESS) to manage, coordinate and develop a range of supports in response to identified training needs. As part of its response to the growing demand from teachers for support and training, the SESS is currently developing teams of trainers to deliver training in four specific areas: Autism, Challenging Behaviour, Dyslexia, and Inclusion. This training will be delivered locally through the Education Centre network and/or through whole-staff in-school support. The SESS provides fees subsidies for the online training course, &ldquo;Dyslexia: Identification and Early Interventions&rdquo;. Fees subsidies are also provided for teachers to enable them to avail of the Dyslexia Association of Ireland courses.</P>
        <P>Training is available through the 21 Teacher Education Centres nationally for teachers using ICT and assistive technologies to support pupils with SEN, including those with dyslexia.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be aware that my Department has developed an information resource pack on dyslexia in CD-Rom, DVD and video format, in association with the Department of Edu<Col N="322"/>cation in Northern Ireland. This product has been made available to all primary and post-primary schools. The DVD and video provides support for parents of pupils with dyslexia while the CD-Rom assists teachers who are teaching children with dyslexia in the mainstream classroom.</P>

	<P>Written and oral Parliamentary Questions (PQs) are dealt with by staff in the line section responsible for the particular issue raised in the question. The number and level of staff involved in preparing a particular answer varies depending on a number of factors including the complexity of the issues raised in the question and the volume and accessibility of information required for the response. It is not possible to isolate the administrative cost of processing PQs from the overall administrative costs of the Department as processing of PQs is carried out as part of the normal day-to-day work of sections.</P>

	<P>The Lyons Estate is in the ownership of University College Dublin.

In this regard, the University is exploring all options open to it, including an examination of the suitability and use of the Lyons Estate. </P>

Staff will not transfer to Newbridge until the construction of the Department&rsquo;s new headquarters is completed in 2009.  In addition to the civil servants, 43 military personnel will be located in Newbridge.

	<P>The Office of the Minister for Integration is responsible for the promotion and coordination of measures to assist in the integration of legally resident immigrants.  For obvious and practical reasons it is the primary responsibility of Departments and public authorities &mdash; The Health Service executive, local authorities, etc. to take account of the needs of this group of residents in planning and delivering services and making financial provision as required.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Integration is glad of this opportunity to place on record his appreciation of the work being done by these bodies, as well as groups in the non Governmental and voluntary sectors. Since his appointment as Minister with responsibility for integration matters he has visited many projects throughout the country and is impressed at the commitment of the various groups and bodies in responding and adapting to the challenges we face in the matter of integration.</P>
        <P>In addition to the funding provided by the various bodies 1.2 million euro is available from the European Refugee Fund for the provision of services to asylum seekers and refugees and 1.6 million euro is available from the European Fund for the Integration of Third Country Nationals to promote integration at a local level.   Applications for funding  were recently sought for the above funds through Pobal.   Pobal are currently engaged in evaluating the applications made. Further calls for proposals will be advertised under these initiatives later this year or in early 2009.  Applications will be sought in the coming months for funding from the European Social Fund to promote employment related initiatives for vulnerable immigrants.</P>
        <P>A sum of three million euro has been provided in the Estimates for 2008 to provide funding for integration initiatives. This funding will have a particular emphasis on membership organisations, faith based groups and building local structures.  The Office of the Minister for Integration also manages a small grants scheme with funding of 400,000 euro for 2008 that provides grants of up to 15,000 euro to community and voluntary organisations to promote the participation and integration of legally resident immigrants at a local level.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Office of the Minister for Integration is not aware of any particular demand from migrant groups for the holding of an event such as that suggested by the Deputy. A number of events, stressing the cultural heritage of various migrants groups are held, both at a national and local level. The holding of such events enables each community to learn more about the culture and history of each others communities and also is important for the sponsoring community to provide information on its history.  In the absence of a demand from communities themselves, it is doubtful that one national day would be accepted, given the particular attachments so many communities have to particular dates or festivals.</P>

        <P FLI="0">In order to meet the increased demand arising from recent, major expansion in the provision of its vetting service, the GCVU has been in receipt of very significant additional resources.  In particular, the human resource allocation to the Unit has increased from 13 originally to its <Col N="329"/>current level of 63, comprising 5 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at Inspector and Sergeant rank and 58 civil servants.  Eleven of these personnel were made available as recently as last month,  and when they have completed their induction and training it is anticipated that processing times will be reduced accordingly.  In this regard, the current average processing time for valid vetting applications is approximately 7 weeks, but it is anticipated that this time period will be reduced to the normal, prevailing processing time of approximately 4 weeks.</P>

	<P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to focus its enforcement activities on the main causes of deaths and serious injury on the roads &mdash; drunk driving, speeding and the non-wearing of safety belts.  The Garda Policing Plan for 2008 aims to increase detections for driving while intoxicated, speeding and road transport offences by 10% over the course of the year.  The continuing increase in the strength of the Garda Traffic Corps, which will reach its planned level of 1,200 by the end of this year, is enabling a continuing increase in enforcement activity to take place.  Along with the increase in its strength, a corresponding allocation of vehicles and other resources is being made to the Traffic Corps.  With regard to combating speeding, detailed analysis by the Garda of collision data is under way to identify locations and times where the greatest tendency for speed related collisions occur.  Speed enforcement will be prioritised on a risk assessment basis on such locations and at such times.  The public will continue to be made aware of roads which have been identified as having a propensity for speed related collisions, including through the Garda website.  The Garda is planning to replace its existing vehicle-based mobile speed detection systems this year.  It is developing proposals to introduce an automatic number plate recognition capability in a range of Garda vehicles, which will have a speed detection capability and assist in detecting suspect and untaxed vehicles.  With regard to outsourcing the provision and operation of safety cameras to a service provider, following the issue of a Request for Tender, tenders were received and evaluated.  Issues have arisen because the costs involved are substantially higher than those estimated for the Government previously.  I intend to bring proposals before my Cabinet colleagues shortly, taking into account issues of value for money and the commitment, as evidenced by the enhanced activity by the Garda I have outlined, to reduce speeding on our roads.</P>

	<P>Section 11 of the Immigration Act 2004 places a requirement on a foreign national to produce on demand, unless he or she can give a satisfactory explanation as to why he or she is prevented from doing so, a valid passport or equivalent document establishing his or her identity and, also, his or her registration certificate where he or she is required to register with the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  This requirement does not extend to foreign nationals under the age of 16 years.  Section 109 of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which was published on 29 January 2008, proposes to continue this requirement with the substitution of a reference to a permit for the current reference to a registration certificate.  Also, the provision applies to all foreign nationals, including those under 16 years of age.  Section 34 of the Bill sets out the information to be contained in a permit.  It includes a provision whereby information relating to the holder, including biometric information, may be contained in the permit where so prescribed.  With the introduction of the Automatic Fingerprint Identification System, I envisage the inclusion of fingerprints on permits in the near future.</P>

        <P>The current processing times for applications for certificates of naturalisation and long-term residency are 30 months and 18 months respectively.  The procedures involved in the naturalisation and long-term residency processes have been developed and refined over a number of years.  I am satisfied they are necessary to maintain the integrity of the processes.  Consequently, having regard to the resources available, which are kept under constant review, there is a limit to the reduction in the processing times that can be achieved.  However, I am aware that the <Col N="333"/>existing waiting times are excessive and accordingly, I have instructed my officials to undertake a review of the various processes so they may be streamlined further where possible.</P>

There are currently 15 staff assigned to the General Immigration Division of whom 14 work full-time.

It is not possible therefore to provide a breakdown of the staffing levels for each of the past five years.  Apart from long-term residency, the staff in the General Immigration Division also process a wide variety of applications from non-EEA nationals seeking to reside in the State on various grounds.  The Principal Officer is also charged with responsibilities other than for Citizenship Section and General Immigration Division.

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the Superintendent in Blanchardstown has operational responsibility for policing the Phoenix Park area, which is patrolled by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assigned to Cabra Garda Station.  The force liaises with the Phoenix Park rangers, who are employed by the Office of Public Works and are responsible for enforcing the by-laws enacted for the park.  A number of Garda initiatives are in place for the policing of the Phoenix Park.  Operation Staple is monitoring illegal sexual activity in the Phoenix Park area.  Operation Scholar is monitoring and tracking the movements of criminals in the area by increasing patrols in the park and setting up checkpoints.  This operation concentrates on the prevention and detection of crime in the park, in particular thefts from vehicles parked in the area.  Operation Encounter is an ongoing initiative targeting public disorder and other anti-social behaviour including the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor to people under the age of 18.  Operation Torque is targeting those suspected of criminal activity including robberies from the person and theft from MPVs.  These ongoing initiatives have proved valuable for gathering intelligence and disrupting local criminals and their criminal activities.  They have resulted in numerous detections and subsequent arrests.  Community Policing Units perform mountain bike patrols of the Phoenix Park, particularly during the summer months.  Crime prevention advice leaflets were distributed to the public in the park during 2007.  It is proposed to repeat this initiative during the summer of 2008.  The leaflets provide crime prevention and security advice on how to keep personal belongings safe.  The Garda Commissioner is responsible for allocating personnel throughout the force taking everything into account.  The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of the Phoenix Park will be fully considered by the Commissioner within the overall context of policing needs throughout the country.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Immigration Division of my Department that the people in question will need to travel to London to obtain Zimbabwean passports.  They have been granted permission to remain in the State under EU Treaty Rights until 2009 and 2010 respectively.  The people concerned may make an application to the Travel Documents Section of my Department to facilitate travel to London for this purpose.  Upon receipt of their new Zimbabwean passports, the persons concerned should present themselves to the Local Registration Office of The Garda National Immigration Bureau to have their new passports endorsed with the appropriate permission to remain in the State.  On the question of citizenship, it is open to the people concerned to apply for citizenship by making an application to the Citizenship Division of my Department.</P>
        <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation, as long as certain statutory conditions are fulfilled.  These conditions are that the applicant must be of full age, or by way of exception, be a minor born in the State; be of good character; have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years; intend in good faith to continue to reside in <Col N="335"/>the State after naturalisation; and have made, either before a Judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister, for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.  In the context of naturalisation, certain periods of residence in the State are excluded.  These include periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the State; periods granted for the purposes of study; and periods granted for the purposes of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act 1996.</P>

	<P>One of the strategic goals set out in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Corporate Strategy 2007-2009 is to significantly reduce the incidence of fatal and serious injuries and to improve road safety.  One of the actions identified in the Garda Policing Plan 2008 in support of this goal is targeted intelligence-led operations against offending young drivers.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that a number of initiatives to target the activities of young male drivers in the areas referred to have been established.  Specific areas identified as places where young drivers congregate are targeted.  As a result, uniform members of the Garda, supported by Divisional Traffic Corps personnel, establish checkpoints and enforce in a highly visible manner the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts.  The initiatives have resulted in detections being made for a wide range of road traffic offences, including offences relating to dangerous driving, careless driving, no silencer fitted, L plates not displayed, identification plates not conforming with legislation, road tax offences, insurance and driving licence offences, speeding offences, dangerously defective vehicles and modified vehicles.  Offences detected are dealt with by way of prosecution, fixed charge notice or, where appropriate, through the Juvenile Diversion Programme.  In 2006 and 2007, over 100 offenders were charged before the local district courts.  In addition to these intelligence-led operations, all uniform members of the Garda are tasked with enforcing the relevant legislative provisions.  Regular mobile patrols and roving checkpoints are established throughout the Galway Garda Division.  In addition, websites are monitored to establish where such anti-social activities are taking place with a view to providing an appropriate response.  Garda road safety awareness programmes are conducted in schools, third level colleges, factories, workplaces and other facilities, with the aim of educating road users of the obligations on all road users under the Road Traffic Acts and to promote road safety among the target group.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that there are 4,227 Gardai attached to the Divisions in the Dublin Metropolitan Region and of these, 398 (approx 9%) are Community Gardai. Of course, community policing involves more than a just single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  All Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues. I fully agree with the view of the Garda Inspectorate, expressed in its most recent report, that community policing is a fundamental policing philosophy and that it is based on strong foundations in Ireland.   </P>
        <P>Specifically in relation to the areas mentioned by the Deputy the following are the percentage of Community Gardai in each station:</P>

	<P>My Department is currently examining the High Court judgement in Dillon <i>v.</i> DPP with a view to bringing forward proposals to address the issues arising from the judgement.  I would point out that although the High Court found section 3 of the Vagrancy (Ireland) Act 1847 to be unconstitutional, other statutory provisions continue to apply. For example, individuals who engage in <Col N="338"/>begging in a public place in a manner likely to cause fear or annoyance or who obstruct the free passage of or harass any person or who fail to comply with the direction of a Garda are liable to prosecution under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 or the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 for obstruction, disorderly conduct, harassment etc. I would add that the High Court&rsquo;s judgement in Dillon does not affect the operation of section 247 of the Children Act 2001; that section relates to cases where children are procured for the purpose of or are allowed to engage in begging. </P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 1 May 2000 and claimed asylum on 25 July 2000.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and on appeal by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>The person concerned was informed by letter dated 30 March 2001 that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him and afforded him three options in accordance with Section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a Deportation Order or to submit, within 15 working days, written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e why he should not be deported.</P>
        <P>His case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to all representations submitted on his behalf for permission to remain in the State. On 18 June 2001 the then Minister refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation order in respect of him. Notice of this order dated 22 June 2001 was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to present himself at Portlaoise Garda Station on Friday 29 June 2001 in order to make travel arrangements for his removal from the State.  A further notice dated 26 October 2001 was served by registered post on the person concerned following the conclusion of Judicial Review proceedings which were struck out in the High Court on 24 October 2001. The person concerned was then required to present himself at Naas Garda Station on Friday 2 November 2001 in order to again make travel arrangements for his removal from the State. He failed to comply with his reporting requirements on both occasions and was classified as evading his deportation. The effect of the deportation order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter outside the State.</P><Col N="339"/>
        <P>The person concerned subsequently re-entered the State. He came to the attention of the Garda&iacute; on 21 March 2007 and was arrested on foot of his deportation order. He was subsequently released with the requirement to present himself to the GNIB on 26 April 2007 in order to make travel arrangements for his removal from the State. He presented as required and was given subsequent presentation dates which he complied with. He was finally removed from the State on 17 January 2008.</P>
        <P>By correspondence dated 15 January 2008, the legal representative of the person concerned made representations requesting a) the revocation of the deportation order and b) the exercise of my discretion under Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 requesting that the person concerned be afforded an opportunity to make an application for Subsidiary Protection. This correspondence is currently under consideration in my Department.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 637, 641 and 642 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies may be aware, since 2006, the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) has been engaged in a major expansion in the provision of its criminal history vetting service to all sectors and organisations involved in the recruitment of persons to work in a substantive, <Col N="341"/>unsupervised capacity with children and vulnerable adults.  At this stage, vetting has now been made available to a broad range of sectors, including health and social services; primary, secondary and tertiary education; pre-school and childcare; youth work; disability; care homes; and so on.</P>
        <P>In order to meet the dramatically increased demand arising from such expansion, the GCVU has been in receipt of very significant additional resources.  In particular, the human resource allocation to the Unit has increased from 13 originally to its current level of 63, comprising 5 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at Inspector and Sergeant rank and 58 civil servants.  Eleven of these personnel were made available as recently as last month, and when they have completed their induction and training it is anticipated that processing times will be reduced accordingly.  In this regard, the current average processing time for valid vetting applications is approximately 7 weeks, but it is anticipated that this time period will be reduced to the normal, prevailing processing time of approximately 4 weeks.</P>
        <P>Finally, it is envisaged that a further allocation of personnel will be made in the coming months.  In this respect, I am informed by the Garda authorities that Garda management are continually monitoring resource requirements within the GCVU so as to ensure a match between demand and supply in terms of the processing of vetting applications.</P>

	<P>The position in relation to granting long term residency is as follows: Persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.   </P>
        <P>The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.  Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.  While <Col N="343"/>applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.</P>
        <P>An application for long term residency from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in December 2006. I understand that applications received in July 2006 are currently being dealt with. As soon as a decision is made on the case, the person concerned will be notified.</P>

	<P>The detailed allocation of resources, including accommodation, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner to decide in accordance with his identified operational requirements.  There is a significant ongoing programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda stations and other Garda accommodation around the country, including in County Tipperary.  The Garda accommodation programme is based on agreed priorities established by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is brought forward <Col N="344"/>in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.</P>
        <P>Under the National Development Plan a total of &euro;260 million is assigned for Garda stations and other accommodation.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 650 and 651 together.</P>
        <P>The Prison Rules, 2007 reflect international best practice, the provisions of the European Prison Rules, and provide a modern regulatory framework for the administration of our prisons.  Section 59 (2) of the Prison Rules, 2007 allows for the discretionary granting of additional remission, up to one third as opposed to the standard rate of one quarter, where a prisoner has shown further good conduct through his engagement in authorised structured activity and where as a result, the prisoner is less likely to re-offend and will be better able to reintegrate into the community.</P>
        <P>I can at the outset advise the Deputy that this additional concession will only be awarded in exceptional cases and where I am satisfied beyond any doubt that the prisoner concerned has demonstrated that she/he meets the requirements as set out in the Prison Rules.  I can further advise that no category of offender is excluded from consideration for this concession and furthermore, that prisoners who request reasons as to why they do not qualify will be advised accordingly.  While there are a number of applications for extra remission under consideration at present, to date no prisoner has been granted this concession.</P>

        <P>The purpose of the European Refugee Fund is to support and encourage efforts made by Member States in receiving asylum seekers, integrating refugees and voluntary repatriation projects.

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not readily feasible to isolate the costs associated with the answering of parliamentary questions from the administrative costs of my Department generally.  Nevertheless, there is no doubt but that a substantial and growing cost is in fact associated with this exercise.  This is well-illustrated by the growth in the number of questions in recent years, with 1729 questions answered (excluding those withdrawn or disallowed) in the last four months of 2007 alone, representing an increase of 230% over the equivalent period in 2000.  Most Divisions within my Department must dedicate a proportion of their resources to this work and in some instances the drafting of responses represents a major drain on the resources of the Division in question.   While I consider responding to Parliamentary Questions an important element of my functions as a Minister, it is questionable whether the full extent of the resources deployed to this end truly represents the best use of the Department&rsquo;s resources, especially when one considers the many other less expensive means by which information may be obtained.</P>
        <P>Moreover, I should also add that in many instances preparation of a response requires operational agencies, notably An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service, to devote their own resources to the collection and collation of information for incorporation in the response.  The Deputy will appreciate that the deployment of such resources to this function may be at the expense of core law-enforcement and public safety activities.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 664 and 665 together.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of pressures for clusters of commercial and other development to occur adjacent to motorways, particularly in the vicinity of motorway interchanges. In the case of the M3 motorway, measures are in place to address these concerns.</P>
        <P>Within the development plan process, appropriate objectives to protect the archaeology and surrounding landscape in the vicinity of the Hill of Tara have been incorporated in the Meath County Development Plan 2007 to 2013, adopted in March 2007, a copy of which is available on the Council&rsquo;s website at <i>www.meath.ie</i>.  Chapter 8 of the Plan includes specific objectives and policies in this regard &mdash; relevant extracts are reproduced below:</P>
        <P LI="1">Section 8.3.2 Archaeological Heritage: Meath County Council are also committed to the conservation of the Tara Skyrne area, another of the prime archaeological resources in the county. This can be seen in its objective to designate this area as a Landscape Conservation Area in conjunction with the Heritage Council.</P>
        <P LI="1">HER POL 66: To employ the full extent of the statutory provisions of the Planning and Development Acts and Regulations and all other relevant legislation including the National Monuments Acts to ensure the sustained protection of landscapes of exceptional value and <Col N="350"/>sensitivity and in particular to protect the rural character, setting, amenity and archaeological heritage of Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne and the Hill of Tara, and of the surrounding areas including the area in the vicinity of the proposed M3 Motorway and its related Interchanges.</P>
        <P LI="1">Section 8.4.4  Heritage Landscapes: The Council will, over the life of the plan, move towards the preparation of a Local Area Plan in respect of areas surrounding and influencing (a) the World Heritage site of the Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne complex and will explore the designation of Landscape Conservation Area(s), pursuant to Section 204 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, in respect of their core areas for (a) the Tara and Skreen area(s) and (b) Loughcrew and Slieve na Callliagh Hills. The purpose of such plans and/or designations is to protect the rural character, setting, historic context and archaeological heritage of the landscape. In identifying and/or designating such areas, the Planning Authority will be required to ensure that the scope and extent of such designation is sufficient to conserve the specific areas requiring protection, i.e. may be wider than the immediate area of the Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne World Heritage Site, the Tara and Skreen area and/or Loughcrew/Slieve na Calliagh Hills. In the case of Tara-Skreen area, particular regard will be had to protecting the landscape from the perceived threat of possible secondary development on foot of the approved M3 Motorway and adjoining Interchange.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I support the objective of Meath County Council to designate the area in the vicinity of the Hill of Tara as a Landscape Conservation Area in accordance with the provisions of section 204 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  My Department has recently met with the local authority to consider how this can be progressed having regard to the Programme for Government commitment to introduce a national landscape strategy, work on which is being initiated by my Department.</P>
        <P>I am also a statutory consultee under the Planning Acts, under which individual planning applications with the potential to impact on the built or natural heritage must be referred by the planning authority to me as Minister. Any comments from my Department must be taken into account before a decision is made on a planning application, with my Department also having a right to appeal to an Bord Plean&aacute;la against an individual planning decision, where an adverse impact on the built or natural heritage so warrants. It is my intention to pursue a robust approach in relation any development proposals impinging on the archaeological heritage, the rural character of the area and the setting of the Hill of Tara.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department, together with the Department of Transport and the National Roads Authority, is currently developing statutory planning guidelines on planning policy and roads to ensure that roads planning, development planning and development management processes are appropriately aligned. When finalised, these guidelines will issue under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 666 and 667 together.</P><Col N="351"/>
        <P>As outlined in the reply to Question No. 1370 of 30 January 2008, the 20-year National Spatial Strategy (NSS) which was published in November 2002, aims to achieve a better balance of social, economic and physical development across Ireland, supported by more effective planning, and has designated nine gateways and nine hubs which have the capacity to grow sustainably and to act as drivers of growth for their hinterlands and wider regions.</P>
        <P>Among the principal objectives of the Strategy are to build up the strengths of all areas in order to achieve more balanced regional development through a better spread of economic activity, employment and population growth; to energise the potential of all urban and rural areas with the support of a stronger urban structure, including the gateways, hubs and other towns; and to set a national context for regional and local planning strategies.  The Department has taken due account of changing economic and demographic circumstances since the publication of the Strategy, through for example, revised regional population targets, on foot of the Census 2006 data analysis, which are being reflected in regional and local plans.</P>
        <P>Investment priorities identified under the National Development Plan 2007-2013 and Transport 21 are fully aligned with the NSS.  The 2004 Regional Planning Guidelines (RPGs), which are due to be reviewed by 2010, translate the NSS objectives into concrete actions at local level.   City and County Councils have regard to the NSS and regional priorities in their development plan and local area planning processes.    My Department has undertaken extensive research into the development issues and challenges of the nine Hub towns.  This work culminated in the publication in June 2007 of the report, NSS Hubs &ndash; Development Issues and Challenges, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website &ndash; <i>www.environ.ie</i> &mdash; and the dedicated NSS website &ndash; <i>www.irishspatialstrategy.ie</i>. Based on responses to a comprehensive questionnaire completed by each of the hub local authorities, the study provides a detailed description of the current status of the hubs, identifies the many development issues and challenges associated with the hubs and makes recommendations to support and advance future hub growth and development.  On foot of this study, my Department is considering how best to implement the recommendations at both central and local Government levels.</P>
        <P>Responsibility has been assigned to my colleague, Minister of State Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, to support work at central and local government levels to secure better co-ordination and timely delivery of key infrastructure and services in fast growing developing areas.  The initial focus is on strategic locations which are experiencing significant development pressures within the gateways and hubs.</P>

        <Quest> the number of defective or failed waste and water treatment systems brought to the attention of his Department in each county in the past five years; if he is satisfied that the regulations governing the construction, maintenance and monitoring of these systems are  adequate; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) produces regular reports on municipal waste water discharges, including treatment standards, and on the quality of drinking water supplies in Ireland.  The Agency&rsquo;s most recent reports &ldquo;Urban Waste Water Discharges in Ireland &ndash; A Report for the Years 2004 and 2005&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Provision and Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland &ndash; A Report for the Years 2006 &ndash; 2007&rdquo; are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
        <P>The Drinking Water (No 2) Regulations 2007 strengthened the enforcement provisions in relation to drinking water standards. The regulations provide for the supervision of local authority drinking water supplies by the EPA.  Local authorities continue to be responsible for supervising group water scheme supplies but all monitoring programmes are now subject to approval by the Agency. The Agency is required to supervise the performance by local authorities of their monitoring functions. Penalties for non-compliance with the requirements of the Regulations have been increased considerably with the inclusion of indictable offence provisions, and supervisory authorities now have powers of direct intervention if necessary to ensure compliance with their instructions.</P>
        <P>In the case of waste water, the Waste Water Discharge (Authorisation) Regulations, 2007, which I made in September 2007, provide for the authorisation and compliance monitoring by the Agency of discharges from local authority waste water treatment works and collection systems to all types of receiving waters.  The Regulations implement aspects of the Dangerous Substances and Water Framework Directives and will ensure that waste water discharges into surface waters, groundwater and coastal waters will meet highest international standards.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the decentralisation programme, all Dublin based operations of my Department are being decentralised, with the exception of Met &Eacute;ireann, ENFO, the Private Rented Tenancies Board and a small co-ordination section which it is proposed to retain in Dublin to assist with the Department&rsquo;s D&aacute;il and other business. A total of 682 Dublin based posts will be transferred to four locations in the South East: Wexford (270 posts); Waterford (225 posts); New Ross (125 posts) and Kilkenny (62 posts).</P>
        <P>The OPW identified a suitable site in Waterford City for the Department&rsquo;s offices and purchase terms have been agreed with Waterford City Council. The contract for sale for the 2.9 acre site located at Bolton Street/Catherine Street was signed on 12 December 2007.</P>
        <P>The indicative timescale for the completion of the Department&rsquo;s offices in Waterford as set out in the Progress Report (September 2007) from the Decentralisation Implementation Group is Quarter 3, 2010.</P>

        <Quest> the action he has taken to regulate the adult entertainment industry; if he has set up a working group on this matter; the composition and terms of reference of this working group; when the working group will report; if there will be a public consultation on the report; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2007 my Department established a task force to examine the regulatory context around the siting and location of adult entertainment venues.  The task force is chaired by my Department and comprises representatives from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; the Office of the Revenue Commissioners; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and Dublin City Council.</P>
        <P>The task force has met on a number of occasions, and its work has been informed by detailed consideration of a range of issues based on agreed terms of reference (set out below).  Given the relevance of a number of different statutory codes to this matter, it is not clear that planning regulation alone can adequately support an appropriate and effective local control regime, and the interaction of these various codes needs to be examined to ensure that the best possible approach is taken.</P>
        <P>I understand that the task force is close to finalising its work and I expect to receive a draft report shortly.  On completion of a final report, I will, in consultation with Government colleagues, consider appropriate measures to progress the issues raised.</P>
        <P>In advance of any new proposals, local authorities should use the powers currently available to them under the planning code, such as the development plan process, to ensure that new late night entertainment venues are not inappropriately located, for example in quiet residential areas.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Agreed Terms of Reference</i></P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 676 to 678, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>It is not feasible to separate taskforces from a variety of administrative arrangements such as working or action groups, steering committees or project teams which are routine and efficient mechanisms for the management of a range of projects and tasks and for the delivery of the business objectives contained in my Department&rsquo;s successive Statements of Strategy.  The detailed information sought is not readily available and because of the number of such arrangements its compilation would involve a disproportionate amount of time and work.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 681 and 682 together.</P>
        <P>Since its establishment in 2005, the Affordable Homes Partnership has played a key role in progressing a range of affordable housing issues, particularly in the Greater Dublin Area.  Its areas of activity have included measures to promote common approaches to the implementation of Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 &ndash; 2006, secure improved affordable housing information, source additional land for affordable housing and advance a number of direct procurement projects.</P>
        <P>In terms of the direct delivery of additional affordable homes, the Partnership&rsquo;s activities have included the exchange of a number of State properties for affordable housing and a programme of purchases in the housing market.  The three land exchanges undertaken to date (the first of which was commenced by Dublin City Council prior to the Partnership&rsquo;s establishment) have yielded 497 affordable homes &ndash; the total cost, in terms of the value of the land exchanged in return for discounts on affordable houses, was some &euro;56.5m.  The sales of 408 of these were completed by end 2006, with 28 further sales completed in 2007.  The sales of the remaining 61 homes are expected to be completed by end February 2008.</P>
        <P>The Partnership also contracted to purchase 502 homes in the open market in the Greater Dublin Area in a process undertaken in late 2006/early 2007.  At the end of 2007, the sales of 186 of these homes had been completed and the sale of the remaining 316 homes continues to be progressed with a view to completion as early as possible this year.  The net cost to the Exchequer of the discounts for the 502 homes was just under &euro;50 million.</P>

That order offers extensive protection to the area, under the planning code, from inappropriate development.</P>
        <P>The Liffey Valley site is important because of the diversity of the habitats within the site, and for that reason, the area has been proposed as a Natural Heritage Area.  It is also protected as such in the Local Authority Development Plans covering the area.</P>

	<P>Section 26(1) of the Wildlife Act 1976 provides that I may grant to the master or other person in charge of a pack of stag hounds, a licence authorising the hunting of deer by that pack, during such period or periods as is or are specified in the licence.</P>
        <P>The Ward Union Hunt applied to my Department for a hunting licence for the 2007/2008 season.  In my consideration of the licence application I raised a number of issues of serious concern with the Ward Union Hunt including in relation to animal welfare, conservation and protection of stags generally and compliance with previous licence conditions.  Meetings were held between my Department and representatives of the Ward Union Hunt and correspondence was exchanged with the Hunt in order to convey my serious concerns and provide them with an opportunity to address these concerns.</P>
        <P>Following these deliberations I decided in December 2007 to issue a licence to the Hunt subject to twenty-eight conditions.  I am of the view that the licence subject to these conditions will allow for the hunting of stags in a manner which is consistent with considerations of animal welfare, conservation and protection of stags.</P>
        <P>I understand from media reports that the Ward Union Hunt has initiated a High Court challenge to the new conditions in the licence.</P>

Progress with the completion of these projects is a matter for the individual local authorities and time scales have varied considerably due to a range of planning and procurement issues locally.  Consideration of a scheme in 2007 was deferred to allow local authorities to make progress with over 80 outstanding projects.  I expect to make an announcement regarding a new scheme this year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government </TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 695, 696 and 699 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s Housing Policy Statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, published in 2007, reflects the commitment in Towards 2016 to develop a national housing strategy for people with a disability which will give a broad framework to inform the future development of local authority Housing Action Plans.  Work has commenced on the development of this strategy, which is being progressed by a National Advisory Group under the aegis of the Housing Forum, headed by my Department and involving the Department of Health and Children, the Health Service Executive, social partners and other relevant stakeholders including the National Disability Authority.  The strategy, which will be developed by end 2009, will support the provision of tailored housing and housing supports for people with a disability, and will have particular regard to adults with significant disabilities and people who experience mental health issues.  It will be designed to reflect the diverse housing needs of people with a disability and ensure that the appropriate structures and supports, to deliver effectively on these needs, are in place.</P>
        <P>In terms of assisting with works to provide additional or adapted accommodation, a new Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability was introduced with effect from 1 November 2007.  Under the new scheme, the grant has increased from &euro;20,320 to an effective maximum grant of &euro;30,000, which may now cover up to 95% of the cost of the works, compared to 90% previously.  In addition, it is open to persons with a disability to apply for affordable housing, subject to meeting the eligibility criteria, principally relating to income, and demonstrating the financial capacity to service the mortgage costs involved.</P>
        <P>Under the framework of Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, protocols for inter-agency co-operation will be developed with regard to all special needs housing where there is <Col N="364"/>a care dimension to the supports required.  Specifically, in the area of housing for people with a disability, protocols are being developed to deal with cooperation between the HSE and housing authorities in order to provide a strategic framework for inter agency cooperation at local level.</P>
        <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, the HSE and local authorities, has developed a protocol governing liaison between the HSE and housing authorities on the assessment of the individual accommodation needs of people with a disability, who have been assessed under Part 2 of the Disability Act, 2005 and identified as being likely to require housing support.  This protocol, which has been in operation since July 2007, ensures that there is a smooth and transparent system to facilitate referral between the HSE and housing authorities in these cases.</P>
        <P>A further protocol to govern liaison between the HSE and housing authorities in relation to a strategic assessment of the nature and extent of local housing needs of people with a disability will be developed in the context of the housing strategy for people with a disability.  This protocol will improve the capturing of data in relation to the housing needs of people with a disability.</P>

	<P>Part M of the Building Regulations deals with Access for People with Disabilities.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the commitment given in my Department&rsquo;s Outline Sectoral Plan published under Section 36 of the Disability Act 2005, a comprehensive review of Part M and the related Technical Guidance Document, TGD-M, was initiated.  Comments were invited from the public/disability bodies on necessary amendments to Part M.</P>
        <P>More than 40 detailed submissions were received under this public consultation process.  Following consideration of these submissions, a preliminary draft of Part M and TGD-M has been presented to the statutory Building Regulations Advisory Body (BRAB).  A sub-group of BRAB has been appointed to advance a comprehensive review of the draft documents.  I intend to publish draft amendments for a final round of public consultation which will be completed by the middle of 2008, with a view to making new Regulations thereafter.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s Sectoral Plan made under section 36 of the Disability Act 2005, which covers Local Government, provides for accessibility audits and implementation plans to be drawn up by local authorities.  These plans would include measures to facilitate access by persons with disabilities to public roads, other public places and to other services provided by local authorities.  It is a matter for each local authority to decide whether some or all of the beaches in its functional area should be included in its accessibility audit and implementation plan.  </P>

The number and level of staff, and time spent, on an individual draft reply depends on a number of factors including the complexity of the issues raised in the question, the volume and accessibility of information required for the proposed reply and the form of the proposed reply, i.e. whether oral or written.  As no record is kept of the time taken by Departmental officials in formulating draft replies, it is not possible to indicate the total administrative cost involved.  </P>

	<P>In the light of concerns raised about the absence of regulation of commercial dog breeding establishments, my predecessor established a Working Group to consider regulating such establishments under the Control of Dogs Acts.</P>
        <P>The majority report of the Working Group contained a number of recommendations, including the introduction of statutorily enforceable standards for the dog breeding industry in Ireland, and proposed the introduction of a registration system for dog breeding establishments.</P>
        <P>Following extensive public consultation on the matter which showed that, while there is some opposition to the majority recommendations, there is general support for regulation in this area, work has been ongoing in my Department on the preparation of regulations to give legal effect to the majority recommendations of the Working Group.  I hope to finalise these regulations shortly.</P>

	<P>Under the Government&rsquo;s Decentralisation Programme, 199 posts in Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSi) are due to transfer to Dungarvan, County Waterford.  At present 16 staff have been recruited to posts relocating since the announcement of the Programme and some 57 staff have a relocation clause in their employment contract.</P>
        <P>The Government has always recognised that the State agency aspect of the Programme presents different challenges from that of the Civil Service but is determined to make progress towards the objectives announced in December 2003.  With a view to further advancing this element of the Programme, the Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG) is engaging in a round of meetings with each agency&rsquo;s CEO and the Secretary General of its parent Department.</P>
        <P>I understand that a site has been purchased by the OPW and that OSi has agreed the details of the accommodation brief for the new headquarters building with them.  It is expected that tender documents will be completed and tenders invited later this month.  Following receipt and evaluation of tenders, the preferred tenderer will be selected and required to submit an application for planning permission.  On receipt of satisfactory planning permission the preferred tenderer will be asked to prepare contract documentation in order to enable a contract to be placed.  Construction work will commence on the site thereafter.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  Details of broadband services throughout the country are available on my Department&rsquo;s broadband website www.broadband.gov.ie.</P>
        <P>The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services by competing private sector service providers.  The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include providing grant-aid under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme and investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).</P>
        <P>There are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  Accordingly, the procurement process for a National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is under way.  The NBS will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband in unserved areas are met.</P><Col N="371"/>

	<P>I have no statutory functions with regard to the connection of towns to the gas network.  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is a statutory independent body, has, since 2002, been charged with all aspects of the assessment and licensing of prospective operators who wish to develop and/or operate a gas distribution system within the State under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002. </P>
        <P>Acting in this capacity, the CER in 2006 approved a new network connections policy, which provided an opportunity to reconsider the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite.  This is to ensure that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting the town to the network are recouped through the consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  The new policy allows for the appraisal of a new town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.  In this context, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann (BG&Eacute;) is carrying out a comprehensive study of towns not already connected to the national gas network.</P>
        <P>The BG&Eacute; New Towns Study (under the new criteria set out in the Connections Policy) is being carried out in three Phases.  Phase 2 of this assessment of towns was completed in October of last year, and included consideration of Youghal and Dungarvan as part of a regional group of towns.  I am advised that connection of these towns was determined to be economically non-viable at the time.  However, these towns will be kept under review as part of an ongoing review process.  BG&Eacute; has a dedicated e-mail address, newtowns@bge.ie, should you have any queries with regard to this study.</P>

	<P>In December 2006, Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) was requested by my Department to initiate a pilot extension of its energy services for business, based on engaging a wider range of firms, especially SMEs, and testing the effectiveness of the energy agreements approach across the enterprise sector.  </P><Col N="372"/>
        <P>SEI accordingly developed and implemented a new programme in 2007, with particular emphasis on small and medium size enterprises.  The enhanced level of activity has seen SEI engage directly with up to 1,000 firms across all sectors, including over 700 in the small and medium categories, as well as many stakeholders and service providers.</P>
        <P>External evaluation of the support programmes indicates that energy savings to business worth over &euro;24 million annually will result directly from these programmes.  SEI has used the evaluation to inform design of further support programmes for business, which will continue in 2008.</P>

	<P>The following table sets out the EU funding received by the Department for programmes and schemes administered by the Department and agencies under its remit as and from 1 January 1997.  It should be noted that the receipts relate to the specific responsibilities that were under the Department&rsquo;s remit at the time received.  The receipts are shown primarily on an activity related basis.  It would require a substantial amount of work to translate each of these figures to a programme basis and the associated costs could not be justified.</P>
        <P>The identification of records prior to January 1997 cannot be facilitated without undue commitment of staff resources and administrative cost.  However, if the Deputy has a question in relation to a specific item I will make appropriate enquiries.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> the status of the decentralisation of the Central Fisheries Board to Carrick-on-Shannon; the number of staff already decentralised; the numbers yet to be decentralised and the timetable for this; the status of property acquisition and the cost involved; when the property will be ready for occupation; the numbers which it will cater for; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The decentralisation of the Central Fisheries Board under the Government&rsquo;s programme involves the relocation 62 posts to Carrick-on-Shannon.  To date, none of these posts has been decentralised.  At present 20 staff have been recruited to posts relocating since the announcement of the Programme and some 20 staff have a relocation clause in their employment contract.</P>
        <P>The Government has always recognised that the State agency aspect of the Programme presents different challenges from that of the Civil Service but is determined to make progress towards the objectives announced in December 2003.  With a view to further advancing this element of the Programme, the Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG) is engaging in a round of meetings with each agency&rsquo;s CEO and the Secretary General of its parent Department.</P>
        <P>The Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG) has not included the Central Fisheries Board among the State Agencies ascribed early mover status.  Property issues in relation to the Decentralisation Programme are a matter for the Office of Public Works (OPW).  However, I understand from the Central Fisheries Board&rsquo;s ongoing liaison with the OPW, that a suitable accommodation solution for the Board has not yet been identified in Carrick-on-Shannon.  In that regard no firm timelines have as yet been established and no costs have been incurred.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> the average cost to his Department of answering a parliamentary question. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Serving the needs of this House and the democratic process is an essential everyday part of the work of staff in the Department.  Work related to Parliamentary Questions is an important element of this process built into the business plans of individual divisions of the Department.  In addition, input into individual questions varies depending on the complexity of the issue raised and the level of expertise required to service it.  Because it is part of the ongoing workload of civil servants and, because staff resources are not exclusively deployed to deal with questions, it is not possible to separate out the cost of answering Parliamentary Questions from overall administration costs. </P>
