	<P>I am sure the Taoiseach will acknowledge the constructive approach from this side of the House in regard to the protection of Irish jobs and, in particular, small businesses.  It is a little more than three weeks since I initially asked about the Government&rsquo;s requirement to introduce a scheme of recapitalisation for the banking system to ensure the protection of Irish jobs and the availability of credit to small businesses.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach in his response yesterday indicated a range of matters.  In view of reports today of meetings between the Minister for Finance and Financial Regulator will he accept it is now not a matter of if the Government will introduce a recapitalisation programme but of when and in what format this will be done?  In the interests of thousands of small businesses, is the Government working towards a recapitalisation programme which will allow for credit to be extended to businesses to enable them survive and to protect thousands of Irish jobs?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that discussions on these matters take cognisance of possible reactions outside this House and to ensure we are responsible and prudent in this regard.  The joint board of the Central Bank and Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland, CBFSAI, has submitted to the Minister for Finance a report on the financial position of the six major institutions covered by the bank guarantee scheme.  The Minister has met with the Governor of the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, to discuss the report which presents an analysis of the capital positions of the six institutions <Col N="2"/>having regard to their loan book.  The content of the report is, of course, commercially sensitive, the details of which cannot be disclosed.</P>
        <P>The report confirms that all the institutions reviewed are in excess of regulatory capital requirements as of 30 September 2008, the date the guarantee scheme was announced by Government.  The PwC report demonstrates, under a number of stress scenarios, that capital levels in the covered institutions will remain above regulatory levels in the period to 2011.  The Government&rsquo;s guarantee scheme has been successful in safeguarding the stability of the Irish banking sector and in restoring its liquidity position.  However, the Minister is aware that international market expectations in respect of capital levels in the banking sector have altered and that meeting these expectations may be challenging with consequences for the sector and the wider economy.  The Minister expects that the covered institutions will explore fully the potential for meeting these capital needs through raising private capital and the disposal of appropriate assets and is, of course, keeping the matter under close review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>This refers to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comment that the Government will take action in this area only as a matter of last resort.  The Taoiseach has read out a number of details in this regard.</P>
        <P>If the Government is to introduce a recapitalisation programme, perhaps the Taoiseach will outline what principles will underpin that programme in terms of the availability of competition to the process.  We do not want a return to a duopoly.  Will the Government ensure the system is transparent and not subject to pressure from large financial entities and that concern is expressed about the requirement for Irish-owned financial institutions, which is important in an Irish context?</P>
        <P>In introducing a recapitalisation programme it will be important to ensure that moneys given to Irish banks does not sit in their vaults but is used for the purpose intended, namely, to enable credit lines to flow for Irish business and, in particular, to enable Irish small businesses to survive and to maintain and protect jobs.  I am sure the Taoiseach does not want a situation whereby capital extended to banks sits in vaults and is used only for the purpose of supporting delinquent developers in whatever form.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will comment on that matter.  I make these points in a constructive fashion because, no more than any other public representative, I am acutely aware of the real concern, anxiety and fear of people who have jobs in regard to their being able to continue in employment.</P>
        <P>It is inevitable a recapitalisation programme will be introduced.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will state, in the interests of providing hope and confidence to people in the small business sector, how and in what format the Government intends to act.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have given a formal statement in reply to Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s initial inquiry about this matter.  I emphasise it is important that people act not in a speculative manner &mdash; I am not suggesting Deputy Kenny is doing so &mdash; but in a responsible manner in respect of this matter.  They should not suggest that any particular way forward is the panacea for all ills.  We are in the midst of an international recession and of a situation where credit markets have yet to return to normalcy.  The detailed analysis and report from PricewaterhouseCoopers is as I outlined in my initial statement.  People must be measured in assessing what is the current stated position.  The Government will do all it can to facilitate a strong banking sector that is capable of providing funding for Irish commercial business.  We will do everything we can to achieve that but it is important to avoid suggesting that any particular course of action taken immediately would provide the overall solution to this problem.  I indicated yesterday that under the State guarantee scheme the question of banks having to submit business plans to <Col N="3"/>show they are prepared to provide credit lines to Irish businesses is an important factor in the Government&rsquo;s consideration of these plans.</P>
        <P>If it was the case that capital was provided by private or other means to the banking sector, that would represent capital for the banks concerned.  It would not be automatically provided as cash flow to Irish businesses but would go towards improving the capital adequacy ratios of the receiving banks.  It is important that people do not think the injection of capital <i>per se</i> provides for increased lines of credit.</P>
        <P>We have received a detailed report which confirms that the regulatory capital requirements are being met by the institutions under review and demonstrates in a number of stress scenarios that capital levels in the covered institutions will remain above regulatory levels in the period to 2011.  That is an important statement in the context of considering the options which may be available to those institutions in dealing with the changing views in international markets regarding expectations for capital levels in the banking sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to follow up on the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response to Deputy Kenny.  Did I hear him correctly as saying the report received by the Minister for Finance from the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator arising from a study by PricewaterhouseCoopers shows that the banks were in a sound position on 30 September, when the decision was made to introduce the guarantee scheme?  If that is the case, why were we led to believe that one bank, or more than one, was in imminent danger of collapse on 30 September?  Given the Minister now has the report, when will he make a decision arising from it?  Is the Government considering some form of recapitalisation of the banks, either through the use of taxpayers&rsquo; money or by means of some scheme to attract private money back to the banks?</P>
        <P>Arising from that, I wish to pursue the comments he made yesterday in respect of the capitalisation of the banks.  He said on a couple of occasions that it would not necessarily ensue from the recapitalisation of the banks that money would be made available to business and that the credit famine which businesses are now experiencing would not necessarily be relieved.  If that is the case, and I believe it is, what conditions does he intend to impose on the recapitalised banks to ensure credit is made available to businesses which need it?  I refer to the proposals made to the Government by the Small Firms Association on establishing a small business fund which could draw down the moneys made available through the European Investment Bank and on the development of a mechanism whereby those moneys can be released to small businesses which need them.  Clearly, the commercial banks are not availing of this scheme.  Will he consider the suggestion by the Small Firms Association that a forum be established involving the State, the banks and organisations representing small businesses to monitor independently the practices of banks in making credit available to businesses?</P>
        <P>It is clear that businesses are in trouble and people are losing jobs.  We have seen massive rises in unemployment levels over the course of the past year and people are worried the trend will continue for the rest of this year and into the new year because of problems in getting credit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to the first matter raised by Deputy Gilmore, the position as of 30 September was that a continuation of the situation was not tenable.  The continuation of capital outflows at the rate experienced over previous days and weeks meant the stability of the banking system was at risk.</P>
        <P>In regard to the question of recapitalisation, I made the point that we are trying to ensure a strong banking sector that can serve the Irish economy in the future.  There are constraints on credit markets in every country.  It is a problem that banks and businesses are facing everywhere as a result of the global issues we have discussed in this House on many occasions.  We need <Col N="4"/>to arrive at a situation on the basis of the State guarantee scheme, which has provided the basis for liquidity in the banking system.  The requirement under the scheme to submit business plans is the best mechanism for ensuring transparently that banks are providing lines of credit to Irish businesses.  I think the Deputy will agree recapitalisation on its own does not provide that guarantee.  Of course, in terms of the expectations of international markets, the improvement of the capital position in banks improves the market&rsquo;s view of those institutions and, by having increased capital, one is in a position to play that off against the possible impairment of assets so that capital adequacy ratios remain sufficient in the regulatory regime that applies.</P>
        <P>As I have said from the beginning, the Government is looking at all options in these matters.  We have to ensure we minimise to the greatest extent possible the exposure for the Irish taxpayer, which is what we did with the State guarantee scheme.  That is an important consideration, particularly given the overall financial and budgetary situation that confronts us.</P>
        <P>In regard to the EIB, I encourage the banks to take up that facility to the greatest extent possible.  It has to be operated through the commercial bank system and I understand the EIB has entered discussions with banks regarding participation in the facility.  These discussions are ongoing and we hope they are successful and that the facility will be taken up by the banks.  Financial institutions should use the facility with a view to making the additional funding available to small and medium sized enterprises as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>In regard to the final part of Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s question, we will continue to work with business interests and the banking sector to find out how we can ensure the maximum levels of credit possible are made available to Irish businesses in the present circumstances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think the Taoiseach grasps the urgency of the situation facing small businesses and the people who work for them and who are concerned about losing their jobs.  He outlined a process whereby reports from consultants are discussed by the Central Bank and considered by the Minister, business plans are submitted by the banks and decisions are made which perhaps will resolve the situation but may not, and to please acknowledge the position on recapitalisation.  In the meantime, businesses are going to the wall because they cannot get their hands on the money they need to pay wages to their staff or to keep going.  That is the problem.  Some are facing choices in terms of whether they should lay off staff at the end of the week, which bills they should pay this week or how will they keep going beyond Christmas.  In many cases they are experiencing a significant drop in trade.  They need some help and not to hear a story that discussions are ongoing with the banks and a process is under way.  They need to get access to credit.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Finance is missing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>How will that be done in the short term?  The Small Firms Association has made three suggestions to Government this week.  It suggested the Government should establish a small business fund.  I know we no longer have a State bank by which that could be done by the State.  However, the Government should find some means by which a small business fund can be established so that businesses that cannot get access to credit through the commercial banking system, as it is not lending to them, can get access to these funds through the European Investment Bank.  That is the first suggestion and it should be feasible.</P>
        <P>The second suggestion is to follow the example of the British Government which has introduced a rule that all state payments to small businesses would be made within ten days.  All invoices made out to a Department or State agency need to be paid within ten days.  That has been done by the British Government and its example could be followed here.</P><Col N="5"/>
        <P>The third suggestion is to establish a formal forum.  Here is the problem: when the business organisations representing small business approach the banks to complain about them not lending or releasing the credit, the banks claim they are doing what they have always done which is to apply the rules.  They need a forum to investigate the practice of what banks are doing with individual businesses and compare that with what they claim they are doing and indeed what the Government will probably require them to do when it makes its decision arising from the report it has received.</P>
        <P>There is an urgency about responding to the proposals made by the Small Firms Association in order to save those businesses that would otherwise go to the wall this week or next week and give them some breathing space so they can get through Christmas and on into the new year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am acutely aware of the situation.  The Government is not standing by or sitting back in this situation.  The Government is actively engaged in trying to deal with a number of these issues.  One of the biggest issues relates to the question of obtaining capital requirements for the banks so that they will in turn ensure they change their loan arrangements because they are reviewing their adequacy ratios all the time.  My purpose in this matter is to try to improve the situation for Irish businesses.  Of course that is my contention.  We also need a functioning banking system to have a proper commercial life in the country and try to maintain to the greatest extent possible the employment we have built up.  There is no disagreement on that front.</P>
        <P>Regarding the EIB, one must work it through the commercial banking system.  The EIB has been in touch with the banks and those issues are being progressed.  I have stated I would like to see that facility taken up as a matter of priority and those discussions are ongoing.</P>
        <P>Regarding the question of a forum, as I have said, the T&aacute;naiste and I along with other economic Ministers will continue to work with the business community to see in what way we can assist.  On the issue of prompt payments within ten days, we are evaluating to see if that is possible.  That suggestion came a few days ago and we are investigating whether it is possible.  Establishing a fund outside the normal commercial criteria that apply is not something that is possible for the Government to do.  We need to see if we can use, for example, the EIB facility as a means of assisting the banks to apply that credit in the way they are applying it at present in terms of their own resources.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The total cost incurred by my Department in respect of the Moriarty tribunal since 1997 up to 31 October 2008 was &euro;33,768,417.  For 2008, up to 31 October, the figure was &euro;2,977,619.  It is not possible, at this stage, to estimate the final costs.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="6"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In July the Minister for Finance issued a statement on behalf the Government that he planned to introduce public expenditure cuts of &euro;440 million by the end of the year and reduce spending by a further &euro;1 billion in 2009.  It was hoped the Moriarty tribunal would have concluded its public hearings this year.  It had its last public session in May.  I believe there were only three public sittings this year, one in March and two in May.  I understand the Government committed to review the operational costs of the tribunals of inquiry as part of the overall review of spending in order to minimise expenditure both in the remainder of 2008 and in 2009, which I support.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach will be aware that the &euro;1 billion the Minister referred to as being saved in 2009 could be just about enough to cover the legal bills expected in the Moriarty and Mahon tribunals.  As he is aware, both have been in existence since 1997 and have as yet to pay out the majority of their third-party legal costs.  No one knows how large those legal bills will be and cutbacks will not prevent these payments having to be made.</P>
        <P>What progress has been made since July arising from the Minister&rsquo;s comment?  Mr. Justice Moriarty has made several comments that his report was expected to be published fairly soon and yet there is no evidence of it at all.  Has the Government contacted the tribunal to establish whether it has completed all its public hearings given that only three took place this year?  If so when can we expect the final Moriarty tribunal report to be published?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware the tribunal is in the final phase of preparing its report.  In response to inquiries from my Department in July the sole member indicated it was his intention to complete his work by the end of this year.  I understand this timetable, although likely to be subject to a slight overrun, is more or less on schedule.  As the Deputy said, the last public hearing was on 7 May and Mr. Justice Moriarty has commenced procedures for finalising his report.  He has not ruled out further public hearings as a result of that process.  He cannot predict.  It could happen but one cannot be sure.</P>
        <P>As I have said, in response to inquiries from my Department in July the sole member indicated it was his intention to complete his work by the end of this year.  Assuming that the final procedural stages of the tribunal&rsquo;s work can be completed smoothly the role of the legal team is likely to diminish.  As soon as submissions have been processed and considered the expenditure on counsel is likely to begin to reduce significantly.</P>
      </Speaker>
       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for that.  What elements of costs for the Moriarty tribunal have been paid out to date?  It was decided in July that the legal counsel to the tribunal would no longer be paid once public hearings were completed.  The Government informed the Departments to which the tribunals report that tribunal legal teams, including the &euro;2,700 a day senior counsel, should be let go.  Given that the Moriarty tribunal has not sat since May, can the Taoiseach confirm that legal counsel has not been retained by the tribunal since July as promised by the Minister for Finance?  It was the view of the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, which I share, that the judges should work on their reports without the assistance of the legal staff who are on generous daily rates of payment.  That could save the taxpayer up to a further &euro;1 million.  Can the Taoiseach confirm that legal counsel has not been retained by the Moriarty tribunal?  Can he confirm that legal staff have been withdrawn on the basis of the comments of the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, that the judges should work on their reports themselves once the public hearings were completed?  If that is not the case, why not?</P>
     
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I should make it clear that work is ongoing in the tribunal, although there are no public hearings.  It relates to the statement made by Mr. Justice Michael Moriarty in his ruling on 29 September 2005.  He stated:</P><Col N="7"/>
        <P LI="1">While engaged in a fact-finding exercise I recognise that the tribunal is nevertheless bound by the principles enunciated in <i>re: Haughey</i> [1971] 1R 217.  The procedures I have adopted to date have provided for representation for persons affected by evidence given at this inquiry or likely to be given at this inquiry.  I also wish to make it clear at this stage that before reaching any conclusions on the evidence given at this inquiry I intend to enunciate a procedure whereby persons likely to be affected by any adverse findings will be given notice of conclusions, which if reached, would be adverse to them so as to enable them to make submissions in relation to those proposed conclusions.  I would also envisage, so as to protect the interests of any such persons, that notice of any proposals to make any such adverse findings is given in writing and not enunciated in public, thereby protecting persons in respect of whom such conclusions might ultimately not be reached from the risk of the promulgation of any such adverse findings.  I would also envisage that submissions in relation to any such proposed adverse findings would be addressed to the tribunal in writing so as once again to avoid unnecessary and potentially damaging publication.  Depending on the circumstances, it may entail the recalling of certain witnesses for additional cross-examination as suggested by Mr. McGonigal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He is currently in the middle of this procedure, putting possible findings to concerned parties and enabling them to reply.  He is using his legal team to assist in the process.  That the tribunal is not sitting in public does not mean work is not ongoing or legal counsel is not required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I appreciate that and respect the rights of the individuals who would be so concerned.  The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, stated that once public hearings are completed, legal counsel on fee of &euro;2,700 a day would be withdrawn.  Legal staff would not be working on the report as it is a matter solely for the tribunal.  We have only had three hearings in 2008 and in view of this does the Taoiseach have any evidence that public hearings have been completed?  The question arising from the Minister&rsquo;s comments was that legal counsel should not be retained by the tribunal if public hearings have been completed.  The same applies to legal staff.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is not certain public hearings are completed.  Depending on circumstances, the recalling of certain witnesses may be required for additional cross-examination in respect of the procedure in which he is currently engaged.  It is less likely there will be additional public hearings but they are not excluded, depending on how the procedure in which he is presently engaged concludes.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Caol&aacute;in for the courtesy.  What the Taoiseach has just told us is astonishing.  This tribunal has gone on for 11 years and I do not know how many days of public hearings it has held.  A report is now being written and the Taoiseach is telling us there could be another round of public hearings some time in the new year.  It is <Col N="8"/>remarkable.  Has any other tribunal or inquiry proceeded in this fashion when compiling a report? </P>
        <P>After 11 years one would expect it should be possible to present a report and not have to go back again to the people investigating to ask permission for the report&rsquo;s publication.  It is incredible after 11 years, when we thought the final public hearings of this tribunal had concluded, we are likely to have another round.</P>
        <P>In April 2004, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s predecessor as Minister for Finance, former Deputy McCreevy, told the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis that he considered the legal fees being paid to the tribunals to be astronomical, the gravy train had gone on long enough and he would reduce the fees.  Various proposals were advanced as to what levels the fees would be reduced to.  Shortly afterwards, the Taoiseach succeeded former Deputy McCreevy as Minister for Finance, so can he explain why all these false promises of fees of tribunal lawyers being reduced never materialised?</P>
        <P>A scheme was introduced at one stage dictating that the fees of tribunal lawyers would be tied, in the case of senior counsel to High Court judges and in the case of other legal personnel to other benchmarks in the Judiciary.  This was never implemented.  In 2004 former Deputy McCreevy, as Minister for Finance, told the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis this would be brought under control so why was this never done?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been correspondence between Ministers whose various line Departments liaise with tribunals regarding some of these matters.  Cases will be made in reply regarding the need for continuity and need to maintain counsel.  In the event of counsel not being retained, resigning or not continuing with its work, the first reaction in this House would be Deputies Gilmore and Kenny saying we are interfering with the tribunal, trying to undermine it and attacking its integrity.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Is the Taoiseach saying I made such charges?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputies cannot have their cake and eat it.  If that had happened, those political charges would be very robustly put.  The chairpersons of these tribunals would make the case in reply regarding some of these and I presume that correspondence is on the record.</P>
        <P>The protraction of the work of this tribunal has in part been due to litigation involving a total of four sets of proceedings instituted by individuals connected with the tribunal&rsquo;s work, illness of witnesses and further material which came to light in the course of the Ansbacher investigation carried out by the authorised officer.  This new material, which had to be considered by the tribunal, necessitated almost a further year&rsquo;s work by way of private investigation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The methodology used by Mr. Justice Moriarty, who despite the protraction of the proceedings has been painstakingly exact in his work, has been about trying to avoid a case where the tribunal would take even longer were he to take a different course of action.  He is trying to keep to a minimum the public hearings and get to the facts.  This is a protracted and intricate financial issue which required painstaking investigation and inquiry.</P><Col N="9"/>
        <P>In regard to the current procedure of finalising his report, I am not suggesting it is likely there will be public hearings.  I cannot rule out a public hearing and I cannot say for certain there will not be one.  It is unlikely if the current procedural stages of the tribunal&rsquo;s work can be completed smoothly.  There will be no more if this comes about and we are in the final stages of this process.</P>
        <P>Ultimately, this is not a court of law.  The findings must be such that they cannot be challenged subsequently in court or not have the required effect.  Mr. Justice Moriarty is ensuring the constitutional rights of all concerned parties are not in any way compromised.  The question of constitutional and natural justice comes into play when an adverse finding is made against a person.  It must be put to the person concerned.  Mr. Justice Moriarty is ensuring the work stands the test of time and subsequent scrutiny.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have two points to make.  First, as I recall it, the McCracken tribunal made adverse findings and it did not beat about the bush in making these and submitting them to the D&aacute;il.  In its earlier reports, the Flood tribunal made adverse findings about people.  I do not understand why the procedure the Taoiseach has outlined is being followed so rigorously in the case of the Moriarty tribunal and why it cannot submit a report to the House.  It is not a report for the courts, it is a report to the House.  It was the Oireachtas that established the Moriarty tribunal and it is to the Oireachtas that it reports.  I do not understand why it cannot submit that report without the prolonged process the Taoiseach has described.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Second, it is laughable for the Taoiseach to suggest to the House that the reason the fees of tribunal lawyers have not been reduced was that he was afraid to do so because of what Deputy Kenny or I might say about it.  That is nonsense.  The same is true of his suggestion that it could not be done in case tribunal lawyers might up and leave the tribunal.  There has been a pretty big turnover of tribunal lawyers at both tribunals over the years.  The Government did make a number of decisions that the fees of tribunal lawyers would be reduced.</P>
        <P>Whatever about paying the lawyers who work on the tribunal itself, the big bill here will be the third party costs when they come to be awarded.  Does the Taoiseach expect that those third party costs will be awarded on the same basis and the same level of fees as has been paid to the lawyers who have been working for the tribunal itself?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a matter for Deputy Gilmore if he wishes to criticise the procedures that are being adopted by the sole member of the tribunal.  Regarding third party costs, the work of the tribunal following the publication of the report, apart from the winding down of the administration, will entail mainly dealing with issues of costs.  The extent of any third party cost process will depend on the findings in the report.  Any orders for cost made will entitle a party in whose favour an order has been made to lodge a bill of costs with the tribunal&rsquo;s solicitor.  The ultimate sanction for costs to be paid to any party in whose favour a bill has been made will rest with the Department of Finance.  The process of awarding costs can be lengthy and may not be completed in 2009.  It is impossible to say what the final cost, including third party costs, will be for the tribunal.  The tribunal has made no rulings in this regard and has consistently told us that to give any indication of what the total amount might be would allow inferences to be drawn,which could infringe upon the rights of the parties involved.</P>

	<P>At the start of the month the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated the total cost of tribunals of inquiry to date had reached &euro;355 million.  Can the Taoiseach confirm if that is the case, and is he able to break that down in regard to the Moriarty tribunal, which is the critical focus of this series of questions?  Can he give us an indication of the total cost of the Moriarty tribunal to date?</P><Col N="10"/>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach share my concerns that the serious cost and duration of these series of tribunals of inquiry have of themselves fed into the argument against establishing tribunals of inquiry into matters that in the opinion of many in this House, including me, and many concerned citizens should have been inquired into and that the experience out of this series of tribunals of inquiry has given rise to the argument against them?  I refer, for instance, to the terrible tragedies faced by women at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, both in regard to the Neary case and the symphysiotomy scandals.  None of those matters has been addressed in any substantive way.  The truth has never been properly sought out and established and the long periods of silence on the part of many who were exposed to the facts of what was actually happening.  None of that has been established.  Does the Taoiseach not share general public concern and alarm at that?</P>
        <P>As various Government speakers indicated previously on a number of occasions the costs and duration of tribunals can be curtailed.  Given what has already been said about the failure to enact already stated intent on the part of the previous Taoiseach to curtail costs, what steps are the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform taking to ensure tribunals of inquiry that are necessary are set up and that the issues of cost and duration are properly addressed in advance?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In the body of the initial reply I gave the cost to date of the inquiry about which the questions were tabled.  The cost to date up to 31 October is &euro;33.768 million.</P>
        <P>More generally, a former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform introduced the Commissions of Investigation Act, which can be a more appropriate means of dealing of some of these matters.  The tribunals of inquiry legislation dates back to the 1920s.  There is no doubt that in the context of due process and the procedural requirements in Irish law even for tribunals of inquiry, quite apart from the courts, are quite rigorous and painstaking, and are fully availed of by those against whom allegations have been made.  Commissions of investigation are a means of addressing issues of public interest in a more urgent and timely fashion.</P>
        <P>There have been other non-statutory inquires and reports were drawn up by various chairpersons that dealt well with issues.  Ms Justice Maureen Harding Clark&rsquo;s report on the Neary situation was an excellent example of what can be done without the need for all of the accoutrements that come with a tribunal of inquiry.  This House must be careful in determining if matters of public interest should be dealt with by way of an outside inquiry and that it should be done as expeditiously and as quickly as possible with reference to the taxpayers of this country as well.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Go raibh maith agat.  The Taoiseach should note that I do not believe there has been serious address of all of the contributory factors to the neglect at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in regard to the cases I mentioned, namely, the unfortunate victims of Mr. Neary and the symphysiotomy scandal.  While I and party colleagues have difficulties and concerns regarding the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill currently going through the Oireachtas, nevertheless, when that does complete its passage can the Taoiseach indicate to the House if there will be an examination of the number of issues on which tribunals of inquiry or other means of inquiry have been sought?  I mentioned the hospital cases.  I also refer to the murder of my party colleague, an elected member of Buncrana Town Council and Donegal County Council, the late councillor Eddie Fullerton, who was brutally murdered in his home.  Despite the indication of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s predecessor of an interest in the matter, no steps have been taken to try to establish the full facts and the truth of that case.</P>

	<P>I am making the point that the costs of the Moriarty tribunal and other experiences have been used as an argument against taking appropriate steps in other cases, so therefore it has a direct impact.  I am asking whether, on the passage of the new Tribunals of Inquiry Bill, further consideration will be given to these other matters.</P>
        <P>With regard to the responses the Taoiseach has given regarding the ongoing retention of the services, at some significant cost to the taxpayer, of legal advisors who are or have been engaged in the Moriarty tribunal, is it the case that the process of public hearings has been completed?  The Taoiseach has posed a question as to whether this is the case.  Nevertheless, the report is being compiled by the sole member.  Does the Taoiseach not accept that there is valid public concern over the extent of the ongoing cost of the retention of a significant number of legal experts, and that this requires intervention by the Government in order to establish their purpose and role?  Surely there is a question in this regard to be addressed in the public interest and in the interest of restoring confidence in the tribunal of inquiry method of addressing major issues.  Will the Taoiseach inquire as to the need and justification for the continued retention of people who are clearly associated with the work of the tribunal at a significant cost, and given that there is some doubt as to the validity of their ongoing claims?</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach, on the cost of the tribunal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>All I can say to the Deputy is that the Oireachtas, when establishing tribunals, must be mindful of wide and comprehensive terms of reference pertaining to matters of great intricacy and complexity which in some cases require worldwide searches in order to reach conclusions.  This is the case in respect of some of the issues we have asked the sole member of the Moriarty tribunal to investigate.  The view that we can operate without expertise or employing people to answer the questions that arise should comprise a prominent part of the debate that takes place before we establish such tribunals.  From my recollection of the setting up of many tribunals such as the Moriarty tribunal, I understand that view did not gain much currency in the relevant debates.  While it is important to investigate matters of public interest, it is only afterwards that people start to hold this view.</P>
        <P>Under the Tribunals of Inquiry Act we asked the sole member of the Moriarty tribunal to inquire into matters of urgent public importance, yet, for a range of reasons I outlined in previous replies, we are still awaiting the final report.  There are reasons for this and I do not criticise the sole member in this regard.  The reasons include the requirement for co-operation of witnesses before a tribunal.</P>
        <P>It is only fair to say that in the aftermath of the beef tribunal, we were told we must be very slow to engage in such a process again, yet we engaged in a plethora of tribunals.  It was a decision of the Oireachtas to do so and that is the way it is.  However, we must take into account the fact that public hearings are not necessarily the only way in which matters of importance can be investigated.  They are sometimes, but not necessarily always, appropriate.  The tribunals of inquiry legislation that was brought through the House by former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, constituted a very clear effort to find an alternative way to investigate such matters in a more expeditious and less costly manner.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="12"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Let me return to a question I asked the Taoiseach already.  I understand Mr. Justice Moriarty said we are now finished with public hearings and that there will be no more.  It makes a mockery of the statement of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, if we are likely to have more public hearings because subjects of the tribunal might challenge its findings.  The sole member announced that there would be no more public hearings, yet, on the basis of what the Taoiseach said, this might be a possibility.  The Minister for Finance said that once the public hearings are ended, senior counsel should be withdrawn, resulting in a saving of &euro;2,700 per day.  He stated the legal staff of the tribunal should not serve any longer and that the judge should get on with the work of writing the report.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comment to Deputy Gilmore that this House has a number of options in respect of carrying out these kinds of investigations.  There are a number of examples of such options that worked very well.  One may have to deal with the constitutional requirement in order to allow for some form of such work, but that is a matter for another day.</P>
        <P>The sole member of the Moriarty tribunal stated we are now finished with public hearings and the Minister for Finance stated, as a consequence, senior counsel and legal staff should be withdrawn, but this does not seem to have occurred.  The public finds this very hard to understand given that the Government has made a decision on the withdrawal of vaccination for 12 year olds at a cost of &euro;10 million.</P>

	<P>As I stated, the sole member indicated it is his intention to complete his work by the end of the year.  The timetable is now to be subject to a slight overrun but it is more or less on schedule.  As soon as submissions have been processed and considered, the expenditure on counsel is likely to begin to reduce significantly.  This is the position of the sole member and we must abide by it in the interest of ensuring there is no unnecessary interference or undermining of his final work at this stage of the proceedings.  It is a question of acknowledging his position.  I am not suggesting it is likely there will be further public hearings but that, in the interest of being exact, it could happen if an issue arose from the interaction between the legal teams.</P>

	<P>On the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement that the tribunals were established by the Oireachtas and that the Oireachtas always has options open to it, does he recall that when the Moriarty tribunal had been established for a short while, an issue arose over an alleged payment made to former Minister Ray Burke?  This side of the House proposed that Mr. Justice Moriarty be allowed to have another module to investigate the allegation.  The then Government, led by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s predecessor, rejected that proposal and insisted instead on setting up a separate tribunal to examine all planning matters.  It turned out that there was some irony in this decision.  Regardless of what the tribunals have discovered, it might have been less costly had the Burke allegation been investigated by way of a separate module of the Moriarty tribunal, as originally proposed on this side of the House.</P>

	<P>What is the situation in respect of searches of aeroplanes at Shannon Airport of persons involved in terrorist activities, or suspected of terrorist activities?</P>
        <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in the past six months there have been a number of reports about al-Queda cells operating in Ireland?  What evidence of this is available to the Taoiseach and the Government?</P>
        <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that MI5 has set up a new headquarters in Northern Ireland?  Is the Government in contact with MI5 with regard to suspected terrorists living in Ireland?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some years ago the Taoiseach&rsquo;s predecessor commented on reputed al-Queda cells operating in Dublin.  In March of this year three people were arrested in Tralee as part of a suspected Islamic terrorism unit in County Kerry that was under Garda surveillance.  Can the Taoiseach inform the House with regard to what happened after that information was brought to the attention of the Government through Garda surveillance?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are all aware of the aftermath of 11 September 2001 and other more recent outrages, and of the scale and the threat posed by international terrorism.  Although there are no grounds to suggest that Ireland is at particular risk, security services maintain a high state of vigilance.  They are also in regular contact with other security services and there is an ongoing exchange of information and intelligence through fora such as Europol and Eurojust.  It would not be appropriate to speculate on whether there are persons active in this country whose activities are linked to international terrorism except to assure the Deputy that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na closely monitors the security situation on an ongoing basis.  This includes any activities that might pose a threat to international security.</P>

	<P>Has the National Security Committee addressed the issue of dissident republican groups?  Does it liaise and co-operate with the international monitoring commission in Northern Ireland in respect of that matter?  What is the assessment of the National Security Committee of the threats posed by dissident republican groups, in this State or throughout the island?</P>
        <P>Would the Taoiseach consider, or has the Government considered, the possibility of extending the remit of the National Security Committee to address the threat posed to the safety of people in this country from organised gangland-type groups?  Does he see any possibility of a role for the National Security Committee in co-ordinating the work of the respective security agencies and intelligence agencies of the State in cracking down on gangland crime?</P>

	<P Just="Left">The National Security Committee does not deal with operational matters which are dealt with by the security services or the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Having dissidents or any terrorist or paramilitary activity under surveillance is something in which the Garda is thankfully expert and has been successful.  People will know that the Garda continues to ensure that such suspects do not engage in any nefarious activity that would be a threat to life or property.  This is an ongoing issue that the Garda Commissioner and military intelligence watch all the time.</P>
        <P>Concerning the gangland issue, this is an operational matter and is dealt with by the Garda in liaison with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, on an continuing basis.  The National Security Committee does not deal with those specific matters which are operational issues.</P>

The report indicates the committee&rsquo;s concern at the EU Commission proposal to have the personal details of all airline passengers furnished to the security authorities in other jurisdictions.

It provides for exchange of information and collective assessment on an ongoing basis.  The nature of the committee&rsquo;s work precludes me from giving any more detailed description of its proceedings, with regard to when it meets, etc.  Concerning any matters that arise in the new situation in which we live, I support all security and co-operation measures between countries as a vital means of protecting our own citizens and others.</P>

	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of urgent national importance, namely, the need for the Government to introduce legislation to regulate management companies that are ripping off mortgage holders in new apartment and housing complexes.  In light of the increasing job losses and rising home repossessions, the Government must protect mortgage holders from management companies that impose exorbitant fees and must ensure that responsibility for the maintenance of new complexes is handed over to local authorities within a reasonable timeframe.</P>

	<P>I wish to seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order No. 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the shameful lack of after-care services for young people who leave the care of the State at the age of 18 years and are regarded as capable of independent living, without preparation or follow-up services.  The majority of these young people end up homeless, involved in drugs and crime, or in detention centres within six months of leaving care.</P>

	<P>In respect of the Finance Bill, when the Minister for Finance announced the budget he stated that the tax rate at which charges for nursing homes and expenses could be reclaimed would be reduced from the marginal rate of 41% to 20%.  Will the Finance Bill contain a provision reversing this measure when it is published tomorrow?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it was not the intention to reduce the rate in respect of nursing homes. </P>

	<P>That was not the intention. </P>

	<P>In the budget the Minister for Finance announced the amalgamation or abolition of a number of State agencies, which I understand will involve the amendment of approximately 17 Acts.  Having asked previously if it was intended to make these amendments in one Bill or separately, I am still unclear as to what are the Government&rsquo;s intentions in that regard.  What are the Government&rsquo;s plans for amending the legislation to allow for the amalgamation and abolition of the different bodies, as announced in the Budget Statement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>When the implementation plans of Departments regarding these matters are completed and received by the Department of Finance, it may be possible, taking all factors into consideration, to bring together some of the rationalisation proposals within one Bill, especially where similar issues or timeframes are involved.  Alternatively, it may also be possible to bring forward a number of Bills together where timeframes are suitable.  We are anxious to make progress on rationalisation as soon as possible and we will adopt the most efficient course of action to achieve early implementation of the improved efficiencies and savings anticipated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>When does the Taoiseach expect the implementation plans to be completed and available to Government?  Arising from that, when will we have some indication as to what legislation will be introduced?  Are the implementation plans to which the Taoiseach referred confined to the amalgamations announced in the budget or is it intended to go further than the budget announcement?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="17"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Finance indicated in his budget the bodies which may be merged or dissolved depending on the various proposals he announced.  These will be the priority for Government in the immediate future.  As to what other proposals may arise, that is a matter for the Government to consider at any time.  I cannot give the Deputy a date on which the implementation plans will be available.  Obviously, work on the issue is ongoing as a result of the budget announcements. </P>

	<P>In the previous term, the House had nothing but debates.  Now that one of the most important issues in Irish history has arisen, the House does not have time to debate it. </P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste and Taoiseach gave an indication that they have reached decisions on the introduction of legislation on property management companies.  Tens of thousands of property owners are experiencing severe difficulties with property management services and their costs.  Has the Government clarified which Department will sponsor what is, I understand, a single Bill?  What is the timeframe for dealing with the legislation?  In terms of the property market, the confused circumstances surrounding property management companies in new areas is causing severe problems for property owners who want to sell their property and move on, those who want to buy a property and those paying mortgages on negative equity homes and high management fees.  </P>

	<P>The Deputy may not make a Second Stage speech on the Order of Business.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the legislation, I understand the T&aacute;naiste indicated yesterday that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would sponsor the Bill as soon as the Attorney General&rsquo;s work has been completed in the matter.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>On the same issue, three Ministries are involved in this issue.  By far the busiest Ministry as far as legislation is concerned is the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Given that it would be extremely difficult for the Department to give priority to the Bill in question, I ask the Taoiseach to review which Department is sponsoring the legislation. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the same issue, there appears to be an element of confusion with regard to responsibility and the nature of the legislation.  I ask that the Government Whip <Col N="18"/>produce a memorandum because it appears that of the three Departments involved, one is taking responsibility for dealing with the issues raised by Deputy Burton.  The Taoiseach has stated consistently that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has responsibility for the Property Services Regulatory Authority Bill which deals specifically and, I believe, exclusively, with the regulation of the auctioneers and estate agents profession, an entirely different matter from that raised by Deputy Burton.  The Taoiseach now appears to indicate that composite legislation will be introduced by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to deal with management companies, which is more of an environment-consumer-enterprise issue and needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We were aware that there are various aspects to this issue and it was the view of many Members of the Opposition that we should ascertain whether it was possible to introduce a composite Bill.  The issue was examined by Government and we decided to try to take that route.  As I indicated, the Attorney General continues to work on the matter.  A legislation committee meeting will take place tomorrow and perhaps the Whip will be able to update the Opposition parties thereafter. </P>

	<P>On No. 75 on the legislative programme, should the wording of the social welfare lone parent and other low income families reform Bill be changed in light of comments made by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs last week regarding a discussion paper with proposals for supporting lone parents?</P>
        <P>I raise No. 35, the foreshore (amendment) Bill, and the Housing (Miscellaneous) Provisions Bill, which we hope will give powers to local authorities and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regarding criminality and anti-social behaviour in housing estates.  On the Bill to implement amendments to SOLAS, the Safety of Life at Sea Convention, has new equipment been purchased for the Malin Head, Valentia and Dublin marine rescue centres?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

Very many decisions have been made by the Ceann Comhairle and previous Chairs in the matter of allowing a Deputy, at this point of the day, to raise the matter of a debate on an issue, requesting that Government time be made available.  There is long-standing precedent by which the Ceann Comhairle is bound as well as a Standing Order, so he may allow that question.  He is not ruled out from allowing it. </P>

Given the Minister&rsquo;s comments yesterday, where he talked about a four-year phasing in period with some of these works such as outside toilets and central heating being put in place, I believe clarity is needed.

	<P>In light of the fact that 48,000 people who are now claiming job seeker&rsquo;s benefit still do not realise that the amount of time in which they can claim has been reduced in the Social Welfare Bill,  a statutory instrument must be sent to the various Departments to ensure that the wishes for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs are carried out.  Her wishes are contained within the Social Welfare Bill.

     <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt> <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise to the Minister for not being here yesterday when the Bill was introduced.  I am glad to be able to contribute to a Bill that is in need of support from this side of the House; we will facilitate the speedy passage of a piece of legislation which does a straightforward and simple thing, namely raise the borrowing capacity of Bord G&aacute;is.  The Minister will have the support of Fine Gael in passing this Bill through Second Stage and further Stages.  To impose a time limit of 18 December, the last day we sit before the D&aacute;il breaks up for the year, is not the ideal way to pass legislation.  </P>
        <P>From the point of view of Bord G&aacute;is and the Government there should have been sufficient notice that Bord G&aacute;is was running out of money in terms of borrowing capacity.  I am not sure to whom we should apportion blame, neither am I sure it is relevant who is at fault.  We need to increase the borrowing capacity of Bord G&aacute;is from &euro;1.7 billion to &euro;3 billion.</P>
        <P>When one looks at its capital investment plans for the next four or five years, there is clearly a need to dramatically increase the statutory borrowing capacity for Bord G&aacute;is for a series of reasons.  Perhaps that should have been done before now and not have to be facilitated in what could be a rushed manner.  If we had a whole raft of emergency legislation to pass in the next month then this Bill would come under time pressure when going through the House and committees, and that would deal with legislation in an ill prepared way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to outline why I think this legislation is worth supporting.  We need to support Bord G&aacute;is as a company that has the capacity to grow, as a well run and profitable company that can make a major contribution to supporting the Government strategy to create a more sustainable energy future for Ireland.  The Minister has hope and determination to try to create a <Col N="24"/>new energy future for Ireland and Bord G&aacute;is, as a State-owned company, can play a vital role in achieving that.</P>
        <P>We should not only facilitate that in terms of borrowing capacity but also by talking to it about its ambitions and the future ambitions of the State on the need for investment in renewable technologies, more sustainable forms of energy generation and the continued roll-out of a gas network as a piece of vital State infrastructure to every town in Ireland where it is feasible to do so.  For that to happen Bord G&aacute;is needs to borrow more money; it is as simple as that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If one looks at how it spent its money since 2002, when the last increase was given to it, it can be been seen that with the exception of one area where criticism could be targeted it has spent money rolling out a gas pipeline across the country.  This has been from Mayo to Galway, a North-South pipeline between Dublin and Belfast and a pipeline between Belfast and Derry.  One interesting element of Bord G&aacute;is is its ambitions north of the Border.  It genuinely aspires to be an all-island gas supply and energy company and that should be encouraged.  The Dublin-Galway-Limerick pipeline which cost &euro;400 million should also be welcomed.</P>
        <P>It is easier in hindsight to question the wisdom of spending more than &euro;300 million on a second gas interconnector.  That has been done and paid for and we should look for positives in that, particularly in view of our security of supply should anything happen to the other gas interconnector connecting Ireland to Britain.  We are facilitating the future today and it is what we should be talking about.</P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is wants to be a dual fuel provider in the energy market and is making the transition now from a supplier and transporter of gas to domestic and commercial users to an energy company that has a significant energy generation ambition.  It is also moving aggressively into the renewable energy sector, whether that is potential investment in wave energy projects off the west coast or purchasing and supporting wind energy projects in a range of areas around Ireland.  That is important because for far too long we have tried to facilitate competition in the Irish market to compete with the ESB in energy or electricity generation.  We have spent a lot of time, effort and State resources to try to create a competitive marketplace for energy generation and supply and we have not reaped the benefits in pricing, product or service choice of that effort for consumers.</P>
        <P>The ESB now provides only 50% of electricity generation in Ireland and we have not seen the benefits one would expect to see from a competitive marketplace in terms of pricing.  One effective way to provide that future competition produces results for the consumer is to ensure that State-owned companies compete with each other aggressively in the energy marketplace.  That means a proactive role for Bord G&aacute;is, Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte to ensure they are competing and have the borrowing capacity to compete with the ESB in terms of producing power efficiently, sustainably and at the lowest cost they can achieve.   Unfortunately, despite the competitive marketplace we supposedly have created through regulation, we have not seen its benefits.</P>
        <P>There is an obvious role for Bord G&aacute;is in terms of contributing to security of supply.  Its plans for gas storage are exciting and ambitious but will require significant investment for which it will require borrowing.  Projected capital expenditure by Bord G&aacute;is is &euro;15 million for this year, &euro;80 million for 2009, &euro;194 million for 2010 and &euro;120 million for 2011.  These moneys are allocated for capital expenditure in renewable and gas storage projects.  It is most important for security of gas supply to ensure we can exploit the country&rsquo;s offshore natural resources.  We must bring that gas ashore in a way acceptable to the local populations.  More importantly, we must ensure we bring it ashore in a way that can supply consistent and attractively priced gas to our networks.</P><Col N="25"/>
        <P>We must also consider gas storage capacity here.  Currently, if the interconnectors between Ireland and Britain were to shut down in the morning, Ireland would only have approximately six days of gas supply.  Our economy would grind to a halt after that.  We need to consider the political stability of the areas from where our gas comes and the expected lifespan of the gas fields and should take a serious look at security of supply issues and give serious consideration to exploiting domestic resources and increasing our gas storage facilities.  We have large empty gas fields off the coast of Kinsale that could be used for storage.  They are currently used by Bord G&aacute;is on a temporary basis to store gas and build up pressure within small gas fields and supply gas to the market in a way that supports the security of supply objectives of the Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My colleague Deputy Bannon will talk about the need to roll out gas pipelines into new parts of the country, rural areas in particular, to ensure everyone, where possible, can benefit from attractive gas prices for home heating and, possibly, electricity generation through small combined heat and power micro-generation.  People should also be able to benefit from the convenience offered by gas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will speak about the issue of pricing before I conclude my contribution, but I would like to focus on an area in which the Minister is interested, namely, the contribution Bord G&aacute;is can make towards reducing our emissions and ensuring we fulfil our commitments and achieve our targets for the reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions.  Last Friday, I and the Minister&rsquo;s colleague spoke at a conference in Cork organised by an organisation called Partnership for Change.  The topic of discussion was climate change and the challenge Ireland faces.  We face an awesome challenge. </P>
        <P>Currently, the State does not invest enough capital in driving changes in consumer behaviour so that we move away from a carbon economy towards a more sustainable one.  The reason for this is that we do not have the money to do this.  We have some projects, for example, the warmer homes and greener homes schemes and energy schemes for homes and businesses.  We are also changing building regulations.  While all of these projects are welcome, we need to ensure there is significant investment in driving change in consumer behaviour and in the way we enjoy power and electricity.  We must also invest in the linkage between power generation and the transport sector, which is the problem sector with regard to growth in emissions over the past ten years.</P>
        <P>The reason the issue of transport emissions is relevant to this Bill is that Bord G&aacute;is has the capacity to make a positive contribution in that sector if is allowed borrow money to do that.  When the State does not have the money to invest in the area &mdash; unlike the position for the past ten or 15 years before we got to where we are now &mdash; we must facilitate successful, efficient and ambitious State-owned companies, particularly those with CEOs like the CEO of Bord G&aacute;is who understands the principles of sustainable energy, and encourage them to borrow responsibly to drive this issue and support the policies being brought forward by the Minister, but which he does not have the capacity to drive with his Department&rsquo;s budget or that of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is needs to and will compete with the ESB, not only in power generation with a conventional plant, like that being built in Whitegate which is a new power plant that will be driven by gas, but also in the renewable sector.  The projected capital expenditure of Bord G&aacute;is up to 2011 demonstrates this is an area Bord G&aacute;is is taking seriously.  It must be encouraged to continue along this line.</P>
        <P>The role of Bord G&aacute;is may expand even further.  I would like to explore with the Minister the need to try and link the energy and transport sectors.  The Minister will need to work with the Minister for Transport on this.  I am aware the Minister has been speaking to companies <Col N="26"/>like Better Place and others in order to try and promote electric vehicles.  He should take an ambitious approach towards making a seismic shift in the way our transport system works.  We should move away from petrol and diesel as our main fuels towards electricity, gas, bio-diesel and ethanol, but the bio-fuels are small players in comparison to what could be achieved by the shift to electricity and gas.</P>
        <P>The models exist for us to make this shift.  If we could make this change successfully, we could shift the emissions obligation from the non-traded sector for which the State has responsibility into the traded sector where energy generators will trade in an emissions trading scheme with other large emitting companies across Europe.  This kind of radical thinking is needed if we are to meet the targets set out for us.</P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is can play a significant role in providing the power, gas or electricity that will be required to power up to 50% of our car fleet over the next ten years and to make the shift from diesel and petrol engines to electric engines.  It can achieve this shift in a convenient way for consumers.  This would be preferable to messing around with small pilot projects such as free parking for small electric vehicles or recharge points at St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green or wherever.</P>
        <P>This must happen on a massive scale to make the kind of impact that is possible regarding Ireland&rsquo;s emissions.  The Minister has considered the models that are being proposed in Israel, Denmark and certain regions of Australia.  I refer to the Better Place model which, while it is not the only model extant, constitutes a good starting point.  The management of Bord G&aacute;is, who can see the potential in this field, should be encouraged by the Department to consider such options aggressively and ambitiously, as well as the borrowing that would be required to facilitate it.</P>
        <P>Moreover, engines in the transport sector that are driven by gas alone should be considered.  For example, why not set a target whereby, from the start of 2010 onwards, all our public transport vehicles would be operated in a carbon-neutral manner either by gas or electricity?  Bus &Eacute;ireann or Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann should then be told to make this happen.  They should ensure the buses they buy thereafter all were carbon-neutral in respect of emissions.  The State companies, such as Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, should lead by example and work with Bord G&aacute;is to try to facilitate this and make it happen.</P>
        <P>As for gas pricing, the decision on whether gas prices will increase further in January should rule this out.  I believe that before the end of this month, Bord G&aacute;is will request that there be no increase.  If this is the case, one could argue that domestic gas prices should be reduced from January onwards.  I encourage the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to discuss the matter with the regulator in an attempt to facilitate such a reduction.  The Commission for Energy Regulation has a responsibility to Bord G&aacute;is and the ESB to ensure fair pricing to enable those companies to survive, prosper and make necessary investments.  Equally however, it also has a responsibility to consumers and businesses to ensure energy and gas is as cheap as possible to enable Ireland to remain competitive.  I am unsure the commission is taking this responsibility as seriously as it should.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution on this important legislation, the Gas (Amendment) Bill 2008.  It is great to see such interest in D&aacute;il business demonstrated in the Gallery although unfortunately I do not have any cousins or relations in Stradbally, County Laois.  Nevertheless, it still is good that such interest is being demonstrated.  I am sure the Minister&rsquo;s heart is as gladdened as mine.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on his work and am proud of what he is doing.  Given the comments of Deputy Coveney and others, I sense the Opposition also is reasonably satisfied by his actions.  Deputy <Col N="27"/>Coveney should not attack me as I merely was interpreting his speech.  However, it is welcome that Members are positive regarding legislation on an issue that concerns everyone.  Deputy Coveney made a good point about a partnership approach in government.  Undoubtedly, the business under discussion falls within the remit of both the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and his ministerial colleagues in the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Social and Family Affairs and Transport, as noted by the previous speaker.  It is important to make this point.  Recently, as Vice Chairman of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, I have had the opportunity to welcome a number of groups before the joint committee to discuss issues that are of concern to them pertaining to this Bill&rsquo;s remit, to which I will refer later.</P>
        <P>In considering the Bill, I contemplated my family history from the perspective of how energy and everything relating to it have evolved through my lifetime.  I am a Dubliner of a generation that remembers different modes of transport.  I even remember horse-drawn vehicles and how heating was a greater challenge than it is at present.  For example, as a small child I remember how my grandmother put coats on our bed to keep us warm.  I should note that I look back on such times highly positively.  Nevertheless, the Minister is aware that I am concerned about our future direction in respect of energy provision and costs.  I wonder what will have happened in respect of energy and related issues in 50 years&rsquo; time, when I presume most of those present, with the exception of the people in the Gallery, will not be here.  In fairness to the Minister, he understands this challenge.  Members should focus on the point that what they do now will be important for future generations.  Even in these challenging economic times, it is appropriate for the Government to make decisions and to create a vision for the future, even the distant future.</P>
        <P>I note the Bill was published to amend section 23 of the Gas Act 1976, as amended, to provide for an increase in the statutory borrowing limit of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann from &euro;1.7 billion to &euro;3 billion.  The Bill, which I understand was published by the Minister on 12 November 2008, is short, comprising two sections.  Its sole objective is to increase the statutory borrowing limit of the company.  It is hoped, subject to normal procedures, that the Bill will complete all Stages in the House.  While researching that point, I was interested to learn that the Christmas recess in the House is set for 18 December.</P>
        <P>It also is important to understand that connections to the gas network have grown in number from 412,000 in 2002 to more than 570,000 at present.  I noted the counties now connected to the gas network include Cork, Limerick, Tipperary, Clare, Waterford, Galway, Mayo, Louth, Meath, Wicklow, Kilkenny, Carlow, Laois, Offaly, Kildare, Westmeath, Monaghan, Cavan, Derry, Antrim, Down, Armagh and my native Dublin.  When people learned I intended to contribute on this Bill, they asked how I proposed to slip Tallaght into the debate.  Even though this natural resource is present in neither Tallaght nor Dublin as a whole, Dubliners are major consumers and this point should be noted.</P>
        <P>Previously, I mentioned my role on the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs.  It is important to deviate from the direct provisions of the Bill, to which I will return later, to discuss the challenges regarding fuel poverty in particular.  The Minister will be interested to learn that, under the chairmanship of Deputy Healy-Rae, a range of interest groups have appeared before the joint committee.  The sessions, some of which I chaired, included meetings with the Combat Poverty Agency, the Institute of Public Health in Ireland, Sustainable Energy Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Age Action Ireland and others.  It was important to provide such groups with an opportunity to come before the joint committee.  As chairman of an Oireachtas joint committee, the Acting Chairman is aware of the importance of facilitating groups which, like Members, have the interests of the public at heart.  Such groups are facilitated to enable them to raise their concerns with Members.  In fairness to the aforementioned <Col N="28"/>groups, they would admit the joint committee members were aware of the issues they raised.  Nevertheless, it was useful to hear their presentations and to hear them articulate the issues that are of great concern to people.  Energy provision and fuel poverty issues are matters to which those organisations have paid particular attention.</P>
        <P>I often have stated, to paraphrase the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, that at a time when all boats are rising, one must remember the little boats.  Those Members who are particularly committed to social inclusion certainly always have made this point.  At present, we are in different and challenging times in which we face a global recession.  At times when one is afraid to turn on the radio or Sky News and when all boats are struggling, one must remember the little boats.  It is important the Government should continue to do this and I already have referred to the various Departments that have a clear role to play in this respect.   The Minister will support this statement.  Where fuel poverty poses challenges and concerns for families, I hope we will continue to pay attention.</P>
        <P>At the most recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, a number of members referred to the presence of the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is and put on record our acknowledgement of the fact that, while those companies must keep an eye on the bottom line, they are sympathetic towards families in difficulty.  Ways should always be found to ensure services are not cut off from families in need.  When my co-workers and I contact the companies directly from my busy Tallaght constituency office, they show sympathy.  I appeal to them to continue working with families in difficulty to ensure people are not left without fuel or energy.  I expect the support of many in saying this.  During a presentation, Age Action Ireland was keen to stress this point.  I am proud of Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s record of taking care of the vulnerable and families in need over many decades.  It is important we do so given the issues of fuel poverty and energy provision.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The point on public transport is interesting.  The previous speaker referred to the need for the Minister to have a relationship with the Department of Transport in respect of issues at the top of his list of priorities.  I support the Minister in this regard.  I make a small contribution, as I do my best to come to work on public transport, particularly the Luas.  However, I must sometimes use my car.  For example, I came to work this morning through Ballyfermot.  If the Acting Chairman tells no one, I will tell him that I had the opportunity to open a new Iceland store in Ballyfermot on behalf of a Tallaght-based company.  People must wonder why I was in Ballyfermot, but it was a great day for job creation in difficult times.  I needed to use my car in this instance, but it is important that we try to use public transport.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Perhaps the Minister will report me to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, for not deciding on how to deal with the cycling initiative.  As some Deputies know, I try to keep fit &mdash; I am looking at Deputy Deenihan when I say that I do not jog &mdash; because I had a health scare approximately nine years ago.  However, I have not reached the point of using a bicycle.  Those who drive to Tallaght know that, given the inclining road, cycling to there would not be easy. </P>
        <P>This morning, I listened to a debate on cycling on Pat Kenny&rsquo;s radio programme.  While it may be two-faced of me, I support the opinion that people should get on their bicycles.  The Minister is cycling and I saw his colleague, Deputy Gormley, cycling through the gate last night.  People sometimes guffaw, but it is important that bicycles be used, given the issues of public health and the environment.  Perhaps I should take on the challenge of cycling to work.  I will try to follow the green agenda.</P>
        <P>A number of groups met the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs in respect of fuel poverty.  The Minister shares the responsibility with a number of his colleagues, but it is <Col N="29"/>important we continue to focus on the issues.  In other debates, reference was made to the question of a fuel allowance.  I am pleased with the progress made in this regard and I will continue to campaign to have the Minister for Social and Family Affairs consider the challenges posed by that aspect of Government policy.  We should try to help those who need assistance with fuel bills.</P>
        <P>The current fuel policy is to pay for 30 weeks, an increase on last year&rsquo;s amount of 29 weeks.  The value of the allowance has been increased to &euro;18 and approximately 300,000 households are in receipt of it at a cost of &euro;156 million per annum.  It is positive that expenditure has been increased, but fuel poverty is a structural problem and often relates to heating systems and housing quality.</P>
        <P>Recently, I read a report that referred to the fuel allowance as heating the sky.  The Minister understands this claim better than I.  It was made on the basis that, when someone buys and burns a bag of coal, the heat efficiency of which is 20%, 80% of the value dissipates.  It is like pouring water in a bucket with a large hole at the bottom.  It will not fill up because there is a structural problem that must be fixed.  This highlights the need for a multifaceted response from the housing authorities, which is South Dublin County Council in my case, the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the energy authorities and the social welfare groups.</P>
        <P>The Minister will agree that each Department has a vested interest.  For example, the Department of Social and Family Affairs would be keen on the savings achieved through improvements in the basic problem.  Similarly, other interests would have improved benefits were the problem addressed.  There is a strong case for the Departments and Ministers to put their heads together to determine what can be done.  I suspect the Department of Social and Family Affairs might argue that it is not the lead Department, in which case the matter will be open to question.  At the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, I took the initiative and asked to have correspondence sent to the different Departments to ensure the issue is addressed.  I ask the Minister for his support in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The fuel allowance is a household payment and, as it is means tested, only some households are eligible.  In recent years, many Members have witnessed a greater reliance on the fuel allowance as a policy instrument, but there are those who argue that the policy is flawed in terms of poverty traps and who can benefit.  There are limits to what one can expect from a fuel allowance as a policy response.  Increasing mainline welfare payments might be a better approach.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, will wrestle with this suggestion.  It is important that all of our eggs are not placed in one basket.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope I am getting across the message that, while the Bill might seem simple on first reading, it is also important.  As the debate has evolved, we have been able to express the different points of view and relevant issues.  The opportunity to do so has been vital.  It is good the Minister has been able to stay in the House and listen to contributions.  He will be encouraged by our across-the-floor support for his attempts.  At the same time, however, everyone has highlighted the challenges that exist and the fact that an integrated approach should be adopted by the Government Department with an interest in this matter.  I often wonder how this issue will be dealt with in 50 years' time.  In that context, we owe it to future generations to take an interest in it.</P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s need for an increase in its statutory borrowing limit has been brought about by the continued growth in the scale of its business.  The company will reach its current statutory borrowing limit early in 2009.  An increase in this limit is required in order that the company might continue to fund its capital expenditure programme over the next five years. <Col N="30"/> The programme to which I refer includes the ongoing expansion of the company&rsquo;s core gas business and its development as a major energy company.</P>
        <P>It is important that the Minister should achieve his goal of having the Bill passed by both Houses before the end of this session.  As already stated, Bord G&aacute;is&rsquo;s borrowing limit is expected to be reached early in the new year.  The company clearly needs to obtain access to the funds necessary for the proper development of its business in the competitive market in which it operates.</P>
        <P>During the course of my contribution, I did not refer to any great extent to my constituency.  However, I am always happy to represent the people of Dublin South-West, including those who live in Tallaght, Greenhills, Firhouse, Templeogue, Bohernabreena and Brittas.  Deputy Deenihan knows Tallaght well.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share five minutes of my time with Deputy Deenihan.</P>
        <P>This Bill, which amends existing legislation, will increase Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s borrowing limit to &euro;3 billion from &euro;1.7 billion and allow the company to fund its expansion plans.  The natural gas distributor and supplier is expected to reach its current borrowing limit early in 2009 and requires further cash to fund a five year capital spending programme, which will ultimately alter its profile.</P>
        <P>Since 2002 Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s remit has been the expansion of the gas transmission and distribution network nationwide.  For most parts of the country, this has held true.  Unfortunately, however, Fianna F&aacute;il cronyism intervened some years ago in respect of my constituency, Longford-Westmeath, and we are not holding our breath in respect of a proposed phase 3 link-up.  I wish to place on the record of the House the fact that Longford-Westmeath has been shamefully disregarded in respect of the gas expansion scheme and has, to the detriment of its economic development, suffered from protracted Government neglect.</P>
        <P>In 2002, the now Taoiseach intervened in the proposals and despite the existence of a firm commitment and a system designed for the purpose, the pipeline did not come through the Longford-Edgeworthstown- Mullingar region as promised.  Instead, it was quietly and mysteriously diverted to Clara, County Offaly &mdash; the Taoiseach&rsquo;s homeland &mdash; among other areas.</P>
        <P>In 2006, Bord G&aacute;is, as directed by the Commission for Energy Regulator, CER, implemented a new gas connections policy to determine the economic viability of connecting towns to the gas network, either on their own or as a part of a regional group.  Longford, Edgeworthstown and Mullingar would have fitted the bill in this regard.  Longford is now under consideration for the final phase &mdash; phase 3.  It has again been place on the hind tit by this Fianna F&aacute;il Government, which has brought such devastation to our county in recent years under the watch of Deputy Kelly.</P>
        <P>As early as 2002 there was considerable anger among public representatives, those in the business community and members of the public following confirmation that neither the town <Col N="31"/>nor the county would be connected to the natural gas network in the immediate future.  This blow to the economic well-being of the region came in the wake of years of lobbying to bring natural gas to Longford, in the interests of local people and to encourage inward investment.  Despite promises and the fact that the system had been designed to accommodate a spur from the planned Galway ring main, we were disappointed.</P>
        <P>At that time, a Bord G&aacute;is statement said detailed engineering and technical evaluation of Longford town was ongoing and, pending an economic viability study, the area would receive a gas supply by the beginning of 2004.  That deadline passed almost five years ago, which is extremely disappointing.  The people of Longford are still waiting to be connected to the national gas network.  The news of the sell-out on this particular commitment was broken to the Longford Chamber of Commerce by, of all people, the then Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke, who as usual failed to deliver for the people of the midlands.  Nonetheless, she managed to bring home the bacon to Athlone.  There are no prizes for guessing from where Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke comes.</P>
        <P>The spur to which I refer would have been a huge boost to Longford-Westmeath which is part of the under-funded BMW region.  During the period in question, the cost to businesses of using gas was 25% lower than that which applied in respect of other forms of energy.  The BMW region and, particularly in this case, Longford-Westmeath were placed at a considerable disadvantage.  Contrary to expectations in 2002, Mullingar was also left out of the loop.  The only provision made was the putting in place of a spur to Athlone.</P>
        <P>The ill feeling people in Longford and Mullingar experienced almost seven years ago in respect of this issue has not abated.  In light of the current economic climate, we are experiencing even greater disadvantages as a result of the failure to run a spur into the county.  The cost of bringing natural gas to Longford &mdash; which is only 25 miles from Athlone &mdash; in 2002 would have been &euro;16 million.  The failure to do so shows that someone was extremely shortsighted at the time.</P>
        <P>As a result of what happened in my constituency, where stand Government plans for regional development?  Not only has County Longford failed to obtain a supply of natural gas, it was also omitted from the national spatial strategy and recently suffered the loss of Connolly Barracks in Longford town, the court service in Granard and Cardinal Health, which was supposed to bring 1,300 jobs to the county.  A number of small businesses have gone to the wall during the term of office of this Fianna F&aacute;il Government.</P>
        <P>The latest commitment to be given is that Longford is under consideration for phase 3 connection, with a report on the matter due in January 2009.  In light of the fact that phase 2B of Longford-Westmeath General Hospital has been promised for the past 12 years &mdash; some &euro;57 million was ring-fenced in respect of this project in the run-up to the 2002 general election but it has not been progressed &mdash; I have particular suspicions about the phased system.  As we have seen in respect of the hospital to which I refer, Government policy is now to divide phases into sub-phases, thereby delaying completion to a ludicrous degree.  Promises are cheap and, as everyone is aware, under this Government, delivery is a moveable feast.</P>
        <P>The numbers on the live register are rising.  In Longford alone, there has been a 47% increase in unemployment during the past 12 months.  Businesses in the midlands have been particularly hard hit by recent events and require every possible advantage to survive.  The necessary incentives must be put in place to encourage inward investment into the area.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, under the provision of extended borrowing power granted by this Bill, intends expanding its business to become a dual electricity and gas supplier to private consumers and businesses and will, through these developments, compete with other companies such as the ESB and Scottish Southern.  Also, we are told, it intends to invest heavily in renewable energy projects.</P><Col N="32"/>
        <P>The Bord G&aacute;is strategy is, according to the Minister, in line with the three pillars of energy policy, namely, security of supply, competitiveness and environmental sustainability, an area of particular concern to me.  I welcome any initiative that will increase our environmental sustainability profile.  The decision to facilitate a further 3,900 MW of renewable power to the national grid by 2020 will help to ensure that Ireland meets the recently announced renewable target of 40% of electricity consumption from renewable sources by 2020.  There are currently 1,300 MW of renewable power in the system.  The total installed capacity from diverse power sources currently stands at 7,800 MW and the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, has described the effort towards renewable energy as a positive and ambitious strategy that will lead to a reduction in Ireland&rsquo;s reliance on fossil fuels for power generation.</P>
        <P>The Gate 3 connection initiative is a commitment to the development of renewable energy that will facilitate the tackling of climate change in Ireland, which to date has not made the required progress under the current Government and which has, by and large, ignored its commitments to the Kyoto targets.  We must, of course, not forget to highlight the increasing cost of gas for domestic and business users, the cost of which rose by 21.3% for domestic use, and that business tariffs will increase by up to 27.1% for heavy users, as outlined by Bord G&aacute;is a few months ago with further increases due in January.  It appears Bord G&aacute;is is being granted a dual mandate of funding increases, in terms of increased loan capacity and increased charges, at the expense of the consumer.</P>
        <P>Looking at the broader picture of power provision, particularly in terms of sustainability, progress is being made on a countrywide basis but this could, unfortunately, be a case of too little to late.  Such green initiatives from the wilting Green Party is progress.  Natural gas provision for Longford-Westmeath remains an extremely contentious issue which could now, more than ever, given the current economic climate, decide the viability of Longford-Westmeath and is a matter requiring urgent resolve.</P>
        <P>I plead with the Minister, on behalf of my constituents in Longford-Westmeath, to ensure this spur is expedited as quickly as possible.  What is happening under the current Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government is detrimental to the people of Longford.  I have been contacted by more young people in the past three to four months in regard to their obtaining visas to get out of the area owing to a lack of job opportunities in the midlands, which is shameful and disgraceful.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, on his election as Leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party was seen as the white dove of hope for the midlands.  However, this is no longer the case in the counties of Longford-Westmeath, Laois or Offaly.  People feel completely let down by him and the manner in which he is running the affairs of this State.</P>

        <P>While we are in challenging times in terms of energy supply, we are also in exciting times.  I am heartened by what I have heard recently in regard to alternatives.  While we often fail in this House to be magnanimous as regards people on the Government side, I would like to <Col N="33"/>recognise the overall approach of the Minister for Communication, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan to energy development and his accessibility to those of us with ideas in this area.</P>
        <P>I am particularly heartened by the fact that a group from the Silicon Valley is visiting Ireland and is to hold a major seminar in Trinity College.  The group met earlier with the President and will meet later this evening with the Taoiseach who will make an address at their dinner.  The group concerned is considering applying its technology to green energy given the abundance of sun in California.  More and more companies are being set up to harness this advantage.  Much of the noise in the Silicon Valley at the moment is in regard to green energy, alternative sources and so on.  It is hoped this group will meet like-minded people and the Minister while here.  One man has a major project for the Shannon Estuary and will attend the announcement to be made tomorrow at 10 a.m. in Government Buildings.  It is hoped something good will come out of this initiative.</P>
        <P>County Kerry has many options to offer be it wave, tidal or wind energy.  This is one area where we can make considerable progress.  I was heartened to read last Thursday the announcement by the Commission for Energy Regulation that it is proposing to facilitate a further 3,900 MW of renewal power to the national grid by 2020, which is a long time away.  It is hoped that deadline can be brought forward.  However, the announcement is positive.  This decision will facilitate the connection of an additional 3,900 MW of mostly wind-generated power to the electricity system and will ensure that Ireland can meet the recently announced renewable target of 40% of electricity consumption from renewable sources by 2020.  I believe this is realisable provided the will exists to do so and people can get connections to the grid.  Currently there are approximately 1,300 MW of renewable power in the system.  This will increase to 6,700 MW by 2020, which is to be welcomed.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I welcome the Bill.  As Deputy Coveney stated, Fine Gael supports it.  Bord G&aacute;is is an exemplary, well-run, profitable company.  It has always done its work right as is the case in regard to the ESB.  These are State companies of which we should all be proud.  This provision will enable Bord G&aacute;is to roll out its proposed capital expenditure of more than &euro;1.5 million over the next four years.  I am heartened that &euro;700 million of this money will be spent on the development of the gas networks and include extension of the networks to parts of the country not currently being serviced.  An article in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> identified certain towns in County Kerry that would benefit from the roll-out.  On 10 May, Bord G&aacute;is announced it was considering 34 towns for connection to the natural gas network, including Killarney, Tralee, Listowel and Newcastle West.  I ask that consideration be given to these towns in light of their dependence on the tourism industry and their significant energy needs.  Gas would provide an alternative energy option for many operators.  By making gas available to Kerry Group, the viability of this major Listowel based industry would be strengthened.</P>
        <P>Shannon LNG presents the prospect of an exciting development for the Shannon landbank.  I am aware that concerns about the development have been expressed locally but I hope these will be allayed so that the project can proceed.  The terminal has been cleared but issues remain in respect of the pipeline.  If the pipeline is approved after a hearing by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in Listowel, the Shannon LNG plant can be connected to the national grid at Aughinis in Askeaton.  It would offer another means of improving supply in this country, thereby making us less vulnerable if our existing interconnectors closed.  When Shannon LNG is up and running, it will meet a large proportion of our energy needs.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, I met representatives of Tarbert Island generating station who were on their way to meet the Spanish company that has purchased the plant from the ESB.  This is a welcome <Col N="34"/>development because when the ESB announced its intention to close the plant we were concerned about the future for its 127 employees.  It is hoped that a large number of these jobs will be retained.  The station will be upgraded and possibly converted to gas and, if Shannon LNG is in operation one mile downstream from the station, supplies will be readily available.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the development of wind energy is not a simple process.  However it is important in the national interest to give hope to people such as the investor from the Silicon Valley who has the money and a project ready to roll out but cannot proceed  without access to the grid.</P>
        <P>The country faces major economic challenges but these are exciting times in the area of energy because we are being forced to consider alternatives to oil.  We are all in this together and, when it comes to renewables, I welcome that the Government is listening to Members on this side of the House, and particularly those of us who are involved in significant renewable projects.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Chris Andrews.  I welcome this Bill and note the positive reaction it has brought from all sides of the House.</P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is refutes the tiresome clich&eacute; that the private sector is a model of competence and efficiency whereas the public sector is a model of the opposite.  I was a customer of the old Dublin Gas Company and, as an official in the late 1970s and early 1980s, had some responsibility for energy matters.  Governments of all types went to enormous lengths to prop up the private Dublin Gas Company, which was inefficient and required subsidies.  These efforts were ultimately unsuccessful and the company was nationalised in 1987.  Bord G&aacute;is is a vast improvement on its previous incarnation.  I pay tribute to this company not only for extending the network and operating more efficiently but also for the substantial dividends it has paid to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Gas is an attractive and efficient fuel.  It will not solve the problem of road transport but it has a role to play in electricity generation, heating and industry.  It is the ideal fuel in many ways because it comes via a pipeline and does not require transport or special delivery.  It is clean, has a good safety record and is not in unduly short supply.  At current estimates, gas reserves are probably much greater than oil and other hydrocarbons.  It is also an environmentally-friendly fuel, which makes it superior to coal for electricity generation from that point of view.  I recall the debates of 20 and 30 years ago regarding the appropriateness of gas for electricity production given its high wastage rates.  Perhaps, however, environmental considerations take precedence over strict energy efficiency calculations.  Gas turbines are particularly useful from the point of view of peaks in demand.  The previous speaker addressed the issue of wind turbines, the output of which is variable.  It is necessary not only to generate sufficient electricity for base load demand but also to meet peaks.</P>
        <P>With minimal exceptions due to weather and, in the past, industrial disputes, energy providers have ensured security of supply in Ireland.  I recognise, however, that we have been living somewhat dangerously recently in terms of our high growth rates.   I assume the fact we are now in recession means the pressure on energy supplies will be rather less than it was when we had high single-digit growth.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I very much welcome what Bord G&aacute;is is doing to upgrade the existing network for domestic supply which is improving safety.  Avoiding leakage improves safety, reliability and efficiency.  I commend it for that work.  I am also very supportive of the extension of the national grid to more parts of the country.  When Kinsale gas came on stream, we started with a quite limited network, involving Dublin, Cork and some towns in the south east.  That is gradually extending <Col N="35"/>to more towns throughout the country.  Clonmel was one of the first towns to be connected in 1987, following the construction of the Cork to Dublin pipeline.  As it is an important business and industrial centre, it was of great benefit to residents, and business and industry.  Carrick-on-Suir benefited from 1998 and what is effectively a new town built around the small village of Ballyclerahan in the vicinity of Clonmel was also connected in 2003.</P>
        <P>I read remarks attributed to Deputy Coonan from north Tipperary, an area for which I am not directly responsible, suggesting that there were no towns in north Tipperary that were connected to the gas network.  That is not strictly accurate, but he may have been misreported.  Ballina was connected in 1998 and Newport in 1999.  However, I accept that some of the major towns in north Tipperary are not connected and need to be.</P>
        <P>Natural gas has become available since last month in Cashel.  I was supposed to carry out the turning on ceremony that day.  However, pressure of business not to mention the Opposition in the D&aacute;il, prevented me from attending that event.  The cost of the construction project was &euro;4.7 million.  Cahir, which along with Cashel benefits from being on the new Dublin to Cork motorway, is scheduled for connection in 2009.</P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is now seems to have an active policy to utilise its gas network better throughout the country and pursue growth opportunities for extensions to other towns.  It is easier to connect towns that are close to the existing network, which is extending outwards.  I understand that Tipperary town, which is probably the only major town in the south riding not connected, and Thurles, which is in the north of the county, will be considered for connection under phase 3 of the new towns analysis.  This report is due for publication early in the new year.  I am sure the people and businesses of both County Tipperary towns would warmly welcome such a development, which is long overdue.  In a semi-private capacity as a civil servant dealing with energy matters, I remember giving a talk about natural gas in Tipperary in 1981.  A long time has passed since then.  As in many of these matters, it is better late than never.</P>
        <P>In an official capacity I first became involved in Northern Ireland and North-South co-operation through the issue of gas.  In the late 1970s there was a question of Kinsale gas being piped to the North.  Indeed a deal was negotiated by Albert Reynolds when he was Minister for Industry and Energy in 1982 with Adam Butler, who was a junior Minister in the North.  Unfortunately Mr. Reynolds struck such a good deal that two years later Margaret Thatcher vetoed it and it did not proceed.  Since then in much more recent times, the ESB has also been involved through the Coolkeeragh project.  Those connections have been established from North to South, from Northern Ireland to Scotland and also directly from Scotland to the east coast of this State.  There is another connection &mdash; I am not sure if it has happened or is about to happen &mdash; across to Letterkenny in County Donegal.</P>
        <P>Associated with the Corrib gas project will be the connection of towns in the west and north west where there has been a very significant gap in the map.  Like everybody else I would hope that before too much longer there will be a resolution of that dispute.  Efforts at mediation are taking place.  All of us accept it was badly handled at the beginning.  The State has a very strong strategic interest in getting it operational from the point of view of security of supply.  I hope that dialogue with some of the groups in what has become a very embittered dispute will lead to a resolution.  While there are local rights, the entire country has an interest in it coming to fruition because it will reduce our proportion of imported energy.  Matters other than safety have come into play in this matter.  Some people want to raise the issue of conditions of supply, taxation and so on.  People sometimes talk in terms as if we were like Norway &mdash; we are not.  We are not in a position to dictate conditions.  Recently there has been a tightening of conditions for future supplies.</P><Col N="36"/>
        <P>I refer to the importance of energy conservation, not least in State-owned buildings.  The system for monitoring consumption in place in buildings requires attention.  We need to be concerned not merely about security of supply, but also efficient usage of the energy we have.  We need to be economical in going about that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ChrisAndrews"><NameTxt>Deputy Chris Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak.  The purpose of the Bill is to increase the statutory borrowing limit of Bord G&aacute;is from &euro;1.7 billion to &euro;3 billion.  I wholeheartedly support its speedy passage through the D&aacute;il.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann has clearly performed very strongly in 2007 and revenues were up 10% on 2006 figures to &euro;1.2 billion.  Connections to the gas network have grown from 402,000 in 2002 to more than 570,000 today.  As a previous speaker mentioned, there may be difficult times in the economy in general but there are great opportunities and challenges within the energy sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The increase in the borrowing limit is required in order that Bord G&aacute;is can continue to fund its capital expenditure programme over the next five years.  This capital expenditure includes, among other issues, the expansion of its core gas business and its development as a company.  It is important that Bord G&aacute;is is able to engage in expansion.  In recent months we have been reminded of just how important it is for us to have security of energy supply.  Ireland is a small energy market on the edge of Europe, with a very limited indigenous supply of energy - a position this Government is committed to changing.  It will not happen overnight.</P>
        <P>Over 70% of our energy is imported and we depend on external sources.  It is imperative that we protect our own resources in a sustainable way.  Russian troops still remain in Georgia after the conflict there, which reminds us geopolitics could potentially endanger continued supply.  During the week we have seen the hijacking of an oil tanker by Somali pirates, which had an immediate impact on the price of oil.  The commodity&rsquo;s value is balanced very delicately and it does not take much to disrupt it.  To ensure we have a proper, well-managed and proactive system in dealing with energy is very important.</P>
        <P>It is said one only misses things when they are gone.  On a recent visit to the Gaza Strip it was evident Israelis had restrictions on fuel and power coming through to the ordinary families and people working there.  One could see how important energy is and how a restriction on the flow of energy can have an effect.  When we visited there were power cuts, which caused chaos for the people relying on fuel, energy and power.  We visited a hospital and could see first hand an impact where babies were in incubators.  When there were power cuts the incubators could not be heated, which had a detrimental effect on the children.</P>
        <P>No more than in Gaza, if we have difficulty with our power supply for some reason, it would have significant impact on ordinary people&rsquo;s lives.  It is very important that we protect the supply.</P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is has performed strongly over the years.  Environmental sustainability is a cornerstone of the Government&rsquo;s energy policy framework and I strongly advocate continued investment in renewable and alternative energy supply.  Development of renewables will enable us to meet our greenhouse emission targets, as well as improving energy security, which as I have said is very important.  Bord G&aacute;is has a commitment to investment in this area, which I welcome.  I commend the Bill to the House and urge other Members to do so also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill as a contribution to increasing the capacity of one of the most successful public enterprises in this State.  It is also hoped that the increased activity of Bord G&aacute;is in the energy sector will provide a much needed boost to the economy and to employment in general at the current time.  There are, however, a number of points that need <Col N="37"/>to be made on the whole issue of energy in this country, and in particular with regard to the gas reserves which lie, for the greater part unused, off our coast.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P Just="Left">There are estimates, including one from the petroleum affairs division of the Department, that 10 billion barrels of oil are lying off the west coast of Ireland, valued at an astonishing $700 billion dollars at the price of $70 per barrel.  That is in addition to a natural gas reserve, estimated to be 50 trillion cu. ft., sufficient to supply the whole of western Europe for some time.  Some 200 km off the coast of Kerry lies the Dunquin gas field, which is estimated to contain 25 trillion cu. ft. of natural gas and 4.13 billion barrels of oil.  The gas alone would meet our gas needs, at present consumption levels, for the next 62 years.  Dunquin is licensed to Exxon and partners, who estimate it will come on stream after 2013.</P>
        <P>Off the coast of Clare there is the Spanish Point field with known reserves of 1.25 trillion cu. ft. of gas and 206 million barrels of oil, valued at &euro;30 billion.  That is hoped to begin production in 2011 with the gas piped ashore.  Off the coast of Mayo is the Corrib field, which has an estimated value of anywhere between &euro;12 billion and &euro;100 billion.  That does not include the Porcupine Bank, where exploration was carried out a number of years ago and other fields off the west and east coast of the country.</P>
        <P>Although this is good news, particularly at the present time of economic uncertainty and concerns over energy supplies, we need to be concerned over the manner in which this huge resource will be developed and the benefits that it will bring to the Irish people.  Unfortunately, because of the ludicrous and indeed dubious deal handed to the multinationals in 1992 the people of Ireland would gain very little from our oil and gas wealth under the current arrangements.  Tax rates are extremely low and most of the current 25% tax on profits can be written off against exploration and operating costs.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that the Minister was successful in having a new rate of tax of 40% introduced but this rate only applies to new exploration licences and does not cover the existing oil and gas licences over which most of our reserves are currently held.  It should be extended to all licences to ensure that when the gas and oil comes on stream, it provides, as it can, a huge revenue boost to the country with all the implications that would have, especially during an international economic downturn.  It is possible to renegotiate deals that were carried out in the 1990s up to the latest tax increase to 40%, and this should be proactively pursued.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to offshore development, there are knock-on effects, particularly to employment in supply ships from shore taking supplies to rigs, stand-by vessels for safety issues, on-shore drilling supplies, transport and equipment taken to and from ports.  This affects the local economy and there would be a long-term benefit when the line is brought onshore.  This is very significant and should not be lost as we pursue our objectives.</P>
        <P>We have many benefits for those looking to offshore exploration.  There is the significant advantage of political stability, particularly compared to places which house most of the energy reserves such as the Middle East, which can be very unstable.  We have a highly educated and trained work force and many people in our coastal communities have in the past or currently work in offshore exploration.  We have the necessary ports.  This could generate significant revenue in local economies and be beneficial for Irish industry and domestic holdings.</P>
        <P>There is also the potential that the development of oil and gas can have to establish security of supply.  At present we import 85% of our energy needs, and we are also at the end of a supply line that extends all the way from Russia across western Europe, Britain and Ireland.  This makes future supply dependent on all sorts of factors which are outside of our control.  Our oil and gas reserves are a factor which we can control if we wish to.</P>

        <asker>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</asker>
        <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</askee>
        <Quest>  if he has had discussions with the Arts Council since budget 2009 on the implications of the cuts on venues, events and artists as well as on Arts Council staff numbers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[41832/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, under measures introduced in the 2009 budget, all Departments and State agencies are to achieve a range of reductions and savings in 2009, both on pay and non-pay expenditure, and the Arts Council is no exception.  These include a 3% reduction in the level of its 2008 pay bill, while also meeting the cost of the recently negotiated second pay agreement under Towards 2016, and at least a 50% reduction in its consultancy and advertising budgets.</P>
        <P>My Department advised the Arts Council of the requirement when informing it of its allocation for next year and is awaiting details from the Arts Council of its proposals to implement the adjustments.  The Arts Council is statutorily independent, under the Arts Act 2003, in its funding decisions and I have no role in funding allocations made by the Council.  I have therefore not discussed 2009 allocations by the Arts Council to individual artists and arts organisations.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism I am committed to securing the best possible funding deal for the Arts Council and the arts sector generally throughout the country.  By any standards, however, the Arts Council has seen dramatic increases in its funding allocation in recent years, increasing by more than 71% from &euro;47.67 million in 2002 to &euro;81.6 million this year.  These are significant amounts of taxpayers&rsquo; money in any context and have effectively transformed the arts, by facilitating increased access to and participation in the full spectrum of art forms throughout the country.  The Government&rsquo;s sustained commitment to the arts is evidenced by the substantial increases in funding, including supplementary funding of &euro;3 million at the end of 2007.  The Government is committed to supporting the arts and will continue to work with the Arts Council as part of its programme to achieve that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s press and media people are to be congratulated on the positive spin they can put on the worst of news.  Unfortunately, the arts community can do sums and it knows how much the reduction is, despite every effort to make it seem as if it was a fraction of 1%.  The actual cut to the Arts Council is 10%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is nothing like that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>No matter how the Minister tries to dress it up the reduction is 10%.  The total reduction is approximately &euro;9 million.</P>
        <P>The Minister indicated he is awaiting a report from the Arts Council.  To all intents and purposes there is not an Arts Council at the moment because since August it has been operating at half strength.  The Minister is aware that five members are needed to form a quorum and it is not always possible to get five people together.  Even if it were, it is unreasonable to expect five or six people to make decisions of that magnitude.  The cuts will cost jobs to individual artists and perhaps result in the closure or temporary closure of venues at weekends or on week days.  There will be a great reduction in activity right around the country as a result of the cuts.  It is unreasonable of the Minister not to have nominated a new chairperson and other <Col N="39"/>members to the council.  Will the Minister indicate when the appointments will be made and whether the Arts Council has been in communication with him in respect of the allocation to the Abbey Theatre, for example?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept what the Deputy said and she would not expect me to.  There should not be any effect on organisations throughout the country.  It has been made clear to the Arts Council that the administrative reduction of 3% in its budget should come from within its own staffing and administrative requirements, which are substantial.  That might be difficult in these times but we all face those realities.  In fairness, most of the people in the arts to whom I spoke said that in spite of the difficulties they are pleased the arts was not used as the whipping boy, so to speak, in terms of taking the brunt of overall Government reductions and that, by and large, in the overall scheme of things they have done fairly well.</P>
        <P>Equally, I do not accept that the Arts Council cannot function at the moment.  It has a quorum and the members should get on with their job instead of waiting around.  It is important they continue to do their work.  They have the capacity to do it and they should move forward.</P>
        <P>It is an independent function of the Arts Council to allocate funding to whichever bodies they wish.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the members will make the decision to allocate the greatly reduced funding they have at their disposal.  No matter how the Minister dresses it up, it is &euro;9 million less than they had last year and only a fraction of the budget is spent on administration, and a fraction of that is to be saved.  Whoever did the spinning for the Minister may have assumed nobody else could do sums but that is not the case.</P>
        <P>When does the Minister intend to appoint a chairperson to the Arts Council?  Is it true the position has been offered and turned down on several occasions?  That is the information I have.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should not believe everything she reads in the newspapers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe everything I read in the newspapers but I would like to hear directly from the Minister when a chairperson of the Arts Council will be appointed.  The last body for which a board was not appointed, namely, the National Archives, has been more or less abolished.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Mitchell well knows that last point is utterly incorrect and I do not accept it.  The allocation to the Arts Council in 2002 was &euro;47.6 million.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>My question was when would the Minister appoint a chairperson.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Mitchell made a comment and I am replying to it.  The allocation next year is &euro;75.708 million.  That is a huge budget by any standard involving substantial funds.  I expect to be in a position to make the announcements with regard to the Arts Council shortly.</P>

        <asker>Deputy Mary Upton</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</askee>
        <Quest>  the progress of the national sports campus; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[41674/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Following the completion of the move by the FAI to the former State Laboratory building at Abbotstown last year, work has been advanced on providing a headquarters for the Irish Institute of Sport.  That involves refurbishing an existing building on <Col N="40"/>the Abbotstown site.  Construction is expected to commence before the end of the year and the Irish Institute of Sport is expected to move into its new headquarters during 2009.</P>
        <P>Following the appointment by the National Sports Campus Development Authority, NSCDA, in April last of project management and design teams, detailed plans for phase one of the campus have been completed by the authority.  The NSCDA expects to apply for planning permission for the campus project before the end of 2008.  The facilities in respect of which the application for planning permission is being prepared are in accordance with the development control plan as originally approved and include a national field sports training centre catering for rugby, soccer, Gaelic games and hockey; a multi-sport national indoor training centre to provide world class training facilities for more than 20 sports; sports science and medical facilities; accommodation for sportsmen and women; and all-weather synthetic pitches for community recreational access.</P>
        <P>I regard the development of the sports campus at Abbotstown as a crucial piece of sporting infrastructure in the support of our athletes as they get ready to represent us in European and World competitions.  I am reviewing with the NSCDA how we might best advance the campus project from 2009 taking into consideration the current difficult economic constraints.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I did some sums also on the funding allocated to arts and sport.  My read is that there is a drop of 8% for them.  That is a substantial cut and is significantly more than in other Departments.  I raise that against the background of what will happen to sport in general and, in particular, to the national sports campus.  Am I correct in thinking that only &euro;4.4 million has been set aside for 2009?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>That will not develop anything like the requirements that are set out.  Where will that leave our commitment, for instance, to the Irish Institute of Sport, to the preparation for the London Olympics and the general enhancement of facilities and support for our elite athletes?  To a certain extent, arts and sport have become the fall guy in the budget.  They were the soft option.  We have to look at what is happening to sport in general in the country and get back to making the commitment that is needed to enhance and support it.</P>
        <P>Let us compare the great sporting achievements in recent days with the lack of achievement in the Olympics.  We must be aware of the importance of sport and also the need to support it.  If we do not support the national sports campus I do not see how we will make any progress.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The athletes would be disappointed with the Deputy&rsquo;s comment on the lack of success at the Olympics.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>In general.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There were a number of successes in terms of best achievements and best times achieved and we won a silver medal and two bronze medals, albeit in one sport, namely, boxing.  Nevertheless, one can never be prescriptive about the sport in which one would like to win medals.  We did win medals and I hope we will win more in 2012, as I am sure does the Deputy.</P>
        <P>Everybody is discounting the cost of the Lansdowne Road redevelopment in my budget.  The State allocated over &euro;191 million therefor.  We are not building stadia such as that at Lansdowne Road every year and it is clear that subtracting a sum such as &euro;191 million from the overall budget results in a significant drop in the Department&rsquo;s capital.  This sets the context for 2009.</P><Col N="41"/>
        <P>We have not engaged in the planning process for the campus yet and it will take a considerable amount of time next year.  That there is not a huge allocation for next year does not mean the project cannot get under way.  By the time the planning and design considerations are cleared, it will probably be very much towards the end of next year.  I would like to see some of the facilities built at Abbotstown.  If we cannot complete the full phase 1 programme, which is unlikely given the current economic climate, we will still be able to work on a number of significant projects, such as the national indoor training centre.  This will provide facilities for over 20 sports.  The hockey facilities are such that teams now have a great shot at doing extremely well in the Olympic Games in 2012.  I am working with the company at Abbotstown to determine how to make progress in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>Although the Minister said there will be a slowdown next year, can I take it there will be a catch-up thereafter?  We would be quite happy with that but it is not the message we are meant to be hearing.  It would be great if there were a catch-up and we could survive without the planning process moving ahead as quickly as hoped if, in the following year, the funds were made available again.  Can we assume this will be the case?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unlikely it will be possible to spend the full &euro;160 million in the next three years.  I do not want to see the project abandoned.  It is too central to the development of sport in this country and the ability to attract many different nations here prior to the 2012 Olympic Games.  The Australians have already made inquiries about the National Aquatic Centre.  They have seen it and believe it is a wonderful facility for swimming, diving and training.  I would like to enhance the aquatic centre site at Abbotstown by providing some more facilities, which I hope will be built over the coming years.  I am considering the cost of this in addition to the structure to ascertain what we can deliver.</P>

        <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</askee>
        <Quest>  his views on the implications for the tourism industry arising from various new measures introduced in budget 2009; his further views on the potential impact such disincentives will have on the number of tourists visiting here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The total allocation for tourism services announced in budget 2009 is &euro;161 million.  The maintenance of this significant allocation for tourism services in 2009 reflects the Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to the development of tourism.  Although there will be marginal reductions in the budgets of the principal tourism agencies, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, these should be largely absorbed by savings in pay, overheads, consultancy and non-programme advertising.</P>
        <P>The tourism marketing fund for 2009 is &euro;48.5 million, which is the same as the amount available for frontline international marketing activities in 2008.  The total is slightly reduced because of once-off expenditure in 2008 on the development of advertising and promotional materials relating to the Tourism Ireland brand.  The allocation for 2009 will enable the tourism agencies, in partnership with industry interests, to continue the Super Regions campaign as well as Discover Ireland&rsquo;s Wonderful West campaign, in line with the commitment given in the Shannon Airport catchment area economic and tourism development plan.  Furthermore, given the overall economic climate, the tourism agencies should also be in a position to negotiate better value in terms of advertising and marketing space.</P>
        <P>F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s allocation of nearly &euro;81 million will, in addition to funding its operations, assist tourism development through business supports and training in conjunction with funding festivals, sports tourism events and domestic marketing.  In 2009, capital funding of &euro;11 million <Col N="42"/>is being provided to support investment in key tourism infrastructure, attractions and visitor facilities.  The allocation for 2009 reflects a careful assessment of the range and quality of applications under F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s tourism capital investment programme in addition to the anticipated draw-down of funds by approved projects in the coming year.  More broadly, the thrust of the Government&rsquo;s budgetary strategy is right for tourism, as it is for other sectors.  It will bring order and stability to our public finances and will enhance our productive capacity.</P>
        <P>In the current difficult international economic environment, the Government has had to make some difficult decisions, both in prioritising expenditure and raising revenue through changes to taxation.  In anticipation of the imminent publication of the Finance Bill by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, it would not be appropriate for me to discuss the implementation of taxation measures that will shortly be considered by the Oireachtas.  I am confident the overall approach in budget 2009 will help the tourism industry, with the other sectors of the economy, to return to sustainable growth in the medium term.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know if the Minister is aware of the latest CSO figures, which indicate that in September visitor numbers from Britain decreased by 17% and visitor numbers from the United States decreased by 10%.  The recession is really beginning to bite.  Given that we know there is a global recession and that the travel industry is contracting, it is very important to retain our market share such that we will have a tourism industry when the recession ends.</P>
        <P>The Minister surely agrees that a &euro;10 departure tax was the last measure needed by the tourism industry, particularly because our Achilles heel is our being an island country.  We depend on the airlines to bring in travellers.  Some 95% of all visitors to the country come by airplane.  Aer Lingus has already announced the tax will cost it &euro;30 million next year.  I am not sure if this figure applies to the whole of next year.  Clearly the airline cannot afford to lose &euro;30 million in addition to the losses it is already expecting.  Surely the tax was not the Minister&rsquo;s idea.  Was he even consulted on it?  If one cared about tourism, it would be the last step one would consider.  The holiday home tax falls into the same category.  Who regarded these taxes as a way to help the tourism industry, which is one of our more important service industries and which, I hope, could be one of our growth industries?  Are they the Minister&rsquo;s idea?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has the luxury of picking on one or two measures.  The reality is that it would be wonderful if in this country we could provide everything for nothing.  We cannot and must have funding in place to provide for everybody and everything.  Of course one would prefer not to have the sort of taxation required but it is fair and balanced.</P>
        <P>The very substantial fee passengers are paying to bring their clothes and toiletries with them is being absorbed without problems.  The fuel surcharges levied over the past 12 or 18 months &ndash; not for the first time &ndash; seemed to be absorbed also.  Very significant costs were involved.  The Finance Bill will be published tomorrow and we will then see the exact detail.  It is clear we need to keep resources in place for tourism and marketing.  I have managed to do so, as has been recognised publicly by the industry.</P>
        <P>I returned last week from the World Travel Market in London.  It was quite an eye opener for me.  There were 41 Irish stands, whose representatives were from all over the country.  I believed there would be many downcast industry representatives but I discovered the opposite.  They were very steeled towards what was happening in the international market and were very keen to seize the opportunities that might arise next year, bearing in mind that there might not be as many as there were heretofore.</P><Col N="43"/>
        <P>The nine-month figure for the period to the end of September suggests visitor numbers have decreased by 1.3%.  I accept the number pertaining to September has decreased by approximately 10%.  This is very much in keeping with international norms.  Many countries&rsquo; numbers have decreased substantially more.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>We are only interested in this country.  Can I take it from the Minister&rsquo;s comments that he agrees with the tax and believes it will not have an impact on Aer Lingus and will be absorbed by passengers?  Does he believe passengers will continue to travel in the same numbers and that Aer Lingus was misrepresenting the facts when it stated it will have to absorb &euro;30 million next year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated, we would all prefer if there were no taxation.  The fact is that there must be and that we must be able to provide services.  This year we are allocating just under &euro;50 million for marketing alone.  We need to have the resources to do so.  Overall, &euro;160 million is being allocated for a broad range of tourism activities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that the marketing budget was kept intact but the reality is that people cannot come here if there are no inward flights.  No amount of marketing will do any good in that case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not have to be the case.  People should consider some of the activities taking place in the industry.</P>

	<P>The Irish Sports Council, ISC, which is funded by my Department, has statutory responsibility for encouraging the promotion, development and co-ordination of competitive sport and the achievement of excellence in competitive sport.  In this regard, the ISC works in partnership with the Irish Institute of Sport, the Olympic Council of Ireland, the Paralympic Council of Ireland and the relevant national governing bodies of sport in the preparation of Irish athletes for the Olympic and Paralympic Games.  My Department has allocated &euro;53 million to the ISC for 2009 which will allow the council to continue to provide high performance support for elite athletes.</P>
        <P>I understand that the ISC has established a review group to examine the preparations and performances at the 2008 Beijing Games in order to prepare for the 2012 London Games.  The overall aim of the review is to make recommendations to the ISC in respect of structures, programmes and investment policy which should be pursued based on the outcomes of the 2008 Olympic and Paralympic Games.  I understand that the review will be completed shortly and it is anticipated that the report will be published in December.</P>
        <P>I recently met a number of the key stakeholders involved in the support of our elite athletes to discuss how we can best build on the success we had in Beijing and the supports required in terms of coaching, programmes, facilities and funding to ensure the optimum performance of Irish athletes at the London 2012 Olympic Games.  It is my intention that the issues arising from these meetings will dovetail with the review being carried out by the ISC.</P><Col N="44"/>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister mentioned the Irish Institute of Sport and its very important role.  What is its status?  I have raised this question a number of times with regard to legislation.  It is important that there be clarity concerning its role.  The Minister  indicated to me previously that the institute may not have a statutory basis and that it may be subsumed, for example, into the Irish Sports Council.  People must know its exact status.  I am not clear what the current position is with regard to its chief executive since the resignation of the previous incumbent.  We must identify where the institute is going and what is its status.  It was established to help elite athletes.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister convinced that the facilities, supports and backup we will have in place will be adequate for our athletes to compete well in 2012?  It may be just as important that athletes from other countries should be able to avail of our facilities.  That is a significant issue in the economic debate.  What does the Minister think will happen with regard to athletes from other countries who want to train to the highest level?  The ideal is to provide that service here for them as well as for our own athletes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question is interesting.  I have met with representatives of the Irish Sports Institute which gave a fantastic presentation within the past few weeks.  The range, breadth and depth of its activities with athletes is extremely substantial and would be equivalent to that provided by any international body of a similar nature.</P>
        <P>It is unlikely that I shall set up the institute on a solo statutory footing.  It is not necessary to do so and might not contribute anything.  The institute has conveyed to me it wants to have the structure in place and the key people to deliver the kind of training  needed.</P>
        <P>There is another misunderstanding abroad concerning sport in Ireland.  I was in Limerick this week and saw the facilities there.  Some of the best known world athletes are coming to Limerick.  I am currently trying to get a visa for Usain Bolt, who wants to come to the University of Limerick to train and use the facilities there.  The All Blacks team told me that the facilities in Limerick were the best it had encountered and that there was only one other facility in the United Kingdom or Ireland that it considered to be on a par.</P>
        <P>I agree with Deputy Upton.  We need more facilities of this standard in order to have greater accessibility to and participation in sport in order to produce more athletes.  That is my intention and the structures that the Institute of Sport is putting in place with the Irish Sports Council are very important.</P>
        <P>The third point is vital to me.  I have recently met with approximately 17 sports bodies.  Their views on the various structures, what they believe works and what does not, have been an eye-opener for me.  I am taking all that on board in looking at the overall structures and how we might progress in getting the maximum out of all the resources we are providing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I shall take a brief supplementary question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister.  We have some good facilities and the Minister appears to be very happy with them.  We both agree that we would like to have better<?oasys _jy ?>ones.  </P>
        <P>Boxing has been our greatest success over the years in terms of Olympic medals.  Our boxers bring home medals.  Yet it is one of the least well supported sports in the country in terms of <Col N="45"/>resources; it must be acknowledged that this is probably because of the work of amateurs and volunteers, particularly the latter.  I have been in boxing clubs in my own constituency where they have to put up the ring, take it down, hoosh it into a corner and then put it up again when the boxers need to train.  There are sports that are neglected but these are the ones that bring the greatest kudos in terms of Olympic medals.  Perhaps we should spread the largesse and see how the sports in which we may be more successful can be better supported.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Upton makes two important points.  The National Stadium has had significant resources spent on it and it works extremely well and efficiently for boxers who make good use of it.  I wish to add to that capacity in terms of provision of facilities that are urgently required.  These can be built out of facilities at Abbotstown.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s point concerning funding is a very good one.  This is quite clear when one drills into the sports capital programme and looks at the amount of resources going to boxing.  One of the problems boxing clubs have lies in matching resources.  These are not as wealthy as some of the soccer and GAA clubs, and others.  I am in talks with the Irish Amateur Boxing Association to see if we might put together a package that would allow resources to be better accessed by boxing clubs.  Like Deputy Upton, I have boxing clubs in my constitutency.  We all have.  The money that goes to them is often very little although they can do a considerable amount with few funds.  We must look at sports that have impediments in matching resources because they are not able to compete for matching funds with the bigger sporting organisations.  I agree with the Deputy and it is my intention to try to put more resources into boxing clubs.  They have proved themselves and they deserve it.</P>

        <Quest>  when Government grants will be paid to inter-county GAA players in respect of 2008; if he will guarantee that these grants will be paid in 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>In the agreement reached in November 2007 between my Department, the Irish Sports Council, ISC, the GAA and the Gaelic Players Association, provision was made for the introduction of two schemes through the ISC to recognise the outstanding contribution of senior Gaelic inter-county players to our indigenous sport. Additional costs associated with elite team performance would be met and aspiring teams and players encouraged to reach the highest levels of sporting endeavour. </P>
        <P>It was agreed that the schemes would be funded through the ISC and the implementation of the schemes was a matter for the ISC and the GAA.  An amount of &euro;3.5 million was provided to the ISC in 2008 to fund the schemes.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the ISC has statutory responsibility for encouraging the promotion, development and co-ordination of competitive sport and for increasing participation in recreational sport.  The council provides annual funding through the national governing bodies of sport and the local sports partnerships for programmes and initiatives aimed at achieving these objectives.</P>
        <P>In light of the current economic constraints and the reduction in the ISC&rsquo;s allocation of funding in the 2009 Estimates, I am having discussions with the Council on optimum funding options for next year in order to maintain its existing programmes while building on recent progress.  The future funding of the Gaelic players schemes will be considered in that context.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnOMahony"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important for the future of these funds or grants.  We have talked about percentages, reductions and budgets.  The players and the GAA  understand that there must be savings and cutbacks.  I would like to put down a marker here, namely, that the principle of grants for players be maintained, whatever the budgetary conditions are.  Perhaps people at large do not understand that elite senior inter-county players have very little flexibility in their jobs with regard to overtime.  A cost analysis was done in recent years that examined how much players lose from their income.  It is important we continue to recognise their input.  Will maintaining grants in some form be a priority for the Minister in 2009?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>While I would like to be in a position to provide the maximum amount of resources to every player or athlete in every sport, the resources available to me are finite.  Taxpayers have invested vast resources in the three largest sports organisations, the Gaelic Athletic Association, Football Association of Ireland and Irish Rugby Football Union.  While there is nothing wrong with this, I am convinced that with relatively small sums of money we could achieve much greater success, including at Olympic and world level, in a large number of sports.  However, I do not have unlimited resources. </P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>To achieve good performances at the Olympic Games or in world athletics or boxing championships we must make fair and balanced decisions.  Some of the large sporting organisations have the capacity to raise substantial sums of money.  They are cash rich, although they make good use of the significant funds that flow through them.  This capacity is not present in other sports.  We constantly ask the reason Ireland is not successful in some of these sports at international level.  I want fairness and for us to do well in these sports.  Any assessment of the budget will show that in recent years the GAA, FAI and IRFU have received an incredible amount of resources from taxpayers.  While this has the proper course of action, it is not sustainable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnOMahony"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
	<P>Substantial Government investment in stadiums is no good without players.  For the first time, a GAA player has failed a drug test.  While I do not wish to pre-empt the decision of any eventual hearings, I assume that if a player is found innocent in such a hearing, the grants paid out to him or her would not be affected.  Assuming the player in this case is innocent, surely it is possible to hold hearings and have the player&rsquo;s name cleared before information reaches the media.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should not stray into matters of this nature.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnOMahony"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
	<P>I do so in the context of the grants paid to players.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Processes are in place to resolve the issue in the public domain to which the Deputy refers.  I do not propose to get involved in the matter as it has no bearing on or connection to the GPA players grant system.</P>
        <P>We have had a reasonable discussion.  A fundamental question arises as to whether the taxpayer should fund individuals who belong to strong and relatively wealthy organisations.  The question is whether this approach is sustainable.</P>

	<P>If the overall view is that we will not support minority sports, which is a term I strongly dislike, and decide that 25 sports are unimportant and all our resources must be invested in one area, that is fine.  I do not believe, however, that this is what everybody wants.  If, on the other hand, we decide we want to fund all sports, limited resources available for this purpose.  We must decide what is fair, what the taxpayer wants and where the resources should go.  </P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76, 77 and 84 together.</P>
        <P>For the information of Deputies, it is worthwhile to set out the rationale behind the decision to combine the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Crawford Art Gallery and National Gallery of Ireland while retaining their separate brand identities, and the decision to merge the National Archives, Irish Manuscripts Commission and National Library.  These decisions, which were announced in budget 2009, arose from the scrutiny by my Department of administrative costs which was undertaken earlier this year as part of the Government&rsquo;s efficiency review, with a particular focus on the number of State agencies and other bodies and in the context of the ongoing oversight exercised by my Department of these institutions against the backdrop of the 2009 Estimates process.</P>
        <P>Deputies may be aware that the programme for Government contains a commitment to put the Irish Museum of Modern Art on a statutory footing.  They may also be aware that the legislation underpinning the National Archives has been undergoing critical analysis by the National Archives Advisory Council and officials of my Department, with a view to updating <Col N="48"/>both the functions of the National Archives and the management structures surrounding the archives.</P>
        <P>Throughout this process, I was aware that some institutions had reasonably good numbers of support staff.  However, the Crawford Art Gallery in Cork which recently came under my Department as a national cultural institution did not have in-house administrative support.  Institutions such as this cannot be expected to function efficiently without the normal level of human resources, finance and other back-up.</P>
        <P>As well as these particular and individual imperatives, I am obliged to ensure our national cultural institutions function through and are supported by administrative and other structures which are efficient and effective and reflect the principles of modernisation and flexibility set out in Towards 2016.</P>
        <P>When one takes all these factors into consideration against the background that the expected continuing pressure on the public purse will not be matched by any decline in expectation or demand for quality customer services, the rationalisation of the support or back office functions within complementary national cultural institutions is not an optional consideration at this time and must be undertaken.  Since the budget announcement on this matter, I have initiated a consultative process with the directors of the national cultural institutions involved.  They have been requested to consider the future arrangements necessary to give effect to these decisions and bring forward any issues they perceive will need to be specifically addressed under various headings such as legislation, governance, unified management structures, unified support services and resources.  I am also establishing consultative committees in respect of each project which will be led by the Department and will have in their membership representatives of the national cultural institutions.  These committees will manage the many issues which will arise.</P>
        <P>In parallel with this process work will commence on producing heads of a Bill to give effect to the required legislative changes.  These changes will include amendment of the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997, National Archives Act 1986 and National Gallery of Ireland Acts 1854 to 1963 and the creation of new legislation.  My objective in this development is to seek the best structures for our national cultural institutions in order that, in facing into times of stringency, they can continue to deliver core services to their respective customers to their normal and superlative standards.</P>
        <P>I also want to ensure these institutions, which contribute collectively to the 3 million visitors our national cultural institutions receive annually, continue to be a core part of our tourism product.  In more discerning tourism markets internationally, the national cultural institutions differentiate us as a destination of distinction and value.  This summer, a visitor to Dublin could have viewed works by Bacon, Monet, Gauguin, Freud, Scully and Rembrandt and read original Yeats and Joyce manuscripts before enjoying the Berlin Philharmonic and catching a glimpse of an Oscar winning songwriter.  This is the kind of cultural immersion and variety that few cities in Europe can offer.  It is entirely appropriate that we continue to invest financially and legislatively in these internationally important institutions in order that they continue to flourish in the new economic environment.  It is not possible at this stage to identify what savings, if any, will be realised through this process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am surprised by the Minister&rsquo;s reply because he appears to suggest these measures were taken in the interests of the institutions in question and to improve the quality of the product provided to members of the public.  The idea for these measures emanated from the Department of Finance and is purely a money saving exercise.  Why has a cost analysis not been done to identify how much money will be saved?  While I am fully in favour <Col N="49"/>of eliminating quangos, none of the institutions under discussion is a quango.  They are the anchor institutions of Irish culture with traditions dating back to the 18th century.</P>
        <P>To decide on the back of an envelope whether to get rid of some or merge others and then suggest that this will somehow improve matters while at the same time saying it is a good idea to invest in cultural institutions does not make sense.  How is that consistent with the Minister&rsquo;s capital budget for the cultural institutions being decreased by 48%?</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding what might have to happen in the Crawford Gallery in Cork, how does the Minister intend, for instance, in the case of organisations such as the National Archives and the National Library to bring them together and somehow assume they are going to be more efficient as a result?  Is there to be a new building and are they to come together on a single site?  Is that the way the efficiencies and improvements are to be achieved?  Does the Minister agree that these are not bloated organisations, which are overspending or overstaffed?  Nothing could be further from the truth.  How are the savings to be made?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I was disappointed with the first remarks made by the Deputy, and then quite happy with the second half, because she began to touch on the reality of the position.  This is not for me, I can assure the Deputy, a simple issue of looking at figures on a page, drawing lines through them and achieving an outcome.  That would not work and it would be foolish to approach it simply on cost-saving lines.  A vast range of issues must be considered and everyone is concerned with getting the maximum return from these institutions, to give them the greatest possible remit in terms of their public functions and to substantially increase the number of visitors they enjoy.  Cultural tourism is now a big business in Ireland.  I opened a conference yesterday in Dublin and I was very encouraged by the scale and numbers of people involved, as well as by the international participants.  More than 3 million tourists last year &mdash; and probably more this year &mdash; visited or will visit the cultural institutions.  That is not to say they should be just left as they are.  To me the Deputy is suggesting that we do nothing.  Do we need 40 directors, for example, in three galleries to make them function? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>How much is that saving? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not about savings at all &mdash; and that is why I am putting the question to the Deputy.  I have said I do not know whether there will be any savings at the end of it.  The Deputy has raised a whole range of issues that I will be scrutinising in terms of whether they should be based in one location, amalgamated, what the board structure will be, the role of the chief executive, the HR functions and so on.  There clearly is a good deal of duplication, even triplication, in so many of the institutes, where they all have utterly independent administrative functions.  As to whether there can be greater efficiencies, the answer is probably &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, but to do much of this it must be decided what else needs to happen and whether the approaches to be taken will be cost-effective.  The outcome I want is to maximise to the absolute end all of the institutes, including the National Archives &mdash; which I have a good deal of time for &mdash; in terms of their ability to be part and parcel of this country&rsquo;s cultural performance. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is presenting this amalgamation to the House as though it were a long-term strategy and something he had planned long before&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>This was actually going on long before I arrived in this Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will please allow the Deputy to put the question before answering. </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="50"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>It coincided with budgetary requirements, and I suggest that this is not really case.  To me this reads like cutting costs and finding means for making savings.  I was very impressed with what the Minister had to say about cultural tourism, which is really important for the country, but bundling together all of these agencies that have quite different functions does not make sense as regards enhancing the attractions of cultural tourism.  I wonder what is the logic. </P>
        <P>On another point, I believe the Minister said he had asked the various directors to give their views to him on this.  That sounds somewhat like asking turkeys about Christmas.  The directors will surely not come up with a system whereby they will chop off their own heads and say, in effect, &ldquo;I do not want to be a director any more &mdash; it makes a lot of sense to me&rdquo;.  Behind this initiative, therefore, there must be some strategy or some plan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a serious plan of engagement, but the Deputy is presenting this as black and white.  One of the greatest institutions in the world with which we are all familiar is the Smithsonian Institute.  It has everything embraced within one structure; are the Deputies telling me it does not work?  Scotland is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>They are funded. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Just hang on a minute.  Scotland is an example where all the galleries and museums are under one structure, the National Galleries of Scotland.  There is one national organisation there although we seem to believe there must be a board of directors to run everything in this country.  A body must be independent, stand-alone, with its own managing director and ten other directors, HR and administrative people, or otherwise it cannot function.  That, in my view, is a load of nonsense. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister telling us that what is required is one enormous capital investment? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy had listened to the answer I gave Deputy Mitchell &mdash; and she expanded on what I said &mdash; the answer to all these issues is that we need to look at whether there will be any savings.  I am being quite open.  There may not be any savings.  Even if there are not, the question is whether those cultural institutions are getting the most out of the money being invested in them.  For example, the National Archives is a wonderful body and has an extraordinary treasure of history, but only 18,000 people a year visit it.  Some of the national archives in other countries&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is located in a biscuit factory.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;-have hundreds of thousands of people visiting them.  They run major public programmes in a variety of areas.  I should like to see our National Archives institute being put in a position to do that.  If it is a fault of the structure or the funding that it cannot do that at the moment, let that fact emerge.  That body contains an extraordinary store of this nation&rsquo;s archives and has the capacity to play a much greater role, both in terms of Irish people who want access to the archives; to attract people who want to use its resources for educative purposes, if they are following a master&rsquo;s, PhD programme or whatever; or simply tourists who have an interest in cultural tourism.  We should not be afraid to tackle the issue, but we should not be prescriptive as regards outcomes. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is absolutely right&mdash;&mdash;-</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy. </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="51"/>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;-in saying he should not be afraid to tackle the issue.  However, the issue should be tackled after he has done the analysis on whether there will be savings and increased efficiencies, and what must be spent in order to achieve those outcomes.  The reality is that all those organisations are completely under-funded, particularly in terms of the structures they occupy.  They are at the receiving end of more and more artefacts and materials every year and the National Archives next month will get another year&rsquo;s material but has nowhere to put it.  The Minister wonders why nobody visits it.  It is because it is locaed in a biscuit factory and they can find nothing.  That is the reality.  Investment is required.  Will he say, at least, what the future of the National Archives is, in terms of the building it will occupy in the future?  When exactly will the National Archives &mdash; which the Minister regards as so precious &mdash; get the building it merits?  The reality is that we shall lose the archives in a fire or something else unless he does something about it. </P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Deputy agrees fully with what I have said, as it is quite clear that she does.  I appreciate that and feel like saying, &ldquo;I rest my case&rdquo;.  I and my Department are engaged with the National Archives.  I fully accept the Deputy&rsquo;s point that the space for the type of storage necessary is utterly inadequate and I believe the OPW has sourced a facility that will meet the requirements in that regard.  However, that is only part of the solution and not the full answer. </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe it will meet all the requirements.  Part of the brief was that the property would have to meet all the standards required for the storage of national archive material.  However, I do not have the details at this stage and cannot say whether anything is finalised. </P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78, 89, 92, 95 and 101 together. </P>
        <P>Following the opening of the National Aquatic Centre in 2003 and a subsequent Government decision in January 2004 to proceed with a phased delivery of the National Sports Campus at Abbotstown lands, capital expenditure of &euro;1.05 million was made in the preparation of the development control plan for the campus and &euro;7.3 million on the refurbishment of the former State laboratories as the new headquarters for the FAI.   By the end of 2008 an amount of &euro;2.6 million in capital funding will have been made on project management and design fees in progressing the phase 1 facilities of the sports campus.  Expenditure on the campus prior to 2004, and chiefly involving the capital cost of the National Aquatic Centre opened in 2003, was &euro;81 million of which &euro;62.5 million excluding VAT is attributable directly to the capital development of the centre.  I am satisfied that each of these expenditures represents good value for money.</P>
        <P>The allocation for the National Sports Campus Development Authority for 2009 provided for in the 2009 Estimates stands at &euro;4.4 million of which some &euro;2.4 million is a current allocation for the administration and running costs of the authority, with the remaining &euro;2 million being a capital allocation.  It is intended that the capital allocation for 2009 will be used to meet the costs of refurbishing the former meat control laboratory on the Abbotstown site as a new headquarters for the Irish Institute of Sport, work on which is due to commence in December with an anticipated completion date in mid-2009.</P>
        <P>I am reviewing with the NSCDA how we might best advance the campus project from 2009 notwithstanding the current difficult economic circumstances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>What questions are currently being dealt with?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Question Nos. 78, 89, 92, 95 and 101.  There are four from Deputy Mitchell and one from Deputy Upton. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The major investment of phase 1 of the development of the sports campus was announced three times by the Minister and his predecessor.  As recently as July the Minister visited the sports campus and said he looked forward to the development being ready to train our athletes for the 2012 Olympics.  Can the Minister clarify if this investment is going ahead and will it be ready to train athletes for the 2012 Olympics?</P>
        <P>This is a 500 acre site and precious little has happened to it for some time.  How much is this costing the taxpayer?  The campus is lying idle with nothing more there than the offices of the FAI, which is wonderful for the FAI but I cannot see how the fortune of sport is significantly increased by giving it offices.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned the state-of-the-art swimming pool and I submitted a question on this.  Is the swimming pool paying its way?  The Minister might clarify that; last year it required a subsidy of &euro;2 million &mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a separate question.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="53"/>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister can confine himself to the questions I have asked.  How much does the entire holding cost to maintain, supervise and insure annually?  Is the phase 1 investment even going ahead, much less phase 2?  The stadium seems to have gone into netherland. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>After seeing 82,000 people in Croke Park last Saturday I would love to see Abbotstown built given the difference of 30,000.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Order in the answering of questions please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is &euro;2 million in the capital budget.  Can the Minister tell me what that will be spent on?  Is it for more offices?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There are design teams involved and we want to keep it going.  I told Deputies Mitchell and Upton previously that the old meat laboratory will be fully finished by mid-2009 for the institute of sport; that is important and I was with them to see it happen.  The Abbotstown lands have been in State ownership for years, long before I came into this House.  They are State-owned lands, and incur the normal costs for maintenance as other State-owned land.  I do not have a specific figure.</P>
        <P>I listed what was involved in the cost of phase 1 of Abbotstown, which was approximately &euro;150 million.  I wanted to include a velodrome in it which increased the cost to &euro;160 million.  A velodrome is an essential element in Irish sport and Deputy Mitchell may share my view.  In the UK they have shown how far they have advanced in sport and the number of medals they have won since building velodromes.  It is unlikely the full building of that phase can be achieved in the current economic climate.  It is a reality I have to face.  As late as last July I thought it might proceed but we all know what has happened here and worldwide since, which has made things immeasurably difficult.</P>
        <P>If I cannot do the entire project I still want to move forward aspects of the project that will be valuable, such as the national indoor training arena which benefits at least 25 sports.  We can still proceed with elements of the project without impacting negatively on the overall project and I am trying to see how we can best proceed with that.  I am currently in discussion with campus authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Green Party would be delighted with the velodrome as it would encourage cycling.  The Minister mentioned the national indoor training centre and that is welcome.  Will the sports science and medical facilities be included in the project?  Is there a list of priorities?  The Minister may have mentioned them but will they be ordered or sequenced?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am discussing that with the board in Abbotstown at the moment.  One or two items cannot be picked out, they must be coherent, cohesive and complementary.  The medical facilities are important.  The indoor training facilities are the core of this as they benefit many sports.  The hockey facilities would also have a huge impact and fit naturally with a phased development.  The possibility of the Irish men&rsquo;s and ladies&rsquo; hockey teams doing very well at the 2012 Olympics is real and if we had all the indoor training and medical facilities they need in Ireland in Abbotstown we could make a substantial impact. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnOMahony"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
	<P>What will be in the sports institute facilities to be completed next year?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">All the State Laboratories were there and we are refurbishing a dedicated building for the staff of the institute of sport.  I do not have the brief here but the Deputy can table a parliamentary question and I will get the details.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</askee>
        <Quest>  if funding has been included in the 2009 capital budget to fund the investment recommended for the University of Limerick and University College Dublin in the consultant&rsquo;s report on the potential of the 2012 Olympics for Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[41286/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics Task Force was established in August 2006 to ensure Ireland can identify and maximise the complete range of opportunities arising from our proximity to the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London 2012.  The task force included experts from the sport, tourism, cultural and business sectors and was supported by staff within my Department.</P>
        <P>The task force report makes a number of recommendations arising from an audit carried out of high quality sports facilities in Ireland and the findings of a report by Indecon International Economic Consultants on the economic evaluation of the benefit to the island of Ireland of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.</P>
        <P>The report highlights the opportunities for Ireland from the London 2012 Games in the sport, tourism, cultural and business sectors.  On the sporting side the report puts forward proposals for investment in sports facilities which would increase our attractiveness as a training destination for Olympic teams in the lead up and during the games.  I understand that inquiries have already been made about the availability of sports facilities here for some Olympic teams, for example, the Australian team is interested in using the swimming facilities in the aquacentre in Abbottstown.</P>
        <P>Both the University of Limerick and University College Dublin have received capital funding from my Department in recent years towards the development of sports facilities.  In 2006, my Department allocated &euro;1 million towards phase 1 of the sports facilities development at the University of Limerick, particularly with a view to the potential usage of the university as a centre for teams preparing for the London 2012 Olympics.  Previous funding to the university sports complex since 1998 was in the form of a &euro;7.55 million grant for the construction of the national 50 metre swimming pool.</P>
        <P>The quality of the facilities at the University of Limerick is amazing and I urge colleagues to visit them.  The number of elite athletes from all over the world who come to Limerick is incredible.  I was surprised by the quality of the staff, which is at the high end of excellence in world sport, and the standard of the facilities.  The swimming facilities and the indoor arena, etc., are of the highest international quality and we should be proud of them.  I congratulate the University of Limerick on the way it has managed the facilities and on its staff.</P>
        <P>The Irish Sports Council, ISC, also provides annual funding to Coaching Ireland, formerly the National Coaching and Training Centre, which is located at the University of Limerick.  Coaching Ireland has an all-island remit to lead the development of coaching in Ireland and in 2008 received &euro;1.9 million from the ISC for coaching services, player athlete services and corporate services.</P>
        <P>In recent years, the Department has also allocated over &euro;1.3 million in capital grants to the UCD sports department towards the development of its sports facilities.  In addition, the national hockey arena, which is located at UCD, was developed with Government funding to the value of &euro;1.29 million.</P>
        <P>I am considering the implementation of the recommendations of the task force report.  I do not deny, however, that the current economic situation has had an impact on the situation.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="55"/>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree the University of Limerick has a wonderful facility, which has been successful as far as it goes.  For that reason, it is a venue that is worth further investment.  However, what is the point in having a report such as the Indecon report and doing nothing on foot of it?  The next Olympic Games are to be held in 2012 and teams are now booking where they will train.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Not yet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said he had already had inquiries about Abbottstown.  Decisions will be made in the next year or two about where teams will go and they will not book into a place that has not yet been built.  Therefore, it is time for the Minister to make up his mind.  Has there, for example, been a response to the University of Limerick proposal for the project that would cost &euro;28 million, half of which the university would put up itself?  Has the Minister done anything with regard to the recommendations of the Indecon report, particularly the proposal from Limerick?  Given we are not going to build in Abbottstown and there will be no improvement in facilities there, will there be compensatory investment in either UCD or the University of Limerick as recommended by the report?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should not put words in my mouth.  I have not said that we are not going to build in Abbottstown.  I have been more than fair in my effort to tell the Deputy precisely what I am going to do.  I have nominated the particular facilities that I see as a priority to be built at Abbottstown.  The proposals for all of these facilities are only going to planning and everything depends on getting planning permission.  We do not know how long that process will take.  I could not have moved more quickly than I have at this stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Why not?  This was announced two years ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>On account of the design work.  There is a full design team working on this and it is employed and paid to work these things out and to get them right.  It has told me it has the process completed and intends to seek planning permission before the end of the year.</P>
        <P>As a matter of interest for the Deputy, there are significant numbers of inquiries being made for the use of facilities that are not yet built.  We have an enormous amount of bookings already for the National Conference Centre, for example.  It is not completed yet, but people realise it will be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>That is because it is being built by the private sector.  However, where we must depend on the Minister to make a decision, projects are not happening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope to be in a position to proceed but unfortunately, although this does not affect Deputy Mitchell or the Fine Gael Party, we have a major economic crisis on our hands, nationally and internationally.  I know that from Deputy Mitchell&rsquo;s perspective this is largely irrelevant and we are expected to find moneys under every bench in the House to fund everything we want to do.  At the same time, the Fine Gael finance spokesman comes in every day and says we are spending too much money.  The Deputy cannot have it every way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>The question relates to investment in UCD and the University of Limerick.  The Minister twice mentioned the swimming pool in the University of Limerick and the hockey pitches in UCD.  These are great facilities, but are the other facilities considered to be world class?  If the Indecon report recommends significant investment, we need to go ahead with it in order to make the facility available.  I accept what the Minister says about the finances, but is it planned to try and meet the recommendation of the Indecon report?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="56"/>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is interesting that a significant number of athletes who won gold, silver or bronze medals at the most recent Olympics have participated in activities in the University of Limerick.  I did not realise so many of them came to the university for training, physiotherapy, medical facilities or coaching facilities.  It is recognised as one of the best in a range of areas.  It has a range of facilities, not just the pool.  It has a huge indoor arena and four basketball courts.  The All-Blacks trained there the other day.  I should have tripped a few of them on Monday and perhaps we might have got over the hump last night.  What an occasion the match in Thomond Park was last night.</P>
        <P>I agree we could do more.  There is no question but that we want to do more and will do so.  Currently, I am trying to maximise what I can do with very limited resources.  That is where I am at in terms of the process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s comment on athletes coming from other countries is very interesting.  If we have such good facilities, will the Minister look at the gap that exists with regard to Ireland not achieving as many medals as we would like at the Olympics?  If we have the capital and the facilities, what is missing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We need more facilities.  However, even if we had all the facilities in the world, I could not say we would win medals.  Much of it comes down to the constant level of international competition and of elite coaching needed for many of the different disciplines.  I was told a story in Beijing that demonstrates this.  The Chinese decided they wanted to win a cycling medal in the velodrome in China.  They sent a 17 year old girl to Switzerland for four years where she did nothing but learn her craft, picking up French and English along the way.  She won a medal.  That is the type of dedication that is needed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I have seen the facilities in the University of Limerick and I agree they are excellent.  However, does the Minister not think there is too much emphasis nowadays on centres of excellence and high performance?  The majority of young people feel excluded and perhaps we should look at the idea of increasing young people&rsquo;s participation in a range of sports.  Currently, the emphasis is on winning at all costs and training the top 20%, whereas 80% of people involved in sports are of average ability.  Many of these people do not get the opportunity to use or are excluded from these top class facilities.  Does the Minister have any plans to increase participation in sport by many young people?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the past while we have invested almost &euro;800 million into the type of facilities the Deputy suggests, into local small clubs, etc., for many different sports throughout the country.  This has had a huge impact.  The ESRI recently published a report which identified two areas in sport that need attention, young women and disadvantaged children.  There is significant work to be done in these areas.</P>
        <P>I commend local sports programmes such as those the FAI are running with local authorities.  These are successful and worthwhile and are the type of programmes we need to do in all sports areas.  While the focus of the questions today has been on major facilities, we should remember that if we build Abbottstown, which we need, Sweden has 22 such facilities.  I will not mention what Germany, France and the UK have.  We need such high-end facilities for all athletes to aspire to, whatever their sport or discipline and we should have them.  This is the reason Abbotstown is very important&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <askee>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</askee>
        <Quest>  the commitments made for each year, including 2008, which are outstanding in respect of the 2008 sports capital budget; if it is expected that all of the &euro;56 million will be drawn down in 2008; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  Since 1998, the Government has allocated more than &euro;725 million in sports capital funding to more than 7,400 sports projects nationwide.  This investment has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland and has allowed the development of sports facilities nationwide.  These facilities have dramatically increased the opportunities for all people to engage in a wide variety of sports.</P>
        <P>I will circulate, with my reply, a tabular statement that sets out the amount of outstanding allocations as at the end of October for each of the years of the programme since 2002, when the Department was established.  The full 2008 allocation of &euro;58 million from the C1 subhead, which is provided for grants to sporting bodies for the provision of sports and recreation facilities, has been distributed to the successful applicants at this stage.  The multi-annual capital investment framework from 2009 to 2013, as published in the Book of Estimates, will enable the commitments made under the sports capital programme to be met in future years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I understand the Minister has informed various organisations that there will be no new capital sports grant scheme this year.  Precious little will happen in Abbotstown, I understand there will be no new swimming pool programme this year and obviously, there will be no money for the universities&rsquo; sports capital programme either.  The Minister&rsquo;s own programme, that is, the sports capital grant scheme, is funded out of national lottery money.  The money to be spent this year was committed last year or in previous years and I presume it will be paid out as the applications come in.  Consequently, <Col N="58"/>I presume that any savings that will accrue will not do so until 2010.  What will happen to the lottery money in 2010, if it is not bound for the sports capital grants scheme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the money came from the national lottery.  However, there is no abrogated tax to my Department marked, &ldquo;national lottery&rdquo;.  The national lottery money goes into the central Exchequer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>If one examines the budget book&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am giving the Deputy a straight answer, if she will permit me to finish.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;every year, it states the scheme is partially funded by the national lottery.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>While the national lottery may well believe that, I am giving the Deputy a straight answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The national lottery does not prepare the budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Not a single cent of the money that comes in from the national lottery goes to my Department.  The money from the national lottery goes to the central Exchequer and every year, when the Estimates are prepared, I bid for resources for my Department.  If some of those resources happen to come from the national lottery, that is fine.  However, the point I am trying to make is there is a widespread misunderstanding in this regard.  People throughout the country keep telling me that I have no worries because my funding comes from the national lottery.  My reply is that this is not the case and that the lottery money goes to the central Exchequer, rather than to my Department.  I get my share of the total income received by the Exchequer.  It forms part of the total income, as does income tax, VAT, stamp duty or whatever else.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>In the minute left to us, if Deputy Mitchell will allow me&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is how it is done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;I will call two Deputies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am simply outlining the position to the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should allow Deputy Upton to ask a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish it was different.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Please, Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is earmarked in legislation for recreation and sport.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will call the Deputy again.  I call Deputy Upton.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a slightly different angle on this issue.  In a recent reply to a parliamentary question I tabled on the sunset clause, the Minister stated that slightly more than &euro;23 million was not drawn down between 2001 and 2008.  Some of this funding pertained to the Cl&aacute;r and RAPID disadvantaged areas.  Can this funding be extended?  I refer to the <Col N="59"/>percentage that must be put in place to meet the matching funds, because often such areas do not have the capacity to do so.  This reverts to my earlier question.  For example, boxing clubs often operate within disadvantaged areas and even if funding is available, they are not always in a position to draw it down because of their lack of resources.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There must be a point&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should wait as I have not yet called him.  I will take Deputy Mitchell as well for her final supplementary.</P>

	<P>For round 15.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>When the relevant legislation was passed, I specifically remember the national lottery money was earmarked.  The legislation states it must be spent on sport and recreation.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That has not been the case for a long time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>What does the Minister mean?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>If one considers the overall contribution from the national lottery, it is significantly greater than that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue will be raised in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be delighted if the moneys from the national lottery were abrogated, if that is the correct term, to sport, to my Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>Nine out of ten people believe that to be the case.</P>

	<P>Is the Minister telling me it is going into a black hole?</P>

    <Title>Gas (Amendment) Bill 2008: Second Stage (Resumed). </Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>The recent uncertainty in the international energy market, although temporarily calmed, has led to substantial increases in fuel prices, which has had extremely damaging consequences for indigenous industry, farmers and fishermen.  It is difficult to comprehend that earlier this year, oil on the international market was making $146 a barrel, while the price stands at just under $60 dollars a barrel at present.  This has not been reflected in the pumping stations throughout this island, in which well in excess of &euro;1 per litre is being charged. <Col N="61"/> Moreover, the large increases in prices charged to domestic customers has placed an added burden on household incomes.</P>
        <P>Therefore the extent of the reserves off our coast place us in a unique position with regard to future supply, costs and overall benefit to the people.  However, this will not be realised unless the Irish State makes radical changes with regard to how the sector is controlled and how the revenues from that sector are channelled.  Other countries have far more control over their oil and gas and the exploration companies are happy to enter arrangements which some people in this country claim would put them off becoming involved here.  This is not the experience internationally and companies are unlikely to turn their backs on the potential that lies off the Irish coast because of higher tax and royalties, which would bring this country into line with others.  I argue strongly that if international oil companies are prepared to enter into arrangements with other countries and pay far greater tax and royalties to those countries, this also should be applicable here.</P>
        <P>In Norway, a state which ironically through Statoil stands to benefit to a greater extent than Ireland from the Corrib gas field, and which has a population similar to Ireland&rsquo;s, the benefits of oil and gas have been massive due to the manner in which the sector is managed by the state.  For example, the Norwegians have a state pension fund of $240 billion, largely built from oil and gas revenues.  During the first nine months of 2008, while the rest of the world&rsquo;s economies were reeling under the impact of the stock market and bank crisis, the Norwegian Government earned $18 billion in royalties from oil and gas.  Combined with the $240 billion in Norway&rsquo;s pension fund, this argues strongly for the exploitation of our resources to the benefit of the Irish people.</P>
        <P>There is potential off our coast, but only if it is properly managed and a proper revenue structure replaces the current one, which was put in place by former Ministers whose activities in other areas have been exposed and called into question.  Their role in handing over our oil and gas should have been the subject of investigation by the tribunals.</P>
        <P>While we are strengthening Bord G&aacute;is, we should also consider expanding the interests of the country in oil and gas by strengthening the State&rsquo;s role and increasing the revenue flow.  We need to ensure that the gas that comes on stream is available to people throughout the entire island.  Currently, 18 of the Twenty-six Counties are part of the grid.  If some of the exploration companies had their way, the gas would be piped out of the country in its entirety.  At the very least, we must ensure that, when the new fields come on stream, the pipeline is extended to every part of the country, which should be reflected in lower costs to consumers.  It would be ludicrous if the predicted scale of the gas to be taken from our coast did not even bring that benefit.</P>
        <P>I welcome the boost the Bill will provide to Bord G&aacute;is and hope that not only will it allow Bord G&aacute;is to expand its operations for the benefit of the consumer and the economy overall, but that the Minister will engage in more hands-on initiatives in the energy sector, particularly in respect of the issues to which I have referred.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterKellyFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill seeks to increase the statutory borrowing limit placed on Bord G&aacute;is from &euro;1.7 billion to &euro;3 billion.  Its enactment will give Bord G&aacute;is the legal ability to access funds to develop the strategic direction set out in its five-year corporate plan to 2012 and beyond.</P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is was established in 1976 with a mandate to develop and maintain a system for the supply of natural gas that was both economical and efficient.  The borrowing limit at the time was &pound;25 million.  Bord G&aacute;is has played an important role in the growth of the economy through the development of a gas network of more than 12,000 km of pipeline serving more than <Col N="62"/>600,000 customers.  A total of 18 counties in the Republic and four counties in Northern Ireland are connected to the natural gas network.  Six years ago, the borrowing limit was increased from &euro;700 million to &euro;1.7 billion.</P>
        <P>The structure of the energy industry has changed significantly since the introduction of market liberalisation and Bord G&aacute;is has a variety of roles within the gas industry.  It has expanded beyond its original base into the electricity supply market.  It has two main businesses, namely, networks and energy supply.  It has 600,000 gas customers and a 2007 turnover of &euro;1.215 billion.  The company employs 900 staff and has been a successful institution of which the country should be proud.</P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is holds the transmission and distribution system owner licences in respect of the natural gas network.  It carries out work and provides services in respect of the network on behalf of Gaslink, the independent system operator.  Through the new connections programme, Bord G&aacute;is Networks brings the benefits of natural gas to new areas and constructs and extends the network to the highest international safety standards.</P>
        <P>The 12,375 km of pipeline includes transmission and distribution networks, two sub-sea interconnectors linking Ireland with Scotland, an onshore system in Scotland, a spur line to the Isle of Man, the north-west pipeline from Belfast to Derry, the Mayo-Galway pipeline to bring gas from the Corrib field into the national grid and the South-North pipeline from Gormanstown, County Meath to Belfast to secure long-term gas supplies for Northern Ireland.  It is important to note that Bord G&aacute;is is licensed to supply natural gas to ten towns in Northern Ireland.  In the week when it was announced that the Stormont Executive is back on track, it is encouraging to see cross-Border co-operation on a practical level.</P>
        <P>The operation and development of the gas network in the next five years will involve adding a further 1,500 km of pipeline, the connection of 150,000 new customers, the replacement of the remaining cast iron network and investment in new systems and technology to provide improved customer service.</P>
        <P>I wish to discuss the global gas market.  Last month, Russia, Iran and Qatar announced their establishment of an OPEC-style gas cartel to control up to 60% of the world&rsquo;s gas supply.  Russia&rsquo;s gas export monopoly, Gazprom, stated that it had agreed to form the cartel with an aim to its becoming a permanent body with regular meetings.  Europe and the United States have warned against such a gas export body because it would pose a danger to global energy security and create room for price manipulation.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Russia, Iran and Qatar are ranked the first, second and third largest holders of natural gas reserves in the world and boast more than 60% of the global total.  They have agreed to hold regular meetings three or four times a year to discuss key issues of gas market developments and claim to have a common vision of the forum&rsquo;s goals and of the need to transform it into a permanent organisation as quickly as possible to serve the goals of stable and reliable energy supplies.  It reads like the script of a Bond movie and is an issue that should be monitored.  As a member state of the EU, Ireland&rsquo;s voice can be heard.</P>
      
        <P>Natural gas has become a global commodity of geopolitical importance. World gas consumption is projected to more than double over the next three decades, with gas surpassing coal as the world&rsquo;s number two energy source.  Experts have suggested that gas could even overtake oil&rsquo;s market share in many large industrialised economies.  The advantages of gas include ample supply, its greenhouse advantage over other fossil fuels and its economic competitiveness as a feedstock for electrical power generation.</P><Col N="63"/>
        <P>Across the Atlantic, natural gas is likely to play an even more important role in America&rsquo;s energy production.  Between 1997 and 2007, the amount of natural gas used in the production of electricity increased by more than 50%.  Natural gas is now used to generate 22% of all electricity in the United States.  When one considers that 55% of America&rsquo;s 109 million households use natural gas for heating purposes, one will realise how crucial it is as a source of energy.</P>
        <P>Sustained high prices, in conjunction with new technologies, have led to a striking increase in production in the United States following a decade of stagnation.  According to the Energy Information Administration in the US, natural gas production has grown by 9% in the past 15 months as companies make use of previously unavailable or unprofitable resources.  One result of the growth in production of gas is that net US exports have increased fivefold since 1997, from 157 billion cu. ft. in that year to 822 billion cu. ft. in 2007.</P>
        <P>Natural gas accounts for approximately 25% of total primary energy demand in Ireland, a share that is in line with both the worldwide and European averages of 24%.  The Irish gas market is small in a European context, using less than 1% of total EU gas consumption.  Ireland has an unusually high dependence on oil &mdash; 56% of our energy comes from oil, compared to 36% worldwide and 40% in Europe.</P>
        <P>It is encouraging that Bord G&aacute;is will have a capital investment programme of up to &euro;2 billion over the next five years.  The Government&rsquo;s energy policy framework document, Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland, supports the sustainable development of the State energy companies.  Competition and environmental sustainability are key pillars of the policy framework.  As the Minister outlined, the enactment of the legislation before the House is crucial.  Increasing Bord G&aacute;is&rsquo;s borrowing limit to &euro;3 billion is essential, particularly if we wish to have a world-class gas service.  Bord G&aacute;is has increased its turnover from &euro;496 million to &euro;1.2 billion and profits have risen from &euro;70 million to &euro;142 million since 2000.  Net assets have increased from &euro;672 million to &euro;1.3 billion.  This shows that the company is in a healthy financial position.</P>
        <P>I support the legislation because it is in the interests of the country to have an efficient energy supply system.  Even if we find ourselves facing changed economic circumstances, we should still encourage expansion and development.  We should continually look to the future and seek new opportunities.  The Bill will assist us in doing just that.</P>
        <P>Longford is among the counties that do not have access to natural gas.  Bord G&aacute;is, at my request, sent representatives to the county on three occasions in recent years.  To date, however, a pipeline has not been laid.  I appeal to the company to reconsider the county&rsquo;s suitability in this regard.</P>
        <P>Numerous criticisms have been directed at me recently by Members on the opposite side of the House.  Five years ago, I stated that I would endeavour to do certain things for the people of County Longford.  At that time, I said I would endeavour to bring gas to Longford.  I will continue my efforts in this regard.  I also stated that I would bring decentralisation to the county, a matter in respect of which I was successful.  As a result of my efforts, 130 staff have relocated to Longford and an investment of &euro;19.5 million has been made.  I further stated that I would ensure Longford obtained a new swimming pool and a new 25 m, six-lane facility, which cost &euro;17 million, has been put in place.</P>
        <P>I will continue to work on behalf of the people of County Longford.  However, I will do so in my own quiet way.  I will not shout and roar about my achievements.  I will continue to work with the people who want to work with me.  Co-operation is the only way forward; it is the only means by which one can be successful in any walk of life.  Members should work together <Col N="64"/>for the common good of the country.  I have no doubt that the Bill is for the common good and that it is designed to promote Ireland.  I am sure people will put the country first and cater for the needs of Bord G&aacute;is, particularly as we require the energy it can generate.</P>
        <P>I visited the headquarters of Bord G&aacute;is in Cork.  I met many of the company&rsquo;s staff, who are a credit to Ireland.  The company, as a semi-State body, is also a credit to the country, particularly in respect of the way it conducts its business.  I wish Bord G&aacute;is continued success in the future.  Once it is safe in Irish hands &mdash; with an Irish board and an Irish management team &mdash; the success to which I refer will continue to obtain.  Irish people are the best in the world.  There is no one to equal them when they put their minds to achieving something.  They have the expertise, management skills and everything else that is required to make a successful business.  Bord G&aacute;is is an example in that regard.</P>
        <P>Perhaps Bord G&aacute;is and the ESB might give serious consideration to not increasing the prices they charge if possible.  Ordinary consumers are extremely valuable customers and we do not want a situation to arise where they will not be able to afford to pay their bills.  Bad weather is predicted this winter and I would not like anyone to be in a position where they could not afford to pay for light and heat.  I am sure Bord G&aacute;is and the ESB will pay heed to what I am saying and review the position in order to discover whether there might be an opportunity to reduce prices.  I will not discuss the details of discussing recent decreases in the price of oil.  However, I am sure those in Bord G&aacute;is and the ESB are aware of how people feel about this matter.</P>
        <P>It would be remiss of me not to mention the Corrib gas field.  It is important that if we have a natural resource it is used for the benefit of the majority of people in the country.  While many people sympathised with those involved in that saga in terms of the inconvenience caused, Irish citizens will normally put up with anything that benefits the majority of people.  The minority must sometimes be inconvenienced for the good of the majority.  All reasonable and sensible people would agree with the sentiment that we must consider our fellow people.  I appeal to everybody, when contemplating actions, to be charitable and to put first the good of the country.</P>

	<P>Members on all sides of the House have welcomed the Bill.  As has been stated, Fine Gael supports the Bill, which is one of those evolving measures that so often comes before the House in regard to companies like an Bord G&aacute;is.  </P>
        <P>The Bill provides us with an opportunity to speak about the activities of Bord G&aacute;is, where we would like to see it go and related matters.  The increase in the lending limit from &euro;1.7 billion to &euro;3 billion is a big increase.  However, all Members are happy to accede to this provision which is, I assume, based on sound management principles.</P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is has been extremely good at running its core business.  Suffice to say, from a layman&rsquo;s point of view &mdash; the Minister of State might refer to this when summing up &mdash; Bord G&aacute;is is a lucky company in that given the current atmosphere in the financial markets, had it to raise this type of money tomorrow morning &mdash; I presume it will require the $3 billion over a number of years &mdash; it would be facing a difficult task.  Ireland is experiencing a financial crisis, as are many countries worldwide.</P>
        <P>On an occasion like this, it is important to point out that Bord G&aacute;is has been one of the better Irish companies.  It has been extremely good at its core business, namely, the supply of natural gas.  It has, in more recent times, done a great deal of work in the west.  Unlike most other utilities, it is seldom we hear complaints about the manner in which Bord G&aacute;is carries out its work despite it having laid countless miles of piping around the country, acquired land, <Col N="65"/>undertaken wayleave agreements and addressed all the legal aspects in this regard.  It has dealt reasonably with the farming community and landowners.  It appears to have been one of those particularly good national schemes that worked as per specification and plan.  As far as I am aware, there were few rows in this regard.</P>
        <P>It is hoped that Bord G&aacute;is will strive to deliver a first-class service at a price people can afford.  This brings me back to an important issue. Everybody knows that the base price for a barrel of crude oil affects all aspects of our lives.  The increase last July to $147 a barrel for crude oil sent everyone into a tizzy, including world airlines and diesel prices.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Not into reverse, I hope.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>Last September Bord G&aacute;is sought and was granted a 20% price increase.  It later sought a further 8% increase.  We were told at the time to consider ourselves lucky it was not seeking a 10%, 15% or 20% increase, which was of little comfort to the people using natural gas.  I do not blame the company for this increase as it was tracking the ESB which in turn tracked the price of oil on the world market.</P>
        <P>However, I cannot understand &mdash; this matter was referred to by almost every speaker &mdash; why the current cost of gas, while it has decreased a little, is based on the cost of a barrel of crude oil last July, which was $147.  I heard a commentator say on the radio a week ago that at that time the price had decreased from $147 to $50 a barrel, although it is slightly higher now.</P>
        <P>Given the Government&rsquo;s objective of providing value for money and to ensure the industrial and economic wheels of the country continue to turn and, above all else, given our commitment to take care of the elderly in terms of home heating, one would expect a dramatic decrease in the cost of fuel at the pumps and for home heating oil.  I paid &euro;1.10 a litre for the last tank of diesel I purchased.  This was not much less than I paid for a litre of diesel six or eight weeks ago.  All of the experts say that we should not be paying more than &euro;1 or 95 cent for a litre of diesel.  We are a long way from that price.  I raise this issue to draw attention to the correlation between all fuels irrespective of source in that as soon as oil prices on the world market increase, the cost of all other fuels increases.</P>
        <P>We have a regulator for everything nowadays.  The Government appears to be throwing its hands in the air and saying it cannot by law interfere in these matters.  Surely, there exists an over-arching system that will ensure various sectors of the economy benefit when the base price is low, as is currently the case.  I am not an expert in regard to what should be the cost of gas when crude oil prices are low.  I cannot do that and do not know if there are many Members in this House that could do so.  Surely, there must be a relationship between the two.  I cannot understand why when crude oil on the world stage is cheap, we must pay dearly for electricity, gas, petrol or diesel.  It is about time this matter was examined.</P>
        <P>We speak about value for money.  I believe people are being ripped off every day.  I cannot understand the level at which current prices are set.  Natural gas is a clean fuel from an emissions point of view.  It is a fuel we should be utilising more.  I am told &mdash; I assume this is correct &mdash; that potentially, from an exploration point of view, it is likely there will be other major finds of gas off our shores during the next few years, although experience tells me this is much easier said than done.</P>
        <P>The find off the Mayo coast is a major national asset and will make a huge difference when it is plugged into the national grid.  Deputy Ferris accused us of making billionaires out of oil magnates but, if the potential was as good as he claims, I would be surprised that so few gas and oil wells were bored.  We all know, however, it is not that simple.  While mistakes were made over the years in terms of allowing the profits from mines and oil fields to be exported, <Col N="66"/>we need to do whatever it takes to identify offshore gas resources and pipe them to households at the earliest opportunity.  It is a big world in some respects but a small one in others.  Russia&rsquo;s gas supplies are situated far from Ireland and the pipeline is vulnerable to a wide variety of interruptions.  I will not waste the House&rsquo;s time in setting out the importance of having our own national supply.  I hope our offshore gas resources come on stream.</P>
        <P>I could not think of a better company to manage distribution than Bord G&aacute;is.  I note that none of my colleagues on either side of the House has a bad word to say about the company and, having watched its progress, I concur with them.  However, I am concerned about a number of issues.  Although we are lucky in counties Galway and Mayo in that most of our towns and smaller villages have access to gas supplies, from a regional and spatial perspective I find it difficult to understand why Sligo and Letterkenny will not be linked to the gas network.  I understand evaluations are ongoing but it appears that the spur pipeline which would have to be built to these towns does not meet the economic criteria laid down for Bord G&aacute;is.  These criteria are business oriented, in other words, the commercial viability of connecting a town to the network is greatly enhanced if it hosts a large company.</P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is is now becoming a dual fuel supplier.  It will be supplying residences as well as ESB generating plants.  Somebody will have to pay a hefty bill to connect households to the network because Bord G&aacute;is does not have the wherewithal to do so.  Given that connections could cost as much as &euro;2,500 per household, it would be far cheaper to supply alternative forms of power.  It is unfair that areas such as Sligo, Letterkenny or Longford are unable to attract natural gas.  Several years ago, many towns in counties Galway and Mayo were ruled out for gas supply, even though the pipeline originated in County Mayo.  It was a sore point that gas from one of our biggest finds, the Corrib gas field, would pass through the two counties for economic reasons.  However, a way around the problem was found by putting several towns and villages into groups of a sufficient size to make a connection economically feasible.</P>
        <P>The north west comprises a huge area and both Sligo and Letterkenny are crucial to the development of the region.  If Galway city is taken out of the equation, no heavy industrial hitters are left other than in Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Waterford.  For obvious reasons, therefore, it is important that we replicate the Galway model in Sligo and, to a lesser degree, in Letterkenny.  It will be impossible to achieve that goal unless these towns have access to natural gas at an affordable price.</P>
        <P>I am delighted that Bord G&aacute;is is involved in the supply of electricity because competition is important.  It recently purchased a large wind farm in my county.  I wonder how this will work out in practice because while we understand the ESB&rsquo;s role in this, the need for alternative energy is increasing.  Although I have amassed a fair degree of knowledge on how wind farms work, I cannot understand why it is apparently as difficult to get a contract to sell wind electricity to the national grid as it is to get into heaven.  We all want more wind energy but it seems to be beyond the bounds of possibility to supply it even where people have developed projects in good locations.  I hope the entry of Bord G&aacute;is into the electricity market will not make it more difficult for wind farm operators.  I do not refer to huge companies but to individuals and community based operations.  Wind farms are vital for our future, so the impediments placed in the way of connecting them to the national grid will have to be resolved.</P>
        <P>I am not sure how far down the road Bord G&aacute;is has proceeded with its dual fuel supply project.  I hope it will be as good on the electricity side as it is in its core business.  There is need for great competition in that market.  I am not saying I have a bone to pick with the ESB group of companies as such.  However, we all know what happens with a dominant player in the market and we do not need to spend time on that here.</P><Col N="67"/>
        <P>I hope the passage of the Bill will allow Bord G&aacute;is to carry out its plans over the next ten or 20 years.  I wish it well.  It has the managerial capacity to deliver.  It should always have an eye on value for money irrespective of how big it grows.  Whatever it does it must always be remembered that ultimately it is the people who are trying to make a living who are its customers.  If for any reason it is not able to supply a service at a price that the consumer can afford that would be the day it would go off track.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MJNolan"><NameTxt>Deputy M. J. Nolan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan is in the Chair.  If some of the energy that was clearly on show in Thomond Park last night in her home city could be tapped into, we might not need to spend so much money on Bord G&aacute;is.  The Bill is timely and it is important from Bord G&aacute;is&rsquo;s point of view that it pass all Stages in both Houses of the Oireachtas before the end of the year because it has an ambitious programme of investment over the next five to six years.  The Bill will increase the statutory borrowing limit for Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann from its existing &euro;1.7 billion to &euro;3 billion.  I am glad it does not simply give a <i>carte blanche</i> to BGE.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in consultation with the Minister for Finance will have a serious input into any of the expenditure BGE will embark on.  When the Bill passes all Stages it will have the ability to access funds to deliver on its strategic plan to 2012 and beyond.</P>
        <P>As we all know Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann was established in 1976 and was given a mandate at that stage to develop and maintain a system of supply for natural gas that was both economic and efficient.  Given that it was established at the time of the Kinsale gas field find, I was disappointed recently to read a report that only 9% of the gas supplied to domestic customers now comes from Irish gas fields.  It is all the more important that we should continue to explore for new gas sources off the west and south coasts in particular.  A recent seismic study of our coastline conducted by the Geological Survey of Ireland has indicated that geologically Ireland has the possibility of holding major deepwater reserves of oil and gas, which is encouraging.  This is particularly so for blocks off the west coast adjacent to the current find in Shell&rsquo;s Corrib gas field.  The study states that the south coast has proven reserves of both oil and gas in the Helvic and the Seven Heads fields.  It is good to know those reserves are there.  The problem of tapping into them in such deep water will prove difficult for the gas and oil exploration companies.</P>
        <P>Representatives of the gas and oil exploration companies recently made a presentation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  It was very clear that the cost of exploring for gas off our coasts can in some cases be prohibitive.  In today&rsquo;s debate some Members suggested that as a sovereign State we are giving too much away to oil and gas exploration companies when they find gas.  It is important to remember that when they were exploring for oil and gas in the North Sea, their expectation was that for every three drillings made, they would hit oil in one.  The experience in Ireland over the past 20 years has been one hit in 40 or 50 drillings, which would seriously discourage any international oil exploration company from taking a chance on drilling off the Irish coast.</P>
        <P>Based on the report from which I have just quoted, reserves do exist.  Perhaps as the oil and gas supplies internationally gradually diminish, it will become more economical for companies to consider Ireland as a place worth exploring for those gas and oil reserves.  I understand it costs approximately $400,000 to $500,000 a day to bring on these rigs to explore for oil and gas.  As time goes on perhaps more interest will be shown in developing Irish gas and oil fields and we can build on the network that has been put in place since 1976.  We now have a sophisticated network running through the country.  Some 18 counties are served by Bord G&aacute;is.  Presumably when funding is put in place and when the time is right the other counties will be in a position to access domestic and industrial gas from Bord G&aacute;is.</P><Col N="68"/>
        <P>Carlow was one of the first towns to benefit from Bord G&aacute;is supply.  While the gas line did not come through Carlow, because of the presence of the sugar factory in the town, which would have been a very big energy user, it was found to be economic to run a spur from the main line to service the sugar factory which was one of the biggest users of natural gas during the sugar campaign season which ran from September to January.  That spur coming into the town allowed a domestic supply network to be installed and many of the developers who were building housing estates in the town were able to put in a service for those new houses, which has proved very successful.  We have been very fortunate in being able to avail of the gas supply when it came on stream in 1976.</P>
        <P>From small beginnings when the original borrowing limit for BGE was &euro;25 million, its recent financial report showed that last year it had a turnover of, I believe, &euro;1.2 billion, with significant profits also.  This has benefited the Government as a stakeholder.  Bord G&aacute;is has more than 600,000 customers.  As the network expands into other counties, that customer base will clearly increase.  The Sustainable Energy Act 2002 increased the borrowing limit for BGE from &euro;700 million to &euro;1.7 billion, which was a vast increase at the time and catered for most of BGE&rsquo;s expansion and capital investment needs.  It now finds that due to the ongoing investment required and the significant cost of capital and labour-intensive investments, that requirement must be increased to &euro;3 billion.</P>
        <P>In the past ten years the network has been transformed with the construction of a number of new pipelines.  There is one to the west, which goes from Dublin to Galway, and a spur from this goes to Limerick.  There is the South-North pipeline which provides a security of supply for Northern Ireland and a gas supply to many of the towns on the way.  The Mayo-Galway pipeline will facilitate the delivery of natural gas to a number of towns along that route, which is very helpful to many towns in Galway and Mayo.  It will also facilitate transportation of the Corrib gas to the Irish market in due course.</P>
        <P>One of the issues indicated to us by a number of international companies is that the supply of a terminal in Mayo for the storage of gas may encourage other international exploration companies to come on board and consider Ireland as an area to explore.  Unlike oil, gas must be stored on land and the costs involved are significant.  Now we have one company prepared to invest in and supply the terminal, other companies may be able to avail of the facility if gas is found off the west coast.</P>
        <P>In announcing its annual results Bord G&aacute;is unveiled details of an ambitious corporate strategy for the company up to 2014.  The company published at the time the results for the year ending 31 December 2007, which showed a significant increase in profits.  Among the strategic highlights was the entrance into the residential electricity market by the company, which is good because it will provide competition in a sector which had a monopoly until now.  Both domestic and commercial customers will welcome that.</P>
        <P>The strategy also highlighted the transformation of the company to a full service energy company supplying both gas and electricity.  Customers North and South will be given a real competitive choice.  The company has a &euro;2 billion investment in existing and new business and has championed energy sustainability by investing in renewable power as part of the electricity generation portfolio.  I am glad to see it is being proactive in doing so.  It is hoped to extend the customer base to the 1 million mark, establishing Bord G&aacute;is as the leading dual energy supplier on the island of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Among the financial year highlights was group turnover, which increased by 10% to &euro;1.215 billion, as in 2006 it was &euro;1.1 billion.  There was growth of 29% in profits before tax to &euro;166 million, compared to &euro;129 million in 2006.  Gross sales increased by 8% to &euro;763 million, com<Col N="69"/>pared to &euro;710 million in 2006.  Gas transportation sales increased by 8% to &euro;169 million, a slight increase on the 2006 figure.  Electricity sales increased by 18% to &euro;239 million.</P>
        <P>The company is set for a period of major growth and development as it establishes itself as a leading energy supplier on the island of Ireland, with plans to double its value and growth in customer base to over 1 million by 2014.  While natural gas will remain the key part of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s business, the company looks forward to developing a diverse portfolio of assets within the Irish energy sector.  It is to be welcomed that it is not just a single product company.  Of the &euro;2 billion investment earmarked to 2014, &euro;1 billion will be set aside for investment in new business areas, which is also welcome.</P>
        <P>In his statement about the corporate outlook, chief executive John Mullen indicated Bord G&aacute;is &ldquo;is confident of its prospects in the coming years and this confidence emanates from an already exceptionally strong business space and from the roll-out of the company&rsquo;s ambitious corporate strategy, which will benefit shareholders and business alike&rdquo;.  That is positive.</P>
        <P>Indigenous gas supplies accounted for only 9% of the total gas demand during 2007, a percentage which will decrease in the absence of further landings of gas.  This is the reason it is critical for us to encourage, in whatever way we can as a country, international exploration companies in seeking new sources of gas off our coast.</P>
        <P>Ireland may not be recognised as a major player in international gas and oil exploration but it is important to acknowledge we have a number of companies, some of which &mdash; like Tullow Oil &mdash; are very successful.  Despite the fact that the company is registered in London, it is seen as one of this country&rsquo;s biggest successes in the oil and gas exploration industry.  It has 120 operation licences in over 22 countries.  Other companies operate across the globe in a variety of capacities in resources development and exploration.  They include Petroceltic, which is in Europe and Africa; PetroNeft, which operates in western Siberia; Dragon Oil, which has offshore fields in central Asia and petrol resources in the Middle East; AMEC in the US, Africa and Asia; and Pan Andean Resources, which operates in South America and the Gulf of Mexico.  We have an interest in the oil and gas exploration area and even to encourage them to return to explore off our coast would be helpful.</P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s requirement for an increase in the statutory borrowing limit has been brought about by the continued growth in the scale of its business, which we have seen since the establishment of the company.  It will reach its current statutory borrowing limit by 2009, which means we must have this legislation on the Statute Book for it to avail of increased limits for borrowing.  Such an increase in the borrowing limit is required to allow Bord G&aacute;is continue to fund its capital expenditure programme over the next five years.  This programme includes the ongoing expansion of its core gas business as it develops as a major energy company.</P>
        <P>It is essential the Bill is passed by the Houses before they go into recess for Christmas and Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s strategy is to develop as a dual fuel provider in the energy market, bringing about competition in both gas and the electricity sectors.  It contributes to security of supply in both and makes a significant contribution to environmental sustainability through investment in renewable and alternative energy projects.  It has proven its commitments in that regard, which is welcome.</P>
        <P>An increase in the statutory borrowing limit does not give <i>carte blanche </i> to Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to borrow to that limit.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, will have a significant input into what it spends the money on and when it does so.  The proposed increase being debated in Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s borrowing limit is in line with similar broad increases for other State energy companies.</P><Col N="70"/>
        <P>The last amendment to Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s statutory borrowing was in 2002 when it was increased from &euro;700 million to &euro;1.7 billion.  Since then, a number of projects have been completed by Bord G&aacute;is.  The construction of a second gas interconnector to secure the supply of natural gas was completed in 2003 at a cost of &euro;300 million.  A ring main pipeline from Dublin to Galway to Limerick was completed in 2003 also, at a cost of &euro;400 million.  The north west pipeline from Belfast to Derry was completed to serve the ESB-owned power plant located there, which facilitated the later development of a gas distribution network to five towns along the pipeline route.  That was completed in the following year, 2004, at a cost of &euro;100 million.  These projects demonstrate that Bord G&aacute;is has been proactive in developing its business.  I am happy to support the Bill.  I hope the success we have seen with Bord G&aacute;is in recent years will continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this important Bill on the necessity of extending the provision of gas connections nationally.  Bord G&aacute;is is a good company under its chief executive, Mr. John Mullins.  It is an essential part of our infrastructure and it has a good future.  We need alternative fuel sources to oil.  It is important that we explore all the options in terms of alternative energy and support the work that is ongoing in that regard.  I am pleased the Bill is before the House and that there is an opportunity to contribute to the debate on how it affects us.</P>
        <P>The Bill is intended to extend the Gas Acts 1976 to 2002, and to use capital to develop an energy company, which will provide gas network services and the procurement and supply of natural gas and electricity, gas transmission and distribution network, including conventional generation, and renewables, investment in gas storage for security of supply, and development of the electricity supply business.</P>
        <P>The oil price rise in the past year has had a significant effect on many businesses throughout the country.  The escalating cost of electricity was brought home to me in particular following the wet summer, which resulted in the need to dry grain after the terrible harvest.  The cost of energy required to dry the grain affected co-operatives and private merchants.  We cannot sustain high energy costs.  We must bring the gas that is off our shores to land.  I cannot understand why people object to the work of Shell in bringing natural gas to land.  Perhaps the matter was not handled properly but the natural gas we have in abundance off our shores must be made available to us.</P>
        <P>It is important that Bord G&aacute;is would make Tipperary town a priority for connection to gas in 2009.  The nearest lines to Tipperary town are the Limerick line, which is located at Ballylanders, and the Cashel gas line, which will be completed in the next few months.  I have had many representations from large employers in the area indicating that the increased cost of fuel, as well as EPA directives about heavy oil usage, mean that switching to natural gas is a priority for them.  I refer to creameries and private merchants among other employers.  The connection of a gas line to Tipperary would ensure that such people could can stay in business and that would guarantee that jobs would stay in the town.  We are experiencing a time of recession, and nobody has the answer as to when it will end.</P>
        <P>What we, as public representatives, have to do is highlight what will improve our communities.  We must examine what will make our country better for people, what will make young people stay on the land in a time of depression, what will nourish and sustain them in the coming years and what will prove to be a far-sighted and worthwhile investment in Ireland&rsquo;s future.  It is most important that we make a worthwhile investment in the Ireland of the future. <Col N="71"/> From time to time we debate in the D&aacute;il about what we should do.  When we invest in the future we are doing something that is worthwhile for the generations to come.</P>
        <P>Small and medium-sized business are struggling beyond belief at present.  Every Deputy in this House can see that in the course of his or her week&rsquo;s work.  One of the best things that we can do for the future is to provide sustainable, reliable energy resources in which employers can have faith and that will provide them with their requirements.  By giving people a direct connection to gas, we are preserving manufacturing in Ireland in the future, by providing a reasonable, clean fuel directly, and one which is much cheaper than oil and also complies with EPA directives.</P>
        <P>I cannot stress sufficiently how valuable it is for Ireland to have as many fuel options as possible.  Extending the gas supply across the country must be a priority, as it would give people options about the fuel choice in their homes, thereby increasing fuel efficiency, while creating competition in the market and, accordingly, making fuel costs lower.  That would mean there is a fuel available to compete with oil, the cost of which is exceptionally high at present, which would help both industry and individual households to save money in both the short term and the long term.</P>
        <P>Having a gas line to supply both individuals and businesses would be a great achievement for Tipperary town.  It would also serve to attract further investment to the area, as many overseas companies consider a gas line is essential infrastructure in the same way as roads or broadband.  Tipperary will be considered in the coming months as one of the towns coming under phase 3 for connection in 2009.  I have the support of businesses, home owners, and the chamber of commerce in the area for that move.  With increased oil prices and instability in the oil market it would be a positive development to have an alternative fuel source directly in Ireland and in Tipperary.  While the investment is large, it is of vital importance that we make it because in order to save money on energy costs in the long run, we must put the best technology in place.  We need an electricity and energy grid that works in tandem with all the energy providers of which we can avail, and gas is only one of those.  While we cannot do so through this Bill, we need to create an energy grid that can utilise fully all the different energy media, thereby lowering the cost of resources and making us as independent and competitive as possible.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I referred to the considerable number of businesses around the country that are on their knees.  They have failed to be competitive not because of their own activities but because of difficulties forced upon them.  Jobs will be lost in many businesses.  In my constituency, the small parish of Knockavilla and Donaskeigh, nor far from which the Minister has relations, has three major employers.  Gerkros Heating Technology in Donaskeigh is now in financial difficulty and an examiner has been appointed in respect thereof.  This company has been very much to the fore in the alternative energy industry.  It has employed 60 to 70 people in a small rural area and has expanded greatly but it is now in examinership.  Up the road in Dundrum, O&rsquo;Dwyer Steel, which was founded by Mr. John G. O&rsquo;Dwyer some 60 years ago and taken over by workers, has given protective notice to all its staff simply because it is not competitive.  These companies are in a small rural parish.  If we do not remain competitive, this story will resonate in every county in the country.  It is vital to remain competitive.  I hope every Member supports this Bill to ensure our energy sector will remain and become increasingly competitive.</P>

	<P>I welcome the chance to speak about Bord G&aacute;is and pay tribute to its management and staff on the handling of the Gaswest project.  I have been listening to comments, including those of Deputy Tom Hayes, on the need for gas in various counties.  We are lucky that the Gaswest project is providing gas to 12 towns in Mayo and Galway.  The management of the project on the part of John Mullins and his team has been extremely professional.  The impact of the project has been minimised through proactive working relationships with local authorities, both officials and elected members, and with various business organisations in the area.  The project is an example to other State organisations of how to roll out complicated infrastructure.</P>
        <P>The Gaswest project depends on the passage of this Bill.  It involves an investment of &euro;40 million in 12 towns in Mayo and Galway, thus enhancing our economic potential and offering businesses and domestic users a choice in a very competitive fuel market.  Given the increases in fuel prices in the past two years, piped natural gas is important to the region.</P>
        <P>The Gaswest project would not be possible without bringing the Corrib gas ashore.  I welcome the initiative of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, in setting up the north-west Mayo forum.  I appeal to everybody to use this forum to air their differences and concerns regarding the project, thereby allowing us to reach agreement and complete the project as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The Gaswest project is being rolled out but there are outstanding applications with the regulator and Bord G&aacute;is from various towns in the area.  I speak on behalf of the east Mayo towns of Swinford, Foxford, Kiltimagh, Ballaghaderreen and Charlestown, all of which serve a key economic area in the country and are being outpaced by gas developments in adjoining towns.  This area of Mayo is home to Ireland West Airport Knock, which has the potential to be an enormous driver of industry in the area in the coming years.  A gas supply would be a key element in finally allowing the airport to fulfil its potential.</P>
        <P>There is an outstanding gas application from Belmullet, the capital town of Erris.  It is the home to the Corrib gas field and also to all the controversy and trouble associated therewith.  There is thriving industry in Belmullet but recognition should be accorded to the difficulties that have been faced in the area.  I hope this matter can be addressed by the forum and the regulator in the coming weeks and months.</P>
        <P>The operations of Bord G&aacute;is and its embracing of new alternative energies in recent years serve as an example to other companies.  We are lucky that both Bord G&aacute;is and the ESB, our two main power and energy companies, are embracing the need to change their methods of business to respond to the challenges of climate change, and to consumer demand as consumers become educated on climate change and alternative energy.</P>
        <P>The investment flagged in this Bill will allow Bord G&aacute;is to further its work in this area and increase the options available to its consumers to provide energy-efficient and energy-friendly products.  The board of Bord G&aacute;is was appointed by the Minister.  Credit is due to it on its foresight in respect of the advancement of the company in recent years.  It has been transformed from a single-utility operation into an energy company that not only provides gas but also provides electricity.  When considering this Bill, it is timely and appropriate for the House to acknowledge this transformation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill and the Minister&rsquo;s intention to expand the borrowing limits.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann was established in 1976 with a mandate to develop and maintain a system for the supply of natural gas nationally.  The original borrowing limit in 1976 was &euro;25 million.  Since then the company has provided a vital role in the growth of the Irish <Col N="73"/>economy through the development of the gas network, which comprises almost 12,500 km of pipeline and serves more than 600,000 customers.  Eighteen counties in the Republic and four in Northern Ireland are now connected to the natural gas network.  Bord G&aacute;is has an ambitious capital investment programme amounting to &euro;2 billion over the next five years and it has a view to becoming a competitive dual fuel supplier in the Irish market.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s energy policy framework document covering the period to 2020, Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland, supports the sustainable development of the State energy companies.  Competition and environmental sustainability are key pillars of that policy and Bord G&aacute;is will continue to meet its emergency response standards and pipeline safety standards.</P>
        <P>In recent years, Bord G&aacute;is has entered the retail electricity market.  While its present customer base is mainly in the industrial-commercial sector, I welcome the fact that it intends to enter the domestic retail market in 2009.  This will obviously provide welcome competition in this sector.  Owing to its retail gas business, Bord G&aacute;is already has the necessary customer service and billing systems in place to support a domestic electricity retail service.</P>
        <P>The development of the gas network over the coming five years will include adding 1,500 km of pipeline to the network, the connection of 150 new customers, the replacement of the remaining cast-iron network with polythene pipes and investment in new systems and technology to provide the customer with a better service.</P>
        <P>This brings me to my point on my county and that of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, which we have been representing for some years.  It is in respect of Wexford that I criticise Bord G&aacute;is and different Ministers severely.  Sometimes I wonder whether Ministers realise Wexford in the sunny south east is actually part of Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Counties Waterford, Kilkenny, Carlow and Wicklow all have gas supplies, yet Wexford, which they surround, has none.  On many occasions we asked Bord G&aacute;is to consider extending to Wexford and were told this would happen after its next review.  Those reviews came and went and so did the following ones.  Less than a year ago I was told that extension might happen on the next review but that one has also come and gone.  Bord G&aacute;is claims that bringing supply to Wexford is not justified.</P>
        <P>It is neither fair nor equitable that Wexford should continue at a disadvantage to other counties in respect of attracting new industries and supplying and maintaining those already there.  There is a great opportunity.  The ESB station at Great Island has been sold to a Spanish company which obviously has plans for the future.  Experts tell me that the quickest, cheapest and easiest way to bring gas to Wexford is from Waterford, via New Ross, supplying Great Island and the other industries there and extending into the greater Wexford area.</P>
        <P>Wexford has significant industries.  As Deputy Hayes said, many of them are currently under pressure with fuel, high energy and other related charges.  It is very important that Wexford be considered in this major &euro;2 billion expansion programme by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.  There are many ways of extending the pipeline.  I suggested the Waterford route but it might equally come from Arklow or Carlow which both border County Wexford.  There are a number of ways of extending the pipeline to Wexford at a low and reasonable cost.  It would be a great advantage in supporting the industries already there and would help them to expand.  More important, it would be a cornerstone in attracting new industry to the county.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to consider seriously the suggestion I made about extending the line to Wexford.  We need this now and have been fobbed off by Bord G&aacute;is for years, despite repeated <Col N="74"/>promises from the company.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, is a very fair man and he will want the people of Wexford, businesspeople and consumers alike, to have the same gas supply enjoyed by almost every other county.  Eighteen other counties have supply as do a number of counties in Northern Ireland.  I have no problem with that but it is the right time to extend supply to my county, which is also the Leas-Cheann Comhairle&rsquo;s county.  If the Minister can do that we will say he has done a good job in his Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill which is very important.  Deputies have the chance to highlight the good work done by Bord G&aacute;is in recent years.  Most other speakers have welcomed the publication of the Bill which will provide for the increase in the statutory borrowing limit of Bord G&aacute;is from &euro;1.7 billion to &euro;3 billion.</P>
        <P>The introduction of this legislation is a tribute to Bord G&aacute;is.  The company is a great example of what can be achieved in the State sector.  The commercial State body was founded in 1976, employs more than 770 staff and now has a pipeline network of over 10,000 kilometres.  There are two main businesses, namely, networks and the energy supply.  The gas distribution network includes two sub-sea interconnectors to Scotland, a spur line to the Isle of Man and two pipelines to Northern Ireland, in addition to a network of distribution lines throughout Ireland.  Bord G&aacute;is made a considerable profit last year but needs the money badly.  Its profits before tax were &euro;166 million.</P>
        <P>As a Deputy from County Clare, I have seen at first hand the work that Bord G&aacute;is and its contractors do.  Much of the pipeline that was extended from the west to Galway and into County Clare across the Shannon came through my own parish.  It came through my own land and I facilitated Bord G&aacute;is in that.  This was a huge project, as I am sure the Minister will acknowledge.  It was carried out by an Italian contracting company and involved much work, particularly with regard to safety, which is most important.  Bord G&aacute;is is in the process of replacing its cast iron pipes, with approximately 94% of these now replaced by PVC pipes.  Last year 177 kilometres were laid down throughout the country.  It is necessary to have these pipes at a very high standard for reasons of safety.</P>
        <P>I saw at first hand the intensive work done by the contractors and the way in which gas is distributed in a very safe manner in these pipelines.  Inspections of gas lines regularly take place.  I wish to mention the terrible accident that happened last year just a mile from my house.  A helicopter that was inspecting the lines crashed and a Bord G&aacute;is employee was killed.  I paid tribute to him, a man from Dublin who gave a lot of time and work to the company.  People in the parish were very saddened by that incident.</P>
        <P>The company is also an energy supplier.  Bord G&aacute;is supplies most of the residential gas market in this country.  This market was open for competition in July 2007.  In 2001, the company entered the retail electricity market and now enjoys a growing market share.  In 2006, it had 8% of the Irish electricity supply.  It has 575,000 natural gas customers and will have more than 600,000 by the end of the year, an increase of 5%.  Bord G&aacute;is has been doing a good job in an efficient way, selling gas products.  It held 37% of the total gas sales market in 2006.  It is a very successful company and I commend it for its foresight and for the way in which it has adapted to the ever evolving needs of our changing environment.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to the House and I am delighted he has stayed to hear the debate.  I also commend him for his first national energy efficiency action plan 2007-20.  It is important we have the plan in place in order that, when our resources  come on line, <Col N="75"/>in particular the Corrib field, they are used as efficiently as possible.  In that way we can become almost self-sufficient in gas.</P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is has invested and is committed to playing a very important role in delivering competitive energy to the Irish industry.  Only recently it announced the purchase of a 30 MW wind farm development in the west.  Deputy Connaughton spoke of this earlier.  It has invested approximately &euro;50 million and the development is expected to be in operation by 2011, supplying 10,000 homes.  That shows the foresight of the company.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year Bord G&aacute;is announced a &euro;1 billion investment in new business areas.  The company is already building a 445 MW gas-fired power plant at Whitegate in County Cork which will cost approximately &euro;400 million and it is pursuing other general power development opportunities, both conventional and renewable.</P>
        <P>Most speakers mentioned climate change and the effects this will have on generations to come.  I am delighted climate change is at the top of the agenda for Bord G&aacute;is.  There are fewer carbon emissions from natural gas than from any other fuel.  It is cleaner than the alternative fossil fuels and contains less sulphur, an important factor for air quality.  It is more environmentally friendly.  Energy experts cite natural gas as an important energy bridge for the next decade in contributing to a decrease in Ireland&rsquo;s CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.</P>
        <P>On 14 November last Bord G&aacute;is, in conjunction with EnviroManagement Services, sponsored a climate change conference in Cork entitled Partnership for Change.  Attended by more than 300 environmentalists, climate change activists, NGOs and policy officers, the conference heard Dr. Rajendra K. Pachauri, chair of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, express hope and optimism for the future.  In particular, Dr. Pachauri asked young people to harness the power of their generation for change and to meet the challenge presented by climate change.</P>
        <P>This morning I consulted Bord G&aacute;is&rsquo;s user friendly website and there is no doubt the company is responding to the climate change challenge, contributing to lowering CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions and limiting the effects of climate change.  As I indicated, Bord G&aacute;is supplies natural gas to more than 500,000 households and serves up to 1,700 small businesses.  The company has extended the supply of gas into various towns and villages in the west and now supplies natural gas in 18 counties.  In 2002, for example, 322 km of pipeline was laid to supply various towns and villages in County Clare.  The pipeline in County Clare was routed from Limerick via parts of Mellick to Cratloe and Sixmilebridge, from where it was routed through parts of Bunratty <i>en route </i>to Shannon town.  Since then, it has been extended further to Clarecastle and Ennis as well as Killaloe in east Clare.</P>
        <P>Those with access to natural gas are satisfied with the product, which is clean, efficient and controllable.  Since the 1980s, an increasing number of people have been won over to natural gas because it remains the most cost effective fuel on the market.  We should try to ensure it is made available to every town and village in the country.  Unfortunately, in County Clare the gas pipeline which was extended from Limerick and Sixmilebridge does not serve everyone in Bunratty.  People living on the Hill Road and Low Road areas of the town are crying out to have the natural gas pipeline extended but have been advised by Bord G&aacute;is officials and local councillors that it would not be cost effective to do so, even though the pipeline is routed along the main Shannon to Sixmilebridge road, which is less than one quarter of a mile away.  As someone who promotes natural gas and greener energy policies, I urge the Minister to examine this issue.  The position is similar with regard to new sewerage schemes which will only be operational in the main parts of Bunratty and will not be extended further.  The Minister should explore ways of extending the gas network to ensure our rural towns and villages reap the rewards and benefits of this valuable energy resource.</P><Col N="76"/>
        <P>The development of natural gas infrastructure is essential in assisting County Clare to maintain its competitiveness.  I urge Bord G&aacute;is and the Government to examine whether gas pipelines could be extended to cluster areas around villages and towns.  Price is the primary reason more and more customers are being won over to natural gas.  Recently the Commission for Energy Regulation published the Bord G&aacute;is submission document on natural gas pricing.  The company has confirmed it will apply for a final average increase of 3.5% on natural gas bills for residential and small business customers in January 2009.  While wholesale gas prices have fallen worldwide in recent weeks, they remain approximately 50% higher than they were at this time last year.  The increase requested by Bord G&aacute;is would add between &euro;3.50 and &euro;5.60 to an average household gas bill.</P>
        <P>Last July, the Commission on Energy Regulation approved a 20% increase in the price of gas charged to households and small businesses.  The increased rates came into effect last month, adding approximately &euro;13 to the average domestic bill.  The ESB, which supplies electricity to 1.7 million households, also expects an increase in the price of electricity to be approved.  These price increases will have the greatest impact on low income families who spend 13% of disposal income on energy and do nothing to encourage consumers to switch to natural gas.  Energy affordability is crucial for lower income families and industries throughout the country, many of which are experiencing serious strain as they try to ride out the current crisis.</P>
        <P>Deputies are aware of the value of gas and oil resources.  In 2006, for example, a conflict arose between Russia and Ukraine when the former threatened to withdraw oil supplies to the latter.  In Russia and the south Caucasus region, where pipelines traverse different national territories, problems can arise when such threats are made.  Russia&rsquo;s decision to seek from Ukraine a fourfold increase in the price of gas triggered a major political crisis, including in western European countries such as France, Italy, Austria and Slovenia, all of which are heavily dependent on Russian oil supplies.  The potential crisis was eventually settled this year after a series of tit-for-tat actions by both sides.  As a result, energy supplies to Europe are now much more secure.</P>
        <P>Figures on worldwide energy consumption in 2006 show that we are heavily dependent on oil, which accounts for 36% of overall consumption.  It is followed by coal, gas, nuclear energy and hydro-energy, which account, respectively, for 28%, 24%, 6% and 6% of global energy consumption.  The share of natural gas in worldwide consumption has increased from 16% in the 1970s to 24% in 2006.  With a decrease in the use of coal expected, gas consumption is anticipated to rise to approximately 30% of overall energy consumption.</P>
        <P>I welcome Bord G&aacute;is&rsquo;s commitment to contribute &euro;2.4 million to enable the expansion of Sustainable Energy Ireland&rsquo;s warmer home scheme to more households, with half this amount to be expended this winter.  The scheme aims to improve the efficiency and comfort conditions of homes occupied by lower income families.  To qualify for the scheme applicants must be in receipt of a social welfare fuel allowance or disability allowance.  Any scheme which helps lower income families to afford a warmer home is welcome.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the gas smart meter is another way of controlling energy costs.  The chief executive officer of Bord G&aacute;is claims that the real advantages of smart card metering arise from customers being able to control energy consumption costs.  Consumers can decide how much they want to spend on energy and pre-pay by purchasing a smart card.  This is a welcome development.</P>
        <P>While a proportion of Ireland&rsquo;s gas requirements come from the Kinsale Head field, where a storage agreement is in place with Marathon Oil, much of the gas consumed in Ireland is <Col N="77"/>pumped via Scotland from the North Sea producers based in Norway.  I understand gas from the United Kingdom accounts for approximately 90% of Irish gas consumption.</P>
        <P>A recent problem in one of the pipes through which the gas flows has highlighted the importance of ensuring a constant supply is available.  When the supply from the UK was curtailed, the price increased.  Natural gas accounts for 25% of primary energy demand in Ireland, a share that is in line with both worldwide and European averages, at 24%.  The economy is highly dependent on imported energy sources.  We have all witnessed the effect of the hike in world oil prices on the economy in recent times.  We have a high dependency on oil.  Some 58% of Ireland&rsquo;s primary energy is oil, as compared to 36% worldwide and 41% in Europe.</P>
        <P>In 1978 gas was first produced in Ireland at Kinsale, and while it continues to produce gas, the output of this field and its satellites will be exhausted in the near future.  As I have indicated, some 93% of our gas is sourced from the UK.  Further developments both in Shannon LNG across the Shannon estuary, in my constituency, at Ballylongford, County Kerry &mdash; Deputy Deenihan spoke of that today &mdash; and Corrib gas in County Mayo, are important sources for Ireland.  It is estimated the Corrib gas field will produce 60% of Ireland&rsquo;s demand for gas on an annual basis and that is very significant.  These projects should secure our demand for energy resources for the foreseeable future.  The Shannon LNG company has entered an option to purchase agreement with Shannon Development as regards 281 acres of the 600-acre site between Tarbert and Ballylongford.  This will become the site of a major liquefied natural gas import terminal.  Some people have concerns in relation to the development of the project and I hope these matters will be resolved in the near future.</P>
        <P>LNG is produced in locations where reserves of gas are discovered, but often too far from markets to economically transport the gas by pipeline.  LNG export sources include Algeria, Egypt, Malaysia, Qatar and Trinidad, while LNG imports are planned from a number of other countries, namely, Norway, Russia and Venezuela.  Industry sources believe our neighbours in the UK will be importing half their natural gas needs by 2011 from remote fields in Russia and Algeria.  In 2007, 93% of the all-Ireland gas demand was sourced from Great Britain and in the short-term it will continue to play a very important role in complementing the Corrib gas field.</P>
        <P>To chart the future Bord G&aacute;is needs to be in a position to explore new growth areas and develop its gas network.  To complete this journey it needs to be in a position to increase its statutory borrowing limits and I certainly support the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution.  I do not believe I have ever seen a shorter Bill before the House.  Nevertheless, it is of major importance and I welcome the fact the Minister has outlined most of the debate.  Bord G&aacute;is, unlike many of the State agencies, has set about, through the provisions of this Bill, expanding the distribution and network of natural gas throughout the country.  The list of counties with access to the network will include all of Leinster bar County Wexford, which Deputy Browne mentioned earlier, all of Munster bar County Kerry and only two in Connacht, Galway and Mayo.  I believe Galway and Mayo have been included because the link from east-west to connect with the Mayo line going towards Limerick cuts through County Galway.  Nevertheless, we see the importance of that in terms of the most recent development and extension to the electricity network, that is, the construction of the gas power station at Tynagh, Loughrea, County Galway.  When one reflects on the controversy generated by the proposal to bring gas onshore in Mayo, it must be very profitable for Shell to pursue this development, distribute the gas throughout the country and sell it to An Bord G&aacute;is.  It is ironic that Tynagh has become the source of the most recent generation, because it was one of the first places where the natural resources, lead and zinc, <Col N="78"/>were found in the past.  A very attractive deal was provided by the Government of the day to the people who developed that mine and it yielded enormous profits to them.</P>
        <P>It is important that the west achieves parity with other areas throughout the country, and hopefully because of the basic network that now exists, many towns in County Galway will benefit.  We are told there are 12 towns in Counties Galway and Mayo in terms of connection, but there are other towns that have the potential to be connected provided Bord G&aacute;is sees fit to develop such as Loughrea, Gort and Athenry in particular, as well as Ballinasloe.  The opportunity should be given for this important infrastructure to be developed there, to give an added advantage, few as they are, for attracting industry to the area.</P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is has had a 28% increase in profit after tax in the last year.  It must be acknowledged that it is one of the few State agencies able to report such a level of profitability.  The Bill, given the proposed increase in capital investment, is important and likewise the urgency of this must be acknowledged to allow Bord G&aacute;is to continue.  The most attractive aspect of this investment for me is that it will allow Bord G&aacute;is to diversify from the single resource of gas and become involved in renewables.  One thinks of the difficulties that have arisen over the last decade, some genuine but others spurious, that stagnated the production of electricity from renewables.  I think in particular of the great difficulties many projects have had to face in terms of the delays and additional costs incurred as a result of objections in the planning process.  Individuals and bodies such as D&uacute;chas, in the past, have objected to many worthy projects, which had they been put in place would now provide a major advantage given the high cost of oil and fossil fuel energy used in the generation of electricity.  There were difficulties and the Minister, his Department and the Government had to react to the situation that arose in Derrybrien.  On that hill another major project received planning permission but because of the likelihood that rare hen harriers were nesting in the area the project was delayed for two years at a high cost to the developers until it was allowed to go through.  As a consequence, the profitability of the technology changed and there is huge additional expense even before the project gets off the ground.  Many complained about the planning process for strategic infrastructure, but it was welcome insofar as it allowed meaningful projects to go through rather than having unnecessary and unjustifiable reasons for delay.  The initiative of Bord G&aacute;is which adopts a hands-on approach to all its developments can be seen in a positive light in the manner in which it approached the issue of entry onto lands, completed idts work and then got out without any hassle.</P>
        <P>I have asked on numerous occasions about the original project at Tynagh which was developed by Gama and then sold to Tynagh Energy Limited but have never received a satisfactory answer.  It has been reliably reported that the cost of generation per unit of electricity at Tynagh is very attractive; that the contract is irregular in that it pays for full capacity of output, regardless of drawdown.  I have asked many times if this can be confirmed.  If that is the case, it is no wonder we have such a high cost of electricity.  I ask the Minister to clarify this matter because it seems to be an unusual contract.  We are discussing the advantages of the Bill in bringing competition to the energy market but the contract at Tynagh rules out real competition.</P>
        <P>Many have mentioned reliability of supply.  Deputy Breen has mentioned that we find ourselves on the periphery of western Europe in the context of the difficulty which arose between Ukraine and Russia some years ago.  If it had developed, we would have been the first to have our supply line cut off.  The Bill provides for the storage of gas which will eliminate some of the difficulties that may arise in the future.  It is possible that gas stored can used to supply rural towns.</P><Col N="79"/>
        <P>Few agencies have provided or proposed to provide a network into sparsely populated or rural areas, unlike Bord G&aacute;is.  Recently we have seen, as a consequence of the budget, that the Government and the NRA have decided that some of the road network that was to be in place by the end of 2016 in the west is to be abandoned.  We do not know when work will recommence on these much needed projects which form part of the Atlantic corridor or east-west network.  We have the potential in the Bill to provide additional funding for the development of infrastructure for the supply of gas in the west.</P>
        <P>When we discuss conventional generation of electricity, I hope we will move away from oil and coal supplies.  If one is downwind of Moneypoint at Killaloe, County Clare there is ample evidence of air pollution, dust and other emissions.  I hope there will be a step in that direction to reduce our dependence on heavy fossil fuels such as coal and oil.</P>
        <P>What will happen in the midlands regarding the use of peat?  I hope the Minister will give a clear indication from his Department on the generation of electricity using peat.  There have been concerns about the loss of employment and the future of established traditions in the production of electricity in the midlands.  It is important that the Minister clearly indicates his policy on the continuation of the production of electricity using peat in central Ireland, particularly in view of the escalated prices charged for oil and gas.  Thankfully, they have now returned to more reasonable prices.  There were suggestions Bord G&aacute;is would have generating stations in the midlands to complement those traditionally established.  Many hope the Minister will clearly indicate his ideas in this regard.</P>
        <P>I will finish with the issues of competition and the cost of electricity.  Some three or four months ago everybody realised oil was expensive and that it was necessary for the ESB to increase its prices.  However, despite the increase allowed and although oil has reduced in price, the ESB is now seeking an additional increase.  While it is important that the Minister encourages competition, as intended with the resources being provided through the provisions of the Bill, he must also make the ESB aware of the difficulties a further increase in prices would create for many industries and small businesses which are at their wits end in their efforts to survive.  If it is necessary for subsidies to be provided, they should be considered as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies for their contributions and the indication of general support for the provisions of the Bill.  As Deputy Burke says, it is a short but critical Bill that will provide Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann with the ability to increase its capital base from the current level of &euro;1.7 billion to &euro;3 billion.</P>
        <P>Deputy Burke&rsquo;s last comment related to the cost of energy in the economy and the clear recognition that in order to have a competitive advantage we must ensure our prices are competitive and as low as they can be, given the variation in and volatility of international fuel prices.  In the past year we have seen volatility in gas, coal and oil prices which has caused difficulties for all players in terms of the price of energy in the market.</P>
        <P>With regard to gas supplies &mdash; this brings me to the point made by Deputy Coveney &mdash; I hope the significant reductions we have seen in recent times will mean that the price increase signalled may not now take place.  We should be into the realm of reductions such has been the consistent reduction in the price of gas.  However, this is a matter on which the energy regulator must decide and adjudicate.  The apportioning of fuel costs and the models used are in the hands of the regulator and it is up his office to bring down the cost where possible.</P>
        <P>The need across the economy for us to have a low-cost competitive energy supply frames my response to the number of Deputies who raised the possibility of the gas network being extended to a range of new towns.  I fully understand the impetus behind each Deputy&rsquo;s request, <Col N="80"/>including for Wexford, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle&rsquo;s county.  I understand the reason counties and towns seek the extension of the gas network as it may facilitate the development of other industries in these areas.  However, the primary responsibility of both the regulator and the companies involved is to be competitive and keep prices as low as possible.  In that regard, any decision to extend the network must be based on an economic case that demonstrates dthat there is cluster demand and a viable business case in terms of the increased cost involved in extending the network.</P>
        <P>Deputy McManus asked about the implications the Corrib project may have for gas prices.  The project should have an effect in reducing prices, but this will be marginal because we are, ultimately, connected with the UK gas markets which are, increasingly in turn, supplied by Norwegian and more distant gas supply sources.  I hear from people who have a knowledge of the market and how it works that an increased supply to a market where supply is constrained has the overall effect of dampening down prices.  Such a gap between supply and demand in recent years has driven prices higher.  Therefore, anything that helps to increase supply gives a cushion between supply and demand.  Even if it only has a marginal effect in terms of overall supply, it has a much more significant effect in terms of price reductions.  The availability of gas from a number of supply sources, including the Corrib gas field, would have an effect beyond the actual flows with regard to the overall market in reducing prices.  This is a factor on which all parties in the House are of a common mind.  We agree that we need to develop our natural resources, in this case our gas supplies.</P>
        <P>Deputy McManus asked about the taxation of any such gas supplies.  It was made clear in August 2007, when I was able to obtain Government approval for a change in the tax terms on profits from our natural resources, that the new tax rate that would apply &mdash; up to 40% on the most profitable fields &mdash; would only apply to new licences.  The arrangements for existing licences remain as they were when granted.  The State does not revoke or change contracts halfway through.  To do so would have significant implications for the reputation of the State across a range of businesses.  Even ordinary householders would understand this, as the conditions would be similar in the domestic environment.  If a householder made a contract with a builder to build an extension or a new house and then changed the terms half way through the process, their reputation would be damaged.  I was glad, on behalf of the State, to be able to increase the taxation terms in order that any future licence arrangements we enter into would give a greater return to the country.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Deputy Coveney raised a number of points with regard to the development of Bord G&aacute;is.  I agree that in its history it has shown itself to be a well managed and effective company which has made proper strategic investments.  I also agree with him on the number of new strategic directions that are appropriate.  As Minister, I support them.  The development of its capabilities as a dual fuel supplier where it may bring competition to the supply sector, be able to provide householders with billing and other arrangements for both electricity and gas supplies and bring about efficiencies brings real benefits to the householder.  This will benefit the electricity and gas markets and is something I very much support.</P>
    <P>I support the ongoing expansion of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann into the electricity area and its ambitions in that regard, particularly in the development of new renewable technologies, which I believe provide a real opportunity for expansion in our electricity system.</P>
          <P>I also agree with Deputy Coveney that the development of the company on an all-island basis was a strategically correct decision.  It allows the company to achieve greater efficiencies and to derive some of the cost benefits that arise from operating on an all-island basis.  Moreover, the gas and electricity markets here now are determined increasingly by east-west <Col N="81"/>relationships.  Our two-line interconnector with Scotland is a crucial item of infrastructure and highlights our utter dependence on the UK market, because more than 95% of our gas is imported from that supply source.  Moreover, the UK in turn has gone from being a gas exporter a mere four years ago to being a country that this year relies on imports for approximately 40% of its needs.  Consequently, we must recognise, when considering any gas future, how dependent we are on international markets and must protect our position accordingly.  I also agree with Deputy Coveney regarding the broader strategic points he was making.  It is important that Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and other parties here should develop their gas storage facilities, which will protect us from any future gas supply shock.</P>
        <P>I also agree with him it is appropriate not to limit the development of this new energy future in respect of renewable generation to the generation side only.  There is great potential for us to develop our transport system in a way that accommodates and benefits such a renewable electricity sector by using electricity as a primary fuel supply in addition to gas-powered and other vehicles.  I look forward, as the Minister with responsibility for energy, to working with the Minister for Transport to turn Ireland&rsquo;s transport system greener as we switch to sustainable long-term fuels.</P>
        <P>This will require strong companies in both private and public ownership.  I perceive publically and privately owned companies to have similar flexibility and ambition in respect of how they manage their affairs, which is appropriate and correct.  The Minister&rsquo;s job is to set the overall policy context and then to leave management and boards to use their own skills and expertise to develop business opportunities that will benefit the people in the long run.  I have given clear direction that the development of energy efficiencies and renewables constitutes the crucial energy policy direction I wish this State to take.  I look forward to companies from both the private and public sectors taking up the challenge to supply the energy needs of the Irish people.  I commend the support from both sides of the House for this Bill because I believe that by providing proper borrowing limits for Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, Members are helping it to achieve these two crucial objectives.</P>

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>A major impetus for this new legislation was a strong sense that the time was right to ascertain what could be done to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s ability to deliver on its potential as a venue for arbitration excellence.  There also was recognition that our primary governing statute in the domestic area is more than 50 years old and that some modernisation in this area might not go amiss.</P>
        <P>The key objective of the Bill is to create the legislative framework that will enable Ireland to capitalise upon the growing demand for non-judicial solutions for disputes arising within numerous spheres of activity, including commercial.  International arbitration in particular has developed as a multi-million euro business and countries throughout the world are competing to attract this business to their capital cities.</P>
        <P>Within Europe, the key players are Geneva, London and Paris.  Research has demonstrated that important concerns for parties when it comes to deciding on where to arbitrate their disputes are legal considerations, convenience of location, the availability of expertise and neutrality.  Ireland is well placed to build on the advantages which we have in all of these areas.  In addition, we also have the benefit of being an English-speaking location and this is a positive factor of considerable importance in the international commercial sphere.</P>
        <P>Ireland has three arbitration Acts and two different arbitration regimes.  One regime applies to arbitrations which are purely domestic in character and is governed for the most part by the Arbitration Act 1954, with small elements drawn from the Arbitration Act 1980 and the Arbitration (International Commercial) Act 1998.  As its name suggests, the latter Act governs arbitration which is both international and commercial in character.  In addition, certain international obligations with regard to the recognition and enforcement of arbitration awards are governed by the 1980 Act.  In summary, therefore, the legislative picture, viewed from the outside, could be perceived as being somewhat fractured and may hinder our goal of presenting ourselves as a modern venue that is suited to the business of arbitration with particular emphasis on the international dimension of this aspect of the law.</P>
        <P>It is widely acknowledged that the gold standard for arbitration legislation, particularly in the commercial arena, is the model law on arbitration that was adopted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, UNCITRAL, in 1985 and subsequently amended in 2006.  To date, it has been adopted by more than 50 countries.  While the model law was drawn up mainly with international commercial arbitration in mind, some countries, such as Scotland and New Zealand, have taken the decision to apply the it in the domestic arena as well.  Ireland adopted the model law in 1998 for international commercial arbitrations only and, with a decade of experience behind us in respect of its operation, it seemed appropriate to take the next step to move to a single arbitration code that would be based almost exclusively on the provisions of that law.</P><Col N="83"/>
        <P>In general, even a cursory glance through the newspapers demonstrates that the profile attached to arbitration, and to some extent to mediation, has grown considerably of late.  This suggests the introduction of this legislation is timely and that we have an opportunity to take advantage of what appears to be a growing trend.</P>
        <P>Arbitration comes within the ambit of what is commonly referred to as alternative dispute resolution.  In the past, there may have been a tendency to view the growing interest in such alternatives as suggestive of an implied criticism of the way in which the judicial system operates.  However, there now is an increasing recognition that access to justice has a number of facets and that the differing elements which facilitate such access have the ability to complement and enhance each other in a mutually supportive way.</P>
        <P>One obvious example of such support is to be found in the rules that were introduced in 2004 to facilitate the operation of the commercial list in the High Court.  By virtue of these rules, proceedings now can be adjourned to allow the parties to consider whether recourse to a process of mediation, conciliation or arbitration might be appropriate to the issue in dispute.  I understand that an increasing number of cases are being settled in this way, which has obvious benefits both for the parties themselves and for the State.</P>
        <P>There also is an appreciation that not every dispute necessarily requires a judicial solution.  In the commercial sphere in particular, the parties to a dispute may well have a long-standing business relationship they do not wish to jeopardise by engaging in traditional litigation or may wish, for reasons of business efficiency, to resolve their dispute outside the glare of unwelcome publicity.  Again, recourse to a process such as arbitration carries with it certain inherent advantages, such as confidentiality, speed of resolution and finality, which may well commend themselves in the circumstances I have outlined.</P>
        <P>I propose to go briefly through the various sections of the Bill and to dwell mainly on those aspects that introduce an element of change into our existing arbitration regime.  I am conscious that some technical amendments may be required on Committee Stage and I already have asked my Department to begin the work necessary to identify the extent of those amendments.  Against that background, Members may be assured I will listen carefully to any suggestions for improvement that can be made.</P>
        <P>Part 1 of the Bill deals with a range of preliminary matters, including the important matter of definitions.  I draw Members&rsquo; attention to the definition of &ldquo;standard arbitration&rdquo;.  Essentially, this covers arbitrations which are not international and commercial in character.  This is of significance in the context of those provisions of the Bill which apply exclusively to this kind of arbitration and I will deal with them in due course.  Another important definition is that of &ldquo;arbitration agreement&rdquo;.  This definition reflects changes introduced into the Model Law in 2006 which include clear provisions concerning the recognition of agreements in electronic form.  Part 1 also contains the transitional provisions and provides for the repeal of the existing Arbitration Acts.</P>
        <P>Part 2 of the Bill is its central core.  Section 6 applies the model law to all arbitration proceedings that take place within the State.  Hitherto, the law has only applied in respect of international commercial arbitration by virtue of the 1998 Act.  Section 7 provides for a rule regarding the commencement of arbitration proceedings that would be relevant in, for example, a Statute of Limitations context.  This is one of the areas where further technical modification may be required.  Section 8 will allow the courts to make use of the preparatory work of the UN commission when interpreting any provision of the model law brought before it and should be a valuable tool in ensuring consistency of approach in the application of the law across a range of cases.</P><Col N="84"/>
        <P>Section 9 deals with the functions of the High Court which, as was the case in the 1998 Act, is designated as the court of competent jurisdiction for certain matters that arise under the model law.  That law is predicated upon the idea that minimal court intervention is facilitative of the arbitration process.  However, it also recognises that there are certain aspects of arbitration where a court role is both appropriate and necessary, for example, where the parties are unable to agree on the arbitrator to be appointed or where there is a need to make an application to set aside an award.  Among the amendments made to the model law in 2006 was the inclusion of a number of new provisions dealing with interim measures and preliminary orders.  The High Court will also have a role in the recognition and enforcement of such orders.</P>
        <P>The High Court, by virtue of section 10, is also given the power to carry out the necessary obligations that may arise under Articles 9 and 27 of the model law.  Article 9 allows a court to grant interim measures of protection before or during arbitral proceedings.  Such measures would include the granting of interim injunctions and orders directed to the preservation of any goods that may be the subject of the dispute.  Article 27 allows the court to assist in the taking of evidence.  Under section 15 of the Bill, it is specified that such assistance may extend to arbitral proceedings occurring outside the State.</P>
        <P>An important new provision in section 10 is that the court will no longer have the power to order security for costs in the context of arbitration.  This will be a matter solely within the remit of the arbitral tribunal.  Section 19 specifies the role of the tribunal in this area.  In a similar vein, the court will no longer have the power to order discovery of documents in the context of arbitration.  The vesting of these powers solely in the arbitral tribunal is generally seen as beneficial in developing Ireland as a centre of arbitration excellence, although it will be open to the parties, should they so agree, to specify that the court can intervene.  Given that arbitration provides an alternative path to litigation, there is considerable evidence to suggest parties are anxious to avoid excessive court intervention.  This is especially evident when it comes to enforcing an award.</P>
        <P>Section 11 provides that there is to be finality in the court&rsquo;s determination in respect of a number of applications.  These include an application to stay a court action in a matter that is the subject of an arbitration agreement, to set aside an arbitral award and to recognise and enforce an arbitral award.  In a new departure for our law, all of these applications will no longer be subject to appeal in a higher court.</P>
        <P>Section 13 specifies that the default number of arbitrators, in the event that the parties do not agree otherwise, shall be one.  This is a departure from the model law which specifies the default number as being three.  The choice made is consistent with our existing arbitration practice and should assist in keeping the costs of arbitration to an acceptable level.</P>
        <P>Section 14 deals with the power to administer oaths which, by virtue of the Interpretation Act 2005, also includes the power to allow evidence to be given either by declaration or affirmation.  Given the inherent complexity of some arbitration disputes, it may sometimes happen that parallel proceedings involving a variety of parties may come into being.  In such cases, it can be advantageous if the various proceedings can be consolidated or run concurrently.  Section 16 deals with this area.  However, because the authority of the arbitrator essentially derives from the agreement of the parties, consolidation or the holding of concurrent hearings cannot occur unless there is a willingness on the part of all parties.</P>
        <P>Sections 18 to 22 supplement the model law in respect of a range of matters.  They touch upon the power of the arbitral tribunal to award interest and costs and also deal with the liability of the arbitrator.  It is important, particularly in the context of international arbitrations, that arbitrators are protected against unmeritorious litigation by aggrieved parties who might <Col N="85"/>be unhappy with the fact that an award was made against them.  A provision restricting liability demonstrates commitment to the arbitral process and is a common feature of arbitration regimes in other jurisdictions.  A final element in this mix relates to the enforceability of the arbitration award and its binding effect, critical elements within the overall arbitral process.</P>
        <P>Sections 23 and 24 deal with various international agreements to which Ireland is already a party and replicate provisions already provided for in legislation dating back to 1954 and 1980, respectively.  Chief among these agreements is the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards.  This is generally regarded as the foundation of international arbitration and facilitates international trade throughout the world.  It has been ratified by more than 140 countries.  This broad range of support ensures arbitral awards will be readily enforceable in almost every jurisdiction of note.  This year saw the 50th anniversary of the convention and Dublin which hosted the prestigious conference of the International Council for Commercial Arbitration in June was centre stage in demonstrating support for its aims and principles.  The other agreements covered by these sections include the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, commonly referred to as the Washington Convention.  This convention is primarily devoted to investor-state dispute settlement.  The remaining agreements &mdash; the Geneva Convention and protocol &mdash; have largely been overtaken by the New York Convention, but retain their relevance for a limited number of countries.</P>
        <P>Sections 27 to 29 deal with the position of State authorities which, as is the case at present, will be bound by arbitration agreements in much the same way as a private entity.  They also deal with arbitrations that arise under statute.  Further adjustment of these provisions will be required to take account of the broad range of arbitrations that arise under various Acts within the remit of a number of Departments outside the justice framework.</P>
        <P>The final element of this central part of the Bill concerns small claims.  Section 30, although couched in somewhat different terms, essentially maintains a key provision first introduced into our arbitration legislation in 1998.  Broadly, it ensures the integrity of the existing small claims procedure that operates under the aegis of the District Court is retained in order that, regarding claims up to &euro;2,000 in value, the jurisdiction of the court cannot be ousted by an arbitration clause.</P>
        <P>I have referred to the concept of standard arbitrations.  For the most part, it is desirable to have a single regime that applies, regardless of the nature of the arbitration.  Nonetheless, it is appropriate that additional protections are available in cases that might not involve large-scale arbitrations, international and commercial in character.  These matters are dealt with in Parts 4 and 5 of the Bill.  While a distinction is made between consumer arbitrations and other kinds of arbitration, it is sufficient to say that, in broad terms, additional oversight by the courts can be availed of in these cases.  For consumer arbitrations, the oversight is automatically available and can only be disapplied where there is agreement to do so once the dispute has arisen.  For other arbitrations, the prior agreement of the parties is necessary for its application.  &ldquo;Oversight&rdquo; means the retention of the existing case stated procedure and clarification as to when it is open to the court to remit an award for further consideration.  In the latter case, the grounds for making an application are that new evidence is available that could materially alter the decision on the award.</P>
        <P>A further element in standard arbitrations involves the specification of additional grounds for setting aside or remitting an arbitral award.  These reflect existing case law and are additional to the grounds for setting aside laid down in the model law.  What we are discussing is a fundamental error of law on the face of an award and evidence of procedural unfairness in the conduct of the arbitral tribunal.</P><Col N="86"/>
        <P>Since one cannot consider the specific sections of the Bill in isolation from the provisions of the model law to which it gives effect, I would like to touch briefly on some key elements of that law.  I have mentioned the underlying philosophy of the model law which is that minimal court intervention works to the advantage of the arbitration process and ensures finality and certainty in respect of any award.  Another key element enshrined in the model law is the idea of party autonomy.  This is evident in the freedom that parties have with regard both to the number of arbitrators and the procedure for appointing the arbitrator or arbitrators.  It is also to be found in the fact that the parties are free to agree on the procedure to be followed by the tribunal.  This can result in the application of a given set of rules emanating from a recognised arbitration body such as the International Court of Arbitration.  However, it also allows parties to agree on particular points of concern to them which will take account of the specific nature of the proceedings in which they are engaged.</P>
        <P>By virtue of the model law, there will also be general application of the provision whereby the arbitral tribunal will be given the competence to rule on its own jurisdiction.  This is a matter which has particular attraction for practitioners.  With regard to the arbitration award itself, it should be noted that, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, that award is to state the reasons upon which it is based.  This is somewhat of a new departure within this jurisdiction for arbitrations that are neither commercial nor international in character.  However, the new rule is not likely to pose any significant problems in practice.  From the point of view of the parties, it should introduce a measure of transparency into the arbitration process and act as a reassurance that proper standards are being adhered to.</P>
        <P>While it is a significant modernising measure, the Bill inevitably involves a substantial amount of consolidation.  From the brief outline I have given as to its content, it should be obvious there are provisions in the Bill that are equivalent to many of those already contained in the Arbitration Acts 1954 to 1998.  However, in considering this Bill, the most important thing to note is that in applying the model law of the United Nations International Commission on Trade Law to all arbitrations, Ireland is putting itself to the forefront in terms of having in place a modern and rigorous arbitration code which is fully in tune with best international practice.  By taking this route we are providing ourselves with a single reference point for all arbitrations.  I hope this will prove to be an attraction when it comes to doing arbitration business in this jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>Alternative dispute resolution in general is clearly a growth industry and the Bill will answer a demand that exists, particularly within the international commercial community, for increased options in this area.  Ireland, by virtue of its legal system which is based on the common law, its accessibility and its language regime would seem to be well placed to capitalise upon that demand.</P>
        <P>I am confident the new Arbitration Bill will provide the necessary legal underpinning for the future development of Ireland as a leading arbitration centre.  It is an undeniable fact of commercial life that where there is investment, particularly of a substantial kind, there are likely to be disputes to which considerable complexity can attach.  In this environment, arbitration allows for solutions which maximise privacy, provide the requisite flexibility and enable arbitrators whose skills and experience match the dispute to be chosen.  There is also the all-important guarantee of enforceability.</P>
        <P>This is a somewhat technical Bill but it is nonetheless an important measure that may help in the delivery of arbitration business to this country.  I commend it to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill makes a number of changes to the law on arbitration in Ireland.  In particular it makes improvements to the 1998 Arbitration Act which introduced an internationally recognised model law for all international commercial arbitration in Ireland.  The new Bill also ensures that any recourse to court will be speedy and will avoid unnecessary costs.  It also removes the possibility of court orders which might be unhelpful to the arbitral process such as orders for security for costs and discovery.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">These are the words used by Mr. Colm &Oacute; hOis&iacute;n, SC, chairman of the Bar Council&rsquo;s arbitration and alternative disputes resolution committee, in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  He proceeds to state:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Significantly the new Bill also extends the model law to domestic arbitrations.  Up to now it had been governed by an outdated law which was no longer in sync with modern procedures.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The Arbitration Bill is a very welcome development as it incorporates international best practice into Irish law.  The new Bill is a very important positive step in establishing Ireland as an attractive option as a neutral third party country venue for international arbitration.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">It is important to note that arbitration forms part of the services industry, which we hope will develop and make a major contribution to our GDP.  When one considers the downturn in the economy and the current lack of finance, it is clear arbitration could give rise to huge benefits in the future.  I spoke with a senior partner in one of the major firms who informed me that his company was obliged to announce that its 15 trainees will be laid off before Christmas.  For whatever reason, the legal profession has not garnered a great deal in the way of kudos in the past.  It must be noted, however, that it, along with other professions, is feeling the pinch in the current economic climate.  When one considers that 750 people are currently studying for FE1s with the Law Society of Ireland, it is clear that legislation that will underpin Ireland&rsquo;s attempts to become an important centre for arbitration must be put in place.</P>
        <P>In the article to which I refer, Colm &Oacute; hOis&iacute;n states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Many international arbitration disputes involve multi-million euro amounts.  Choosing Ireland as the arbitration venue for these disputes is a vote of confidence in the quality of our government, business and legal structures.  Ireland is a neutral, English-speaking venue which has a common law system and an evolving, strong legal framework which is attractive for dispute resolution.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The West&rsquo;s legal system has as its basis the English system, which has been in place for centuries.  If we get the legislation right and companies and other countries can see Ireland&rsquo;s value as an arbitration centre, we will prosper.  We must ensure the law we put in place is good, progressive and fair.  In that context, this legislation provides a template that will prove beneficial in the future.</P>
        <P>In his article, Colm &Oacute; hOis&iacute;n also states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Hosting the arbitration of these disputes has many significant economic, legal and business tourism benefits.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Nearly 1,000 overseas companies have made Ireland their European base, in many sectors such as finance, information technology, pharmaceuticals and other services.  We have a wide range of translation and stenography services, which are another advantage to our location.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He goes on to observe:</P><Col N="88"/>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The courts also support and encourage arbitration.  For example, the Commercial Court provides a fast track system for dealing with commercial litigation and can potentially be used in arbitration matters.  The development of a purpose-built centre for arbitration and dispute resolution would further enhance our ability to attract this business.  International best practice is to have such centres and, in order to compete with London, Paris and New York, Ireland must also offer similar facilities.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I understand a significant case will soon be coming before the High Court.  It is important to get legislation right in the first instance and not be obliged to revisit it.  If we do so, we will enhance our reputation on the international scene.</P>
        <P>Mr. &Oacute; hOis&iacute;n&rsquo;s article continues:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Ireland Inc as a brand has had worldwide success.  Many leading Irish people have figured on the international economic and political stage and this helps attract people from overseas to Ireland.  This business would greatly enhance our economic and legal standing.  It would also encourage domestic alternative dispute methods, which can only be of benefit in repairing fractured business relationships.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Many sectors in the Irish economy are internationally focused and have made inroads into markets abroad.  The Irish legal services community has been more domestically focused up to the present.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Dublin ICCA 2008 [to which the Minister referred] was the biggest international arbitration conference ever.  It has generated significant goodwill to Ireland.  This coupled with the new Arbitration Bill and the various initiatives prompted by the conference, should allow us to achieve the goal of establishing Ireland as a premier centre for international dispute resolution.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">I referred to arbitration and dispute resolution.  It is important we get this right.  There is nothing as annoying as a new Member of the House as the possibility that this legislation will have to be improved upon.  We should ensure, therefore, we get it right on the first occasion.</P>
        <P>Section 9 provides that the High Court is to be the court specified under Article 6 of the model law for the performance of certain functions of arbitrational assistance and supervision.  I do not intend to speak about all of the matters referred to by the Minister.  However, there are a couple of issues in regard to small claims that are important.  Far too often small claims clog up the system.  I am sure the international dispute resolution procedure of which I am speaking will deal not with small claims but with international claims of significance.</P>
        <P>Section 30 provides that the Bill shall not apply to an arbitration agreement that relates to a claim which does not exceed the monetary limit for small claims in the District Court, currently &euro;2,000.  Such a claim, if not individually negotiated by the parties, will be deemed to be an unfair term for the purposes of the European Communities (Unfair terms in Consumer Contracts ) Regulations 1995 and 2000.  It is important we ensure small claims cases do not clog up the courts or the arbitration process.</P>
        <P>Section 34 deals with special oversight and preserves the power of the arbitrator to state a case for the appropriate court as to an award.  Also, it allows a party to an arbitration to make an application to that court seeking that an award be remitted to the arbitrator on the grounds that new evidence has emerged which is likely to materially alter the decision in regard to that award or seeking a direction that the arbitrator state a case for the decision of the court. <Col N="89"/> Arbitration can be and is hard, given the requirement for privacy and confidentiality on the part of the parties involved and the arbitrator.  Our attitudes may vary.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>The Minister referred to section 11 which provides an alternative path to litigation.  There is, as the Minister stated, evidence to suggest the parties are anxious to avoid excessive court intervention, which can only be welcomed.  Section 11 further states there is to be finality in regard to the court&rsquo;s determination in respect of a number of applications.  These include an application to stay a court action in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement; an application to set aside an arbitral award or an application to recognise and enforce an arbitral award.  The Minister has stated it is a new departure for our law that all these applications will no longer be subject to appeal to a higher court, thus giving to the arbitrator a court of final appeal.</P>
        <P>As I stated, it is important we get this right and that we ensure no confusion arises that may present as a flaw in the legislation.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify this matter.  It may be that I have not read or interpreted the section correctly.  We must ensure we do everything correctly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the taking of Second Stage of the Arbitration Bill 2008. </P>
        <P>Alternative disputes resolution has been with us for a long time and is essentially based on the prior agreement of the parties to resolve their differences in a manner that conforms to the fundamental principles of justice.  Alternative dispute resolution processes have emerged in the context of delays in the courts system.  After a fashion, the Small Claims Court is a mediation process for certain consumer disputes, while the Family Mediation Service provides an important alternative resolution facility in the context of family conflicts.</P>
        <P>Up to now, model law has applied only in regard to international commercial arbitration.  The Bill will apply the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, UNICTRAL, model law on international commercial arbitration to all arbitrations that take place within the State.  The Law Reform Commission in its report makes plain that &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; in &ldquo;alternative dispute resolution&rdquo; should not be seen as preventing the court process &ldquo;from continuing to play a positive role in resolving disputes by agreement&rdquo;.  The commission&rsquo;s view is that an integrated civil process should include a combination of alternative dispute resolution processes such as mediation and conciliation and the court-based litigation process.  On the other hand, many practitioners seem to favour minimal involvement by the courts.</P>
        <P>Whether the objective that Dublin might one day rival Geneva, London and Paris as a venue for arbitration excellence will be realised, I cannot say.  However, there is no reason we should not aim high.  There is no doubt that Ireland has certain advantages and no reason we should not market them to optimum effect.  Deputy D&rsquo;Arcy focused on this important dimension.  It is my understanding that the Irish branch of the Chartered Institute of Arbitration, founded in 1982, has approximately 800 members drawn from diverse backgrounds and a wide range of professional qualifications.</P>
        <P>The extent to which alternative dispute resolution is available to resolve disputes in many walks of life and its legal authority to do so may surprise many outside those sectors where they are in regular use such as in the construction industry.  Consumer arbitration schemes offer a great many a means of resolving disputes which arise from the purchase of goods, holidays or the supply of services to consumers.  Examples include contracts for the supply of holidays under the Package Holiday and Travel Trade Act 1995 and the sale of motor vehicles by members of the Society of Irish Motor Industry.  These arbitration schemes offer the consumer a speedy, inexpensive, final, legally enforceable resolution of their dispute and, in addition, <Col N="90"/>help to develop an awareness of, and encourage acceptance of, arbitration as a dispute resolution process.  In July this year the Law Reform Commission produced a broad ranging consultation paper on alternative dispute resolution.  The paper covers all aspects and techniques of dispute resolution outside the courts.</P>
        <P>The Arbitration Bill 2008, the first comprehensive review of arbitral legislation in this country since the original Act in 1954, will affect dispute resolution in a decisive way.  I am aware that the Irish branch of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators has welcomed the Bill in general and supported the proposal to modernise the legislation by means of a consolidated Act to replace the existing three Acts and to extend the UNCITRAL model law to govern not alone international arbitrations but also domestic ones.  However, improvements could be made in some areas and a more detailed examination of some of the sections of the Bill is warranted.  The Bill contains 36 sections, a number of which appear to have been taken word for word from the 1954 Act.  I ask whether some sections require updating or, in some cases, could perhaps be omitted from the Bill.  For example, section 29 simply repeats section 5 of the 1954 Act and relates to industrial relations matters which are excluded from the operation of the Act.  I can see why this might have been considered desirable in 1954 which was shortly after the establishment of many of the State agencies governing this area such as the Labour Court, but I would like to hear from the Minister why he considers the same considerations apply today.  Given the long delays in arranging hearings at the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the fact that ACAS in the United Kingdom has introduced the option of private arbitration, this exclusion should be examined.  I say this against a background in which lawyers have become commonplace in situations where industrial relations executives and trade union officials originally did the business and an expanded workforce in which many employments are not trade union organised.</P>
        <P>As regards court ordered arbitrations, section 31 is a literal transposition of sections 49 to 53 of the 1954 Act.  My advice is that this power is seldom, if ever, used and, therefore, I ask the Minister to explain why it ought to be reinserted in the new legislation.</P>
        <P>I have referred to the sections of the Bill which deal with consumer arbitrations.  These are schemes for the resolution of disputes which arise from the purchase of goods or the supply of services to consumers.  These provisions potentially cover a great many people.  The arbitration schemes offer consumers a speedy and relatively inexpensive final resolution of their disputes, in addition to developing an awareness and encouraging acceptance of arbitration as a dispute resolution process.  However, the effect of section 30(1) which is not directed solely at consumer arbitrations will be to limit the number of arbitrations which take place and retard the acceptance and development of arbitration.  I would like to learn from the Minister the reason arbitration should not be permitted, unless the amount in dispute is higher than the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Court.  If a taxi driver who is not a consumer for the purposes under discussion is in dispute for an amount less than &euro;2,000, the only remedy available to him or her is litigation.  Perhaps the purpose of the section is to avoid duplication but it is not readily apparent why disputes that come within the remit of the Small Claims Court should be excluded.  I ask the Minister to outline why this subsection should be retained.</P>
        <P>While other measures provide protection for consumers, the practical application of the provisions of sections 34 and 35 may be open to abuse.  The protection which the Government wishes to provide for consumers could be arranged in a more straightforward manner, thereby allowing for more streamlined legislation.  In addition, there is considerable support for mod<Col N="91"/>ifying or even omitting section 32 which deals with the additional powers of the court to set aside or remit awards.</P>
        <P>The UNCITRAL model law on international commercial arbitration already governs domestic arbitration in a number of countries, including Germany, Kenya and New Zealand, and much of the model law restates contemporary Irish law on domestic arbitration.  I welcome, in particular, the decision to introduce into Irish arbitration law the powers of arbitrators to determine their own jurisdictions, amend and interpret their own awards and terminate cases for want of prosecution or on grounds of delay, as well the default requirement that all awards should be reasoned.  However, the Bill will require further revision in specific areas to avoid anomalies caused by the fact that the model law is tailored specifically to international arbitration.  The most obvious example of this arises in respect of Article 34 of the model law which allows the courts to set aside an award on stated grounds and Article 36 which allows the courts on almost identical grounds to refuse to enforce an award.  This, in effect, gives a party resisting an award two opportunities to mount a challenge.  That may be necessary in international arbitration where the enforcing court and the set-aside court may be in different jurisdictions but it is not required in domestic arbitration.  In contemporary Irish domestic arbitration law a party with a grievance about the fairness of the arbitration or the process leading to the award must bring a challenge to the award within the time limits specified in the rules of court.  The party cannot thereafter resist enforcement of the award, unless the court extends the time for challenge, except where the award was made without jurisdiction or where it has already been performed.  The model law will, therefore, make it much easier to resist an arbitrator&rsquo;s award in domestic arbitration.  This might be redressed by a provision in the Bill which would stop a party from resisting enforcement under Article 36 on grounds already rejected in a challenge under Article 34 or by a provision limiting the grounds for refusal of enforcement under Article 34 in domestic arbitrations.</P>
        <P>Some practitioners question the necessity of applying to a court to enforce a domestic arbitration award.  I note the very definite view taken on this issue by the Law Reform Commission.  Under the law, if one wishes to enforce a domestic arbitration award, it is necessary to apply to the Master of the High Court on affidavit, even if the award is not being challenged.  The other party to the arbitration is entitled to resist the application and this can lead to delay and expense.  A simple procedure should be put in place, whereby a domestic arbitration award which has not been challenged under the provisions of the legislation providing for a challenge could be converted into a court judgment through the central office and without formal application to the court.  If a defendant does not defend summary proceedings for recovery of a debt, the plaintiff is entitled to obtain judgment through the central office.  Why should the recipient of an award in a domestic arbitration be in a weaker position?  Similarly, it is the view of practitioners that the new evidence ground for remission under the special oversight provision in section 34 should have a time limit.</P>
        <P>The possibility of abuse also arises in situations where parties to arbitration have unequal bargaining powers.  This arises in sections 12, 18 and 20.  If there is an unequal balance between a consumer and, for example, a multiple store, the latter ought not be facilitated in causing the consumer to jump through a number of hurdles, not least where expenses are involved.  In that context, it must be borne in mind that arbitration provisions are often included in the standard forms of contract or terms and conditions prepared by one of the parties.  It is important that such a party should not be in a position to protect itself against its own wrongdoing by providing for the non-payment of interest or costs to a successful claimant.</P><Col N="92"/>
    <HtmlBk SectId="6" />
        <P>In many conflicts speed can be of the essence.  Alternative dispute resolution facilitates early settlement of disputes.  As the Law Reform Commission consultation paper notes, &ldquo;early settlement can be both financially and emotionally advantageous to the disputant&rdquo;.  It also notes that &ldquo;an important relationship can be repaired and maintained, something which may be at risk in adversarial litigation&rdquo;.  A settlement on the steps of the court &ldquo;often depends on the strength of the legal rights-based arguments&rdquo; and, as we know, may follow on from an already very expensive process, including the cost of discovery.  The Law Reform Commission paper argues that alternative dispute resolution &ldquo;must be seen as an integral part of any modern justice system&rdquo; and records the view of the British Master of the Rolls, Sir Anthony Clarke, who said in May 2008, &ldquo;It must become such a well established part of it that when considering the proper management of litigation it forms as intrinsic and as instinctive a part of our lexicon and of our thought processes, as standard considerations like what, if any, expert evidence is required.&rdquo;  While we may yet have some distance to go before these are the instinctual responses, the Bill should bring us closer to that objective.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome this opportunity to express my broad support for the Bill.  The Bill is a welcome development to ensure arbitration will continue to grow as an alternative to court proceedings in commercial disputes and to facilitate Dublin and Ireland in becoming an international centre for dispute resolution.</P>
        <P>A number of proposals in the Bill will improve our existing arbitration law.  The UNCITRAL model law on international commercial arbitration which until now had only applied to international arbitration will be extended to domestic arbitration.  The process of streamlining Irish law with international standards is a welcome development and we will be supporting that element of it.  The provisions in section 32 which provide for additional grounds for the High Court to set aside arbitral awards in domestic arbitrations are welcome.  The new grounds to set aside an arbitral award where there is a fundamental error of law or in case of unfair procedure are a necessary extension to ensure parties in commercial arbitration have proper recourse to the courts.</P>
        <P>Some of the criticisms of the arbitration process such as it being costly and cumbersome have been addressed in the Bill.  Section 10 which provides that the High Court will not make any order for security for costs and an order of discovery, unless agreed by the parties, should have the effect of avoiding unnecessary costs.  I certainly hope that is the case.</P>
        <P>The section dealing with consumer arbitration deserves careful consideration.  While arbitration is well established in the travel and motor trades, as mentioned by the previous speaker, through bodies such as the Society of the Irish Motor Industry and the tour operators holiday package scheme, in other areas alternative dispute resolution is in its infancy.  It is widely acknowledged that there can be great inequality in bargaining power in consumer contracts.  Dispute resolution is often chosen by the company whereas the consumer is likely to have a limited knowledge of the process of alternative resolution.  For these reasons, consumers need added protection to ensure consumer arbitration procedures are fair, effective and expeditious.</P>
        <P>I support the proposal that provides for the mechanism, whereby arbitrators shall state a case to a court on a question of law and for an arbitral award to be remitted if new evidence emerges.  I also support section 30(2) which deems an arbitration term as an unfair term under the European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations 1995 and 2000 if it has not been individually negotiated by the parties.  However, I am concerned about the limitation of its application to claims under the Small Claims Court threshold of &euro;2,000.  I <Col N="93"/>support the previous speaker&rsquo;s comments in that regard.  All arbitration terms in consumer contracts should be deemed unfair if they have not been individually negotiated by the parties and a consumer should only be bound by an arbitration clause after a dispute has arisen.  It should be possible for consumers in smaller transactions to choose arbitration in the aftermath of a dispute.  This would ensure consumers could make an informed decision to proceed through the courts or in the alternative to pursue any claim through proper dispute resolution bodies.  I will, therefore, be recommending an examination of the wording of section 30(1).</P>
        <P>With more than 700 members in the Irish branch of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators, it is clear that businesses are choosing arbitration as an alternative to court proceedings.  It is necessary that arbitration law in Ireland provide a clear, decisive and effective process.  The provisions in the Bill, by and large, will succeed in doing this.  There will also be considerable economic and tourism benefits if Dublin becomes a major centre of dispute resolution.</P>
        <P>While I support the Government&rsquo;s commitment in developing the State as a global venue for international arbitration through reform of our arbitration law, there are other important elements for attracting international arbitration to the State which have been undermined to a degree by the Government and to which attention should be drawn.  Colm &Oacute; hOis&iacute;n, chairman of the Bar Council arbitration and alternative dispute resolution committee, identified in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> our neutrality as an advantage for the State as a third country in international arbitration disputes.  The Taoiseach emphasised our neutrality when addressing the International Council for Commercial Arbitration 2008 conference at the beginning June.  Clearly, the promotion of our neutrality is an attractive feature for businesses from non-aligned countries such as India.  However, the Government&rsquo;s support for US military aeroplanes landing at Shannon Airport and enhanced defence co-operation in Europe undermines this assertion.  If we are to make a convincing case and use our neutrality to attract international dispute arbitration to Dublin, we must have an unambiguous position.  My party will continue to call for a halt in the use of Shannon Airport by the US military in its war efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq.  We will also oppose any development of a common EU military policy through European treaties.  The development of international dispute resolution illustrates that our neutrality is something that can benefit us both politically and economically.  It is the responsibility of the Government to safeguard our neutrality, not to undermine it.  While I broadly welcome many of the proposals in the Bill, the Government must also re-engage with our policy of neutrality if this is to be recognised as a genuine neutral third country venue for international dispute resolution.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>To some degree, the process of recognising Ireland as a potential arbitrator in disputes has commenced.  There have been instances where people from the State have been invited to meet parties abroad.  There is strong recognition internationally of Ireland&rsquo;s potential to play a significant role in this regard, not least following what we hope will be a successful resolution of our own differences and disputes on the island and with our neighbouring island, Britain.  I hope this can be built upon.  We have seen significant progress this week in further building on the Irish peace process.  We look forward to developing its potential to ensure we maximise the benefit, not just for the sake of building an economic advantage for Ireland, but also in achieving world peace, clearly a laudable objective that goes beyond any economic desire we might legitimately have.  I hope the potential can be tapped into through the introduction of the Bill.  While some of its provisions cause me concern, nevertheless I welcome it as a useful step forward.  I look forward to discussing it on Committee Stage.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>Gangland criminals make their living as parasites on vulnerable people who often through disadvantage, lack of educational opportunities or family breakdown are easy prey for the drug baron vultures.  These are the unfortunates who find themselves behind bars, for the most part, while the barons are free to continue causing murder and mayhem on our streets.</P>
        <P>In reply to a recent parliamentary question, the Minister informed me that in 2007 there were 1,840 prisoners treated for drug-related problems.  I do not have a figure for the total number of prisoners for 2007 but extrapolating from the figures for 2008 up to mid November, it would appear that approximately 50% of prisoners have drug-related problems.</P>
        <P>This significant number of drug-based offenders indicates the correlation between drugs and crime.  Prison should be a place of rehabilitation but the number of places for drug treatment in prisons is totally inadequate.  The drug detox programme in Mountjoy, for example, runs for six weeks with a capacity for nine prisoners at a time.  If the drugs issue is to be taken seriously and properly addressed, this level of support within prisons is totally inadequate.</P>
        <P>The real threat to society is not from the mostly unfortunate drug users but from the criminals who have targeted them and used them to ply their trade.  It is stomach-churning to read or hear of the pain and suffering inflicted on some of these unfortunate people when a gang leader decides to take indiscriminate revenge when people fall out with him.  It simply beggars belief that these ganglords can direct operations from within prisons.</P>
        <P>I refuse to believe it is not within the capacity of this Government to engage the appropriate expertise to put in place a system to prevent mobile phones getting into prisons in the first place.  If they should escape the first line of detection, why is the technology not in place to stop a signal from the illicit phones and so prevent contact between the prisoner inside and those on the outside, who are being directed to do his murderous bidding?</P>
        <P>It is the State&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that those who are in prison cannot continue to direct their operations from behind bars.  To do this we require more funding for the Irish Prison Service but also greater efficiency in the running of the prison service and real supports for prisoners who want to pursue drug treatment or education programmes.</P>
        <P>The question must be posed about the reasons for the drug culture and the level of crime in our society.  There are many contributory factors but while all of the issues that have been <Col N="98"/>addressed in this debate are important, I want to draw attention to one in particular that I believe is neglected.  That is the disregard for the safety and welfare of children who come from dysfunctional homes and who know nothing other than a wayward existence.</P>
        <P>I have said on numerous occasions that these young children, mostly in disadvantaged areas, with a parent or parents who are themselves involved in drug dealing and other crimes, are destined to become the drug dealers or victims of tomorrow.  This debate is centred on gangland crime, legal instruments to combat it, the provision of more garda&iacute;, the management of prisoners, the control of firearms and so on but the failure to address the needs of young children who are living on the edge of society leaves a major gap in this debate.  Without taking a long view as well as dealing with the immediacy of this problem, it will always be a case of fire fighting.</P>
        <P>Last weekend I watched an unfortunate shopkeeper protecting his property from an onslaught from a mini-gang of six or seven young lads whose ages I guess were between seven and 11.  These children were in free-fall, running wildly around a shop trying to steal whatever they could, causing havoc and then walking away, sneering.  I really do not blame the children because their parents are not being held responsible for their welfare.  Although this may not be the immediate responsibility of the Minister and his Department now, it will be in just a few years when these novices get their stripes and join the bigger club.</P>
        <P>The message seems to be that crime does pay and that the thrill or the gain is worth the risk.  The rash of serious crime that is now blighting the lives of many innocent people must stop and the Minister must find the way to do it sooner rather than later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted Fine Gael has tabled this motion on gangland crime as it provides an opportunity to explore the issue and consider suggestions and proposals.  The current status of gangland crime is directly attributable to the Government, going back a good number of years.  It is not just the fault of this Administration but previous Administrations also.</P>
        <P>I was the party spokesman for justice in the previous D&aacute;il and on numerous occasions I warned the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, former Deputy Michael McDowell, that tolerance of tit-for-tat gangland killings was a recipe for disaster down the road.  I warned him it would only be a matter of time before innocent bystanders or victims would be caught in the crossfire.</P>
        <P>In 2003, before we had any innocent victims caught in the crossfire, former Deputy McDowell made his famous flippant statement that the latest tit-for-tat gangland killing was the sting of a dying wasp and he was in control, that there was no need to bother.  This was totally arrogant and ignorant but the most serious issue was that he, as Minister, had stewardship but left the door open to continuation of the activities which led the events we are debating.  Shane Geoghegan is the most recent victim but only a while ago there was Keith Fitzsimons, Baiba Saulite, Donna Cleary and in my constituency, Anthony Campbell, a 20-year-old carpenter caught in the crossfire by a drug dealer in Finglas.  This was from the response of the previous Minister, and I lay it firmly at his door that the issue was allowed to develop.  Nothing has changed since.</P>
        <P>The second pillar of gangland activity is the escalating problem of drug abuse, which is nationwide.  There was a time when serious drugs were only available in Dublin but they are now available everywhere throughout the country in towns and villages.  This is the cause of and fuel for virtually all serious gangland crime.</P><Col N="99"/>
        <P>Three weeks ago we saw how the Garda and other services seized the largest consignment of cocaine in the history of the country, worth between &euro;500 million and &euro;1 billion.  In September, which is not so long ago either, we heard of the largest seizure in the history of the State by garda&iacute; of legal weapons.  It consisted of 41 brand new, top of the range, high quality weapons.</P>
        <P>These seizures are a sign of the times and that Irish criminality has moved to a different plane.  Illegal drugs are now very big business in this country and criminal enforcement &mdash; not Garda enforcement &mdash; and intimidation is becoming a very deadly business.  New strategies are needed.</P>
        <P>One strategy which has been introduced fairly recently is the Dial to Stop Drug Dealing and Threats initiative.  This was originally devised by the national drugs strategy team two years ago and piloted successfully in Blanchardstown.  We also piloted it successfully last Christmas in the north inner city.  The national launch was in September.  The initiative is quite simple.  It provides a freefone number &mdash; 1800 220 220 &mdash; which is very easy to remember.  Importantly, the public can use it securely, confidentially and anonymously to report information on drug dealing, threats and intimidation.  These are now widespread throughout the community.  The national launch has already produced good results, in that 465 calls have been received on the freefone number.  A total of 141 informative reports have been sent to the Garda, following which a number of substantial seizures have taken place.</P>
        <P>We launched the Dial to Stop Drug Dealing and Threats initiative on the north side of Dublin last week.  I hope it will be a success.  Every sector of society must be informed and mobilised in the fight against drugs and the initiative is an important step in that regard.  The fight against drugs is the one area that should be protected from cutbacks in the Department&rsquo;s budget.  Many community-based programmes, projects and agencies work in front line activity.  I heard the Minister say last night on a programme that there would be a 5% reduction in his budget.  Let us hope the reduction is not in the front line area.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I very much welcome the opportunity to speak in favour of the Government amendment to the Fine Gael motion on gangland crime.  I accept we must tackle, and are tackling, the root causes associated with gangland criminal activity, namely, social deprivation, poor planning, lack of community facilities, the need for urban regeneration and access to education, to name but a few.  By their nature, those measures have a long-term focus and will not solve the immediate problem of vicious gangland activity.</P>
        <P>The common denominator in gangland criminal activity is drugs.  The drugs industry is an evil menace that poses the most grave threat to society.  As long as there is a demand for drugs, there will be a corresponding supply, despite the best efforts of the authorities.  The demand for drugs is an essential ingredient of gangland culture.  Every drug user must accept some responsibility for the actions of the criminal gangs who service their needs.  The Minister of State, Deputy Curran, has a huge responsibility in drafting the new national drugs strategy.  I very much support him in that work.  I applaud the Dial to Stop Drug Dealing and Threats initiative to which Deputy Costello referred.</P><Col N="100"/>
        <P>It is with regret that I say many of our judges are completely detached from reality.  It beggars belief that persons with multiple previous convictions who commit a further crime get light sentences in court.  Soft sentencing undermines public confidence in the criminal justice system, affects Garda morale and encourages criminals to take the risks associated with crime.</P>
        <P>Sentencing will form part of the forthcoming White Paper on justice and I am sure the public will clearly express its views on sentencing policy when the time comes.  I welcome the fact that, by virtue of the legislative amendments introduced in the Criminal Justice Acts 2006 and 2007, as interpreted currently by the Judiciary, there has been a doubling in the mandatory sentences for certain drug offences in 2007 over and above 2006 levels.  That is a step in the right direction.  I would like to see the Judiciary implement mandatory sentences in far more cases.  As we know, the mandatory sentence for murder is life, but the average length of time spent in jail for a life sentence is approximately 15 years.  Those who commit murder, who wilfully go out and take the life of another human being, deserve to be put away for a very long time.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister on the work he and his predecessors have done in terms of a legislative response to the problems we face.  In recent days he announced the covert surveillance Bill.  That is an especially important initiative to assist the Garda in its work.  The criminal procedure Bill will also be introduced, bringing an end to double jeopardy and enshrining victims&rsquo; rights.  The Minister also plans to introduce a DNA Bill and has provided funding for the initial steps to be taken to put that process in train next year.  Those measures, in addition to the Criminal Justice Acts 2006 and 2007, will significantly enhance the capacity of the Garda to do its work and will assist the DPP to secure convictions.</P>
        <P>If tackling the evil menace of gangland crime involves the loss of some of our civil liberties, then that is a small price to pay.  At times when we introduce legislation we put so many safeguards and checks and balances in place, sometimes at the behest of groups such as the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the Human Rights Commission, that the purpose of the legislation itself can become ineffective.</P>
        <P>As a country, we have a fundamental decision to make as to what direction we want to take in terms of handguns.  If one has a liberal licensing regime for handguns, one must accept the consequence of those guns getting into the wrong hands.  The Minister has instigated an urgent and intensive review of firearms legislation and that review is approaching its conclusion.  I am sure he will make brave, courageous and perhaps controversial decisions on the outcome of the review.  Those decisions will be necessary.</P>
        <P>We must continue to follow the money trail in tackling gangland criminal activity.  The Revenue and the CAB must redouble their efforts.  We must hold the criminals to account for the wealth they have generated.  The stakes involved are very high.  The overt manifestation of criminal gangland activity we have seen in Limerick and Dublin will spread to other parts of the country if we fail in our duty.  This is one battle we cannot afford to lose.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important debate.  I compliment the Fine Gael spokesperson on facilitating us in that regard because it gives us an opportunity to strongly support the work of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who, like his immediate predecessor and other colleagues, has shown a willingness to deal with the issues that are of concern to all of us.  The <i>Limerick Leader </i>had an amazing headline: &ldquo;United in Grief and Anger as Shane Geoghegan is Laid to Rest&rdquo;.  We have all been united.  I did not know the young man and I do not know Limerick as well as Deputy Niall Collins and other colleagues, but we have all been <Col N="101"/>struck by the death of Shane Geoghegan and how communities right around the country have reacted to that terrible tragedy.  The local priest, Fr. Jim Maher, said at the funeral that he hoped the death would mark a turning point in the type of violence which has marred the good name of Limerick and other cities.  He called for the cycle of violence to be confined to history.</P>
        <P>Like other colleagues, I support the Minister in his work and in examining all of the issues.  People are entitled to make political points but we should be focused.  We should understand the need for action and for the Minister to be tough.  I speak as someone who, like other colleagues, has been threatened in the past for speaking out about gangland crime and crime in general, especially in the Dublin region.  I will never be afraid to do that, nor will I be afraid to speak from the Fianna F&aacute;il benches in support of those who are affected by crime.</P>
        <P>A clear linkage has been made in recent days to the drugs trade and drug barons.  Newspaper articles pointed out that middle class people who take recreational drugs are fuelling the current situation.  Senator Costello referred to the Dial to Stop Drug Dealing and Threats initiative, which has been prevalent throughout the Dublin region.  Like other colleagues, I strongly support it.  In addition, the Minister of State, Deputy John Curran, faces a particular challenge as he is the Minister of State with responsibility for the drugs strategy.  There is a need to strongly support him.</P>
        <P>I am not afraid to say that even at a time of economic challenge we must continue the funding and support for all the community supports that are needed.  My community, like that of the Acting Chairman, Deputy Ardagh, is no different in that regard.  I want to be positive about my own community but there are challenges to be faced and we should take every opportunity to support those organisations that are fighting against the drug barons and to tackle the problems that exist.  We should continue to do that.</P>
        <P>I heard the Labour Party spokesman refer to my constituency.  I am not afraid to say that Tallaght, the third largest population centre in the country, does need more garda&iacute;, a new Garda station and as much support as possible to continue the fight in which we are all engaged.  As a member of the south Dublin joint policing board, of which the Acting Chairman, Deputy Ardagh, and Deputy Catherine Byrne will be very much aware, I with my colleagues will continue the fight in partnership with the garda&iacute;, the county council and other community representatives.</P>
        <P>I extend my deepest sympathy to all those affected by gangland crime, particularly those in Limerick.  We should reach out to them.  We should, in a very positive way, take up the challenge of Fr. Jim Maher, namely, to ensure the Garda and State agencies have sufficient resources to fight gangland crime and bring the killers of Shane Geoghegan to justice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The tragic death of Shane Geoghegan and other tragedies should remind us all just how urgent it is to fight gangs in Limerick and across Ireland.  While Limerick was unfortunately in the headlines this week, I woke up last Christmas morning only to hear of a murder in one end of my constituency and a serious assault just down the road from me.  This is happening all over Ireland.  It is most important that we commit immediately to being tough on crime and its causes.  Crime is caused by individuals who decide of their own free will to kill, maim and break the law.  We must be as tough as possible on them.</P>
        <P>We must ask the public outside Limerick, who are not directly affected by the recent tragedy, for their views.  I want them to ring my office to complain about what is being done about crime.  Nobody has contacted my office this week on this issue.  It is far more important than any other we have dealt with in recent weeks.  No radio station has asked its listeners to e-mail Oireachtas Members about this issue although it is the most important one we have dealt with in the House since the summer.  It is very serious and the public outside the Limerick region <Col N="102"/>will have to come on board to fight the gangs.  As Deputy O&rsquo;Connor stated, the people who are smoking hash and taking cocaine, although they may regard it as a laugh and great fun, are the ones who are funding the criminals who are willingly murdering, maiming and injuring people and on whom we need to be as tough as possible.</P>
        <P>We need to give the Garda all the resources it needs.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Taoiseach have indicated they will do whatever must be done in Limerick.  I am glad of this but they also need to do whatever must be done all over the country.  Garda strength is increasing this year and there is to be a new state-of-the-art forensic science facility and a new communications system, a digital radio service.  In my constituency, the commitment of the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the current one, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has been second to none.  Garda numbers have perhaps trebled in the past year at my local station in Laytown.  There is a renewed commitment to policing in east Meath.</P>
        <P>My area of the commuter belt has its own share of criminal gangs.  Their members have moved out of the north side of Dublin.  They are not all travelling up and down to Dublin to work but may travel up and down by night to carry out robberies.  There are three or four families in my constituency who are known to be engaged in this practice and I want the Garda to be tough on them.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil, for which &euro;21 million was allocated this year, is often applied in my constituency by the Garda.  It results in extra checkpoints, one of which I passed today on my way to Navan.  There will be more uniformed foot patrols, where necessary, and armed plain-clothes patrols.  They are needed so we can be tough on the causes of crime and those who are willingly and freely committing crimes, killing, maiming and injuring.</P>
        <P>We need to pass legislation.  We are to do so and I welcome the legislation the Government has initiated.  One hears the human-rights brigade and political-correctness brigade saying we must be wary of moral panic, but we must also be wary of moral failure.  It would constitute moral failure not to introduce the legislation and I commend the Government on reacting as it has.</P>
        <P>In the past, we have strengthened bail requirements, created mandatory sentences and toughened penalties for crime.  As colleagues have stated, judges must play their part in this regard.  There is still work to do.  The Government has announced the covert surveillance Bill, which is important because it will create a nationwide DNA database to assist criminal investigations.  It will help stop gangs from intimidating witnesses and committing perjury during trials, as happens all the time.  By taking such steps, we are helping the Garda to be as effective as possible in targeting the individuals who are willingly committing crimes.</P>
        <P>The Government has been consistently tough on crime.  I refer to Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform from Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue onwards.  I was only in college when Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue was Minister.  Fianna F&aacute;il Members have been steadfast in support of the Garda.  Others have not always been as steadfast in doing so.  We have supported the Garda through thick and thin and I will support every decision any member of the Garda makes in my constituency.  It is important that this message be circulated.</P>
        <P>We need to continue to assist garda&iacute; by giving them all the resources and legislative tools they need to fight gangland crime.  I commend the Opposition for raising this issue this week.  It could have raised budgetary issues to oppose the Government or give it a kick but it raised the issue of gangland crime, which was very responsible.  This is a great debate and we are generally working across the aisle on these issues.  I know the Opposition will support us when necessary.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="103"/>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Mary Alexandra White.</P>
        <P>There is a need to consider the aspects of criminal law that may need strengthening in regard to the recent callous and brutal murder perpetrated by awful criminals.  It is good police work that will solve this crime.  The investigation into the murder of nightclub security guard Brian Fitzgerald took five years but ended with the conviction of two men, who are now serving life sentences.  We can talk a lot about the need for new legislation but good, honest-to-goodness police work will be at the heart of solving the terrible crime that has precipitated the discussion we are having.  Considerable resources are being devoted to solving it.  There are 50 garda&iacute; involved in the investigation and there are over 620 garda&iacute; in the Limerick division.  The emergency response unit has been deployed in the region.</P>
        <P>In the obviously heated discussion on what occurred in Limerick, it is important the protection of people&rsquo;s civil liberties be considered in tandem with ensuring the perpetrators of the crime are put behind bars.  We must always strive to strike this balance and ensure the call for finding the criminals is addressed in conjunction with the issues that arise in respect of penal reform, recidivism and education.  It is not often that such issues are discussed in this House and it is important to stress them in this debate.</P>
        <P>I am pleased there has been a 20% increase in funding for the Criminal Assets Bureau.  It has done fantastic work over recent years.  By seizing the assets of those engaged in illegal criminal activity, regardless of those criminals&rsquo; place in the drug or criminal food chain, the bureau is sending out a clear signal that the Garda will not tolerate drugs gangs and will pursue them vigorously, as much through focusing on the spoils of crime as on the commission of crime.</P>
        <P>It is very important that there be more garda&iacute; in the community.  I am delighted there are 27 garda&iacute; on mountain bikes in Limerick at present.  One obtains good information from people by walking and cycling the streets.  Good work is being done and I hope we will bring the perpetrators of the most recent murder in Limerick to justice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Cuffe for sharing time.</P>
        <P>We all have been really traumatised by the recent events in Limerick and by those in other areas over recent years.  I refer in particular to the recent death of Shane Geoghegan.</P>
        <P>I wish to remind the House of the problem surfacing in many small towns and rural areas in south Leinster because of the ravages of drug abuse.  The drug barons are speeding down the M9 to places such as Carlow and Kilkenny with their awful loads and are ready to supply drugs to those who are addicted.  The demand for illegal drugs, particularly cocaine and heroin, is very pronounced in Carlow, a town with a considerable heroin problem at present.  The drugs come from Dublin.  The vicious circle is such that people in south Leinster have experienced shootings in houses and the awful effects of gangland crime.  We need to tackle it and do so in a sophisticated manner.</P>
        <P>The resources which the Government is providing to the Garda are vital and welcome.  In this regard, I am glad CCTV will be made available in Carlow in the next three weeks.  It will play its part.  I value the 20% increase in funding for the Criminal Assets Bureau next year.  This is of tremendous help, as is the important work associated with Operation Anvil.</P>
        <P>Having been assaulted myself, I know what it is like to be the victim of crime.  I know also how competent members of the Garda are.  The Government is addressing the problems of gangland crime but we must be mindful of the small rural towns, such as Carlow and Kilkenny, that have drug problems.  These are the breeding grounds for future gangland crime.  Otherwise, <Col N="104"/>debates such as this in the wake of the recent death of Shane Geoghegan, will continue to provide an all too familiar backdrop.</P>

	<P>I condemn totally the brutal murder of Shane Geoghegan.  In County Monaghan on Saturday, 20 October 2007, we had a similar barbaric crime in the butchering of an innocent victim, Paul Quinn.  I raised it as an Adjournment matter the following week and there were statements on it in this House in February.  Tonight we focus once again on a similar barbaric crime.  How long can this carnage continue?  These senseless brutal killings appear to settle down and then flare up again every few months.  Have we broken down, as a nation and a society?</P>
        <P>Society has serious questions to answer.  The girls doing a quick line of cocaine to keep themselves going on a night out, or the lads smoking a cannabis joint to chill out, are the very people who are fuelling these gangs, their turf wars and gangland crime in general.  If these people did not have customers, and a growing number of them, for their goods, we would not be where we are.  Individuals most show their social responsibility in a collective way.  People can no longer afford the luxury of tut-tutting as they watch the news before turning around and indirectly fuelling this lifestyle.  We expose our fellow citizens to a fatal game of Russian roulette, of life and death, where being in the wrong place at the wrong time, or saying the wrong thing to the wrong people at the wrong time, means that a person ends up being murdered.</P>
        <P>The issue of familial responsibility is fundamentally interwined with this.  Most people can become parents easily and they reap the glorious benefits that children bring into their lives.  However, serious responsibilities come with this.  Crimes are being committed by minors, by people under the age of 18 years.  I said in this House before, and am happy to repeat it, that if children are not at home, their parents should know where they are, who they are with, and what they are doing.  I make no apology for saying that.  People in our society, men and women, who believe in parenting by proxy, via the high stool in a bar or via a PlayStation, are neglectful of the child and they damage society.  From a very early age, some of our young people are exposed to violence.  Shooting their victims in a PlayStation game is a normal fun thing to do.</P>
        <P>The majority of contemporary crime concerns drugs, whether drug running, drug taking or drug selling.  The key, therefore, to solving the crisis in crime is to solve our drugs crisis.  Urban rejuvenation, such as we see in the Limerick southside and northside regeneration agencies, is the slow process that will reap benefits in the future.</P>
        <P>However, while that is a long-term matter, we must get tough in the short term and get these unrepentant bullies, drug dealers and crime barons off the streets.  People know who killed Shane Geoghegan just as people know who killed Paul Quinn.  However, with witnesses fearing for their lives, evidence will continue to emerge in order to get convictions for these heinous murders.  I commend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI in respect of their valiant efforts in trying to secure a conviction in the case of Paul Quinn.</P>
        <P>We must broaden the scope of the Special Criminal Court in order to take on these thugs, and I make no apology for calling them thugs.  I am most heartened that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, informed the Garda Commissioner that any additional assistance needed will be provided, whether by legislation or through resources, in order to deal with the Limerick criminal gangs.  I expected nothing less of them.</P><Col N="105"/>
        <P>I welcome the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who outlined his proposals to ban licensed handguns.  The Minister said that the handgun ban would be included in legislation currently being prepared, which will be published shortly.  I am pleased that he explicitly stated his central concern must be the protection of the public, particularly in view of the level of gun crime.</P>
        <P>I am a mother of three young children.  If we were to be subjected to another Dunblane-type incident, or if stolen legal handguns were to be used to kill more innocent people, I would have failed in my duty as a national legislator.  In my view, the Minister is acting swiftly and decisively, and I hope the Bill passes quickly through the House.</P>
        <P>The memory of the callous murder of Shane Geoghegan, or that of Paul Quinn in my own constituency, must not be allowed fall from the front pages and fade out of focus in respect of what we, as national legislators, must do to tackle these criminal gangs.  I extend my sympathies to the family and friends of the late Shane Geoghegan.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>This debate is welcome.  Unfortunately, it is also timely because of the tragic death of Shane Geoghegan over a week ago.</P>
        <P>I knew Shane Geoghegan personally.  He grew up in Patrickswell from where I came and where his family farmed.  They moved later to Dooradoyle.  I played rugby with Shane Geoghegan in Garryowen rugby club and togged out in the same dressingroom as he did more times than I care to remember.  He was an upstanding citizen of this country and was never involved in anything he should not have been.  He was hardworking, had a wide circle of friends and comes from a most respected family.  Our community in Limerick has suffered a great loss because of his passing.</P>
        <P>Last night we had a momentous occasion in Thomond Park.  It was preceded by a minute&rsquo;s silence for Shane Geoghegan, as happened last Saturday before the Ireland-All Blacks match at Lansdowne Road.  It is incumbent on all of us to ensure that we do not require to have any more minute&rsquo;s silence on occasions such as these.</P>
        <P>We must focus and try to remain detached in order to figure out where we go from here and what we must do to deal with this situation as it evolves.  There have been calls from all sides for extended powers.  The word internment was used and there have been calls to bring in that type of legislation.  I would support that, where at all possible.  However, we must remain realistic and if the Attorney General states that such powers are not workable or practical, we must accept this.</P>
        <P>I took issue with the right to silence.  We have that right in this country although it has recently been amended and a court can now draw certain inferences when a person claims that right.  If a person is subject to investigation for murder, should that person be entitled to the right to silence?  People are posing that question to us on the street.  There are complex legal issues involved but the public asks the questions and looks to us for the answers.</P>
        <P>I welcome the moves made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with regard to the placing of covert surveillance on a legislative foundation.  His intention to tackle the issue of handguns is also welcome.  We must look more to multi-agency tasking, networking and co-ordination in the tackling of gangland crime.  If one looks at the situation in Limerick, which probably mirrors that of other places around the country, the hardcore leaders of these gangs are targeting young people, children in their early teens.  They are grooming them and in doing so they are assuming the role of parental responsibility.  We must get the social service agencies into this loop at an earlier stage.</P><Col N="106"/>
        <P>Last week the Garda Commissioner spoke at the Committee of Public Accounts and gave a very good account of the workings of the Garda.  I do not wish to paraphrase what he said but concerning the witness protection programme, he said he does not require to have it on a legislative foundation.  He was quite forceful on the matter.  He called on society to get involved in tackling crime alongside the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In this House we should take every opportunity to try to involve the wider community and should use our offices and the platform we have here as public representatives to encourage members of society to get involved in this way.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner also raised the issue of handguns which the Minister is addressing.  While I do not propose to take the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s words out of context, he indicated that the legislative tools he requires are either available to him or in the pipeline.  He did not state that resources were deficient but forcefully pointed out that sufficient resources were available to him.  The Commissioner was questioned on these issues by Government and Opposition Members.</P>
        <P>I compliment the work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Limerick city and county, which have excellent detection and success rates.  As a Deputy representing County Limerick, I am aware that the crime initiated by gangs in Limerick city affects the entire county.  These gangs supply the drug trade in the county and many of them live in areas of the county outside the city.  Many of the communities I represent are fearful that anyone in the county could suffer the same fate as Shane Geoghegan.  This fate could befall anyone anywhere in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The House should have a serious debate on some of the sentences being handed down in the courts because many members of the public believe sentencing is too lenient.  I will return to this issue at another time.</P>
        <P>On an issue to which Deputy Conlon alluded, the murder of Shane Geoghegan was an attack on middle Ireland.  However, middle Ireland is the market for the gangs who supply cocaine, heroin and ecstasy.  As with those who shot him, those who snort lines of cocaine, take ecstasy or use heroin, have Shane Geoghegan&rsquo;s blood on their hands.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, Paul Connaughton, Tom Sheahan, Catherine Byrne, Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell and Simon Coveney. </P>
        <P>The former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Michael McDowell, spoke eloquently in the debates leading up to the enactment of the Criminal Justice Act 2007.  On 19 December 2006, he stated that &ldquo;a Government can have no greater priority than the safety of its people&rdquo; and pointed out that the Government had provided a &ldquo;comprehensive programme of measures to ensure that the full resources of the State are brought to bear as never before&rdquo;.  He also asserted that it is &ldquo;no use willing the end of gangland activities unless we will the means&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Justice Act 2007 introduced a wide range of means to deal with the scourge of gangland crime, yet two years later we still await fundamental operational measures on the ground.  Hurdles are continually being placed before the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in it efforts to apprehend gang members and establish cases against them.  Problems have been encountered with the establishment of a DNA database, the upgrading of Garda communications equipment and the updating of interview principles and procedures.  Without reform and change in these areas, bail laws, sentencing recommendations and judicial instruments will be of little use.</P>
        <P>I express my sympathy to the family of the late Shane Geoghegan.  The brutal murder of Mr. Geoghegan in Limerick during the weekend before last horrified the nation and clearly illus<Col N="107"/>trated the threat posed by gangland figures to innocent members of society.  The failure of the criminal justice system to secure convictions in 113 of the 127 gangland killings which have taken place since 1998 shows the Government is losing the war on gangland crime.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s response to this issue last week and in speaking to the motion last evening struck me as one of resignation, an acceptance of the <i>status quo</i> and an acknowledgement, as it were, that society will have to put up with this problem.  The Minister&rsquo;s attitude is not good enough.  Has anybody been convicted of directing gang activity under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2007?  The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo; and this will continue to be the case for as long as the Minister fails to take control and lead a strong, unstoppable effort to break up the gangs and put the thugs behind bars.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, especially those based in Limerick, on their work in solving the cases presented to them.  Better police work solves crime in the short term. Unfortunately, however, the Garda must be lucky all the time, whereas gangs can afford to be lucky occasionally.</P>
        <P>The Government must ensure the Garda is equipped with the most modern equipment to counter gangland crime.  The force needs the long promised digital radio communications system as the current equipment is outdated and easy to hack into.  Speaking on the Garda communications system in December 2006, the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. McDowell, referred to high level project groups, procurement processes, financial due diligence and finance approval, in other words, the usual web of red tape and paper shuffling.  Nothing has changed under the current Minister&rsquo;s watch.  Those on the ground who put their lives on the line are still waiting.  When will the essential communications system be made available to the Garda?</P>
        <P>On the criminal age of responsibility, anecdotal evidence suggests children are being exploited and drawn into gangland activity.  In recent times, we have heard of ten year olds proudly wearing bullet proof vests.  I urge the Minister to treat those responsible for drawing children into gangland crime with the full vigour of the law.</P>
        <P>With regard to Garda interrogation, the procedure under which members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are compelled to document and record evidence needs to be revised.  The practice of garda&iacute; having to transcribe questions during interrogation is outdated.  Surely it is time video recordings of interrogation sessions were allowed as evidence.</P>
        <P>Gangland crime is closely linked to the drug trade.  Gangs rule with virtual impunity and jealously guard and fight for territory.  Their members have no regard for life and will do anything to protect their empires.  The value of drug seizures in the past year is approaching &euro;1 billion.  The link between gang suppliers and so-called middle Ireland must be tackled.  To break this link, much stronger penalties should be imposed on recreational drug users, for example, by making them participate in community service in areas which have been savaged by drugs.  Furthermore, moneys seized from gangland activities should be pumped back into these communities.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Standing in Thomond Park in sympathy with the family, fianc&eacute; and friends of Shane Geoghegan, I could sense the heartfelt wish of people to recover our country from the thugs and gangs.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party has not been successful in dealing with gangland crime in the past ten years.  Shane Geoghegan was the 17th victim of gangs this year alone and of the 127 people killed in the past ten years, only 14 convictions have been secured, hardly a record of success by any manner or means.</P><Col N="108"/>
        <P>I do not suggest that simple solutions are available.  However, the first requirement of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in Government is to come out of denial mode and accept that there is a serious problem.  The Government relies heavily on statistics which tend to fluctuate in the areas of headline and indictable crime.  It is clear that there has been a large and inexorable increase in violent crime, specifically killings, the use of firearms and knives and drug related crime.  The Government should take its collective head out of the sand.</P>
        <P>From time to time, some members of the media, which are noticeably absent for this debate, treat the issue of crime very lightly.  I suppose the media will pronounce on the issue before we know where we are.  It is necessary to be factual and truthful towards people and the Government has failed in this regard.  We used to have a pretence from the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about the number of garda&iacute; which involved counting fellows who had been inside the door of Templemore for one day as fully attested garda&iacute;.  Even now, while the Government amendment refers to 1,100 Garda trainees, it does not mention that the figure will fall to 400 next year.  It is important to tell people these facts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have the pretence from the Minister that the motion was tabled by the Fine Gael Party to criticise the Garda.  With all due respect to the Minister, this is a silly defence which should be beyond him.   The motion is aimed at criticising the Government and urging support for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the reform and updating of the criminal justice system.  We demand answers to very legitimate questions.  There is a promise to introduce legislation on a DNA database next year.  The Minister does not mention that this was promised in 2006 and was due to be law in 2007.  We had promises in relation to the criminal procedure Bill, dealing with the possibility of the retrial of an acquitted person in the event of perjury and so on.  How will the other issues raised by the criminal law review group be dealt with, matters such as the exclusionary rule and so on?  What we are getting from the Government is a knee-jerk reaction when what is needed is a sustained committed approach, resources for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and continual updating of the criminal justice system.  We had many debates in the last D&aacute;il in relation to electronic tagging, for instance, and how useful that would be from the viewpoint of dealing with criminals and suspects.  Eventually, as a result of Fine Gael urging, that was put into legislation in 2006 and 2007.  However, the present Minister clearly has no intention of implementing that important measure.  It has been a feature of the criminal justice systems in Canada since 1984 and is common in many EU countries as well as in New Zealand, Australia and the United States and yet we do not have it.  On the other hand, we have a system in which, clearly, there is failure by the authorities to keep track of suspects released.  As a consequence, the number of offences committed by suspects released on bail has risen by 60% in the last four years, from 15,000 to more than 25,000.  If we had implemented what is now law, we should have a system that allows the authorities to keep track of serious offenders when they are released from prison, such as sex offenders or violent criminals who are likely to re-offend, and also a system that would allow people released on bail to be electronically monitored.</P>
        <P>This is a Government that is not dealing with crime in the sustained manner that is needed.  It is not using the further legislative measures that are required and from that point of view it must stand condemned.  We demand a consistent sustained approach, which will be supported by Fine Gael while this Government lasts in office, to attack the enormous amount of crime that exists, give resources to the Garda and reform and implement the criminal justice system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Deputy Charles Flanagan for bringing this motion to the D&aacute;il.  Irrespective of how the Government massages the figures, it can only reach one conclusion, namely, that it is losing the battle against gangland killings.</P>
        <P>My greatest concern, however, is the Limerick situation because while everyone accepts the Garda is doing a wonderful job there, the battle is still being lost.  There are literally 100 reasons why gangland crime is escalating, and everybody accepts the drug trade is at the heart of the problem.  Illegal drugs and drug dealers mean criminal activity spilling into the lives of people in ordinary communities.  As we all know, this scourge is moving into every community in the country.  The competition for rank or market share &mdash; the &ldquo;patch&rdquo;, as they call it in the market for drugs &mdash; is extreme.  The only deterrent for those criminal scumbags is to eliminate each other with the gun.  No democratic society can tolerate this carry-on, and if it is left to fester it will bring much greater grief to those families that are far removed from the criminal gang communities.</P>
        <P>Our courts system depends on witnesses telling their version of events truthfully to judge and jury, but criminals are intervening by treating such witnesses with the same fate they mete out to each other and few people take such threats lightly.  Our Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to be accepted by most people as an even-handed respected law enforcement agency for the protection of all law-abiding citizens.  However, criminals exercise their own brand of power on people who do not wish to be involved.  Many cases now come to court where witnesses change their evidence, interference with jurors is suspected and where fear and intimidation stalks the system.  Ordinary people around the country know very little about this dangerous and murky matter, but many people are gripped with fear of intimidation.  That is why the Government is guilty of turning its back on crime, when so much more could be done to limit this criminal scourge.</P>
        <P>For instance, will the Minister of State say why it has taken so long to implement covert tapping as regards all criminal activities, irrespective of where or who the criminals are, and have this material presented as evidence in court?  I also believe that in murder cases the right of silence should not benefit the criminal in any shape or form.  Indeed, the witness protection scheme must be able to assure those witnesses who want to break free of the cycle of fear that it can protect them.  Should witnesses and jurors continue to be intimidated, as in Limerick and other places, consideration must be given to some cases being held in the Special Criminal Court.  That is not something I readily approve of, but there is no alternative if this intimidation continues.</P>
        <P>Members of this Government and its predecessor, including the Ceann Comhairle in the past, have spoken eloquently about zero tolerance.  We are a million miles away from zero tolerance now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I am surprised the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not here, with due respect to the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moloney.  In fact the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, should be here with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform because there is a cross-over.</P>
        <P>We are here, really, as a consequence of the death of Shane Geoghegan.  That is why my colleague, Deputy Charles Flanagan, who is to be complimented, has brought this forward.  The profile of the murderer who killed Shane Geoghegan would probably be as follows: he came from local authority housing, which was mismanaged in the 1970s and 1980s, was an early school leaver, suffered from social deprivation and through greed and without values, he gunned down an innocent man.  That is the profile of the murderer, the man who killed Shane Geoghegan.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Sociological data states we are a society of middle mass and underclass, which we as a society have created.  We have a prison system at present which can only be described as an academy of crime.  The recidivist rate at St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution correctional facility at present, I believe, is between 70% and 80%.  Why is this?  The vast majority of residents in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution have come from the same four to six postal districts since its inception.   St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution is run as an institute of incarceration and not education.  Cutbacks have come right, left and centre to the workshops and educational facility.  There is no emphasis on rehabilitation or education.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>We can say, &ldquo;Lock them up and throw away the key&rdquo; and many people believe that, but it is not the answer.  There must be more emphasis on rehabilitation and education of detainees because the formal education system has failed them.  The only way forward is education and rehabilitation so we will not have the recidivist rate of 70% to 80%.</P>
        <P>In our country of four million people, which is approximately the same population as greater Manchester, we are to blame because we have socially constructed and engineered this deprivation within society.  President-elect of the United States, Barack Obama was elected despite the fact that the African-American population is 12% of the total US population and 50% of those incarcerated are African-American.  This comes back to the deprivation we are discussing.</P>
        <P>One must ask what is the educational attainment of prisoners in this country.  It is less than the junior certificate.  Our prisons should be filled by violent criminals and not those who owe money in fines, petty criminals or psychiatric patients.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>This situation on our streets has now reached crisis point.  Another innocent life was lost last week, and my sympathies are with the family of Mr. Shane Geoghegan.  I watched his mother on television last night as she spoke about the death of her son.  It brought home the sad reality of how gangland crime can tear families apart and one would have to be made of stone not to be moved by her courage and how she spoke about her son.  We can swap statistics and figures but we must realise there is a human element to this situation.</P>
        <P>Communities and families are being affected by gangland activity.  It is not about being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  We are all entitled to walk down the street or through our neighbourhoods without our lives being threatened.  When I think back to the killing of Mr. Anthony Campbell in Finglas, a young plumber who was going about his daily work, or Ms Donna Cleary, who was shot dead at a party in Coolock, I am deeply saddened by the thought <Col N="111"/>of these young, innocent victims whose lives were cut short by those who have no respect for human life or law and order.</P>
        <P>It is more than obvious that the system is really failing when it comes to bringing criminals to justice.  If the criminal justice system does not put proper deterrents in place to prevent criminals from taking the law into their own hands and killing anyone who gets in their way this situation will spiral further out of control.  All murder convictions should incur a sentence of 25 years in jail.  In recent years sentences of just 13 years have been handed down for murder and this is not enough.</P>
        <P>The main causes of gangland activity are drug-related yet in 2006 just one person received the mandatory ten year sentence for drug dealing.  This is a joke.  People dealing in drugs are themselves passing on a death sentence to anyone they supply.  They receive short sentences and are released.  Drugs are a lethal weapon and the sentences must reflect the seriousness of the crime.</P>
        <P>On my own doorstep in Inchicore, Walkinstown, Ballyfermot and Crumlin, 15 people have been shot dead.  Many of these have stemmed from gangland activity involving the feuding gangs in Crumlin and Drimnagh.  These gangs have wreaked havoc on our local community for the past ten years.  After Limerick, this is the bloodiest gangland feud in the country involving rival groups, who started off dabbling in drugs and are now fighting for control of the drugs trade on their patch.  In today&rsquo;s society, it seems that drugs equal power.  Drug dealers are becoming very powerful and they can control entire communities.  I will never forget the senseless killing of the two young Polish men in Drimnagh earlier this year who were violently attacked by a group of teenagers.  This shows that the gang mentality can raise its ugly head in other equally dangerous forms.</P>
        <P>The grim reality is that many drug dealers and gangs are better equipped than the Garda.  They have technology, illegal guns  and proper cars which the Garda do not have.  A guard told me even their handcuffs are outdated.  Despite Government promises, the 2009 intake into the Garda Training College will be reduced, which is unbelievable as crime is at an all-time high in this country.  We urgently need more community garda&iacute; on our streets who walk the streets, listen to people and understand and relate to young people.  I urge the Minister to recruit more garda&iacute; to Templemore and not to reduce the number.</P>
        <P>We have to stop giving these criminals an easy ride.  For them crime pays and that is why we have to get tough, and the softly-softly approach has failed.  Mr. Shane Geoghehan&rsquo;s death was the 17th gangland murder this year.  Must we wait until another innocent victim is murdered on our streets before the Minister and the Government make protecting our communities a priority?</P>

I was in Thomond Park last night and the people of Limerick and Munster stood in silence for one minute as a tribute to the late Mr. Shane Geoghegan who was brutally murdered by ruthless individuals in Limerick.  The people of Limerick want this issue solved.  Enough is enough and I add my voice to the appeal on &ldquo;Crimecall&rdquo; last night for anyone who knows anything at all to come forward and bring these ruthless individuals to heel and lock them up for life.  What they have done must be dealt with in a firm way and a sentence of 25 years for murder must mean 25 years.</P>
        <P>I read the transcript of the Minister&rsquo;s speech last night and he said he would provide all the necessary resources to solve the murder of Mr. Shane Geoghegan.  The Minister and the <Col N="112"/>Government have not done enough.  I proposed practical measures in the emergency debate last week, I reiterate them now and propose some other items that should be looked at.  The garda&iacute; in Limerick are doing a very good job under extremely difficult circumstances with a lack of resources and proper legislation.  They are conducting house to house searches and everything possible to apprehend the murderer.  The report of Mr. John Fitzgerald on social deprivation in Limerick, which was commissioned by the Government, looked for the establishment of a properly resourced CAB in Limerick and that should happen as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>Much of the gangland crime in Limerick is directed from Limerick Prison.  I put the issue of the blocking of mobile phones in and out of Limerick Prison to the Minister last week and we must also look at the licensing of prepaid mobile phones.  We must destroy the network of drug barons nationally.  People in Limerick and elsewhere who are using recreational drugs must realise they are creating the demand for these drugs.  Without the demand, drugs barons would not exist.  People who use drugs must take on board that they contribute to these murders.</P>
        <P>The issue of drug dealing must be looked at on a Europe-wide basis.  We have a huge coastline that is impossible to police fully.  The Government should seek to police drug dealing on a Europe-wide basis.  Most of the drugs entering Europe come through Ireland.  Our coastlines are not properly policed and the Government should look to the EU to help deal with this problem.</P>
        <P>I call on the Government to establish a task force to look at gangland crime.  The task force should be headed by a former member of the Judiciary and should report within a month on how to tackle the issue.  We want the issue tackled in Limerick.  We want resources provided so that by apprehending the murderer of Shane Geoghegan we can properly remember him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I too was in Thomond Park last night.  I was approached there by a number of former colleagues from Garryowen rugby club and reminded of how deep an impact the recent murder of Shane Geoghegan has had on not just the sporting community in Limerick, but on his close friends.</P>
        <P>We have a job to do in this House.  We must provide an adequate and determined response from the State in terms of new thinking and a new approach towards assisting the Garda, where possible, in surveillance, in ensuring convictions are achieved to ensure tough prison terms and to combat drug trafficking and, most importantly, to target demand for illegal drugs.</P>
        <P>I do not have much time this evening so I will concentrate on this area, in particular the demand for cocaine that is prevalent in Ireland currently.  The drugs trade is no different to the arms trade or the trade in young women for prostitution.  As long as there is a strong demand from users, vast sums of money can and will be made by meeting that demand illegally.  No matter what policing resources are thrown at the drugs trade, drugs will continue to find their way into society as long as demand exists.</P>
        <P>I want to put some facts on the record on drug use, particularly cocaine use, in Ireland.  Some 5.3% of adults between the ages of 50 and 64 in Ireland have used cocaine, over 150,000 people.  Some 25% of users use at least once per week.  That is, 37,000 people use cocaine every week.  Some 7% use cocaine every day, that is, more than 10,000 people use it on a daily basis.  Some 23% of people personally know somebody taking cocaine, over 700,000 adults.  There has been an increase of 50% in the number of professionals and executives seeking treatment in the past three years.  This is not a problem of people in deprived areas.  This is middle class Ireland.</P><Col N="113"/>
        <P>People get cocaine at discos and night clubs, but mostly from their friends at house parties.  In Limerick alone, the Garda has confiscated more than &euro;3.5 million worth of cocaine this year.  We have a problem.  Innocent people are being killed because many, from all sectors of society, demand and use cocaine.  Until the dinner parties in middle class homes are targeted as well as the toilets of night clubs, we will make no serious impact on the demand for and use of cocaine here.  This demand fuels crime, violence and the murder machine that infects society through violent gangland crime.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>This has been a useful debate as it has given us all the opportunity to condemn unlawful killing, in particular the murder of Shane Geoghegan.  Deputies raised the issues of bail, the Criminal Justice Act, concerns about the 3% reduction in expenditure, digital radio services and Garda figures and I hope to respond on some of those issues.</P>
        <P>The current figures with regard to crimes committed by those released on bail show the number of offences committed is decreasing.  The figure for the first half of 2008 represents a decrease of 50% on the figures of the corresponding period last year.  The Criminal Justice Act 2007 introduced new provisions designed to tighten up on the granting of bail.  For example, a person can be required to provide a statement of means, previous criminal record and details of any offences committed while previously on bail.  The law takes a serious view of offences committed while on bail and it is mandatory that a sentence for such an offence is consecutive to the sentence for the first offence.  Committing an offence while on bail is to be regarded as an aggravating factor and failure to answer to bail is to be regarded as an offence committed while on bail.</P>
        <P>The granting of bail is a matter for the courts.  The DPP, who is independent in the performance of his function, represents the State for the purpose for dealing with such applications.  The Minister is keeping the situation with regard to bail under review and will consider whether there is need for him to take any further action on it.  He has confirmed that the changes brought about through the 2007 Act, which have not been long in place, are bringing about an improvement in the situation.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Justice Act 2007 contains a provision on electronic tagging, a matter to which a number of Deputies referred.  There are complex issues with regard to bringing into force the provisions for tagging people granted bail, including cost effectiveness and developments in technology.  The Minister is keeping this issue under review.  There is a possibility that if tagging was available this would lead to an increase in the number of people being granted bail by the courts because they might be persuaded it would be safe to release people on bail &mdash; if they are tagged &mdash; who would otherwise be detained in custody.</P>
        <P>The Minister understands that the DPP is satisfied there is no danger of his office being unable to deal with the prosecution files submitted to him.  The office has been well treated over the years in terms of resources.  Many Members raised their concerns about the 3% cut in the payroll of the office of the DPP.  The Minister understands the office will meet the reduced levels through a combination of factors such as changes in work practices, postponements in filling vacancies and the tight control of overtime payments.</P>
        <P>Many Deputies raised the issue of digital radio.  Plans are well advanced for the roll-out of the digital radio service to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for next year.  The implementation process has already commenced and it is planned to roll out the service, starting with the Dublin metropolitan area next April.  By the end of 2009, it is estimated that over 9,700 garda&iacute; &mdash; approximately 67% of current Garda numbers &mdash; 1,294 Garda vehicles and 136 Garda motor cycles will be <Col N="114"/>fully equipped and operating on the new digital radio service.  In addition to radio communications, the system will also be used for SMS type messaging and for voice calls to report incident details for the Garda information services centre in Castlebar for entry to the PULSE system.  This will obviate the need for garda&iacute; to carry both a radio and a mobile phone.</P>
        <P>The prison and probation services provide a range of rehabilitative programmes with the aim of encouraging positive personal development of prisoners and preparing them for reintegration and resettlement on release from custody.  Over 250 prison service posts and an increased number of 90 workshops operate in our prisons catering for this.</P>
        <P>Before I conclude, I would like to correct the record with reference to the comments about low Garda numbers.  There will be 15,000 garda&iacute; in place by the end of 2009.  This is the figure mentioned in the Opposition contract during the most recent general election campaign.  The Opposition targeted 2012 to achieve that figure.</P>
        <P>Consequently, the Garda figures we promised by and large are in keeping with those that obtain at present.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to touch on an issue that has not been raised earlier in respect of the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB.  I refer to what I should describe as a chestnut of mine, namely, a regional version of CAB.  For too long, CAB has focused exclusively on the major players.  While I can understand the logic behind this, it also would be logical to establish a regional version of CAB that would be able to take on such people while they are still small fish and before they become dangerous sharks.  I know, and the Garda know, who the drug dealers are in my town.  Most Members know who the drug dealers are and who are the main players.  Although the information exists, the problem is that both the will and resources to deal with it are lacking.  For example, I once contacted CAB to deal with a man who had no source of income but who was driving a large, brand new jeep.  The CAB stated he was too small a player, which I accept, as it should concentrate on the major players.  However, I then contacted Revenue only to be told it was not Revenue&rsquo;s job and the Garda then stated it did not have the resources.</P>
        <P>My point is the requisite information exists and although it is soft information, people must come out of the comfort zone and use it.  Such information is widely available in this House and every superintendent in the State knows exactly who are the people in question.  However, I question whether we are prepared to invest in the social capital of our communities to take them on before they become dangerous criminals who engage in warfare with one another and who catch innocent civilians in the crossfire.  While it is not a shiny Luas tram or a new tunnel at which one cuts an opening ribbon, it would be an investment in social capital.  Members such as Deputy Catherine Byrne, who is present, know exactly what I mean in this regard.  Her role in respect of drugs must be noted and should be considered quite exceptional.</P>
        <P>As my time is short and Deputy Neville wishes to make his contribution, I will touch on one other issue.  An <i>entente</i> exists between many institutions of the State, starting with the Minister.  The <i>entente</i> operates between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his <Col N="115"/>officials beside him, who constitute the permanent executive of this State.  The <i>entente</i> also includes Garda management, its senior officials, individual garda&iacute; and the Garda representative bodies.  Everyone operates within the comfort zone and no one wishes to step out of it to take on the real issue.  For example, no one wishes to deal with the fact that a garda who is stationed in a small area in which there is practically no trouble, apart perhaps from the need to run a few sheep from the road or something similar, receives the same salary as an officer who operates in deprived urban areas in which gangland warfare takes place.  This will be the case until the <i>entente</i> is broken by someone who asserts he or she will not continue with it to ensure there are no more Donna Clearys or Anthony Campbells.</P>
        <P>I also attended Thomond Park last night and the screen display regarding Mr. Geoghegan&rsquo;s decency will stick in my mind for a long time.  One ingredient that is necessary to break that <i>entente</i>, and which I do not believe the Minister possesses, is courage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I wish to deal with the concerns of the people of rural County Limerick.  This matter also is of extreme concern to them, given that tentacles of the difficulties and criminality in the city are extending out into County Limerick.</P>
        <P>Before doing so, however, I again sympathise with Tom and Mary Geoghegan, Shane&rsquo;s brother, Anthony, and his fianc&eacute;e, Jenna Barry.  I congratulate and empathise with Mary and Jenna on the bravery they showed last night while appearing on national television on the &ldquo;Crimecall&rdquo; programme to try to assist with the investigation into this horrible crime.  Deputies O&rsquo;Donnell and Noonan have expertly challenged the Government in respect of what has happened in the Kilteragh estate.  I know the Kilteragh estate very well, as a close member of my family, who was a friend of Shane, lived there and used to socialise with him.  The fear and trepidation of the people of the estate is palpable.  Such decent people, when going about their daily work and lives, should not be obliged to experience a level of fear and trepidation that almost invites a consideration to leave their homes.  In a civilised society it is unacceptable that people should experience what almost constitutes trauma in respect of the death of someone they knew well and loved.</P>
        <P>Such gangland crime also is of concern to the rural areas.  Both gangs have purchased properties in County Limerick, the far west of the county included.  Such properties are not holiday homes but constitute bases for the development of drug distribution in County Limerick in the future, if not already.  While drug problems exist everywhere in Ireland, I have no doubt but that the drug problem in County Limerick has the mark of the aforementioned two gangs on it.  I am concerned that the people of rural County Limerick may experience the ravages endured by the constituency represented by Deputies O&rsquo;Donnell and Noonan.</P>
        <P>It is time for the Minister to act to ensure our society is rid of this scourge.  The problem has been identified for many years and surely the Government has the wherewithal to ensure that such vile activity can be removed from our society.  The Minister must take action to so do and to ensure that people are protected and can feel safe in their communities and that this vile activity does not extend to other areas.  Deputy Deenihan expressed his concern last night regarding its extension to northern Kerry and he has information that the activity of these gangs has extended to this area.  In rural County Limerick, CAB already has confiscated the property of one of the gangs.  Moreover, there has been murder in the county area that was connected to both gangs.</P>
        <P>I wish to express to the Minister the concern of the people of the rural areas of the new Limerick constituency regarding what is happening in areas of the city.  Although I come from <Col N="116"/>the rural part of the county, Limerick is my city and one rightly talks it up.  There is extreme concern in respect of the image Limerick city is obtaining because of such activities.  However, last night demonstrated another side of the passionate, sporting, honest and decent people of Limerick and its surrounding areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to begin by thanking those who spoke sincerely and constructively during the debate on this grave issue, particularly my colleagues in Fine Gael and Members of the Labour Party.  All Members share a feeling of revulsion in respect of the activities of gangland criminals, whether such activity involves murder, violence, intimidation, drug dealing, drug smuggling or terrorising communities.  Where Fine Gael differs from the Government parties and the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in particular, is in respect of how gangland crime should and will be tackled.  In recent years, the Government&rsquo;s approach has been characterised by a flurry of promises after every gruesome gangland murder followed by a prolonged period of inactivity.  This has been evident since the horrific Crumlin knife crime of last February.</P>
        <P>The typical approach of only taking action when matters have reached crisis point has been maintained by the Minister and his predecessor, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  Hence, the heads of legislation planned during former Minister Michael McDowell&rsquo;s tenure have not yet been published.  Criminal Justice Acts passed during the previous D&aacute;il are not yet commenced in many respects.  There has been inaction in terms of surveillance, regulations around restrictions on the right to silence, double jeopardy, sentencing guidelines and resourcing of Customs and Excise.</P>
        <P>The Minister has boasted of the resources he has allocated to policing numbers, Operation Anvil and the Criminal Assets Bureau, but none of these ideas is new or even came from him in the first instance.  He is merely maintaining the <i>status quo</i>, which is insufficient.  Clearly, more is needed.  That gangs are continuing to thrive is the proof in the pudding of the Government&rsquo;s approach to date.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael has introduced a package of measures geared at co-ordinating all of the relevant strands of the criminal justice system in the fight against gangland crime.  Lack of co-ordination is the issue.  The Garda, the courts, the prisons and the Minister&rsquo;s office operate as independent republics with no co-ordination between them.</P>
        <P>We must provide the Garda with modern equipment for crime prevention and evidence gathering, address deficiencies in the court system, establish a judicial sentencing commission, transform our prisons into centres of rehabilitation, which was eloquently put by my colleague, Deputy Sheahan, and, above all, address the scandalous Government apathy in respect of the importation of drugs into the State, as mentioned by my colleague, Deputy Coveney.</P>
        <P>Preventing the importation of drugs into the State must be the cornerstone of any effort to end gangland criminality.  The drugs scourge has led to the origin and sustenance of criminal gangs for a long time.  These drugs enter our unpoliced coastline, through smaller and private airports that rarely, if ever, see a customs inspector and through our ports, where traffic is only sporadically subjected to X-ray scans or intelligence efforts.  Until this gross anomaly is addressed, garda&iacute;, the courts and the DPP will be fighting a losing battle against the gangs.</P>
        <P>For reasons best known to himself, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is clearly most reluctant to take decisive action in respect of gangland crime.  His apathy has led Fine Gael to draft a Private Members&rsquo; Bill today containing a package of measures, including criminal organisation civil restriction orders, which would make it difficult for gangland crimi<Col N="117"/>nals to conduct their business and, accordingly, would serve as an important function in the fight against gangland crime and address the difficulties posed by sections 71 to 73 of Mr. McDowell&rsquo;s 2006 legislation.  Our Bill also addresses loopholes around sentencing, automatic remission and penalties for possession of blades and firearms.</P>
        <P>The Minister has shown a petty and petulant attitude to Private Members&rsquo; legislation.  He owes a duty of care to citizens and the victims of gangland crime and their families to rouse himself from his apathy and to take on the gangland criminals through every means available, including the courts, the Garda, the DPP &mdash; the resources of which the Minister slashed &mdash; and the Customs and Excise, to which neither he nor the Minister for Finance has given particular attention.</P>
        <P>Rarely before has there been such a unity of purpose in the nation in respect of putting an end to gangland crime.  The Minister must find the courage and humility to do what needs to be done to eradicate organised crime in the State.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important matter which relates to a family with a number of children who have special needs and who previously were in receipt of a home care package in recognition of their special needs.  As the pressure on this family was so great and in order to be nearer family members for support, they decided to move from County Kildare to their parents&rsquo; home in County Galway.  Unfortunately, given the current fluctuation in the housing market, it was necessary for them to return to County Kildare.  The problem now is that their home care package has been re-allocated.</P>
        <P>This is not a simple situation.  It is one which the Minister of State might take up with his Department.  It is odd that while previously the home care package was available to this family under the old health board system and that were it still in existence it would have been possible <Col N="119"/>to restore to them the home care package on their return to County Kildare, that under the single health board now in operation this was found to be impossible.</P>
        <P>I received a note in regard to this family from a neighbour who states that one of the children suffers from autism and kidney problems, a second child has hearing and speech problems and a third child suffers from chronic eczema problems that require the child to be almost completely bandaged and cared for full-time.  The manner in which this family must operate is distressing.  Both parents are teachers, one of whom has taken time off from work to care for the children while the other parent is at work.</P>
        <P>When I took up this issue a few weeks ago, the family was not in receipt of a medical card although I believe they are entitled to one.  The parents are devoting all of their time to addressing their children&rsquo;s health needs.  I do not believe there is any more deserving case than this.  I received the following response to a parliamentary question:</P>
        <P LI="1">This family did receive home support hours previously and then left County Kildare and moved to County Galway.  As we have not received an additional allocation for home support hours for the past number of years, we have been recycling hours to new families when they become available.  This, in effect, is what happened to this family&rsquo;s hours when the family left Kildare.  We now have a waiting list for children for home support and we are reviewing this service on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P FLI="0">On 4 November I was told the family had been placed on a waiting list, that the service is being reviewed on an ongoing basis and that there are 27 children ahead of them.  There were 27 children ahead of them on 29 September and as such the queue is not shortening.  I ask the Minister of State, as a humanitarian gesture and in view of the extreme stress under which this family is currently operating and the fact they are caring for their family as best they can, to intervene and to make an exception in this case.  Will he at least consider providing them with some support hours in order to relieve the stress on the wife in particular, which is enormous and will get worse?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I take this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</P>
        <P>I wish to emphasise the Government&rsquo;s commitment to providing a high quality service to all people with a disability.  This commitment is illustrated by the substantial investment we have been making in disability services during the past number of years.  In recent years, significant additional resources have been provided for services and supports in this area.  The multi-annual investment programme, which is a key component of the Government&rsquo;s disability strategy, will by the end of 2008 have provided for 980 new residential places, 313 new respite places, 2,505 new day places for the intellectual disability service, 300 new residential places and 950,000 extra home care-personal assistance hours for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  Funding was also provided for the targeted transfer of persons with intellectual disability-autism from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements.</P>
        <P>Since 2006 more than &euro;550 million has been allocated to the HSE under the multi-annual investment programme, of which &euro;425 million was for disability services and &euro;125 million for mental health.  The Government has further emphasised this pledge to people with disabilities by allocating additional funding to the continued development and enhancement of services in 2009.  In budget 2009, an additional &euro;10 million was allocated to the HSE for services in the area of disability and mental health.  The funding for 2009 will provide for 125 additional therapy posts in the disability and mental health services area targeted at children of school-<Col N="120"/>going age.  In addition, once-off funding of &euro;1.75 million is being provided for suicide prevention initiatives and for mental health projects supporting service users and carers.</P>
        <P>With regard to the specific matter raised by Deputy Durkan, I understand from the HSE that the person concerned was receiving home support from his local HSE.  When his family moved to another county, the home support hours were allocated to other children.  When he and his family returned home approximately one year later there were no unallocated home support hours available.  There are many children with autism who require home supports and there is a high demand for these services.  I understand the HSE in the relevant area is currently reviewing the service and expects to have home support hours available in January as a result of this review.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise this matter to clarify the position of the Minister for Health and Children and the Government in regard to their commitment to the ongoing development of Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to understand what is the attitude of the Health Service Executive and Professor Brendan Drumm to Connolly Hospital.  Is it to be developed on a par with the other Dublin teaching hospitals, namely, Beaumont Hospital and the Mater Hospital or is it to be a Cinderella sister to the big Dublin teaching hospitals?</P>
        <P>Connolly Hospital, situated as it is on the M50 and M3, serves a large part of Meath as well as Dublin 15, Cabra, the Navan Road and Finglas.  Given the restriction of activities in Navan Hospital in particular there has been a surge in demand for the services of Connolly Hospital.  Although the HSE has promised a new hospital for the north east it does not seem as though this will be developed and opened any time soon given the mess of our public finances.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, stated on the record that there is not a red cent available to develop it.  The burden on Connolly Hospital is, therefore, likely to grow.  Sufficient resources must be provided to meet the increased demand and to develop the hospital as a regional centre of medical excellence, which is what the Government previously promised.</P>
        <P>I want the Minister to give a clear and unequivocal commitment that Connolly Hospital will receive the resources it needs, in particular in respect of accident and emergency services and modern imaging equipment.  It is hard to believe that a modern hospital serving such a large population has to transport people to the new private Hermitage Medical Clinic in Liffey Valley, the Mater Hospital and Beaumont Hospital for MRI and CAT scans.  These services are vitally important to ensure doctors can make an accurate diagnosis.</P>
        <P>When I previously raised this matter in the D&aacute;il I was told that a proposed co-located private hospital would be built on the grounds of Connolly Hospital.  We were led to believe that a private hospital operator was insisting on having exclusive rights to the provision of modern imaging services such as CAT and MRI scans.  We were told that Connolly Hospital, the public hospital and its patients must wait.</P>
        <P>Given the current cost of bank borrowing, it seems likely that from a financial point of view, this particular co-location proposal is dead in the water.  Must Connolly Hospital wait indefinitely for its MRI scanner?  The Progressive Democrats Party is dead as a political party yet its policy of co-locating private hospitals lives on like a virus infecting the entire health system.  Taxpayers in Dublin 15 and surrounding communities are getting a raw deal as a result.</P><Col N="121"/>
      
        <P>Several million euro are wasted every year on transporting patients and their escorts in ambulances and taxis to have scans carried out in other hospitals in the Dublin area.  A cost-benefit analysis of MRI and CT scans would show that it makes economic sense to invest in the hospital rather than continue the present inefficient practice of outsourcing basic services.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, promised that Connolly Memorial Hospital would be developed as a major regional hospital when he opened the new wing in 2005.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>An on the record declaration of faith in the hospital and a commitment to adequate resourcing is now long overdue.  Unless a clear commitment is made to Connolly Memorial Hospital regarding its equipment, accident and emergency services and excellent staff, patients will inevitably suffer.  Plans are floating around the HSE for closing down accident and emergency units in the Dublin area, possibly including one on each of the north and the south sides of the city.  I hope I will receive an assurance that the accident and emergency unit will be safe.  Even if the private hospital development was to commence tomorrow, it will not be ready to open for at least three years.  Despite the fact that Connolly Memorial Hospital serves a population of 240,000, it does not have the modern imaging equipment possessed by practically every rural hospital in Europe.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I reiterate the Minister&rsquo;s continuing commitment to developing Connolly Memorial Hospital in a way that best meets the needs of patients.  This commitment is underlined by the investment that we have made in the hospital in recent years.  Phase one of the redevelopment of the hospital, which was completed at a cost of &euro;107 million, provided accommodation for a modern accident and emergency department, including a minor injuries unit.  This project also included the provision of theatres, intensive and critical care units, day surgery facilities, an acute psychiatric unit, a mental health day hospital and ward accommodation of approximately 180 replacement beds.  The new emergency department has 23 cubicles, three chest pain assessment bays and three high observation areas.  In 2007, the hospital received 32,000 emergency presentations resulting in the admission of 8,000 patients.  In 2008, the hospital saw 28,000 emergency presentations and admitted 6,500 patients by October.  The emergency department has approximately 100 staff including 53 nursing and 17 medical staff.  Refurbishment of the surgical block was completed early in 2008 at a cost of &euro;14.36 million and included a department of medicine for older people incorporating 56 replacement beds and day hospital and a medical day unit with endoscopy facilities and respiratory medicine department.</P>
        <P>A range of diagnostic services are provided at the hospital and appointments are allocated on a priority basis based on clinical need.  Urgent X-ray requests are processed either on the same day or within 24 hours, while urgent chest X-rays are seen on the same day.  All ultrasound and barium study referrals are assessed by a consultant radiologist and allocated on a priority basis.  With regard to urgent requests, the general practitioner contacts the consultant radiologist directly and the request is processed as soon as possible.  The hospital received approval and funding in the order of &euro;2.5 million for a replacement CT scanner.  It is expected this will be operational in 2009.</P>
        <P>All patients&rsquo; clinical requirements for MRI are met through Beaumont hospital or the purchase of private capacity.  There is no waiting list for this service.  At present, the activity level generated by Connolly hospital for this service is below the required norms for an MRI.  Diagnostic activity levels at the hospital are increasing, however, and the HSE will continue to monitor the situation with a view to developing increased capacity if required.</P><Col N="122"/>
        <P>I thank Deputy Burton for raising this matter.  I am happy to confirm that Connolly hospital continues to be an integral part of acute hospital services, as evidenced by the significant investment made in recent years in developing services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise this urgent matter because we have an opportunity in the December Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting to reverse the proposal on closing box 6A.  European fisherman will not be allowed to fish within an area comprising 14,600 square miles, or 23% of Irish waters, for a period of one year until the end of December 2009.  This will specifically affect the whitefish sector.</P>
        <P>Small boats from Greencastle, Burtonport, Killala or Belmullet cannot operate beyond the 100 fathom limit.  While I welcome conservation measures in general, bigger French and Spanish trawlers will be able to hoover up cod, whiting and haddock beyond the 100 fathom line.  The only people who will suffer, therefore, are the small boat operators who have traditionally worked within this limit.  How can we draw a line in Ireland&rsquo;s seas in the interest of conservation?  Do we expect fish to stay within this line rather than swimming to the area fished by Spanish and French trawlers?  I do not think so.</P>
        <P>We need to consider the reality of this situation.  We are in effect erecting two pillars and a gate at Ballyshannon in southern Donegal and closing an entire industry.  These fishermen were unable to avail of the decommissioning scheme because their boats were too small.  They are left with the burden of making repayments on boats.  They cannot fish for the next year and will have to sell their boats, which are worthless because they do not come within the remit of the decommissioning scheme, or walk away from the industry to claim social welfare.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food needs to show strength and leadership in Brussels by applying for a derogation for these small boats.  There is no reason why they should not fish on a small scale in 23% of Irish waters.  They will remain within the parameters of conservation measures.</P>
        <P>The scientific and impracticable solution of drawing lines in the sea will not work.  Even if we were to limit the days at sea in mackerel fisheries to six weeks as a conservation measure, modern technology and advances in boat building allow boats to hoover up fish during that period.  Boats from all over the world take fish during the permitted days at sea.</P>
        <P>We have to come up with a new solution.  This is an island nation and our fishermen have proposed solutions.  I urge the Minister, Deputy Smith, to allow men in small boats who do not damage whitefish stocks to continue fishing.  He needs to see sense.</P>
        <P>The entire coastal community of Ireland opposed the Lisbon treaty on the basis that it will drive fishermen out of a traditional way of life.  I will give those on the Government side of the House some advice.  If they want the people to buy into any European treaty we need to start to be pragmatic and introduce a wee bit of common sense.  If we show leadership, creativity and vision at a national level we will have a common sense result on our future in Europe.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an dTeachta Joe McHugh as an cheist th&aacute;bhachtach seo a ard&uacute;.  This matter refers to a recent proposal by the European Commission which calls for the establishment of a moratorium on fishing certain whitefish species in the area off the north west coast &mdash; technically called Area 6A which covers the areas from the <Col N="123"/>south Donegal coast north to north of Scotland.  It applies to all waters of a depth less than 200 m.  The proposed ban prohibits any fishing activity within this specified area.  Certain very limited derogations are allowed.  According to the Commission, its justification for this measure is based on scientific advice which has determined that the stocks of haddock, cod and whiting in the area are in poor shape and need time to recover.  The stated purpose of this proposal is to provide &ldquo;breathing space&rdquo; for these whitefish species to recover.</P>
        <P>Derogations for fishing in the area are to be allowed for fishing of pelagic species, shellfish with pots, and nephrops with 80 mm mesh using a Swedish grid and where at least 90% of the catches on board are nephrops.  Fishing for saithe and anglerfish will also be allowed.</P>
        <P>The scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas for cod in this area is that the spawning stock biomass is low, with low recruitment into the stock in recent years.  From a precautionary perspective the advice for 2009 is for a zero catch.  The scientific advice for haddock in the area is that the stock is at risk of reduced reproductive capacity and of being harvested unsustainably, and recommends a closure of the fishery in 2009 and the development and implementation of a recovery plan as a prerequisite to reopening this fishery.  The advice for whiting in this area is also indicating that the stock is in a poor state.</P>
        <P>This proposal has come as a complete surprise and the Commission had not given any advance warning or notification of its intentions.  The proposal has been included in Annex III of the Commission&rsquo;s 2009 total allowable catch and quota proposal, which was published on 10 November.  The total allowable catch and quota regulation sets out the various fishing opportunities for member states for 2009.</P>
        <P>The president of the European Association of Fish Producers Organisations, currently a representative of the Federation of Irish Fishermen, sent a letter to the Commission regarding the proposal on 29 October.  The European Association of Fish Producers Organisations expressed its surprise regarding the proposal and the Commission&rsquo;s method of presenting it.  The letter points out that the Commission has not followed normal practice and did not consult stakeholders through the EU Regional Advisory Council or other industry groups.  It points out that it is unacceptable for the Commission to make this proposal without at the very minimum consulting the stakeholders and assessing the serious impacts this measure will primarily have on coastal fleets of the adjacent countries which do not have the technical capacity to change activity.  It also pointed out the danger that there could be a significant displacement of effort to other areas and the socioeconomic effects of such a drastic measure should have been evaluated in advance by Scientific, Technical Economic Committee for Fisheries.  The EAPO is requesting the Commission not to proceed with the proposal, but instead to immediately put in place a consultation and evaluation process.</P>
        <P>My colleague with direct responsibility for fisheries, the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, who is dealing with this issue in Brussels at present, shares the industry&rsquo;s concerns about the lack of consultation and forewarning of the Commission&rsquo;s intentions regarding this ban.  It is clear to me that the proposal as it stands could have significant adverse socioeconomic impacts on the fishing communities off the north-west coast.  The Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, has already raised his concerns with the Commission and has asked for a proper evaluation of the measures by the STECF and for full discussions with stakeholders through the Regional Advisory Council.</P>
        <P>The proposal, in its current form, would have serious implications for Irish fishermen and Irish coastal communities.  We share the concern that it could also cause a significant displacement of fishing effort to other fishing areas, as vessels capable of moving to other areas shift <Col N="124"/>the focus of their operations.  This could also have major implications for stocks outside Area 6A where increased fishing activity will take place.  The Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, recognises the need for strong conservation measures for cod and the associated stocks of haddock and whiting as do the Minister, Deputy Smith, and I.  Today at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council, he accepted Commission proposals for the recovery of cod in this area.  These proposals involved restrictions on catch and reductions in the number of days vessels spend at sea.  The recovery plan involves year-on-year reductions in the total allowable catch and the fishing effort until safe biological limits for the stock is achieved.</P>
        <P>The plan&rsquo;s objective is to rebuild stocks so that fishermen and fishing communities can look forward to healthy stocks fished at sustainable levels into the future.  While this plan is targeted at cod recovery, the reality is that the reduced effort will apply to cod, haddock and whiting and this coupled with the reduced total allowable catch levels now being proposed will help to rebuild all these stocks over the coming years.  In these circumstances, the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, remains to be convinced that the additional measures, at least in their current form, are necessary.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, will be liaising closely with the Federation of Irish Fishermen on this issue and working hard in advance of, and at, the December Agriculture and Fisheries Council to ensure that any measures agreed at the Council are proportionate, appropriate and take into account the situation of the Irish whitefish fleet in this area.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCeann Comhairle as ucht an deis seo a thabhairt dom an t-&aacute;bhar seo a ard&uacute; sa D&aacute;il anocht.  O&rsquo;Carolan college in Nobber is one of the few entirely rural second level schools in Leinster.  It is situated in the beautiful, but small, village of Nobber and is named after the famous man of music, Turlough O&rsquo;Carolan.  The school having grown from relatively small beginnings is housed in a building provisionally designed for 250 students.  Under the great leadership of its current principal, Brian Goggins, the school has grown from 179 pupils in 2002 to approximately 415 today.  This remarkable increase is much greater than the rate of growth of population of County Meath.  It is testament to the education that is provided by O&rsquo;Carolan college and the work of all the teachers who have worked very hard in O&rsquo;Carolan college and in the community over the years.</P>
        <P>O&rsquo;Carolan college in Nobber is situated in the heart of north Meath.  Its catchment comes from parishes in County Meath such as Dromconrath, Nobber, Kilmainhamwood, Kingscourt in County Cavan, Kilbeg, Moynalty, Lobinstown, Kilberry and Rathkenny among others.  It is an anchor for the entire north Meath community.  The school continues to expand, but expects pupil numbers to stabilise at approximately 550 pupils in 2010, which is more than double the number of students the school was originally designed to cope with.  There are eight prefabs and four more are expected next year.  Its corridors and current entrances and exits are very small and not suited to the number of pupils using them.</P>
        <P>Pupils, parents and teachers of O&rsquo;Carolan college are therefore anxious that the school get the major building works it needs.  I am deeply committed to helping them in any way I can to move this building project forward.  It is badly needed.  In addition with the population stabilising, which means that the school population will stabilise in the next few years, I do not expect to be coming back &mdash; nor does the school expect to be coming back &mdash; looking for more after that.  When we think of rapidly developing areas, we do not tend to think of rural north <Col N="125"/>Meath and a unique second level school such as O&rsquo;Carolan college.  However, the college is rapidly developing, as is the area.</P>
        <P>The college is providing a great education, but needs a building commensurate with that.  The school motto is &ldquo;Saothar agus Sonas&rdquo; which means work and happiness or work and prosperity.  If the Minister does some of the saothar there will certainly be considerable sonas in O&rsquo;Carolan college and throughout north Meath.  I am urging the Minister to progress this building project as soon as he can.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for continuing to champion the many causes in north Meath and in particular this issue.  I am taking the Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  This affords me the opportunity to outline to this House the current position with regard to the proposed building project for O&rsquo;Carolan college, Nobber, County Meath.  The school is a co-educational facility operating under the aegis of County Meath VEC.  It had an enrolment of 359 pupils as of 1 September 2007.  In February 2006, the VEC asked the Department of Education and Science to examine the accommodation at O&rsquo;Carolan college with a view to making capital funding available for a refurbishment and extension project.  In common with all applications for large-scale capital funding, this application was assessed taking into account all the relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends in the area.  An accommodation brief to cater for a long-term projected enrolment of 500 pupils was subsequently agreed with the VEC.</P>
        <P>The area of the proposed new accommodation amounts to approximately 5,000 sq. m, which includes general classrooms, specialist rooms and an autism unit, along with a general purpose and dining area and other ancillary accommodation.  The project will also include refurbishment work to the existing school building.</P>
        <P>Under the published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects, each application for capital funding is assigned a band rating, which reflects the type of works needed at a school and the urgency attached to them.  There are four band ratings in all, with band 1 being the highest and band 4 the lowest.  Each band rating has a number of sub-categories which more specifically describes the type of works needed and the urgency attaching to them.</P>
        <P>Band 1 rated projects address accommodation needs in rapidly developing areas where either no accommodation exists or where the existing accommodation is not sufficient to meet the needs of a growing population.  It also addresses the provision of accommodation for special needs pupils, structurally unsound buildings and the provision of accommodation to underpin rationalisations.  A band 1.2 rating has been assigned to the project for O&rsquo;Carolan college, which reflects the fact that specialist accommodation is needed for pupils with special needs.</P>
        <P>The next step for the project is the appointment of a design team.  In this regard, this was already announced by the previous Minister for Education and Science.  Unfortunately, due to the level of demand on the Department of Education and Science capital budget, it has not been possible to progress the appointment of a design team to date.  However, the band rating assigned to the project is such that it is well positioned to proceed once the requisite funding is available.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, the Department has provided temporary accommodation at the school to cater for increasing enrolments as an interim measure.  It is open to the VEC to apply for further such accommodation until the Department is in a position to carry out the project for permanent accommodation.</P><Col N="126"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Department of Education and Science&rsquo;s capital allocation for next year will amount to &euro;581 million.  This will allow it to continue to significantly invest in primary and post-primary school buildings throughout the country, provide additional school places and continue the Department&rsquo;s programme of modernising existing schools.  Annual capital resources of this magnitude have allowed the Department to deliver over 7,800 building projects under the last national development plan alone.  The Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, looks forward to building on this unprecedented level of work with an allocation of &euro;4.5 billion for school buildings under the current plan.</P>
        <P>The Minister wants to assure the Deputy that the O&rsquo;Carolan college project will be considered for progression in this context, taking its band rating into account and as the necessary funding becomes available.  I again thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There are currently three public-private partnerships (PPPs) in train under the aegis of the Department, one of which is underway and the other two at various pre-contract stages.  These projects are the redevelopment of the National Theatre, the redevelopment of the National Concert Hall and the development of a National Conference Centre.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>National Theatre</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Government decided, in 2006, to proceed with the redevelopment of the Abbey Theatre by way of a &lsquo;build, finance and maintain&rsquo; PPP on a site at George&rsquo;s Dock.</P>
        <P>The project is being progressed.  In particular, Government approval has been secured to hold an international design competition for the new theatre, the specifications of which are being finalised by the Office of Public Works.</P>
       <P el="10"><i>National Concert Hall</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Government also decided, in 2006, to redevelop the National Concert Hall by way of a &lsquo;design, build, finance and maintain&rsquo; PPP, to incorporate a main auditorium with a seating capacity for more than 2,000 patrons.  The existing auditorium will be retained as a rehearsal hall and as a mid-scale public performance space, and there will be a third, smaller, flexible <Col N="128"/>hall.  It is also envisaged that the Earlsfort Terrace buildings will be re-united with the Iveagh Gardens, facilitating increased public access.</P>
        <P>Following a process of competitive dialogue that commenced in September of this year, the short-listed consortia will be invited to submit tenders in July 2009.  I remain committed to this redevelopment.</P>
      <P el="10"><i>National Conference Centre</i></P>
        <P el="0">In respect of the National Conference Centre, under the PPP agreement already in place, Spencer Dock Convention Centre Dublin Ltd. is required to &lsquo;design, build and finance&rsquo; the Centre and to operate and maintain it for a period of 25 years, after which the facility will revert to the State.  In return, once the construction of the Centre is complete and open for business, the State will pay the Company an annual charge, the maximum total cost of which over the 25 years will be just under &euro;380 million in present-day values.</P>
        <P>The development of a National Conference Centre will deliver significant numbers of international conference visitors to Ireland and will generate substantial foreign revenue earnings.  It is, therefore, all the more important that this project proceed apace.  I am pleased to report that the Centre remains on schedule to open on 1 September 2010.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, I want to emphasise my commitment to these projects and I am satisfied that the current challenging national and international economic climate will have limited impact upon the PPP projects currently in train.  In part, this is due to the beneficial nature of the PPP process itself, which spreads capital costs for the State over a longer period of time and involves the sharing of risk with the private sector.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 115 together.</P>
        <P>Work on the National Sports Facilities Strategy is at an advanced stage in my Department.  The aim of the strategy is to provide high-level policy direction for future investment/grant assistance at national, regional and local level.  It is intended to identify the facilities requirement for sport so that participation at reasonable cost is feasible for those who wish to engage in sport at either amateur or elite level.</P>
        <P>A nationwide audit of sports facilities is being carried out in conjunction with the strategy and is being completed in stages to help speed up the availability of information.  Phase one, which focuses on national and regional sports facilities, has now been completed within my Department.  Phase two of the audit, which is a more complex undertaking to establish a record of existing sports facilities at local level and identifying the need for future provision, is underway with the assistance of local authorities.  Guidelines have been issued to local authorities to assist them in carrying out the audit.</P><Col N="129"/>
        <P>Under the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by my Department funding is allocated towards the provision of sports facilities at national, regional and local level.  It is the primary vehicle for promoting the development of sports and recreational facilities in Ireland.  Through the Sports Capital Programme the Government has allocated over &euro;725 million in over 7,400 separate sports projects since 1998.  The Programme has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland with improved facilities in virtually every village, town and city.  The facilities funded range from new equipment for the smallest clubs to regional multi-sport centres and national centres of sporting excellence.</P>
        <P>The National Sports Facilities Strategy will address future sports facility funding and provision.  When the strategy has been completed it will be published as will phase one of the audit of sports facilities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has considered this review in detail, and in particular its recommendations and findings. There were two key recommendations: (1) the Irish Film Board should agree with the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism a set of measurable, quantifiable targets, including the timeframes for their delivery and the performance indicators by which progress will be measured, for the period 2006-2010. Performance indicators employed in this context should refer both to the outputs of the Board&rsquo;s activities and to outcomes for the industry.  (2) The type of indicators now to be provided should include, inter alia, &mdash; number of films made, total budgets, employment generated in the State, total spend in the State, and number of personnel trained. I am pleased to say that both of these recommendations are being implemented and procedures are now in place to ensure that appropriate mechanisms exist to enable my Department to monitor these <Col N="130"/>on an ongoing basis in the context of the determination of the Irish Film Board&rsquo;s annual funding.</P>
        <P>With regard to the findings, a key finding of the Review was that the Irish Film Board has established a system of schemes and supports, designed to assist all levels of the industry and without which significantly fewer Irish films would be made, resulting in a dilution of Irish culture on screen.</P>
        <P>In 2008 the film &ldquo;ONCE&rdquo; won the Oscar for Best Original Song, while &ldquo;HUNGER&rdquo; won the Camera D&rsquo;Or award at Cannes in May. The award at Cannes was the third year running that Irish film had been honoured at the Festival Cannes following on from &ldquo;THE WIND THAT SHAKES THE BARLEY&rdquo; and &ldquo;GARAGE&rdquo;. These awards are testament to the fact that film, as part of the audiovisual medium, is an area in which Ireland continues to excel.</P>
        <P>Film and filmmaking are of great value to Ireland, both financially and culturally. There is now more than ever greater global competition in securing film and television productions. Ireland continues to hold its own in this area thanks to the work of the Irish Film Board, our impressive talent pool of directors, writers, actors and technical crews and the various Government supports that are on offer, including Section 481 &ndash; which was extended until the end of 2012 in Budget 2008.</P>

	<P>The National Aquatic Centre is operated by NSCDA (Operations) Ltd., a subsidiary company of the National Sports Campus Development Authority.  All day-to-day operations of the National Aquatic Centre are a matter for the Authority and the operations company.  Following the restoration of possession of the National Aquatic Centre to the then Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Ltd. on 1 December 2006, an extensive capital programme was undertaken to restore the Centre to its original condition. Much effort has gone into rebuilding the reputation of the Centre and increasing its customer base. An initial subsidy of &euro;1.8 million was required for the Centre in its first full year of operation under the National Sports Campus Development Authority.  Following the first full year of operation under the new arrangements, a clearer picture of the operational needs of the Centre is emerging.  I am encouraged by the significant increase in both visitor numbers and income which is being achieved to date.</P>
        <P>The Authority has arranged for a financial assessment study, which will benchmark the National Aquatic Centre against other equivalent facilities, to be carried out.  This work is now nearing completion.  When the consultants&rsquo; report comes to hand it will be evaluated by the Authority who will advise me on the issues involved.  This exercise, together with the Centre&rsquo;s performance since it reverted to the direct control of the Authority, will inform my decisions on the funding requirements of the Centre both in the short and longer terms.</P>

	<P>In the Arts and Culture Plan 2008 my Department indicated that it aims to undertake a programme to encourage philanthropic support of the arts.  In response to that the Arts Council, which is funded by my Department, has completed a position paper on the subject.  The paper is very thought provoking and provides many interesting ideas in which this much under utilised source of funding for the arts could be harnessed.  </P>
        <P>This paper is currently under consideration taking into account that the financial environment against which such proposals must now be considered is changed vastly since publication of my Department&rsquo;s Plan and receipt of the Arts Council&rsquo;s paper.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 93.</P><Col N="132"/>
        <P>In a period of significant difficulties in major economies around the world and a challenging fiscal and economic climate at home, the Government introduced a fiscally responsible Budget in order to ensure stability in the public finances, to increase productivity and competitiveness and to protect those who are most vulnerable in our society.  To have done otherwise would be to put at risk the gains we have secured as a country in the last fifteen years.  The Government will continue to invest in public services but, in a time of scarcer resources, the value-for-money principle becomes all the more important.   Within my remit, the Budget consolidated Government investment to date in the areas of arts, culture, sport and tourism, with significant funding of approximately &euro;550 million allocated to the Department in 2009.  The reduction in the Department&rsquo;s capital budget relates to the fact that the 2008 budget made provision for large once-off projects in the Sports and Arts areas, including the new Lansdowne Road stadium which received &euro;93 million, the Gate Theatre, the new Opera House in Wexford, the new Lighthouse Cinema in Smithfield, the Carlow Arts Centre and the Everyman Theatre.  When these once-off projects are taken into account, the underlying upward trend in the capital available to the Department of &euro;146 million is maintained.</P>
        <P>In the arts, culture and film sector, the total allocation of &euro;185 million in 2009 constitutes a doubling in the budget for this sector over the past five years.  With specific regard to the Arts Council, the 2009 funding is just under &euro;76 million.  While this represents an overall reduction of 8% over 2008 the actual reduction in monies available to the Arts Council for grants in 2009 will be mitigated by a reduction in the administration costs of the body.   Funding to Culture Ireland is broadly maintained and current funding for the National Cultural Institutions is higher than the 2007 levels.  Cuts in the day-to-day allocations are marginal and a full programme of events and exhibitions is scheduled for 2009.</P>
        <P>In the sports sector, a total allocation of &euro;204 million &ndash; which is a significant investment &ndash; will enable the Department to meet its commitments in 2009.  The allocation of &euro;56 million to the Sports Capital Programme in 2009 brings to &euro;780 million Government expenditure on sports facilities at local, regional and national level over the last 10 years.  With specific regard to the Irish Sports Council (ISC), the 2009 funding is more than &euro;53 million, compared to a 2008 allocation of &euro;57.6 million.  The 2009 allocation is, nevertheless, still significant and represents an increase of more than 300 per cent on the funding available in 2000.  It will be sufficient to enable the ISC to maintain its existing programmes while building on recent progress.</P>
        <P>In the tourism sector, the total allocation of just under &euro;161 million in 2009 constitutes an increase of more than 50 per cent over the past five years.  From this total allocation, there will be marginal reductions in the budgets of the principal tourism agencies &mdash; F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland &mdash; which should be largely absorbed by savings in pay, overheads, consultancy and non-programme advertising.  There will be no reduction in the amount available for frontline international marketing activities, since there are some once-off expenditures this year on new advertising/ promotional materials for the Tourism Ireland brand.</P>
        <P>Having regard to the foregoing, I am satisfied that the financial allocations available to me in 2009 will allow progress to be maintained in the development of the arts, culture, sport and tourism sectors, in accordance with the overall commitments in the Programme for Government.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 100 together.</P>
        <P>The London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics Task Force was established in August 2006 to ensure Ireland can identify and maximise the complete range of opportunities arising from our proximity to the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London 2012.  The Task Force included experts from the sport, tourism, cultural and business sectors and was supported by staff within my Department.</P>
        <P>The Task Force report makes a number of recommendations arising from an audit carried out of high quality sports facilities in Ireland and the findings of a report by Indecon International Economic Consultants on the economic evaluation of the benefit to the island of Ireland of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games.</P>
        <P>The report highlights the opportunities for Ireland from the London 2012 Games in the sport, tourism, cultural and business sectors.  On the sporting side the report puts forward proposals for investment in sports facilities which would increase our attractiveness as a training destination for Olympic teams in the lead up and during the games.  I understand that enquiries have already been made about the availability of sports facilities here for some Olympic teams.</P>
        <P>I am considering the implementation of the recommendations of the London 2012 Task Force Report taking account of the current economic situation.</P>
        <P>I have met with a number of the key stakeholders involved in the support of our elite athletes to discuss how we can best build on the success we have had in Beijing and to identify the supports required in terms of coaching, programmes, facilities and funding to ensure the opti<Col N="134"/>mum performance of Irish athletes at the London 2012 Olympic Games.  I also intend to work closely with the Irish Sports Council to ensure that our athletes are prepared to the highest standard for the London Games.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97, 105 and 109 together. </P>
        <P>The Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund was established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001 for the purpose of giving support to both racing industries.  Under the provisions of the Act, the Fund receives a guaranteed level of finance based on excise duty on off-course betting in the preceding year, subject to a minimum level based on the year 2000 amount adjusted for inflation, subject to the limit on the total aggregate amount of the Fund.  Any shortfall in the amount generated by the excise duty is made up by direct Exchequer subvention.  &euro;69.719 million has been allocated to the Fund for 2009.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, 80% and 20% of the moneys paid into the Fund each year are distributed between Horse Racing Ireland (HRI) and Bord na gCon respectively.  Since 2001, income from the Fund has been used by both bodies towards increasing prize money levels, meeting administration and integrity costs alongside a programme of capital investment, which has underpinned a growth in both sectors.</P>
        <P>Since the establishment of the Fund a major period of development of both industries has resulted.  The funding has allowed Ireland to develop into a world centre of excellence for horseracing and greyhound racing.</P>
        <P>To date the Fund has not only helped towards providing some top class racing venues and facilities, but it has also underpinned significant employment in the industries.  Horse breeding is a significant net contributor to the Irish economy and has an important role to play in generating employment, particularly in the tourism and agri-economy sectors, making it a significant regional employer and an important contributor to rural communities.  The Irish greyhound industry is also regarded as one of the most vibrant and successful in the world.</P>
        <P>In 2004, the Government put in place regulations to increase the limit of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund from &euro;254m to &euro;550m to continue the Fund for a further four years to 2008.</P>
        <P>A review of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund is currently underway.  Any increase of the Fund limit will require the approval of the Government and the Oireachtas (the level of the Fund is increased by Regulations made by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance).</P>
        <P>Projections of revenue receipts through excise duties are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>

	<P>Since 1998, under the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by my Department, almost &euro;7 million has been allocated to individual boxing clubs to provide facilities and equipment to the Irish Amateur Boxing Association.  Included in this figure is &euro;2,800,660 towards the development of the National Stadium and &euro;109,100 towards high performance equipment.</P>
        <P>The Irish Sports Council (ISC), which is funded by my Department, has a statutory role in encouraging the promotion, development and co-ordination of competitive and recreational sport.</P>
        <P>The Irish Sports Council Act, 1999 specifically states that one of the functions of the ISC shall be &ldquo;to encourage the promotion, development and co-ordination of competitive sport and the achievement of excellence in competitive sport&rdquo; and that the Council has responsibility for developing &ldquo;strategies for increasing participation in recreational sport and to coordinate their implementation by all bodies (including public authorities and publicly funded bodies) involved in promoting recreational sport and providing recreational facilities&rdquo;.  According to the ISC&rsquo;s <Col N="138"/>strategy &ldquo;Building Sport for Life&rdquo; the ISC&rsquo;s mission is &ldquo;To plan, lead and coordinate the sustainable development of competitive and recreational sport in Ireland&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>Under the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by the Department, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  The aim of the Programme is to maximise participation in sport through the provision of modern high quality, safe, well-designed and sustainable facilities and sports equipment.  The provision of such facilities allows for increased numbers to participate in sport.  </P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that allocations under the 2008 Sports Capital Programme were announced in July last.  No decision has yet been made about the timing of further rounds of the Programme.  In the 2009 Estimates, &euro;56m has been provided in my Department&rsquo;s vote to cover payments to be made from the C-1 sub-head, which is provided for grants for the provision of sports and recreation facilities.</P>
        <P>Since 1998 grants to the value of over &euro;725 million have been awarded to over 7,400 projects under the Sports Capital Programme.  This investment has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland and has allowed the development of sports facilities across the length and breadth of the country.  These facilities have dramatically increased the opportunities for all people to engage in a wide variety of sports.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The funding of the Arts Council, as with all Government Departments and State agencies, is a matter for consideration under the annual budget and Estimates&rsquo; process.  In doing so, the Government must balance competing demands from every part of our economy and society.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the Arts Council&rsquo;s desire to have multi-annual budgets.  I can appreciate the need for stability in budgeting that such a measure would provide, but my Department, like other Government Departments, is provided with and must work within annual current expenditure budgets through the Estimates&rsquo; process.</P>
        <P>By any standards however, the Arts Council has seen dramatic increases in its funding allocation in recent years, increasing by over 71% from &euro;47.67 million in 2002 to &euro;81.6 million this year.  These are significant amounts of taxpayers&rsquo; money in any context and have effectively transformed the arts, by facilitating increased access to and participation in the full spectrum of art forms throughout the country.  The Government&rsquo;s sustained commitment to the arts is evidenced by these substantial increases in funding, including supplementary funding of &euro;3m to the Arts Council at the end of 2007.</P>

	<P>In 2006 the Government decided to proceed with the redevelopment of the Abbey Theatre by way of a public private partnership on a site at George&rsquo;s Dock, on a build, finance and maintain basis.  This site was <Col N="141"/>chosen following an extensive search exercise conducted by the Office of Public Works that involved the examination of a number of options.  This PPP project is now being progressed on the basis solely of the Georges Dock site. </P>

	<P>Extending the opening hours of national cultural institutions is an essential innovation in developing access and attracting wider audiences.  More flexible opening hours reflect the changed lifestyles for those who wish to visit our National Cultural Institutions, and especially the national museums and galleries. </P>
        <P>The extended and more flexible opening hours at our national cultural institutions during 2008 was highly successful and welcomed by visitors to these venues.</P>
        <P>In 2008, funding was specifically provided for the introduction of extended opening hours.  The tighter budgetary outlook in 2009 and the consequent allocations to the cultural institutions, in particular with regard to pay, is likely to have some impact on the general ability to deliver extended opening hours.  My Department will, however, seek to consolidate the opening hours improvements of 2008.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that their primary goal is to ensure that all taxpayers meet their tax and customs obligations in a timely manner.  A delay in collection of the revenues due impacts on the level and timeliness of financial resources available to the Government and facilitates those who, by withholding tax payments and using those monies to improve cash flow, gain unfair competitive advantage. </P><Col N="142"/>
        <P>I am advised by Revenue that their approach to maintaining and extending high levels of timely compliance involves a twin track approach.  Firstly there is a strong focus by Revenue on promoting and supporting voluntary compliance by facilitating taxpayers and businesses in meeting their obligations in as easy a way as possible through quality service provided by Revenue.  Secondly there is a strong focus on addressing late or non-compliance through the deployment of appropriate collection recovery and enforcement measures.</P>
        <P>I am advised by Revenue that the records it maintains do not enable it to provide figures on the number of occasions in respect of which it has acted in tax arrears cases with businesses in each of the past five years.  However, the following table contains details of the number of enforcement actions involving referral to sheriffs or solicitors or putting in place of Attachment Orders by Revenue for each of the last five years.  Other than providing details of the amount of monies collected as a result of these actions, Revenue is not in a position to comment on the individual case outcomes, even at an aggregate level.  However, I am satisfied that the focused, risk based debt and compliance management programmes being implemented by Revenue has been a key element in delivering the very significant improvements in compliances rates that have been achieved in recent years.</P>

        <P>In the case of loans qualifying for mortgage interest relief (under the provisions of section 244 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997), the benefit-in-kind charge is based on the difference between the amount of interest that would be payable if the mortgage had been subject to an interest rate of 5.5% and the amount of interest paid on the preferential mortgage.</P>
        <P>In the case of all other loans, the benefit-in-kind charge is based on the difference between amount of interest that would be payable if the mortgage had been subject to an interest rate of 13% (increased to 15% in the Budget) and the amount of interest paid on the preferential loan.</P>
        <P>The rates are calculated based on figures supplied from the Central Bank of Ireland.  These calculations take into account both the prevailing commercial loan rates and likely market trends.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in the normal course of events, if an employee presents documentary evidence to their local Tax District indicating that tax has been deducted from his/her pay e.g. a payslip, P45, P60, etc., the employee&rsquo;s tax position will be reviewed in the normal way.

	<P>There are currently two national service-planning databases for people with disabilities, the National Intellectual Disability Database (NIDD), established in 1995, and the National Physical and Sensory Disability Database, established in 2002. These databases inform decision making in relation to the planning of specialised health and personal social services for people with intellectual, physical or sensory disabilities. Information for the databases is collected by the HSE and non-statutory service providers. The databases are managed nationally by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department of Health and Children.</P>
        <P>The NIDD provides a needs assessment of people with an intellectual disability. The categories of need are as follows: unmet need; service change required; persons with an intellectual disability who are accommodated in psychiatric hospitals and multidisciplinary support services required.</P>
        <P>Information for the NPSDD is collected by means of interviews with individuals who meet the registration criteria. The primary focus of the NPSDD is to facilitate service planning and provision; it also aims to record the details of people availing of, or requiring, a specialised health and personal service. As not every individual in Ireland who has a physical or sensory disability is availing of or requiring a specialised health or personal social service, the NPSDD cannot provide any epidemiological statement on the number of people with a particular type <Col N="151"/>of disability. Participation in the NPSDD is voluntary; the database may not therefore cover a proportion of people living in Ireland who have a physical or sensory disability.</P>
        <P>In addition, in keeping with its statutory requirements under section 13(1) of the Disability Act 2005, the HSE is engaged in a process of collating and maintaining records collected under the Assessment of Need process for children aged under 5.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>A primary objective of Government policy in health insurance is that it should be affordable for the broadest possible cross section of the community including older people and those who suffer ill-health. This policy objective has been implemented through a substantial body of primary and secondary legislation providing for open enrolment, community rating and lifetime cover.  Following the liberalisation of the market in 1994 every political party and successive governments have supported the maintenance of community rating.  It is an inescapable fact, supported by international evidence, that community rating cannot be sustained without some scheme to support the higher claims costs of older or sicker people</P>
        <P>Although the Supreme Court found the particular Risk Equalisation Scheme to be ultra vires, it did not strike down the principle of applying risk equalisation or any of the other important elements of the regulatory framework that supports private health insurance in Ireland.  After the Supreme Court decision which struck down the Risk Equalisation Scheme on July 16th last, there was a real risk that older people would effectively face significantly higher premium costs than younger people.</P><Col N="152"/>
        <P>Accordingly, on the joint proposal of the Ministers for Finance and Health and Children, the Government has decided to put forward two major steps as interim, three-year measure to stabilise the health insurance market.</P>
        <P>There will be additional tax relief for health insurance starting for people aged 50 and over and increasing for higher age groups as follows:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />50-59: &euro;200;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />60-69: &euro;500;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />70-79: &euro;950;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />80+: &euro;1,175.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Given this, existing legislation will be amended to allow for community rating to be applied on net premia, with regard to this scheme.</P>
        <P>Legislation will also be introduced to provide for the introduction of a Community Rating levy on health insurance companies in respect of all individuals covered by the health insurance policies issued by them, priced as follows:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />&euro;160 for each adult;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />&euro;53 for each child (under 18).</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The levy will apply to all policies from 1 January 2009 and subsequent years. The obligation to pay the charge will be imposed on the health insurance companies. It will be a matter for the companies (based on their individual commercial considerations) as to whether, and to what extent, they pass the cost of the charge on to their customers.</P>
        <P>The implementation of these measures is subject to approval by the European Commission. A formal submission has been made to the Commission.</P>
        <P>Older people will benefit by the price of their policies not rising massively based on their age. But it is not just older people who will benefit. Those under 50 who look forward to continuing their health insurance as they get older need to know it will continue to be affordable, and will not rise in price just because they get older.</P>
        <P>By supporting the principle of intergenerational solidarity, younger subscribers will benefit from affordable health insurance as they in turn become older.  Our society benefits from having clear, explicit measures to support solidarity between the generations in health insurance.</P>
        <P>The Government hopes and expects that the health insurance industry will respond to this initiative by continuing to market community rated products which meet the health needs of all segments of the population.</P>

	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the sale of products associated with the consumption of illegal drugs and whether current legislation is deficient in this regard.  I am aware that a range of substances often referred to by the generic term &lsquo;legal highs&rsquo;, which mimic or cause effects similar to illicit substances, are available in so-called &lsquo;head shops&rsquo; and are currently not scheduled under Misuse of Drugs legislation.</P>
        <P>The Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and regulations made thereunder regulate and control the import, export, production, supply and possession of a range of named narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances listed in the Schedules to the Act.  Substances are scheduled under the <Col N="154"/>Act in accordance with Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under international conventions and/or where there is evidence that the substances are causing significant harm to public health in Ireland, which could merit the criminalisation of their sale and use.</P>
        <P>The list of scheduled substances is kept under review on an ongoing basis.  In particular my Department reviews any evidence that substances are being abused and are causing significant harm to public health. For example, in 2006 psychotropic &mdash; magic &mdash; mushrooms were brought under control and their possession and sale is now an offence. Furthermore, following the European Council of Ministers&rsquo; decision in March 2008 to bring Benzylpiperazine (BZP) under control, which was deemed to pose an excessive risk as a party pill, my Department will be introducing regulations to make the possession and sale of BZP illegal.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>In Budget 2009, an additional &euro;10 million was allocated to the HSE for services in the area of disability and mental health.  The funding for 2009 will provide for 125 additional therapy posts in the disability and mental health services area, targeted at children of school going age.  In addition, once-off funding of &euro;1.75m is being provided for suicide prevention initiatives and for mental health projects supporting service users and carers.</P>
        <P>Almost &euro;1 billion is provided each year to non-statutory providers of disability services.  In line with the efficiency measures being taken elsewhere in the health system, an efficiency reduction of 1% will be applied by the HSE to the allocations of non-statutory disability agencies for 2009.  It is envisaged that efficiencies will be achieved in non-frontline areas such as advertising, PR, travel and subsistence and management/administrative payroll costs.</P>
        <P>Mental health services currently spend an estimated &euro;1 billion.  It is also important to bear in mind that some 90% of mental health problems are dealt with in primary care.</P>
        <P>The estimated additional cost of the implementation of &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo; the Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy is &euro;150m over 7-10 years.  A total of &euro;51.2 million has been allocated since 2006 which represents over a third of the overall requirement.  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive is obliged to operate within its overall vote.  In this regard, it took steps to ensure that it met this objective in 2007 by delaying some of its planned developments, including developments in mental health.  I am advised that of the &euro;51 million provided in 2006 and 2007 for the implementation of &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo;, about &euro;30 million has now been invested.</P>
        <P>In 2008 the HSE prioritised the development of child and adolescent mental health services.  The recruitment of 8 additional child and adolescent mental health teams and the commissioning of 14 additional beds for children and adolescents are underway.  Construction of two 20 bed units for children and adolescents and Cork and Galway is scheduled to commence in 2009.</P><Col N="155"/>
        <P>As the matters raised by the Deputy, including the provision of personal assistants and resources and outreach services are a matter for the HSE under the Health Act 2004, I have requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have these matters investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

        <P>For operational and security reasons it is not Garda policy to disclose the number of Garda&iacute; detailed for specific duties over any specific period of time. Notwithstanding this, I have been informed by the Commissioner that four members of  the local Community Policing Unit are allocated specifically to the area and these members attend meetings with various Residents&rsquo; Groups attended also by Local Authority and public representatives.

	<P>The Government Legislation Programme published on 23 September 2008 provides for publication of the Property Services (Regulation) Bill during the current Dail session.</P>
        <P>This Bill will establish the Property Services Regulatory Authority on a statutory basis.  Its primary task will be to operate a licensing system for auctioneers, estate agents and property management agents and to improve standards in the provision of property services by licensees. The Authority will specify and enforce qualification requirements for licences, including levels of education, training and experience and other requirements such as minimum levels of professional indemnity insurance. The Authority will also establish and operate a system for investigating and adjudicating on complaints against property service providers. In this context, the legislation will refer to the possibility of resolving disputes by mediation between the parties concerned.</P>
        <P>With a view to improving client protection and ensuring clarity with regard to the services being provided by a licensee, the legislation will also require that property services agreements be entered into between service providers and their clients. Such agreements will specify the services to be provided, fees payable by the client, details of redress procedures etc.</P>

Every effort is being made to ensure that Belarusian children can continue to visit Ireland for the purposes of rest and recuperation.

        <P>Late on 14 November, a Belarusian response to a draft Agreement between Ireland and Belarus on the matter which my Department had sent to Minsk was received through our Embassy in Moscow. The text of the revised Agreement is being examined closely by officials in my Department and in the Office of the Minister for Children, and it is intended to forward our response to Minsk shortly with a view to the very early conclusions of negotiations.</P>
        <P>My Department has also received positive indications at official level that visits by children from Belarus can continue while the negotiating process is ongoing.  I hope that this can be confirmed with the Belarusian Government in the coming days. Close contact is being maintained with the charities dealing with Chernobyl children as the situation evolves.</P>

        <P>In addition to members of the Oireachtas, participation in the work of the Committee is open to Northern Ireland members elected to the Westminster Parliament. I welcome the fact that a number of MPs have participated in the Committee, and made a significant contribution to its deliberations. I very much hope that in the near future members from all parties will feel in a position to do so. I know that their participation and insights would add greatly to the work of the Committee.</P>
        <P>In line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment in this area, I and my officials avail of every appropriate opportunity to encourage greater understanding and cooperation between the main traditions on the island. I have consistently made clear my view of the benefits of closer dialogue, including through participation in the work of the Good Friday Agreement Committee. I recognise, of course, that ultimately this is a matter for decision by individual members and their parties.</P>
        <P>In this regard I am encouraged by the example of the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly, where unionist representatives recently participated as members for the first time. I am also aware of the ongoing contacts on a range of issues between Committees of the Oireachtas and of the Northern Ireland Assembly.

	<P>The Special Committee on the Arts and Education report &lsquo;Points of Alignment&rsquo; published earlier this year marked the culmination of a comprehensive consultation process and serious consideration of all the issues by those charged with the production of this document.  The Committee&rsquo;s remit was to advise the Arts Council on how best to align the Council&rsquo;s strategies for the promotion and encouragement of the arts with the priorities of the formal education system. Indeed the authors of, and contributors to, this report are to be commended for their openness and insightful deliberations in putting forward their final recommendations.</P>
        <P>As I stated in my reply on 8th October last in response to Parliamentary Question No. 174, this report points out the advantages of structured communication and interaction between school and artistic communities at a local level and adds further vital information on this exciting and wide-ranging arts and education spectrum.</P>
        <P>When the relevant parties have finalised their budgets for 2009, my Department intends to resume consultations with the Department of Education and Science and the Arts Council to see what elements, if any, of the recommendations of the report can be implemented. These consultations will however, have to be undertaken in the light of the ongoing economic challenges and the serious budgetary constraints now facing all areas of public expenditure.</P>

	<P>Under the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by my Department, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Since 1998 the Government has allocated over &euro;725m in sports capital funding to over 7,400 sports projects across the country.  This investment has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland and has allowed the development of sports facilities across the length and breath of the country.  These facilities have dramatically increased the opportunities for all people to engage in a wide variety of sports.</P>
        <P>One of the stated aims and objectives of the sports capital programme is to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities.  Since 2002, those areas that have been designated by Government for special support through the schemes administered by Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, i.e. RAPID, Local Drugs Task Force (LDTF) and CL&Aacute;R areas are treated as disadvantaged under the programme.</P>
        <P>Projects identified as being located in areas designated as disadvantaged are targeted and prioritised in a number of ways during the assessment of applications. They are permitted to have a lower level of minimum own funding available towards their project and extra marks are also awarded to such projects during the assessment process by the application of socio-economic disadvantage criterion.  Under the 2008 Sports Capital Programme, the level of own funding required by applicants from RAPID and Local Drugs Task Force areas was reduced <Col N="162"/>to 10% from 20%.  This is in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government.  At this stage there are no plans to further reduce the level of own funding required.</P>
        <P>Through the prioritisation of applications from disadvantaged areas, the Sports Capital Programme has invested over &euro;146 million in designated disadvantaged areas.  In turn, the arrangement where Sports Capital allocations in RAPID and CL&Aacute;R receive top-ups from the department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has allowed further allocations of more than &euro;22 million to be made.</P>
        <P>I believe that these measures taken together give priority to applications from RAPID, CL&Aacute;R and LDTF areas and that the large scale investment in sports facilities in these areas is evidence of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to meeting the needs of designated disadvantaged areas.</P>
        <P>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, under the 2008 programme grants totalling over &euro;16.4 million were allocated to 264 projects in designated disadvantaged areas.  My colleague the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has announced top-ups for qualifying grantees in RAPID areas of over &euro;2m.</P>

	<P>Primary responsibility for the support and promotion of film-making in Ireland in respect of both the indigenous sector and inward productions is a matter for the Irish Film Board (IFB).  This agency is funded through my Department and is independent of the Department in its operations.  For 2009 a budget of &euro;20.416m has been provided for the IFB in the Estimates for my Department.</P><Col N="163"/>
        <P>The task of attracting international production into Ireland is dependent on a number of elements, not all of which fall within the sphere of influence of my Department or that of the Irish Film Board.  Decisions to site a film project in a particular territory involve complex funding, cultural, logistical and project-specific elements, all of which are crucial for a successful result.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s primary operational role in supporting the film sector relates to the administration of elements of the Section 481 tax relief scheme.  This scheme is kept under regular review in conjunction with the Irish Film Board and any enhancements necessary to retain or regain competitiveness are addressed and brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance as appropriate.  The scheme was amended and enhanced in the Finance Acts of 2000, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and most recently this year when the Minister for Finance, in his Budget 2008 speech, announced that he was extending the scheme for a further four years until the end of 2012, following a review of the scheme by Indecon International Economic Consultants.  This extension of the scheme was welcome and also the proposal in the Finance Bill to increase the overall ceiling on qualifying expenditure from &euro;35m to &euro;50m.</P>
        <P>An area that I considered needed examination was in relation to measuring and capturing the full scale, value and potential for growth of the audio-visual production sector in Ireland.  In that regard I am pleased that the Irish Film Board has commissioned a major independent survey of the audio-visual production sector in Ireland.  The survey should provide a complete and accurate description of the character, scale and value of the entire industry as it currently exists and provide an objective starting point from which to chart a plan for the future and act as a benchmark from which to accurately measure progress.  The survey was recently completed and I look forward to receiving a copy of it from the Irish Film Board in due course.</P>
        <P>Another important element of a successful film industry is the availability of adequate, fully equipped studio resources that can cater for the needs of indigenous and incoming film/TV productions and this is a key factor in the Irish Film Board&rsquo;s role of marketing Ireland as a film location.  The studios at Ardmore play an integral part in fulfilling this role and following recent discussions that have taken place with representatives of all interested parties, I can confirm that the current arrangements between the Irish Film Board and Ardmore Studios are to continue.</P>
        <P>I believe that the industry in Ireland has never been stronger in terms of international recognition and commercial success.  This is evidenced by the Oscar success this year for the film &ldquo;Once&rdquo; and both the critical and financial successes of numerous films in recent times.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 174 to 176, inclusive, together. Government Policy on the Arts is set out in the Programme for Government and is elaborated further in my Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy.  My policy on the arts is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, increase access to and participation in the arts, and make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country, including Kildare, is primarily devolved to the Arts Council.  The Arts Council is the principal agency through which State funding is channelled to the arts.  Under the Arts Act, 2003, the general functions of the Council include the following: -to stimulate public interest in the arts; to promote knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts; to assist in improving standards in the arts.</P>
        <P>The Arts Council supports many arts organisations in Co. Kildare.  However, the Council is statutorily independent, under the Arts Act 2003, in their funding decisions and I have no role to play in their grant allocations.</P>
        <P>My Department has taken a direct role in relation to the provision of capital grant-aid for arts and culture infrastructure and has allocated over &euro;150m in funding for the capital development of facilities around the country in recent years.  Funding for new arts facilities is primarily provided through the Arts Capital Programme (previously known as ACCESS &mdash; Arts and Culture Capital Enhancement Support Scheme).  The Arts Capital Programme is a key element in the Government&rsquo;s regional arts strategy and has greatly improved participation in the arts for large numbers of people, of all ages, nationwide.  The scheme has been widely acknowledged as a significant intervention in the provision of quality cultural spaces.  Funding has been provided towards integrated community art centres, theatres and galleries as well as art studios and other art production, creative and performance spaces.</P>
        <P>Two applications were received from Kildare under the current scheme (ACCESS II).  These were assessed by an independent selection committee who made recommendations to the Minister.  One of the two applicants in Kildare was successful under ACCESS II.</P>
        <P>All of the available funds under the current Arts Capital Programme have been fully allocated.  In the present economic climate there are no immediate plans to launch a new Arts Capital Programme.  Applications for any new scheme would be invited by public advertisement and details would also be available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 177 to 179, inclusive, together.</P><Col N="165"/>
        <P>We have in recent years enjoyed consistent growth in numbers of overseas visitors and associated revenue earnings.  Last year alone we welcomed over 8 million visitors with associated revenue of &euro;4.9 billion, including Irish carrier receipts.  While the international tourism market is becoming increasingly competitive, Ireland has consistently outperformed our competitors in terms of growing the number of overseas visitors to our shores.</P>
        <P>It is fully recognised that current global economic factors are likely to impact on the number of outward travellers from some of our most important overseas markets.  Figures for the first half of this year were up on the corresponding period of 2007 but there has been a fall-off in numbers since then.  I understand that this falloff mirrors trends across Europe, where the year started positively but saw a downturn in monthly figures from May onwards.</P>
        <P>I believe that the strategic approach taken to tourism development in recent years, by both the public and private sectors, has given the industry the capacity to withstand the cyclical external challenges and to sustain its performance in coming years.</P>
        <P>While I know that our businesses are responding positively to current challenges, it is just as important that the strategic framework for tourism development responds to the changing environment.  I have therefore decided to take steps to renew our strategic framework for tourism development as set out in &ldquo;New Horizons for Irish Tourism: an Agenda for Action 2003 &ndash; 2012&rdquo;.  I will be putting in place the arrangements for this shortly and I will seek for it to be completed in the first half of next year.  In the meantime, an extensive range of marketing, product development, training and business supports are being rolled out by the Tourism State Agencies under the Tourism Services budget of the Department. I am confident that the tourism sector here has the capacity to manage the current cyclical slowdown.  Renewing our strategy will help the sector to manage the current challenges and to return to sustainable growth in the medium term.</P>
        <P>In terms of our ability to compete in the international arena in the future, maintaining and enhancing competitiveness is a major issue for Irish tourism as it is for the economy as a whole.  In addressing that issue, it is important to bear in mind that competitiveness is about more than price and costs.  It is generally agreed that Ireland cannot and, indeed, should not attempt to compete on the basis of costs with mass tourism destinations.</P>
        <P>The tourism agencies continue to monitor Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness as a tourism destination and I am encouraging them to assist the industry in responding to changing conditions through a variety of programmes in marketing, human resource development, quality enhancement, product development and productivity.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 to 183, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Irish Sports Council (ISC), which is funded by my Department, has a statutory role in encouraging the promotion, development and co-ordination of competitive and recreational sport.  The Irish Sports Council Act, 1999 specifically states that one of the functions of the ISC shall be &ldquo;to encourage the promotion, development and coordination of competitive sport and the achievement of excellence in competitive sport&rdquo; and that the Council has responsibility for developing &ldquo;strategies for increasing participation in recreational sport and to coordinate their implementation by all bodies (including public authorities and publicly funded bodies) involved in promoting recreational sport and providing recreational facilities&rdquo;. According to the ISC&rsquo;s strategy &ldquo;Building Sport for Life&rdquo; the ISC&rsquo;s mission is &ldquo;To plan, lead and coordinate the sustainable development of competitive and recreational sport in Ireland&rdquo;. The ISC prepares an annual report which is available from the Council.</P>
        <P>In that context, the ISC receives an annual Grant in Aid from my Department. The ISC determines the allocation of funding to the development, support and promotion of active sporting activities and funding to competitive and high performance sport.</P>
        <P>In tandem with the programmes which are funded by the Irish Sports Council aimed at improving standards of performance and increasing participation in sport, the Department, through the Sports Capital Programme, allocates funding for the provision of sports facilities throughout the country.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 184 and 185 together.</P>
        <P>Government Policy on the Arts is set out in the Programme for Government and is elaborated further in my Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy.  My policy on the arts is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, increase access to and participation in the arts, and make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life.  Responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is primarily devolved to the Arts Council.  The Arts Council is the principal agency through which State funding is channelled to the arts.  Under the Arts Act, 2003, the general functions of the Council include the following:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to stimulate public interest in the arts;</P><Col N="167"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to promote knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to assist in improving standards in the arts.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Arts Council is a statutorily independent body, funded by my Department and independent in its day-to-day operations, including in relation to its funding decisions.  Funding for the Arts Council has increased by over 71% from &euro;47.67 million in 2002 to &euro;81.6 million this year. A table showing expenditure by the Arts Council for the past five years is set out below.  These are significant amounts of money in any context and have transformed and increased access to the arts and allowed the Arts Council to support artists and arts organisations nationwide.</P>
        <P>My Department has taken a direct role in relation to the provision of grant-aid for arts and culture infrastructure and has allocated over &euro;150m in funding for the capital development of facilities around the country in recent years. A total of &euro;113m of this is expected to be drawn down by the end of 2008. The table set out below outlines expenditure on capital arts projects since 2004.</P>
        <P>The Arts Capital Programme (previously known as ACCESS &ndash; Arts and Culture Capital Enhancement Support Scheme) is designed to assist in the provision of high standard arts and culture infrastructural projects, thereby enhancing access to all aspects of the arts throughout the country.  The programme has been widely acknowledged as a significant intervention in the provision of high quality arts and culture infrastructure around the country.</P>
        <P>Facilities funded to date include integrated arts centres, theatres, galleries, studios, and creative and performance spaces.  In this manner the Department provides the bulk of capital funding for building and refurbishing arts facilities around the country, mainly in the not for profit sector, while the Arts Council provides the ongoing revenue support for many of the facilities.</P>
        <P>The promotion of Irish arts internationally is the responsibility of Culture Ireland, which operates under the aegis of my Department.  Culture Ireland supports a wide range of projects and events across all art forms in order to increase the worldwide profile and presence of Irish artists and ensembles, and to develop new international audiences for Irish arts and culture.   The agency also showcases outstanding Irish artists at key international events and festivals.    Promoting Irish arts abroad represents in addition an investment in the growth of cultural tourism and Ireland&rsquo;s international profile and reputation.  Culture Ireland&rsquo;s current funding for 2008 is &euro;4.75 million. </P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the need to provide extra grant aid to fund community based and financially assisted local initiatives involving the provision of youth services such as community centres, drop in centres and indoor facilities with the objective of providing positive alternative outlets for teenagers here having particular regard to the growing number of negative influences and their impact on young people; if he will take a strategic decision to implement such a policy to a greater extent than has been the case heretofore; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government  and I continue to be acutely conscious of the specific needs of young people in the development of positive, healthy and pro-social attitudes and behaviours, as evidenced, inter alia, by the Department&rsquo;s provision of unprecedented sums in grants for a range of arts and sports facilities over the last number of years. </P>
        <P>In the arts sector, the Arts Capital Programme has facilitated the allocation of more than &euro;150 million in funding in recent years for the capital development of arts and culture infrastructure, much of which is community based and provides access to young people to participate in the arts.</P>
        <P>In addition, in 2008, funding of more than &euro;81 million was provided to the Arts Council, the principal agency through which State funding is channelled to the arts, to support artists and arts organisations nationwide.  In this regard, over the period 2006-2008, the Arts Council has taken and continues to take initiatives to improve and extend opportunities in the arts for young people and children.</P>
        <P>In the sports sector, in 2008, the Sports Capital Programme allocated more than &euro;50 million to 685 sports and recreation projects nationwide, including young people&rsquo;s sporting organisations and/or those with a focus on the provision of sporting facilities for young people.  More than &euro;16 million of the 2008 funding was allocated to projects located in designated disadvantaged areas.  Since 1998, the Sport Capital Programme has allocated more than &euro;725 million to more than 7,400 separate projects.</P>
        <P>Moreover, through the Irish Sports Council, considerable funding has been made available to the Local Sports Partnerships to promote participation in sport and physical activity, including by young people.  In 2008, this funding amounts to more than &euro;5.4 million, an increase on the approximately &euro;4.1 million provided in 2007.  In addition, in 2007, the Irish Sports Council <Col N="169"/>administered more than &euro;1.9 million from the Dormant Accounts Fund for sports for disadvantaged youths.</P>
        <P>Having regard to all the foregoing, I remain satisfied that at both the policy and funding levels the specific developmental needs of our young people are being well catered for in the arts and sports sectors.</P>

        <P>In this regard, it is a matter for the SERDTF to decide what projects are funded and the level of funding granted to projects from their overall budget.  In this context, I am not in a position to provide any funding to the project outside of these processes.</P>

	<P>The Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate, appointed under Section 250 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 is responsible,<i> inter alia</i>, for ensuring that employers and self employed people comply with the Act in relation to Pay Related Social Insurance contributions.  Employer compliance, in this regard, is monitored through inspections which include; detailed examinations of employers&rsquo; records to ensure that correct PRSI payments are being made in respect of all employees. </P>
        <P>Where an employee notifies the Department that his/her employer has not been remitting PRSI on their behalf or where an irregularity in a customer&rsquo;s PRSI record is detected at claim processing stage, the case is referred to a Social Welfare Inspector for investigation.</P>
        <P>Where PRSI undercharges are confirmed, the Inspector sets out PRSI arrears/underpayment in respect of each employee for each tax year and issues a demand to the employer for payment.  Should the employer fail to respond satisfactorily, a statutory demand will issue by registered post and the employer given 14 days to respond.  If the employer fails to respond the case is considered for prosecution.</P>
        <P>Following confirmation of the employment, either by way of wage inspection or employee statement, the Department&rsquo;s Client Eligibility Services Section is advised to update the employee&rsquo;s PRSI record for the period of employment in question.  Where a benefit claim is pending the relevant scheme area is similarly advised.  This is to ensure that there is no loss of benefit to an employee caused by their employer&rsquo;s failure to make timely and proper returns on their behalf.</P>

	<P>The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of premises is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under section 10 of the Fire Services Act 1981.  My Department&rsquo;s role is one of supporting and assisting fire authorities in delivering fire services through the provision of funding under the fire service capital programme and through setting of general policy. </P>
        <P>The Department recently initiated a review of the priorities of fire authorities in relation to the funding of the replacement or upgrading of fire stations.  In that context, Waterford County Council has submitted a priority list of the following stations which are in need of replacement:&mdash;  Kilmacthomas, Lismore, Portlaw and Tallow.  The provision of exchequer funding to support further investment in the County Waterford fire service will be considered under future capital programmes. Such funding will have regard to the Council&rsquo;s priorities, existing facilities and the competing demands from other fire authorities for available funding.</P>

        <Quest> if, in respect of Parliamentary Question No. 507 of 11 March 2008, he will provide a copy of the defence presented by his Department to the European Commission in respect of current rural practice policies and practices; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Following discussions with the European Commission, my Department issued Circular Letter SP 5/08 to all County Managers on 30 September 2008, regarding local need policies in cases where there is an application to build a dwelling from which a full-time business will operate.  Local authorities were asked to examine their development plans in light of the updated guidance provided in the circular to ensure their compatibility with Articles 43 and 56 of the EC Treaty which guarantee respectively the freedom of establishment (of business) and the free movement of capital.  A copy of the Circular Letter is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.environ.ie. </P>
        <P>When we have confirmed with all local authorities that their plans are compliant with the terms of the circular or, if necessary, that their plans are being varied to make them compliant, my Department will write again to the Commission to confirm that the issues have been <Col N="175"/>resolved.  In the meantime, as stated in the reply to Question No. 212 of 10 April 2008, I am precluded, on the basis of legal advice, from publishing or disseminating either the correspondence from the European Commission in relation to enquiries or investigations into possible infringements or the State&rsquo;s responses as these documents are regarded as part of possible legal proceedings.</P>
        <P>However, once matters have been concluded to the satisfaction of the Commission and there is no longer any likelihood that possible proceedings could be undermined by the release of such documents, my Department will be pleased to make its papers available.</P>

        <Quest> if, in relation to the joint policing committees in local authority areas, there will be duplication of the roles of these committees between the county committees and the committees covered by areas that were formerly town councils that operate within the local authority area; and if he will make a statement on the most practical way of ensuring that there is an effective policing committee in each area without unnecessary duplication. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Following a pilot programme, Joint Policing Committees (JPCs) are currently being established in all local authorities.  Revised guidelines in relation to the operation of the JPCs were recently issued by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005, following consultation with myself and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The pilot phase was very useful in identifying issues that needed to be addressed, including the importance of good linkages between town and county JPCs.  Accordingly, the revised guidelines specifically highlight the need for good co-operation between town and county JPCs within a county to ensure complementarity, to avoid any negative impact on Garda and local authority resources and to facilitate the overall effective operation of the committees.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will continue to keep the operation of JPCs under review and make any necessary changes to the guidelines in the light of experience gained.</P>

	<P>I assume the question refers to general purpose grants from the Local Government Fund. <Col N="176"/> General-Purpose Grants are the contribution that my Department makes to local authorities to meet the gap between the cost to them of providing a reasonable level of day-to-day services and the income they obtain from other sources.  The Local Government Fund is also providing significant funding to local authorities for the improvement and maintenance of local and regional roads, and additional amounts are allocated for particular purposes including the operation of Water Services, and the administration of Group Water Schemes and the Vehicle Registration Unit.  My Department also provides additional support for Local Authorities through specific grant programmes.</P>

        <Quest> the cost of production of biofuels; the way this has moved over the past three years; and the way it compares in price and in performance terms in motor vehicles with oil based fuels. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department does not have or maintain specific data on the cost of producing biofuels either domestically or globally.  Production costs for biofuels are individual to each producer and feedstock and vary widely.  Also, given that in many cases the biofuel feedstock is an agricultural commodity, the price paid can be dependent on factors at play in the commodities markets.</P>
        <P>The very sharp spike in the price of certain agricultural commodities, particularly in late 2007 has substantially subsided.  It is estimated however that volatility in agricultural commodities markets will continue to affect the price competitiveness of biofuels periodically.</P><Col N="179"/>
        <P>In terms of comparative performance, biofuels vary significantly in terms of the energy output per unit volume in comparison with their mineral equivalent.  Some have nearly identical energy outputs, while others, like bioethanol, have a lower energy content.</P>

        <Quest> the action he is taking to hasten the provision of broadband to Bredagh Glen, Moville, County Donegal; his views on whether people living in that area are being put at a competitive disadvantage in terms of establishing or conducting business and that the youth of Moville are at an educational disadvantage relative to youths living in areas serviced by broadband; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[41805/08]  </QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that in addition to fixed landline broadband, otherwise known as Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) or broadband over telephone lines, broadband services are available from competing service providers over multiple platforms including cable, satellite, fixed wireless and increasingly mobile.  I understand that Moville already has broadband on offer from a number of service providers.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 201 to 203, inclusive, together.</P><Col N="180"/>
        <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) is implementing a Micro generation Pilot Programme, which will conduct research and field trials, including support for between 50 and 60 installations on a pilot basis. The field trials will address a range of issues including grid connection and technical standards to ensure the power security, safety and quality of installations.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER)/ESB Networks have recently amended the rules associated with small scale generators.  It is now the case that generators of less than 6kW on single phase electricity and 11kW on three phase electricity supply cables can connect to the grid without prior authorisation.  SEI will shortly publish a guide to connecting renewable and CHP electricity generators to the electricity network including advice for micro-generators. The development of micro generation will be progressively facilitated by the roll out of the national smart meter programme.</P>
        <P>My Department is working closely with the Commission for Energy Regulation and other stakeholders to put in place in the short term an appropriately structured payment system for microgenerated electricity exported to the grid which will operate separately from the REFIT mechanism.</P>

	<P>A draft decision notifying Ireland not to proceed with its draft legislation for country of origin labelling of pigmeat, poultrymeat and sheepmeat was one of the items on the agenda of the meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health on 13 October 2008. </P><Col N="181"/>
        <P>The Commission summarised the grounds advanced by Ireland for the draft legislation but pointed out that it had adopted a negative opinion. Its view was that the proposed regulations were not justified under the provisions of the current labelling directive.</P>
        <P>The Irish delegation pointed out the basis for the draft legislation including the various misleading labelling practices and the legitimate expectation of consumers to know the origin of their food. It also indicated that the current provisions of the labelling directive were not sufficient to pursue effectively the variety of misleading cases and also referred to the fact that health marks and ill-defined &ldquo;substantial transformation&rdquo; could conceal the true origin of product.</P>
        <P>The Commission took note of the observations but indicated that it was maintaining its position.</P>
        <P>I will continue to argue for country of origin labelling of meat in the context of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal for a new regulation on food information. The Department of Health and Children is the lead Department for that proposal and my officials remain in contact with it on this issue.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 215 to 218, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>My Department currently has 42 posts for Visiting Teachers of the Hearing and Visually Impaired (VTHVIs) nationally, 29 of which are assigned to support the education of approximately 2000 hearing impaired children and 13 in the case of approximately 1000 visually impaired children. The posts are assigned to caseloads of between 60 and 100 children covering, in some cases, a limited geographic area and, in others, up to 5 counties. Each caseload contains a combination of children and young people with varying levels of sensory difficulties from pre-school through primary and second levels to third level education.  Each of my Department&rsquo;s ten Regional Offices is a base for an average of 4 VTHVIs. All 42 posts in this service are currently filled.</P>
        <P>The assignment of caseloads to individual VTHVIs and the location of VTHVIs is a factor of available resources and assessment of service needs at any given juncture. The assignment of a VTVI to continue a limited service to Co. Mayo from Dublin in 2007/2008 fell within these parameters. While it was necessary to review that service in September 2008, it was always intended that the needs of visually impaired children in Co. Mayo would be addressed locally and permanently in the longer term within the overall capacity of the VTHVI service. In order to ensure some continuity of support for families, schools and relevant referral agencies, a VTVI has been providing welcome advice and support on an interim basis since early September 2008 while options for a permanent solution to this matter have been explored.</P>
        <P>My Department will correspond directly with the Deputy in relation to details regarding costs and staffing of the VTHVI service.</P>
        <P>I wish to inform the Deputy that significant progress has been made in planning for a permanent VTVI service to Co. Mayo and, in that regard, my Department will shortly advertise the post in question.</P>

	<P>The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. Decisions were made in order to control expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long term. In this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be entirely spared, and I acknowledge the impact of funding restrictions in a number of areas, including at school level.  However, these are the inevitable result of the challenging economic environment and the need to manage Exchequer resources prudently.</P>
        <P>Specific information in relation to the detailed staffing allocations that individual schools will have for the commencement of the academic year 2009/10 cannot be determined until the allocation processes have fully concluded. There is nothing exceptional in this. The allocation processes include appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. This is particularly relevant at post-primary level where the appellate process considers in particular any specific curricular needs of the school concerned. At post-primary there is no effective system wide redeployment scheme at present and this can mean that schools retain teachers, though over quota, and in addition discrete allocations are made to post-primary schools for example to cater for pupils with Special Educational Needs and those with Language difficulties and these allocations can also alter the ultimate position of the school in relation to any over quota position.</P>
        <P>Schools are currently returning data to my Department in relation to their enrolment as of 30 September. My Department has commenced processing this data although all schools have not yet made their returns. The allocation processes including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The school to which the Deputy refers is the among the schools that were judged by an independent identification process in 2005 not to have a sufficient level of disadvantage among their pupils to warrant their inclusion in DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools), the Action Plan for educational inclusion. The next identification process is scheduled to be held at the end of the current DEIS programme which runs from 2005-2010. There will not be an opportunity before this to be included in the current DEIS programme of supports.</P>
        <P>This school together with 72 other post primary schools retained resources, both teaching posts and financial, under pre-existing schemes and programmes for addressing educational disadvantage. When DEIS was introduced, a commitment was given as a concessionary measure to these schools that they would retain a level of support for the duration of the DEIS Initiative.</P>
        <P>While it is appreciated that the discontinuation of these resources will impact on these schools, given the current volatile and challenging economic climate, difficult decisions had to be made in order to contain public sector spending. One of these decisions was to advance the withdrawal of such supports from non DEIS schools to the beginning of the next school year.</P>
        <P>The main focus of Social Inclusion measures will be to retain resources in DEIS schools. There is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools in most need and this approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are set out in his report on Primary Disadvantage of 2006, which recommended that the Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 223, 225 and 235 together.</P>
        <P>The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and the Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. The Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.</P>
        <P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department. In the case of the latter, only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld can the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB will try to help parents to find an alternative school placement if their child is on a waiting list or has been unable to secure a school placement to date. The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</P>
        <P>The Forward Planning Section of my Department is currently in the process of identifying the areas where significant additional school accommodation will be required at primary and post-primary level. Factors under consideration include population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places. Having considered these factors decisions will be taken on the means by which emerging needs will be met within an area.</P>

	<P>My Department is not involved in the allocation of school places. Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.</P><Col N="188"/>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate the sensitivity attached to releasing this type of information for each school. The source of the data comes from the annual &lsquo;October Returns&rsquo; from each post-primary school to my Department. Amongst the data collected on each student is a &ldquo;country of origin&rdquo; designation. This designation defaults to &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; unless otherwise indicated in each school&rsquo;s return.</P>
        <P>In this context and based on this designation, I can inform the Deputy that the number of students whose &ldquo;country of origin&rdquo; was returned as other than Ireland for each of the post-primary schools in the Dublin area in 2006/2007 was 3,262. Total enrolment for that school year for these schools was 90,072.</P>
        <P>The total enrolment for all post primary schools in the Dublin area for the school year 2007/2008 was 89,376. Of these 3,424 were students whose &ldquo;country of origin&rdquo; was returned as other than Ireland.</P>

	<P>Notwithstanding the increase of &euro;302 million in the Education budget for 2009, which is a real achievement in the current economic climate, a number of tough and difficult decisions had to be taken.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When the country was able to afford it the Government reduced the basis on which primary teachers are allocated to schools from being based on an average number of pupils per teacher from 35 pupils down to the current level of 27 pupils. The change to a new average of 28 pupils per teacher has to be viewed in that context.  Significant additional support went into schools particularly in the area of special education.  The Government also reduced class sizes for the most disadvantaged in our DEIS schools to an average of 1 teacher for every 20 pupils in <Col N="189"/>Junior classes and an average of 1 teacher for every 24 pupils in Senior classes and these will not be changing in 2009.  When one adds up all the teachers in the system there is 1 teacher for every 16 pupils in our primary schools.</P>
        <P>I am confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that no anomaly exists.  My Department sets out the criteria for allocating additional supports in schools which have enrolled children with special educational needs.  The level of such support is determined by the assessed disability of the pupil(s) concerned in accordance with my Department&rsquo;s policy parameters.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special needs. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>A significant number of sections of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, 2004 have been commenced, principally those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those promoting an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.  Specifically, the following sections have been commenced &mdash; 1, 2, 14(1)(a), 14(1)(c), 14(2) to 14(4), 19 to 37, 40 to 53.</P>
        <P>As required under the Act, the NCSE provided a report making recommendations regarding the implementation of EPSEN which suggested additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum across the education and health sectors. Having considered the NCSE report, and consulted with the education partners, the Department of Health and Children and the HSE, my Department identified a range of options for the implementation of EPSEN. My Department&rsquo;s opinion is that the level of investment required would be greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. In the light of the current financial circumstances, it is therefore not possible to proceed with full implementation in 2010 as originally envisaged. However, the Government will keep the matter under review and is committed to the full implementation of EPSEN at the earliest possible date.</P>
        <P>I want to reiterate that children with special educational needs will continue to receive an education appropriate to their needs. The NCSE will continue to support schools, parents and children, and teachers and special needs assistants will continue to be deployed to schools to <Col N="191"/>meet children&rsquo;s needs. As announced on Budget day, an additional &euro;20m has been provided &mdash; &euro;10m for education services and &euro;10m for health services &mdash; to strengthen and enhance services, and continue the preparation for the full implementation of the Act at a later date.</P>
        <P>An integrated approach is being adopted by the education and health sectors to target these additional resources to the areas of greatest need. Progress in both sectors will be kept under review by the Office for Disability &amp; Mental Health and the Cross-Sectoral Team.</P>

	<P>These documents cover all aspects of the development of a building project for both internal and external works. The level of facilities to be provided in schools will vary depending on the brief of accommodation needed for the school.</P>
        <P>The standard size of a classroom being delivered for primary schools, whether through the generic repeat design (GRD) concept or traditional design, at primary level is 80 sq metres, including wet area, w/c&rsquo;s, storage and cloakroom facilities. 80 sq. metres is considered to be the optimum size of classroom and was determined by studies carried out by my Department and in line with international best practice. The details are given in Technical Guidance Document 022. This has been the standard size for rooms constructed in recent years. It allowed plenty of space for the range of activities carried out under the modern school curriculum.</P>

	<P>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility, through its network of Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for the establishment of special education facilities and for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special needs.  School transport for children with special needs is generally provided to the nearest recognised mainstream school, special class/special school or unit that is, or can be resourced to meet the child&rsquo;s special educational needs under my Department&rsquo;s criteria.  My Department will request the NCSE to clarify the position regarding the allocation of resources.</P>

	<P>Notwithstanding the increase of &euro;302 million in the Education budget for 2009, which is a real achievement in the current economic climate, a number of tough and difficult decisions had to be taken. These decisions <Col N="192"/>included the decision to discontinue the annual funding of &euro;97,000 that my Department made available to the Centre for Talented Youth (CTYI) at Dublin City University.</P>
        <P>While it is appreciated that the discontinuation of this funding will impact on the Centre, given the current volatile and challenging economic climate, difficult choices had to be made in order to contain public sector spending.  Tax revenues are down significantly and Government expenditure has to reflect this reality.  The priority of this budget was to focus on measures to channel as much as was possible of the available resources to the direct funding of our schools.</P>
