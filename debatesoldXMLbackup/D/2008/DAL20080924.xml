	<P>Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghlacadh leis an Taoiseach as ucht teacht anseo inniu.  In the three months since we last met circumstances in the country have changed utterly.  There have been thousands of job losses.  Unemployment has increased by 42% to more than 300,000.  Jobs are not being protected and are being outsourced to other countries.  The tax shortfall has increased from &euro;3 billion in July to more than &euro;5 billion in September.  The stock market is down by 45%.  The property market has collapsed.  A major pension problem is about to surface.  In our health services we are now faced with an undetermined number of other misdiagnoses in cancer cases from Cork to Donegal.  A report states that the Dublin Port tunnel is not safe.  There is potential lead poisoning in water pipes in some areas in Galway city.  The cost of living has risen by 50%.</P>
        <P>Do these matters not concern the Taoiseach to the point where he should agree that on the first day this House meets after its summer break it should discuss the economy and the circumstances that now affect every person in the country?  Does he accept the premise outlined by the Minister for Finance two weeks ago when he said that the people collectively chose this course of action?  Does he agree that his Government now blames the people for the circumstances in which we find ourselves?  Does he blame the people for the musings of Ministers, where one wants to increase the top rate of income tax, another wants to introduce domestic water charges and another wants to introduce third level college fees?  The reasons are that the Government failed to heed the warning signs outlined by this party and others in making <Col N="2"/>arrangements to deal with the situation that applies.  While it is not to blame for the international financial crisis, it is to blame for the wastage of hundreds of millions of euro of taxpayers&rsquo; money.  Is the Taoiseach prepared to allow a proper debate over two days in the House or does he accept the premise outlined by the Minister for Finance that the people collectively chose this course of action?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is acting on this matter by bringing forward the date of the budget to 14 October, which is the most important decision that has been made.  It is an indication of the seriousness of the intent of Government to take whatever decisions are necessary to meet, as Deputy Kenny has said, the new economic situation we now face.  While I do not intend getting involved in a debate during Leaders&rsquo; Questions this morning on the record of the Government, which we can defend, it is a question of facing up to the situation with which we are confronted.  That is exactly what the Government is doing.  I wish to make it clear that on budget day on 14 October we will have an opportunity to put forward a balanced and coherent plan which sets out the priorities for Government in the context of the new situation we face.  We believe that is the responsible, right, appropriate and proper thing to do in the context of the challenges confronting us, quite apart from the international financial situation we face.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an act of gross political cowardice on behalf of the Government to refuse to debate the circumstances that apply in the economy of the country on the first day the House meets after its summer recess.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach said the Government is facing up to the situation in which we find ourselves and that on budget day on 14 October it will have a balanced and coherent plan.  The Government produced a balanced and coherent plan, or so he said, in July when its projections for the deficit were &euro;3 billion and it projected a 3% reduction in payroll across every Department.  </P>
        <P>I saw the Taoiseach yesterday in Cuffesgrange but I did not get a chance to speak with him because he was busy.  I was amused to hear him say that we have to buckle down and cut out waste of public money.  The reason I was amused to hear the Taoiseach say that is because the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report points to dysfunctional budgeting in the HSE, for the Minister for Health and Children, a situation where 200 new Garda cars were held in storage for 15 months because they could not be used, that the Irish Prison Service entered into 60 contracts worth &euro;18 million without seeking competitive quotes and payments were made in respect of Border allowances for troops ten years after the peace process concluded.  Who was the Minister for Finance who presided over all this waste?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has said the Government is facing up to the situation, yet he was the Minister for Finance who presided over this gross waste of public money.  He had the temerity in Cuffesgrange yesterday to say we have to stop all this wastage of public money, bring in efficiencies and face up to the situation.  In the first 120 days or so of his time as Taoiseach, can he name three actions he has taken to ensure his successor, who said he had the misfortune to be in the Department of Finance at this time, will not fall into the same financial slurry pit with further reports from the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General of gross wastage of public money?  Will he name three <Col N="3"/>actions he has instructed as Taoiseach, that he was not able to do as Minister for Finance, to protect taxpayers&rsquo; money and ensure they get value for what they pay?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question in regard of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report, to which he referred, and what I had to say about it yesterday, I made the point that the constitutional responsibility of every Comptroller and Auditor General under any Government is to point out where he feels there has been less than effective value for money or disposal of funds.  It is in the context between raising revenue of &euro;50 billion and expending over &euro;50 billion, the total expenditure and tax raising powers of the Government is almost &euro;100 billion.  Any &euro;1 million or &euro;100,000 spent unwisely or not to best effect is obviously &euro;1 million or &euro;100,000 too much but the context in which we are discussing this is that level of expenditure and of tax raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is gross incompetence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That is just to make that point.  In no way does it take from the merit or demerits of any aspect of any Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report under any Government and that will continue in the years ahead.  Any lessons to be learned from it have to be learned.  That is the simple point I was making.  Deputy Kenny continually contends that the record of this Government is something that did not exist at all and that suddenly we now have the real situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Complacency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The fact is that all forecasts made coming into this financial year were around the same as those made by the Department of Finance.  We are in an unprecedented situation, much different from that envisaged by forecasters at the tail end of last year because of what has been happening, primarily in international markets.  That is a fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>That is rubbish.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is a slow learner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>What did the Taoiseach do?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The downturn is taking place in every economy.  What we must do and are intent on doing is to bring to the D&aacute;il within three weeks a budget proposal that will set out clearly what the expenditure issues must be.  With less revenue coming in it is clear economies must be made.  What we must contend with are what our priorities will be as they relate to the capital programme and what the issues will be regarding the protection of tax breaks.  That work is ongoing within Government now and has been for the past number of weeks.  The issue will crystallise on that day.  In the meantime, if Deputy Kenny wishes to engage in a three-hour debate on the economy, today and tomorrow, which he is entitled to request and is his prerogative, we will engage with him in such a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is great.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We have no problem in engaging with Deputy Kenny in that debate but the Government has a job to do. </P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The job of Government now is to prepare for the budget which we will bring forward on 14 October.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="4"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Since Deputy Cowen became Taoiseach, some 140 days ago, 45,628 people have lost their jobs in this country.  That is, on average, approximately 300 a day.  We are told that people are now losing their jobs so fast that the Department of Social and Family Affairs cannot keep up with applications for social welfare payments.  More than 30,000 people who have lost their jobs are still waiting for their payments to be processed.  What has the Taoiseach done since this House last met to find employment for those 45,000 people?  Can he tell the House what new initiatives he and his Government have taken to put back to work those who have lost their jobs since he became Taoiseach?  What measures have been taken to protect those who are at further risk of losing their jobs? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>What we are doing, obviously, is using the training agencies to provide whatever opportunities they can to provide upskilling and reskilling of those who, unfortunately, have lost their jobs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
	<P>F&Aacute;S.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not doing too much.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>F&Aacute;S is the training agency to which people go and of whose services they avail.  Regarding the overall situation, if there is an international downturn it affects a small local economy such as ours.  This is happening elsewhere and we are not immune from such developments.  The downturn is having an impact.  </P>
        <P>It is also fair to say that there have been indications of investment from foreign direct investors during the period Deputy Gilmore mentioned.  More than &euro;1 billion has been received so far this year which is very welcome and this situation must continue.  Part of our strategy is to ensure confirmation that Ireland remains open for business and that the country is aggressively seeking those opportunities from foreign direct investors.</P>
        <P>We must also help those who are in work by ensuring that we run the finances of the State in such a way that the economy is more sustainable than would be the case if we operated on a no policy change basis.  We will not have such a policy in the coming 12 months and beyond and must take account of the changed circumstances.  Luckily we are working off a lower unemployment rate than was the case when we faced challenges such as this in the past.  The economy is in a stronger position.  I know that is no comfort for anyone who has lost his or her job, at any time, during good times or bad.  The issue for us is to continue to work with the State agencies and to have an overall responsible budgetary position that will uphold confidence in the economy and ensure that those who are at work have the prospect of continuing in their jobs, with people trying to obtain more market share.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked what the Taoiseach has done, in the ten or 11 weeks since this D&aacute;il last met, to find jobs for the 45,000 people who have lost their employment.  What new initiatives has the Government taken in that period?  I received a long answer that suggested the Government will carry on with F&Aacute;S and with its approach to the public finances.  A case of &ldquo;as you were&rdquo;.  It is clear from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply that the answer to my question is that the Government has not taken a single new initiative, in the ten or 11 weeks since the D&aacute;il rose, to address the problem of people losing their jobs.  Some 45,000 people have lost jobs in places such as Cappoquin, Tipperary, Tullamore, Cork and all over the country.  People are losing jobs and in the ten or 11 weeks since this D&aacute;il last met the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment have not taken a single new initiative.  I have not heard the public announcement by the Government of a new initiative anywhere to help people who have lost their employment find new jobs.  I asked the Taoiseach a simple, straightforward question this morning.  Did I miss the announcement of something in the newspapers in the <Col N="5"/>past ten or 11 weeks?  Has there been a new initiative?  Has a new mandate been given to the IDA or the job creation agencies?  Has a new initiative been taken by the Government to find employment for the 45,000 people who have lost their jobs since the Taoiseach took office?  The clear answer is that the Government has not done a single thing to find employment for people who have lost their jobs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the situation.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will answer parliamentary questions today on what F&Aacute;S is doing to react to the increase in unemployment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be more F&Aacute;S courses and more money wasted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy has no confidence in what F&Aacute;S has done to help reskill workers and provide unemployed people with opportunities and pathways to employment then I am afraid he does F&Aacute;S a disservice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Apprenticeships are being closed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>F&Aacute;S has had success in this area and I think it is only fair to say this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>Why was &euro;37 million taken from the budget for apprenticeships?  The Taoiseach is trying to cod us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There may be other issues relating to audit matters, but they are being dealt with and this has been welcomed by the chairman and chief executive of F&Aacute;S, in the interest of maintaining confidence in the agency.  I am glad that this is the approach they are taking to the issue.  If the Deputy is suggesting F&Aacute;S is not helping people in any way he is doing the agency a disservice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Taoiseach doing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Taoiseach doing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In answer to Deputy Gilmore, the Government will continue to work with job creation agencies like Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.  These agencies have had successes, although I notice Deputy Gilmore has not mentioned them and instead has mentioned only those people who, unfortunately, have lost jobs and who I acknowledge.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an insult to the unemployed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The picture painted by Deputy Gilmore is unbalanced.  It is a serious situation, which we intend to confront, but I do not expect any input from the Opposition other than the sort of political point scoring we have heard this morning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>The only answer is to send people to F&Aacute;S.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Vacancies arise in my Department from time to time for a variety of reasons, including staff transferring to other Departments, retirements, career breaks and resignations.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the business needs of the Department and the relevant Civil Service rules and procedures, it has been the practice to fill vacancies through the appropriate deployment of existing staff within the Department, promotion competitions, lateral transfers or external recruitment through the Public Appointments Service.</P>
        <P>At present, there are three vacancies in the Department and it is anticipated that three more staff will leave the Department in the coming months.  The grades involved are cleaner, service officer, clerical officer, administrative officer, higher executive officer and assistant principal.</P>
        <P>Further to the Government&rsquo;s recent decision to achieve a 3% saving in payroll costs, the senior management team has decided that the staffing needs of the Department will be managed from within the existing staff complement, having regard to the budgetary constraints and the overall priorities of the Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to comments made in July by the Government making a commitment to reduce the public service bill by 3% by the end of 2009.  I note the Taoiseach has employed a non-Civil Service economic adviser in his own Department at an obvious cost to the taxpayer.  May I take it that the 3% reduction in payroll will apply to both Civil Service and non-Civil Service staff?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It applies to the Department&rsquo;s full payroll.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>Will it apply to both civil servants and non-civil servants?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The figure of 3% applies to the full payroll.  The Department has been given an opportunity to reduce the payroll by 3% by the end of 2009 in respect of all employees, regardless of their status.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>If this is to apply across the board, how will the decision be made between civil servants and non-civil servants?  Who is to point the finger of redundancy, moving on or whatever within the Department of the Taoiseach?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The reduction in payroll is envisaged on the basis of taking 3% off the payroll costs.  One achieves this by examining whether to recruit people as a result of vacancies arising, the position regarding overtime and a range of issues.  Such flexibility must be given to management to achieve the payroll cut.  I am simply saying the payroll cut applies to the full payroll costs of the Department, regardless of the status of those who work there.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="7"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Have any appointments been made in the Department of the Taoiseach since the announcement was made regarding the 3% cut in payroll costs?  How does the Taoiseach propose to achieve the 3% cut in payroll costs in his Department?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The decision to manage staff resources within existing staff resources in effect means that staff vacancies arising will, in general, not be filled by means of external recruitment, which will result in a permanent reduction in the authorised staff complement for the Department.  This will necessitate reviews of how staff are deployed within the Department to ensure that key areas of departmental activity are staffed adequately.  The Department will endeavour to redeploy staff according to key business needs and levels of activity, to restructure workloads as appropriate and to achieve greater productivity through exploiting new technologies and availing of shared services arrangements.  That is how it will work.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to predict the numbers affected at this time as the budgetary effect will depend on the timing and grade of any vacancies that may arise due to staff leaving the Department, whether as a result of retirement, external promotion or any other reason.  It is estimated, based on averages, that approximately ten posts will be affected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for reading out that section of his brief and ask him to answer the two questions I asked of him.  Have any appointments been made in the Department of the Taoiseach since the 3% payroll cut was announced in July?  How will he achieve the 3% payroll cut in his Department?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to the first question is not to my knowledge.  Second, I have just explained how the payroll cut will be achieved in the Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will come back to Deputy Gilmore.  I call Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of staff vacancies, can the Taoiseach advise what is the employment policy regarding people with disabilities within the Department of the Taoiseach?  Does that Department have a policy of affirmative action to ensure people with disabilities have a fair opportunity to compete and access vacancies as they present?  I expect the Taoiseach will confirm his acknowledgement that people with disabilities are under-represented within the Civil Service and his acceptance that the Civil Service itself is in a unique position to take affirmative action measures to try to address such under-representation.</P>
        <P>While I am open to correction as there was a lot of background noise at the time, in his initial reply did the Taoiseach indicate there are three vacancies within his Department at present?  What are the prospects of any of those positions within the Department of the Taoiseach being taken up by someone with a disability?  Can the Taoiseach advise the House what affirmative action measures are currently in place within his Department and what further steps does he propose to take to address this extremely important and pressing imbalance?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A census of staff serving in my Department as of 31 December 2007 was conducted in February of this year.  Some 5% of the 79% who responded to the survey voluntarily disclosed a disability.  My Department is an equal opportunities employer and staff are recruited solely on the basis of ability to fulfil specific roles.  My Department exceeds the legislative requirement of employing a 3% level of people with disabilities in the public service and as I have stated, 5% of Department staff voluntarily disclosed disability.</P>
        <P>Staff are recruited through the Public Appointments Service on the basis that they meet the requirements of the positions they are to fill.  The issue of disability does not affect assignment to my Department and no exceptions are made in that regard.  Recruitment, promotion, training <Col N="8"/>and other benefits or opportunities are decided on objective criteria, including the qualifications and suitability of the applicant.</P>
        <P>Our recruitment principles follow the Department of Finance code of practice for the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service and the Commission for Public Service Appointments code of practice for employment of persons with disabilities to positions in the Civil Service and certain public bodies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply invites a further question.  He indicated that members of staff in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department voluntarily disclosed a disability of one sort or another.  My understanding &mdash; the Taoiseach may correct me if I am wrong &mdash; is there is a requirement on Departments across the board to meet the 3% level in terms of recruiting people with disabilities.  If the disclosures were voluntary, was this factor relating to disability taken into account with regard to access to employment in the first place?</P>
        <P>This is a very important point which needs clarification as quotas are to be reached.  These are currently inadequate and understate the present need.  They should be increased to a 5% level &mdash; an argument I have made here before with the support of other voices currently in government.</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach outline the current vacancies in his Department as I may not have picked him up correctly in his initial reply because of noise in the Chamber?  I understand three vacancies were signalled but if this is not the case will the Taoiseach please let us know?  Is there any prospect with regard to current affirmative action measures that the positions will be filled by someone with a clear disability if there are any vacancies in the Department?</P>
        <P>We are talking about staff in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department and the Civil Service across the board.  What is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s position on the contribution by the Minister of State, Deputy John McGuinness, in which he stated that the Civil Service is &ldquo;a reactionary, inert mass at the centre of our economy&rdquo; with too many square pegs in round holes throughout?  The Taoiseach has not clarified to my satisfaction how he stands on that view, which must be a reflection on his Department also.  Will the Taoiseach put on record how he stands on Deputy McGuinness&rsquo;s utterances and convey his view of the standard of people employed within our Civil Service?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I explained the various codes of practice employed within my Department and I have also indicated that based on a survey, we know approximately 5% of our employees meet the definition regarding disability.  With regard to the specific query raised outside the ambit of this question on comments by the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, those were personal and do not reflect Government policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I will ask two further questions.  The website of the Department of the Taoiseach shows the progress report, phase 3, of the public service modernisation programme, which was published in April 2007, or 18 months ago.  In fairness, the first three reports were published within six months of each other.  This modernisation programme, as the Taoiseach knows, details staff numbers and points out priorities for the Departments.  Nothing further has been posted in the past 18 months so when can we expect the next progress report on public service modernisation in so far as it affects the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department?</P>
      
        <P>My second question &mdash; we have been around this mill a few times &mdash; relates to the communications unit established in the Department of the Taoiseach by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s predecessor for the purpose of providing news updates, transcripts and so forth.  Recently, when the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, was musing about the return of third level <Col N="9"/>fees, I noted he stated that his Department had built up a file of clippings to present to him in order that he could form a judgment on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought it was a pile of beer mats. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>This obviously means the Government Information Service is duplicating at a cost of &euro;340,000 per annum what is being done in the Departments.  In the context of the reduction in the public service pay bill, does this mean that either the units in the Departments or the communications unit will be the subject of some rationalisation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will have to check with the Deputy regarding the report on modernisation about which he inquires.  I will get back to him on the issue which is outside the ambit of the questions in front of me.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>On the communications unit, I have explained the situation regarding how it is envisaged that payroll costs would be cut in the Departments.  It is not specific to individual units or members of staff.  It is about how or whether one fills vacancies when they arise, where external promotions will be held, how one increases productivity and where one introduces information technology to assist productivity rather than increasing personnel.  These issues form part of the management function to be managed in the course of the coming year to enable Departments to discharge their core function, while at the same time meeting the policy objective of reducing payroll costs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I will return to the 3% reduction in payroll costs and the comments made by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy John McGuinness.  I do not accept the line that his comments were personal.  This was not a&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is well aware, the issue is not relevant to the questions, which relate to the number of staff in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I will explain the reason the issue is relevant.  The Minister of State proposed a way by which payroll reductions could be achieved and said a vast programme of redundancies should be implemented immediately across the Civil Service and State sector.  He identified where these redundancies would take place and stated that there are too many people in the Civil Service who have no function or do not know what their function is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The same applies to the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>There were, he said, featherless but still plump State hens in the Civil Service and unhappy square pegs in round holes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Whatever about hens or ducks, the questions refer to staff vacancies in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Are there any featherless but plump State hens in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department or square pegs in round holes who he believes should be made redundant?  Is there anybody in his Department with no function who he may make redundant?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Having explained three times how the payroll costs are to be handled, I do not wish to repeat the explanation again.  On the question of Civil Service and public service modernisation or public sector reform, as it has been described, I expect the task force, which I set up on obtaining the OECD report on the matter, will report to us very shortly.  The task force will set out in a coherent and schematic way how to approach dealing with the <Col N="10"/>recommendations in the OECD report, which refer to the fact that while overall we have a very good public service, there are clearly areas where we can try to improve.  It is our objective to put in place the means by which we can achieve this based on the task force&rsquo;s recommendations.  That is the most comprehensive and coherent way to approach these matters. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no assurance from the responses given so far by the Taoiseach that there is within his Department a policy of affirmative action in relation to people with disability.  Does he accept that a statement of voluntary disclosure, which happens to show a level above the quotient applying with regard to the employment of people with disabilities, in no way assuages the fears of this Deputy or other people that there is not a proactive approach to facilitating people with disabilities accessing employment in Departments, specifically the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department, and the broader Civil Service?  I will not engage in a heated exchange with the Taoiseach on this matter.  However, I invite him to put the record straight.  Is there such a programme in place and, if so, does he project that people with disabilities will be considered for vacancies arising in his Department?</P>
        <P>There must be certainty about this matter.  It cannot be a case of adopting a hit and miss approach and inquiring after the fact, by means of voluntary disclosure, whether a person has a disability.  There is a requirement on all Departments to ensure that a certain percentage of their staff have specified disabilities.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response, on the record, to the effect that remarks made by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy McGuinness, were personal in nature and do not represent the views of the Government.  When the Minister of State made his remarks, I was of the opinion that they reflected the usual confusion among members of Fianna F&aacute;il who see the Civil Service as an appendage of their party.  The Minister of State was clearly only referring to Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot fathom the meaning of the second part of the Deputy&rsquo;s contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>

	<P>The Taoiseach is not that slow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The survey to which I referred is evidence that a policy exists, that this policy is monitored, that the targets set down are being exceeded and that there is adherence to the codes of practice.  The Deputy&rsquo;s contention seems to be that a survey was carried out, that people disclosed their views and that there is not a policy, but the position is quite the contrary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy McGuinness, is one of a number of new junior Ministers appointed by the Government.  He is one of four Ministers of State serving in that Department.</P>

	<P>When I asked the Taoiseach whether the Government had done anything to find jobs for people since the D&aacute;il last met, he was not in a position to indicate a single action taken by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment or any of her four Ministers of State in the past ten weeks in that regard.  To quote the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>They are not.  It is not my fault they are not allowed; those are the rules of the House.  In any event, and as Deputy Gilmore is probably well aware, the Minister for Finance has overall responsibility for the Civil Service.  We must remain within the parameters of the original questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The question tabled in my name relates to the Government&rsquo;s objective to achieve a 3% reduction in payroll costs.  Is the Taoiseach of the view that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which has four Ministers of State, is somewhat over-staffed?</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Does he believe there might be scope for achieving a reduction in the payroll of that Department?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ministers of State in question have cross-cutting responsibilities which range beyond their work in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  They are doing their jobs.  The reduction in payroll costs relates to staff.  I have already outlined, on approximately six occasions since I began answering questions on this matter, how that reduction is to be made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach intend to introduce, if necessary, a voluntary redundancy scheme to bring about the cuts he proposes?  Is such a scheme under consideration in any Department of State?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No decision has been made in respect of those matters.  All we have done is outline how the 3% payroll cuts are to be achieved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Is such a scheme being considered?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We should await the outcome of the task force report and the OECD report before considering any of those matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach referred to the OECD report.  Is it true that senior civil servants felt inhibited in putting forward their views on areas of  the Civil Service and Departments where an over-deployment of staff &mdash; possibly as many as 8,000 &mdash; occurred?  Is it also true the Government nobbled or interfered with the OECD report to make it less trenchant in the context of being an honest and open evaluation?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Very detailed reports were carried in the <i>Irish Independent</i> around the time of the summer recess.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department is responsible for that report, so could he say what interaction there was?  Was there discussion about overdeployment in some areas, particularly arising from the mess caused to Departments by decentralisation, the general uncertainty about where people were going and from where they were coming and the duplication of offices arising from decentralisation?  A number of senior civil servants were very disturbed and conveyed this quietly.</P>
        <P>Is it true that in the Department of Social and Family Affairs, there was an open discussion at a management meeting that there was excessive deployment and confusion about what <Col N="12"/>people were doing in the context of all the moves in the Civil Service again arising from decentralisation?</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware of the identity of the civil servants who made those comments, if they exist at all.  The OECD people stand over their report.  I recall reading that article.  I am not aware of those who felt so strongly or if they made themselves known. </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>My Department applies best practice and uses industry standard information security protection devices and software to protect all data within its systems.  The Department regularly reviews and updates these security procedures and products as a matter of course.</P>
        <P>No computers, disks, laptops or memory storage devices containing personal information about members of the public have been lost or stolen from my Department.  Although sensitive information belonging to members of the public is not generally collected by, or stored, in the Department&rsquo;s electronic systems, a number of specific measures are in place in my Department to protect all data which is held electronically.</P>
        <P>Access to personal information held on databases within my Department is controlled by application security and confined to relevant authorised personnel only.  Access by users to these systems is granted on a &ldquo;needs only&rdquo; basis.  The Department&rsquo;s computer networks themselves are secured against cyber attacks through the use of security products such as multiple firewalls, anti-virus software and e-mail security tools.  Staff supplied with mobile equipment are issued with guidance to ensure devices are secured properly.  The hard drives of all laptops are encrypted and do not store departmental data physically on them.  Strong authentication methods, in addition to username and password, are in place to prevent unauthorised access to the Department&rsquo;s network from mobile devices.</P>
        <P>My Department also evaluates and reviews advanced information security products and technologies as they come to market and implements them where appropriate.  The Depart<Col N="13"/>ment&rsquo;s IT assets are audited by the IT unit on an annual basis.  The IT unit is currently carrying out an asset audit.  Audits are also carried out on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis by the Department&rsquo;s internal audit unit.  My Department is also subject to annual audit inspections by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for that reply.  If I understood him correctly, he clarified that no laptops, as far as is known, have been stolen from his Department.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach will be aware that personal information on 380,000 people on the social welfare register went missing in April 2007.  It took until August 2008 &mdash; 16 months &mdash; before the Minister for Social and Family Affairs was made aware of the extent of the loss.  I understand that the data was only password protected instead of being encryption protected.  Am I correct that sensitive data in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department are encryption protected and not only password protected?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach will be aware that personal data on 580,000 people has been lost in the past 18 months and that the reporting of that seems to be inadequate.  As he is aware, there are procedures in place but there are no specific legal obligations on a body which loses personal data to notify a person that private information on him or her has been lost.  Also, there is no legal obligation on a body to notify the Data Protection Commissioner of any such loss.  Does the Taoiseach agree that it is only right and proper that if a person&rsquo;s information is lost, he or she should be notified and there should be a legal requirement in that regard?  Does he also agree that if a body loses similar relevant information, it should be obliged to inform the Data Protection Commissioner?  The Taoiseach is aware that the reports of the Data Protection Commissioner are only made public if the body being investigated agrees to their publication.  The Irish Blood Transfusion Board agreed to publication, but the Bank of Ireland did not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach can only comment on his Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The question is in respect of his Department, but I have given examples from others.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the Department of Social and Family Affairs, I understand there is no evidence to suggest the information was used.  The Minister provided a full and frank disclosure upon being notified of what had happened so the people concerned could take whatever precautions they wished to ensure their personal information would not be used by anybody in an unauthorised way.  It is regrettable that theft happened, but I am sure whatever lessons are to be learned in terms of encryption arrangements will be learned.</P>
        <P>On the issue of data protection legislation and the Data Protection Commission, perhaps a question directed to the Minister concerned would elicit the accurate information.  One must balance the need to let people know of any infringement of their rights or privacy with the efficacy of being able to do so in terms of the number of people who may be affected.  One may need to use other means to bring the matter to their attention so they can take whatever proactive steps they wish to ensure they are unaffected.  This may provide the more practical means of assessing any damage or otherwise that arises as a result of these events happening.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the recent series of laptop theft, will the Taoiseach indicate what steps are being taken within his Department and across all Departments to assess the security of personal data on citizens?  Does the Taoiseach accept the theft of a laptop with the social welfare records of some 380,000 citizens and significant other material on their personal circumstances, including details of marriages, births etc., is very distressing?  There is an undoubted confidence deficit in the public arena that must be addressed.  Does the Taoiseach <Col N="14"/>accept the call of the Data Protection Commissioner for all major holders of information on clients or citizens, be it in the public or private sector, to employ every care to ensure that information is not put at risk?</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that, in most instances, it appears the laptops stolen were not in an office environment at the time of the theft?  They were stolen in transit between home and work or from public transport.  The need for the removal of sensitive data transported in that manner must be examined. Will the Taoiseach assure us there is a review under way and that steps are being employed to ensure the security of information held on citizens by all Departments?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that the person responsible for equipment lost or stolen notifies authorities as quickly as possible, and immediately if possible.  The procedures in place to deal with equipment reported as lost or stolen in my Department is that, where a device is reported missing or stolen, the user account associated with that device is immediately disabled.  BlackBerries are centrally disabled from the server, a procedure which also wipes the memory of the machine.  The network provider is notified so that the SIM card can be disabled, which renders the device inaccessible to unauthorised users.  The Department&rsquo;s asset register is updated and, in the case of theft, the user is asked to report the matter to the Garda.  Where personal or sensitive data are compromised, the Data Protection Commissioner is also informed.</P>
        <P>These procedures satisfy us that best practice is followed to ensure Departments&rsquo; databases are safe from hackers, for example.  Industry standard information security protection devices and software are used to protect all data within systems.  These procedures, products and devices are regularly reviewed and, in the case of a breach of security, would have to be reviewed and updated to ensure they are capable of providing the best security appropriate to a Department&rsquo;s needs at all times.</P>
        <P>In regard to whether any incidents have occurred whereby personal data held by the Department of the Taoiseach or its agencies were compromised in any way, no personal data held electronically by my Department has been compromised in any way.</P>
        <P>Obviously, every Department has to be vigilant in this area and employ good people in the relevant units so that they have the most up-to-date means of ensuring data are not accessible by other than authorised users and, immediately upon notification of theft, the ability to disable that information and render it useless to anyone else.  Wiping the information held on a server or whatever is also an important part of the process of protection.</P>

	<P>We have a problem because the Taoiseach can only address questions for his own Department. Questions for the Department of Social and Family Affairs would have to be addressed to that Department&rsquo;s Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter that has to be addressed is the public&rsquo;s concern about personal and sensitive information being accessed by somebody who should not have it.  We now have a situation whereby certain medical tests in hospitals have been outsourced.  There <Col N="15"/>are clearly concerns about where that information might end up and it would help to reassure people if information could be provided as to whether material contained on laptops which have already been stolen has been accessed in any way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is not responsible for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to that is not in my knowledge.  I have not been notified of any adverse subsequent development beyond the fact that the events took place.  The Ministers concerned have brought the events to public notice and have indicated what the people who may have been affected would need to do to reassure themselves that their information was not improperly accessed or used in a way that was adverse to their interests.  I have not heard anything since then.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Taoiseach to investigate Departments and agencies, including his own, which publish on their websites personal information pertaining to inquiries they conduct.  I refer specifically to the Private Residential Tenancies Board when it holds hearings into disputes over tenancies or whether a tenant is causing serious social problems in an area.  The law requires that such hearings are held in public but, if members of the press do not attend and if nobody is present other than those involved in the hearing, the PRTB puts the name, address and all the details of the complaints and the responses to them on its public website.  This compromises the people concerned in respect of their neighbours, so this issue needs to be addressed.  The Data Protection Commissioner is trying to resolve the issue by having the town in which Mr. X or Ms. Y lives posted rather than his or her personal details.  This is an important issue because it leads to the continuation of serious social problems.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach can only answer for his own Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a matter for the line Minister concerned.  I can only observe that, unlike family law proceedings, these are not held <i>in camera.</i>  There is not a requirement for privacy, so the question arises of how one can transparently communicate the outcome of these arrangements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fine, but the detail is the issue with which I am concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of the level of personal information and the extent to which this infringes privacy issues is a matter that can be taken up by the competent authorities and resolved in a practical manner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 13, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Since the publication of the OECD report, Regulatory Reform in Ireland in 2001, significant progress has been made in the area of regulatory reform.  In 2004, the Government published the White Paper, Regulating Better, in response to the OECD&rsquo;s report.  The White Paper provides the basis for work on the better regulation agenda.  Some of the key areas outlined in the White Paper relate to specific sectoral issues on which the responsible Ministers report directly to the House.</P>
        <P>The better regulation unit in my Department is tasked with the overall promotion of the better regulation agenda across the Government system.  Clearly, individual Ministers and their Departments and Offices are responsible for implementing the various elements of this agenda within their own Departments and agencies under their aegis.  There are no plans to alter these arrangements.  In the context of the ongoing work of the better regulation unit, I would like to outline briefly for the House progress, in particular, in the three areas of regulatory impact analysis, modernisation of the Statute Book and reviewing the economic regulatory environment.</P>
        <P>Following a Government decision in June 2005, regulatory impact analysis, RIA, must be applied to all proposals for primary legislation, significant statutory instruments, draft EU directives and significant EU regulations.  RIA is a tool which is used to assess the likely effects of a proposed new regulation or regulatory change in a structured and transparent way.  In line with the terms of Towards 2016, an independent review of the operation of RIA was published in July of this year and is available on the better regulation website.  It indicates that, overall, good progress has been made in relation to the implementation of regulatory impact analysis across Departments, with some 74 produced in the period between June 2005 and February 2008.  The report also finds that the supports which have been made available to officials conducting RIAs are well regarded.  More than 800 officials have been trained in the use of RIA.  This training has resulted in a significant increase in analytical skill sets across the Civil Service.  These skills help to ensure that all impacts, including unintended ones, are assessed through the RIA process, resulting in better quality legislation.  The Government has agreed to implement the recommendations made in the report.</P>
        <P>The better regulation unit of my Department has, together with the Office of the Attorney General, steered and focused work in the area of modernisation of the Statute Book.  This work is designed to increase the transparency and accessibility of the Statute Book for the citizen.  The statute law revision project is helping to clear away thousands of redundant and obsolete Acts so we can see what needs to be repealed and re-enacted in modern, consolidated form.  Almost 3,500 obsolete pre-1922 Acts have already been repealed by the Statute Law Revision Acts 2005 and 2007.</P>
        <P>The current phase of the statute law revision project is focusing on local, personal and private Acts.  The aim is to provide a complete list of pre-1922 primary legislation which remains in force.  The heads of a new statute law revision Bill were approved by the Government on 29 April 2008.</P><Col N="17"/>
        <P>In addition, the Law Reform Commission is undertaking a programme of statute law restatement which will make legislation more accessible by providing, in the case of selected Acts, a single, up-to-date text, including all amendments.  The Acts to be restated as part of the programme were selected following an extensive consultation process and reflect Government priorities.  This process of restatement will also facilitate future consolidation and modernisation of legislation.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government includes a commitment to instigate a review of the economic regulatory environment which fits well with elements of the action programme for better regulation contained in the White Paper.  An interdepartmental group chaired by my Department has been tasked with advancing work in this area, for which the Economist Intelligence Unit in a partnership with Compecon Limited is undertaking an independent review to compare key economic regulators with their counterparts in the EU and the OECD and thereby address the need for stronger international benchmarks in regard to the comparative efficiency, effectiveness and accountability of regulators.  It is expected this review will be completed by the end of the year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is only time for brief supplementary questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>That is very exciting stuff from the Taoiseach.  I have three brief questions.  The Government is committed to a 25% reduction in red tape, which is a very large cost for business.  An employer with eight employees recently told me that one of his staff must spend half a day each week filling Government forms.  Is it planned to carry out a baseline assessment of the cost of red tape for Irish business that would apply across the board so people would know what the target is on a comparative level?</P>
        <P>Second, an independent benchmarking report has been commissioned to address the need for stronger international data and benchmarks to assess the comparative efficiency and effectiveness of key Irish economic regulators.  When is that expected to be published?  Third, the report on regulatory impact analysis by an independent review was published recently.  Some of the stakeholders involved in this were disappointed at the apparent lack of consultation about it.  In any event, given the time put into it and its considerable cost of &euro;108,000, when does the Taoiseach expect the review&rsquo;s recommendations to be implemented?  Is there a programme through which that will take place and is there a target date for implementation of the recommendations?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the 25% target for reducing the administrative cost of regulation by 2012, which was agreed by the Government in February last, more than six months ago, are there any figures available on how much of that 25% target has been achieved?  When does the Taoiseach intend to give some interim update on how much the cost of regulation has been reduced since that target was announced?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The 25% target for the reduction of administrative burdens arising from national legislation by 2012 is under the aegis of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who has overall responsibility for achieving that target.  In this context the Department is leading a cross-departmental project to measure the administrative burdens arising from all national legislation.  The approach and methodology to be used are currently being devised and work across Departments will be co-ordinated and reported on annually by the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
        <P>Parallel with that, the high level group on business regulation, which consists of business representatives and officials, has been examining ways of reducing unnecessary administrative burdens in five priority areas identified by Irish business as being the most burdensome.  These <Col N="18"/>are taxation, health and safety, environment law, statistical returns and employment and company law.  That is in line with the commitment in the programme to ensure direct feedback from business on regulatory burdens.  The first report of the high level group on business regulation was published in August.  A number of individual administrative burdens were measured, identifying over &euro;20 million of savings for business.  Furthermore, the group is working to support co-operation between Departments and agencies across Government with a view to simplifying procedures and reducing duplication.  That work will continue to result in the reduction of costs for business as well as identifying opportunities for meaningful efficiency improvements in the public sector.</P>
        <P>The twin processes outlined above provide for a cross-Government target-driven process while at the same time allowing a forum for specific issues to be tabled and dealt with as they are identified by the business community.  The regulatory impact analysis process will be used to measure the cost of any potential administrative burdens arising from future regulations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s website page on better regulation states that the State liberalised telecommunications and describes this as a wise move that has placed the communications market on a par with many OECD countries.  Does the Taoiseach not accept that the facts belie this claim?  The latest European Commission survey on communications shows that Ireland lags far behind other countries.  A total of 49% of homes here have an Internet connection but we rely on narrow band technology or dial-up access.  This is the only EU state where more households access the Internet by narrow band than by broadband technology.  What is the Government doing about this?  This is one of the most important areas that must be addressed, particularly now when there are ever-growing difficulties in the employment sector and a straitened economy.  There is a need for real investment in opening up opportunities for the future and broadband is one of the areas that has been critically neglected.  What steps does the Government propose to take?  Will the Taoiseach assure the House that such critical investment will not be set aside as part of the Government&rsquo;s so-called addressing of the challenging fiscal circumstances that now confront us?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the administrative burden faced by small businesses, many people who run small businesses spend their weekends at their dining room tables filling in the various survey forms that are sent out by Government offices.  Not only is this a significant cost, but for many people who are new to the experience of running their own business it is an emotional and stressful burden.  The Government has been talking about reducing this for some time and has spoken about putting as many as possible of the forms on-line and allowing them to be filled in on-line.  The Taoiseach must be aware, from people in his constituency and the business people he knows, that our level of regulation is very old fashioned in that it still involves a great deal of form filling.  We accept it is for the collection of statistical data, but small businesses are receiving a tsunami of paper.  Does the Minister propose to lift that burden?</P>
        <P>While the Taoiseach is lightening the burden of regulation for small business, what does he propose to do about the banks?  During the debate on the Finance Act this year, the Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Finance, said he favoured regulation with a light hand.  He spoke philosophically about it for some time.  Now that regulation with a light hand has brought the international economy almost to its knees, particularly in the United States, does he intend to revisit his approach to regulation of large institutions such as banks?  In particular, does he propose to examine how the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator have been able to respond to the current crisis brought about by delinquent capitalism in the United States banks and, indeed, in some European banks?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="19"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach can only answer in so far as the questions are related to the main questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The questions relate to the OECD report on regulatory reform.  In response to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, there has been a large expansion in broadband usage and more competition in the sector.  There has also been a big reduction in the cost of using broadband.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in recent months produced a further paper setting out how he envisages the sector developing in the future, how we can meet the competitive challenge we have set ourselves in terms of trying to devise a knowledge economy and where broadband fits into that in the context of the information and communications technology sector.  There has been a great deal of effort in that area.  If the suggestion is that rather than having that type of environment we should have a State environment where it would be publicly provided, I doubt that we would have reached the current level of usage given the capital intensive nature of that type of investment.  The market and competition in the market have helped to drive down costs and spread usage.  Obviously, there is more to be done in that area.</P>
        <P>With regard to Deputy Burton&rsquo;s question, we are working with our EU colleagues on improving regulation generally in the financial services area as a result of what has arisen.  There are continuing challenges and these are being monitored and evaluated both nationally and at a European level as far as Ireland is concerned.</P>

The Department of Education and Science sanctioned a rebuild of the school in March 2001, some seven years ago.  Despite many promises by various Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers and the project having been assessed as a priority no school has been built.  The walls are damp, the roof is leaking and there are major health and safety risks with mouse-traps having to be set every evening.

	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of urgent and national importance, namely, the need for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to extend the date of 31 December in respect of the control of farm waste scheme.  The projects have been already approved for funding, the money is desperately needed in this sector and farmers were unable to commence building owing to the horrendous weather this summer.  It is imperative that the Minister allows many projects at farm level to be com<Col N="21"/>pleted.  The control of farm waste scheme is vital for the industry which is currently struggling following a difficult year made worse by the terrible weather.  The current deadline is damaging both to the agricultural building sector and agricultural sector.  It will be dreadful if funding applied for, approved and desperately needed is not sanctioned.  This will have a major impact on our rural environment.

	<P>There are two proposals before the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 10 agreed?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="22"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not agreed.  The Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s decision not to adjourn the House under Standing Order 32 to discuss the financial crisis affecting many of our people is a strange one.  I am constrained by the rules of the House in this regard.</P>
        <P>In not agreeing to the proposal regarding No. 10, I am putting forward the view that as this is the first D&aacute;il sitting day following the summer recess and given circumstances have changed utterly in this country in the past three months, the Government should have provided for a full scale debate in this regard during the next two days in order to inform Members on all sides of what is happening around the country in respect of the proposed 3% cutbacks prior to the budget.  The Taoiseach and quite a number of Ministers have been publicly seeking a bipartisan approach from this party in areas such as health.  Here is an opportunity for the Government to state that this is an important matter, that it will not shy away from it, and that it will be debated in the House in the interest of the people.  This is what people are talking about, because it affects every one of them in their daily lives.  Jobs are being lost or transferred to other countries.  The cost of living is increasing.  There is no protection for jobs and no training for the 50,000 workers in the construction industry who will be out of work by the end of the year.  There has been no initiative from the Government to deal with this.  The public finances have deteriorated so that we will have gone from a budgetary surplus to a deficit of &euro;5 billion by the end of the year.  It is probably the worst financial crisis that has developed in this country over such a short time.  Yet the Government wants to talk about boundary extensions and changes to constituencies, although there is no election coming up that I know of.</P>

	<P>The Government may decide to move the writ for the by-election for the late lamented S&eacute;amus Brennan.</P>
        <P>I suggest to the Taoiseach that we get down to reality.  This is not posturing.  There is a serious issue facing every single citizen of this country.  The Taoiseach is the Leader of the Government.  He should be willing to instruct the Whip to change the Order of Business to allow a two-day debate on the economy.  We will facilitate the Government where we feel it is appropriate.  The Government is seeking a bipartisan approach.  Here is its opportunity.  I call on the Taoiseach to suspend the business of the House and forget the Second Stage of the Electoral Amendment Bill for today and tomorrow.  Let us have a discussion about the economy.  Let us hear Deputies from all sides&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;paint pictures of the stories that are streaming into their offices and clinics on a daily basis, all because the Government has failed to show any kind of competency in saving public money and implementing initiatives that would protect our economy for the future.  The Government is not responsible for Lehman Brothers or Merrill Lynch, but it is responsible for wasting hundreds of millions of euro over the last number of years.  It continues to preside over this but its members do not want to speak about it in the House.  My suggestion to the Taoiseach is that he back up his own words and accept a bipartisan approach.  Let us have a debate over the next two days on the economic problems facing the country.  We will be happy to return to normal pairing arrangements if that applies.</P>

	<P>It is the Government&rsquo;s responsibility to propose the legislative programme for the House.  In my time here I have never seen such a pathetic legislative programme as we have for this week&rsquo;s business.  What we have before us for these two days shows us that this Government is now so long in office that it has lost touch with reality and with the people that sent us here.  The Cabinet is suffering from a bad dose of burn-out.  The Taoiseach cannot be seriously suggesting that we come in here and talk about D&aacute;il constituency boundaries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which might have to be changed anyway based on the next census, at a time when the people of the country have many other concerns.  The head of the HSE told us yesterday there might be further cases of cancer misdiagnosis.  People are losing their jobs.  There are people whose homes and businesses were flooded during the month of August in bizarre weather.  There is no end to the things the House could and should be debating.</P>
        <P>If it is the Government&rsquo;s view that the House should talk about legislation, where is the nursing homes legislation?  There are families out there who are driven demented by the fact that they cannot get subventions and they do not know how they will pay the nursing home bills, yet no nursing home legislation is ordered.  People living in apartments are waiting for legislation, promised by the Taoiseach some time ago, to regulate the management companies that govern them.  The Civil Partnership Bill was promised but has not appeared.  There is the employment regulation legislation that we have asked for so many times.  More than a year after the formation of the Government, it is surely not too soon to expect legislation on carbon emissions to be brought before the House for debate.  There is no end of legislative initiatives that the House could be debating.  The programme for this week is the product of a Government that is burnt out and that has become lazy and incompetent.  It has nothing to offer the House and nothing to offer the people of this country.</P>

	<P>The Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies cannot accept the Order of Business as presented.  As a schedule it represents a total lack of realism on the part of the Government.  It is not a case of returning here for business as usual, in the way things finished up in the earlier period of the year, at which time the Government was clearly bankrupt in terms of legislative proposals.  Yet here we are starting off again.  What is the Government offering Members to address on the first day of the second year of the 30th D&aacute;il?  It is an absolute disgrace.</P>
        <P>It is not business as usual.  There is nothing usual about the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  The country has been plunged into a sharp economic decline.  Tens of thousands of people are being placed on the dole queue.  Health cuts are continuing to hurt right across the board, despite all the assurances given by the Minister for Health and Children and Professor Drumm of the HSE.  On the ground, these cuts are biting and they are hurting gravely.  We need an opportunity to articulate these problems and to bring them to Government notice in this Chamber.  That opportunity must be presented by Government.</P>
        <P>We must make no mistake about the programme for Government.  It was put together by a Taoiseach who is no longer Taoiseach and a party that has almost hung up its cap and coat.  There is no programme for Government.  What the Government has cobbled together, presumably over the period since last we sat in this Chamber, is a programme for cuts.  Its members must come clean before this Chamber.  They must outline the reality that they know from <Col N="24"/>within their Departments and their proposals to address the realities facing our citizenry today.  As Opposition voices, we need the opportunity to hear clearly the Government&rsquo;s intentions, to analyse them, give our views, offer what further guidance and opinion we can to try to improve on the Government&rsquo;s proposals and to point out where they are clearly going to fail.  That is our role and responsibility, yet the Government is asking us to proceed on matters such as electoral boundaries.  For God&rsquo;s sake, that is not what the people out there want us to address today.  They want us to address the matters that are most affecting their daily lives, that is, the current recession &mdash; we should call it what it is and not be afraid to use the R-word &mdash; the further contraction of job opportunities in the State, the ongoing cuts that are hurting people in the health services and the failure of Government to provide for the needs of our children through the education system.  These are the issues we should address.  It is an absolute disgrace that this is the best the Government can present, through the office of the Chief Whip, as a proposal for the work of this House today and tomorrow.  It is absolutely not good enough.</P>

If this House is to have any relevance, we need to discuss issues that are relevant to people&rsquo;s lives and to what is happening in the real world.  If the Government is not in a position to bring forward legislative proposals that have meaning outside the walls of this building, it should make Government time available to the Opposition so that we can discuss the issues that affect the people.</P>

	<P>I wish to speak not only in relation to not providing legislation but not providing the opportunity to properly discuss the real issues that are important to people today.  That is a major failure on the part of Government this morning.  Clearly if Government is not prepared to do that, then the Opposition must.  I fully support Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s proposal and I appeal to the Taoiseach that whatever his initial reaction to the proposition, he should give it serious consideration because Deputies in this House, of all opinion, have the right to articulate the difficulties they know first hand are affecting their constituents across the length and breadth of this State today and these need to be aired on the floor of this Chamber.</P>

	<P>The difficulty, of course, is that the Standing Order provides that Private Members&rsquo; business shall be three hours overall.

	<P>If the Government agrees, we can extend the time for Private Members&rsquo; business, even though it is not provided for in Standing Orders.

	<P>Arising from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply, can I take it that whether the nature of the problem was constitutional or otherwise, it has now been sorted out by the Attorney General?  Can I assume also that there will be no further delay in having the details of this Bill put together so that it can be published, brought into the House and debated?  Will the Taoiseach put a timescale on the matter?  Can we have the Bill in three or four weeks?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We had this question before.  Progress was made over the course of the summer regarding issues that in certain respects were delaying the drafting of the Bill.  It is being finalised at present and is expected to come before the House during this session.  That is my information.</P>

	<P>I wish to raise two matters.  First, I understand there will be some changes in employment legislation arising from the conclusion of an agreement between the Government and the social partners.  Which pieces of legislation in the Government programme will incorporate the changes in employment legislation agreed with the social partners?  Will separate legislation be introduced?</P>
        <P>Second, I noted reports during the summer that the Combat Poverty Agency is to be withdrawn back to the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Is it intended to introduce legislation to amend the Combat Poverty Agency Bill of 1986 in order to allow this to happen?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be separate legislation for some of the new aspects that were agreed in partnership.  With regard to the Combat Poverty agency issue, obviously there are no plans to do anything at the moment.  The matter is under review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>I know that the Comptroller and Auditor General holds office independently of Government.  In the past two months the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, and the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coughlan, have called on the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out investigations into universities and into F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach propose to bring forward a motion asking this House to direct the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out these investigations or were these statements to serve merely as crutches because the Ministers did not act within their own Departments on these issues?  The Taoiseach could introduce a motion to this end if the Government is serious about the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that such a motion is not necessary.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has the relevant constitutional responsibility and discharges it very well.  Indeed his reports are often referred to and lauded in this House in terms of the issues they raise and the forensic examination they undertake in various aspects of public expenditure.  The use of the existing mechanisms one expects to find in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s office for such a purpose should instil public confidence.  I do not see why one should question that vehicle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard Allen</NameTxt>

	<P>Further to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments regarding the Combat Poverty Agency and the fact that there are now no proposals to amend the Combat Poverty Agency Act,  will he take this opportunity to assure the House that he will maintain the independence of that agency?  It is obviously critically important to the work it does.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I see under the Order of Business that the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is to come before the House.  In section 36 of the Bill the incremental tenant purchase scheme is mentioned.  In particular, it is stated that residents of flats and apartments will be prohibited from availing of this scheme.  Does this mean also that the long-standing issue of the sale of council flats under the tenant purchase scheme legislative framework is not going to happen?  This issue has been before the House and the Minister in whose brief it lies has indicated that the Bill would resolve this matter.  However, having read the Bill this morning, it appears this issue will not be dealt with.  Can the Taoiseach say whether this option has been ruled out entirely?  People outside this House have been waiting for this Bill and felt it would resolve the issue but it now appears that this will not happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the issue is still under consideration and whether an amendment may be required on Committee Stage to see whether it can be encompassed. </P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I want to ask the Taoiseach about the Property Services Regulatory Bill.  It is listed to be published before the beginning of the next session, which could be up to February 2009.  Is there a timescale for this Bill?  As of next month the Government will have spent &euro;600,000 on keeping open the offices of the National Property Services Regulatory Authority but the authority has no legal powers.  It is doing its best but it cannot do the job it was created to do in terms of, for example, dealing with the problems of young apartment owners who are being sued for exorbitant management fees for poor services.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The publication of that Bill is subject to the resolution of certain legal issues that arose during the completion of the drafting process.  Every effort is being made to have it published as soon as possible.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Just over three weeks ago a cohort of junior infants started school in north County Dublin.  The patron of the school has no legal entitlement to act in that capacity, thus unnecessarily exposing the parents, teachers and children to risk.  On the Order Paper there is a requirement, under the Department of Education and Science, to bring forward the education (patronage) Bill.  I read with some concern that publication of that Bill is expected in 2009.  It is a one line amendment Bill.  I can give the Taoiseach a copy of one this afternoon, if he so wishes and is so bereft of legislation.  It is extraordinary that the Bill is expected in 2009 when it was understood for over a year that the north Dublin County Council VEC would be the patron for the school.  Can we bring forward this legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

        <P>The Government has indicated that it will not publish a pre-budget outlook or Estimates regarding what it proposes on services.  Everything is to announced on budget day.  This goes back to the stroke pulled by the former Minister for Finance, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, regarding decentralisation, which was announced on the floor of the House.  Last year, the Taoiseach said that the development of pre-budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We need to bring forward the budget quickly and provide clarity and certainty regarding the direction of the economy, in light of the situation in which we find ourselves.  For this reason, pre-eminence must be given to holding the budget on 14 October.  The question of the end of third quarter returns and so on will be provided in due course.  It is important to point out that this process allows us to bring forward the budget on 14 October.  This is the overriding requirement, quite apart from arrangements that may have prevailed in the past and would have applied to a December budget.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am raising this in the context of promised legislation.  We were told that three pieces of legislation would be published last term and the same three pieces of legislation are in the list for this term.  None of them has been dealt with.  The Minister introduced no legislation last term, despite three being on the priority list.  One, the nursing homes support scheme Bill, has already been raised, while the adoption Bill and the child care Bill are the others.  When will these pieces of legislation be introduced?</P>
        <P>On the nursing home support scheme Bill, families are being crucified with regard to the means test for subvention and the family home.  These people can no longer afford to pay for their relatives and we need a date for this legislation.  In the meantime the HSE must be ordered to relax the methods that are being used at the moment in terms of assessing families for subvention.</P>

Doublespeak is being told last Christmas that we would have this Bill by January, being told in January that we would have it before Easter and being told before Easter that we would have it during the summer.  We have been told again that we may have it.  Can we have a straight answer?  Will this Bill come before this Chamber before Christmas?  Have the legal issues been resolved?</P>

	<P>On the adoption Bill, families and children across the country have difficulties because of the Government&rsquo;s failure to reform our adoption legislation.  Prior to the summer recess, on the Taoiseach&rsquo;s final day in this House, a promise was made by him, along <Col N="33"/>with the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with responsibility for children, that the adoption Bill would be published during the summer.  This Bill has been promised for approximately nine and a half years, which I think is a national record.  I have lost count of the number of legislative programmes on which we have seen it.  Can the Taoiseach tell us whether it will be published this week or next week?  What happened to the promise that guaranteed its publication during the summer recess period?</P>

        <P>Regarding the raft of health legislation that has not been brought forward and in the context of the fact that it is estimated some 5,000 people die prematurely in Ireland each year as a result of social deprivation, including health inequality, how is it that a Bill that was on the last legislative programme for publication this year, which first appeared on the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme in January 2006 for publication that year, has now been deferred once again?  I speak of the eligibility for health and personal social services Bill.  This is crucial legislation that, once again, now appears next to the message &ldquo;not possible to indicate&rdquo;.  That was not the case last January and it has not been the position since January 2006.  I have gone back through each of the legislative programmes since it first appeared on the Government&rsquo;s proposals.</P>

        <P>I made the point that the nursing homes support scheme Bill is nearly finalised.  It is intended to be brought before the Houses in the current D&aacute;il session.  As for the child care Bill, during the summer recess work continued on drafting of the Bill to resolve points arising from significant legal and technical issues that had emerged during the drafting and accompanying consultation processes.  Further consultation took place to assist that process and, in addition, legal advice on specific complex issues were formulated, sought and obtained.  As a result, several significant sets of instructions were sent to the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and new draft versions <Col N="34"/>of the Bill were produced, resolving many of those issues.  It is expected that having resolved some of those issues, the Government will be able to proceed with publication in the next term.</P>

Will there be an opportunity to debate it in the House, given there is a great lack of clarity regarding the extent of the liabilities that have been taken on on behalf of the taxpayer?</P>

	<P>I draw the Taoiseach&rsquo;s attention to section B of the legislative programme, the Bills in respect of which heads have been agreed and texts are being drafted.  Very similar Bills were published at the beginning of the life of the present D&aacute;il and the current rate of progress has been painfully slow to date.  Incidentally, I note the inclusion of the Curragh of Kildare Bill, which I believe first appeared on the Order Paper when I was first elected to the House.  However, the major problem pertains to section C, which consists of 50 Bills in respect of which heads have yet to be approved by the Government.  Many of the Bills are important and at the present rate of progress will not have passed through the House by the end of the life of the present D&aacute;il.  I ask the Taoiseach whether it is intended to draw up a <Col N="35"/>priority list whereby such urgent legislation can be speeded up and brought through the House at an early stage?</P>

	<P>The entire purpose of the A, B and C lists was to give an indication to Members, as they requested, as to what priorities were likely to come before the House in the immediate term and so forth.  If the purpose of producing the C list is to ask the reason the Bills are not on the A or B list, and the House goes through this <i>seriatim</i> every week, what is the purpose of producing the C list, if the Opposition or individual Members thereof suggest they should be on the B or A list?  This goes on in every term.</P>

	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The whole idea of bringing forward these lists in the present form is to indicate from the outset, in fairness to Opposition spokespersons and everyone else who wishes to contribute to the House, what Bills are likely to be brought forward and what ones are not.  Questions about policy issues should be tabled before the relevant Ministers during Question Time.  However, if the House is to have Orders of Business in which Members spend at least an hour talking about Bills, which the C list already indicates clearly will not be taken this term, and if Members wish to have a debate on the reason they are not being taken in this term and if that is the best use of Members&rsquo; time, I will stay here for that.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach, on the pharmacy No. 2 Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the pharmacy No. 2 Bill was twofold, first to follow on from the Pharmacy Act 2007 and deal with other changes in the regulatory framework for pharmacy and pharmacy services not addressed in that Act and, second, to deal with any remaining recommendations of the pharmacy review group, including matters relating to a new pharmacy contract.  Work was progressing on commencing the Pharmacy Act 2007.  However, due to the complex nature of the modernisation of the regulatory framework for the sector, including the putting in place of procedures and rules in areas not previously regulated, such as the registration of pharmacy businesses and a fitness to practice regime, the Act is not expected to be fully commenced until some time in 2009.</P>
        <P>Until the Act is fully commenced and its provisions are operational, it will not be possible to prepare proposals for any new pharmacy Bill.  In addition, work on the remaining issues in the pharmacy review group&rsquo;s recommendations for the Bill is dependent on progress and developments in the area of pharmacy services and contractual matters.  While the Department and the HSE have been engaging with the pharmacy sector on these issues, they are not sufficiently advanced at this time to permit the preparation of proposals that might be included in any new pharmacy Bill.  With these considerations in mind, it is considered that the pharmacy No. 2 Bill cannot be progressed for the foreseeable future.</P>

	<P>I wish to raise an issue that is connected to that raised by Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch, at which time I tried to get in but could not.  I refer to the tenant purchase scheme for council flats.  Specifically, a policy document was published by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in February 2007 and it certainly was expounded by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s party in advance of the general election that provision would be made in legislation during this D&aacute;il term for council flat owners to purchase their flats from local authorities.  However, the legislation published during the summer makes no reference to this.  Is Government policy still as was set out in February 2007?  Does the Government intend to implement some scheme in the future and, if so, how does it propose to so do?  Will it be by ministerial order or through further legislation?  Why can it not be included in the Bill that is to be brought before the House?  That appears to be bizarre.</P>
        <P>I wish to make a relevant point.  In the late 1980s such a scheme was successfully implemented by Cork City Council.  It was discontinued in the early 1990s, in 1992, I believe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>On the multi-unit developments, an interdepartmental and inter-ministerial group has been working on this.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is in discussion with the Law Society with regard to some aspects and contractual issues in preparation for proposed provisions for that aspect of the problem.  That meeting is imminent, which I know having spoken to the Minister about it.</P>
        <P>What we are trying to do is prepare provisions from various Departments affected by this issue.  The Attorney General will then make a decision as to whether we will have an omnibus Bill which would take all those provisions together or if they will be part of enactments of statutes from within Departments which are already on the way or being prepared.  The idea is to find the quickest and surest way of doing that, whether by omnibus Bill or to proceed in other various ways.</P>
<?oasys _cl14- ?>
        <P>Legislation is required to empower the Circuit Court to resolve disputes arising with regard to the operation and control of multi-unit developments, including existing developments.  There is the property services regulation Bill, which will be published during the autumn to <Col N="38"/>establish that regulatory authority.  It will, among other things, regulate property managing agents and set standards for the provision of property management services.</P>
        <P>Legislation is also required to specify the obligations of developers to protect the interests of purchasers of units in multi-unit developments and ensure compliance with such obligations.  There is also the making of a ministerial order to extend compulsory registration of title to multi-unit developments and the question of legislation to amend the planning and development Acts to require planning authorities to &ldquo;adhere to&rdquo; or &ldquo;substantially comply with&rdquo; relevant ministerial guidelines, rather than simply having regard to them, for example guidelines concerning the size and quality of design of new multi-unit developments.</P>
        <P>There are also statutory requirements to ensure that where property, including units in multi-unit developments, are being sold from plans, scalable drawings and measurements must be given, and the development of appropriate standard covenants for inclusion in the title deeds and conveyances of units in multi-unit developments.  I presume that will be one of the issues to be addressed in the meeting to be held between the relevant Minister and the Law Society.</P>
        <P>It is a question of pulling all those together.  Various Departments are involved, including those dealing with the environment, planning and development, as well as justice and other issues.  If the quickest way to do this is to pull this together into an omnibus Bill, it is the way we will proceed.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to implement the recommendations in the report of the independent Constituency Commission published in October 2007 on revisions to D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies.  In addition, the Bill amends the law relating to the constituency revision process and provides for the introduction of alternative procedures for the nomination of non-party candidates at European Parliament and local elections.</P>
        <P>Parts 2 and 3 of the Bill provide for implementation of the recommendations of the Constituency Commission&rsquo;s report on D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies.  In considering these parts of the Bill, it might be helpful for Members if I outline the principal constitutional and legal requirements in these matters.</P><Col N="40"/>
        <P>Article 16.2.3&deg; of the Constitution provides that &ldquo;The ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.&rdquo;  This provision was considered by the courts in two cases in 1961 &mdash; the High Court case of John O&rsquo;Donovan versus the Attorney General, and the Supreme Court reference case relating to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 1961.  It was again considered in a High Court case last year taken by Deputies McGrath and Murphy where it was argued that the constituencies on which the general election was being fought did not comply with the constitutional requirement contained in that Article.  In none of these cases did the courts quantify the precise degree of equality of representation required by the Constitution.</P>
        <P>Examples of significant disparities in terms of population to seat ratio, which exist at present based on census 2006, include: 21% above the national average in Dublin West; 18% above the national average in Dublin North; 14% above the national average in Meath East; and 10% below the national average in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.</P>
        <P>Article 16.2.4&deg; of the Constitution provides that &ldquo;The Oireachtas shall revise the constituencies at least once in every twelve years, with due regard to changes in distribution of the population&rdquo;.  This, in effect, requires that the constituencies be revised whenever population changes, as shown in a census, lead to population to Deputy ratios in individual constituencies that are significantly out of line with the national average.  That is the case at present and the Oireachtas must respond accordingly.</P>
        <P>Section 5 of the Electoral Act 1997 provides that on publication of the relevant CSO report on a census, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government must set up a commission to report on D&aacute;il and European constituencies.  The terms of reference of the commission are specified in the Act, which are, of course, subordinate to the relevant constitutional provisions.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>As Deputies will be aware, for more than half a century after the founding of the State, changes in constituencies were formulated and advanced by the Government of the day.  The first Constituency Commission was established in 1977 to report on constituencies for the direct elections to the European Parliament in 1979.  The first D&aacute;il Constituency Commission was established in 1980 on a non-statutory basis and such commissions continued to report on constituency revisions until the enactment of the Electoral Act 1997.  The commission which reported in October 2007 is the third statutory commission established under the Act.</P>
        <P>Volume 1 of the 2006 census reports was published in April 2007.  This showed an increase in total population from 2002 of more than 322,000, giving a total 2006 population in the State of 4.24 million.  In 2006, therefore, each of the 166 Deputies represented an average of 25,541 persons.</P>
        <P>As I indicated, the detailed population figures for each constituency showed there were serious variances from the national average population per Deputy in a number of constituencies.  Nineteen constituencies had variances from national average representation in excess of 5% and 11 had deviations in excess of 8%.  The most under-represented constituencies were Dublin West and Dublin North with variances of +21% and +18% respectively.  The most over-represented constituencies were D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Cork North-Central with variances of -10% each.  Clearly, significant changes have become necessary in some areas to secure equality of representation between constituencies based on the 2006 census.</P>
        <P>In accordance with section 5 of the 1997 Act, a Constituency Commission was established in April 2007, chaired by Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O&rsquo;Neill.  The other members of the commission <Col N="41"/>were Mr. Kieran Coughlan, Clerk of the D&aacute;il, Ms Deirdre Lane, Clerk of the Seanad, Ms Geraldine Tallon, Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, the Ombudsman.  I thank the commission members for the conscientious and impartial manner in which they carried out their work.</P>
        <P>The main features of the Constituency Commission&rsquo;s report in relation to D&aacute;il constituencies are as follows.  First, there is to be no change in the current level of D&aacute;il membership, that is, 166 seats.  Second, the total number of constituencies is to remain at 43 and no change should be made in 19 constituencies.  Third, the Louth and Dublin West constituencies are to increase by one seat and changes are to be made in the areas covered by the constituencies.  Fourth, the D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Limerick East constituencies are to be reduced by one seat, with the latter constituency to be renamed as Limerick City, and there are to be changes in the areas covered by the constituencies.  Fifth, the area and name of two constituencies, Kerry North and Limerick West, should be amended to Kerry North-West Limerick and Limerick, respectively.  Finally, changes, many of them small, should be made to the area of 18 other constituencies.</P>
        <P>The main features of the Constituency Commission&rsquo;s report in relation to European Parliament constituencies are, in the context of 12 Irish members of the Parliament, a reduction of a seat in the Dublin constituency and the transfer of the population of counties Longford and Westmeath from the East to the North-West constituency.</P>
        <P>The Government has accepted the Constituency Commission&rsquo;s recommendations as a single package of interlinked measures bringing D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies into line with prevailing population patterns, in accordance with constitutional imperatives and other legal requirements.  We all recognise that it may have been possible for the Constituency Commission to suggest solutions other than those recommended in the report and I appreciate fully the concerns that arise, including those relating to breaches of county boundaries.  However, the commission has completed its work in accordance with its statutory terms of reference and its independent determination of the issues should now be respected.  By cherry-picking individual recommendations, we would undermine the reasons for establishing an independent commission in the first place.  It is the Government&rsquo;s firm view that the precedent of adhering to the Constituency Commission&rsquo;s advice should be followed.</P>
        <P>Part 4 of the Bill revises the procedures to be followed by Constituency Commissions.  In terms of the form of this element of the Bill, I decided that in view of the importance of these procedures, the amendments should be made by way of repeal and re-enactment with amendment of the full part of the Electoral Act 1997 dealing with the constituency revision process.  In this way, Members, in considering the Bill and other subsequent Bills, will be able to see in one place the full text of the law relating to a Constituency Commission.</P>
        <P>As regards substance, most of the existing law in this area is being retained.  The main change is that future commissions will be established on publication by the Central Statistics Office, following a census of population, of the census report setting out the preliminary result of the census in respect of the total population of the State.  In addition, a commission will have to report as soon as may be after publication by the CSO of the census report setting out the final result of the census in respect of the total population of the State, in any event not later than three months after such publication.  Previously, commissions had to await final results before starting work and then had six months to complete their task.</P>
        <P>This change responds fully to the High Court judgment in the Murphy and McGrath case in June 2007 in which the court concluded that, having regard to the constitutional requirements and high quality of CSO preliminary population data, consideration should be given to initiation of constituency revisions on publication of the CSO preliminary report on a census, <Col N="42"/>with the revision work being completed when the final data are available.  This is an important new provision and I hope it will be welcomed on all sides.</P>
        <P>I am also taking the opportunity to update and improve the consultation processes followed by a Constituency Commission in the course of its work.  The Bill requires a commission to allow at least three months for the making of submissions to it.  At present, a commission has discretion as to the length of time allowed and this is inevitably influenced by the six months&rsquo; time limit on a commission to produce its report.  With future commissions commencing work on the basis of preliminary data, greater time can be now made available for consultation with interested organisations and individuals.  I have made specific provision for this in the Bill to ensure a fuller opportunity for political and wider public input to the revision process.</P>
        <P>The Bill also expressly provides that background information statements prepared by the Constituency Commission are to be made available free of charge.  Previous provision that fees had to be paid to obtain copies of submissions made to a commission has been replaced by a requirement that they also are to be made available free of charge.  A requirement in the existing law regarding physical inspection of submissions at specified times and places has been revised to allow the commission to decide on the detailed arrangements for making these publicly available.  In this way, best use can be made, for example, of the Internet to give people access to submissions.</P>
        <P>Taken together, these are significant and worthwhile improvements to the consultation processes followed by Constituency Commissions during the course of their work.  However, the essential features of commission procedures which have operated effectively over many years are retained.</P>
        <P>This Part also updates both fines provisions in sections 14 and 15 of the 1997 Act and references in the law to specific offices and other legislation which have changed in the decade since the Act came into operation.</P>
        <P>The final elements of the Bill, Parts 5 and 6, provide alternative procedures for nomination of non-party candidates at European Parliament and local elections.  The need for alternative procedures for nomination of such candidates arises from a judgment of the Supreme Court in November 2006 in the cases of King, Cooney and Riordan <i>v</i>. the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Attorney General and others.</P>
        <P>The judgment in question deals with the assentor requirements for the nomination of D&aacute;il candidates who are not members of registered political parties.  In particular, the court upheld the main requirement for obtaining assentors to help ensure the proper regulation of elections but struck down the provision requiring personal attendance by all assentors at a single location in a constituency on the basis that it can involve excessive demands on the time of such assentors.  The court found that the provision is disproportionate to the objective to be achieved, namely, the due authentication of nomination papers, and declared the relevant section of the Electoral Act 1992 to be unconstitutional.</P>
        <P>The implications of the Supreme Court judgment were dealt with by the enactment of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2007.  Due, however, to the limited time then available and the urgent need for enactment and implementation before the 2007 general election, the text of the Act provided for alternative nomination procedures &mdash; deposits or assents &mdash; for non-party candidates at D&aacute;il elections only.  Corresponding procedures for European Parliament and local elections are now required in advance of the elections next year and are included in the Bill on that basis.  The procedures proposed follow those enacted in 2007 in respect of D&aacute;il elections.</P>
        <P>Parts 5 and 6 provide for two alternative mechanisms to regulate the nomination of candidates at European Parliament and local elections who are not in possession of certificates of <Col N="43"/>political affiliation.  These are: by way of assents, requiring the completion of statutory declarations &mdash; 60 in the case of European Parliament elections and 15 in respect of local elections &mdash; by assentors in the constituency or local electoral area, as appropriate, which may be witnessed by a commissioner for oaths, a peace commissioner, a notary public, a garda or a local authority official; or by way of the candidate, or someone on his or her behalf, lodging a deposit with the returning officer &mdash; &euro;1,800 for European Parliament elections, &euro;100 in the case of the election of members of a county or city council or &euro;50 in the case of any other local election.</P>
        <P>The nomination procedures for candidates not in possession of certificates of political affiliation standing at European Parliament and local elections are being brought into line with the procedures in place for such candidates at D&aacute;il elections.  This alignment of the nomination procedure represents a necessary improvement on the previous arrangements and fully meets the relevant constitutional requirements.</P>
        <P>Part 6 makes the required amendments to nomination procedures by way of substituting new articles in the local election regulations.  Since the publication of the Bill, I have been advised by the Attorney General that, consistent with developments in the law relating to the use of primary and secondary legislation, it is desirable to supplement these proposed regulations with corresponding principles and policies in the parent primary legislation &mdash; in this instance, the Local Government Act 2001.  I will, therefore, be bringing forward a limited number of amendments on Committee Stage for this purpose.  It is important to emphasise that these additions to the Bill will not change the substance of the new nomination procedures at local elections and are designed solely to give fuller legal effect to the proposals already contained in the Bill.</P>
        <P>Members will recall that when I made a statement regarding the Constituency Commission report in the House on 28 May last, I stressed the importance of maintaining the long-established practice of implementing the recommendations of constituency commissions in full.  The Bill before the House does this.  The Government and I believe that this is the correct approach.  The Bill also brings forward significant and worthwhile improvements to the processes followed by constituency commissions in their work, as well as putting in place measures to facilitate the holding of the upcoming European and local elections.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2008 on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.  However, I am somewhat disappointed that we are not engaging in a debate on the economy.  I am of the view that it would have been a great deal more appropriate to discuss the state of the economy rather than this Bill.</P>
        <P>The Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2008 aims to bring into law the Constituency Commission&rsquo;s report on how D&aacute;il and European Parliament election constituencies should be drawn for the immediate future.  The commission&rsquo;s report &mdash; an 84-page document &mdash; was compiled by people who are apolitical and who went about their work in a clearly defined manner set down by the Oireachtas.  The commission was led by Mr. Justice O&rsquo;Neill, a judge of the High Court, and included among its membership the Clerk of the D&aacute;il and his counterpart in the Seanad.  These individuals should be commended on going about their work in a professional manner and completing it within the defined guidelines set down for them.  The Constituency Commission should always remain independent.  Politicians should refrain from making public comments in respect of its report.</P>
        <P>We were obliged to wait an unnecessarily long time between the Bill&rsquo;s publication and the commencement of the debate on it.  The Constituency Commission&rsquo;s report was published in October 2007 but it is only at this late stage that we are debating the Bill.  As Deputy Hogan <Col N="44"/>stated on previous occasions, there has been an unjustifiable delay on the part of the Government and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government &mdash; who has direct responsibility for this matter &mdash; in giving effect to the recommendations of the commission.  The Minister may be in breach of constitutional law and open to challenge as a result of this delay.</P>
        <P>The Government ignored the report for almost a year.  This is despite a High Court judgment in 2007 to the effect that the Government would be obliged to implement the recommendations of the commission with minimum delay.  The latter has not happened and that is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>I made representations to the Constituency Commission in respect of my constituency, which, I am delighted to say, remains intact.  There were rumours in the media in the run up to the publication of the commission&rsquo;s report that the Dublin North-East and Dublin North-Central constituencies would be merged but this proved not to be the case.  That is a good result for public representatives and their constituents, who desire continuity and who want to enjoy the same level of service to which they have become accustomed.</P>
        <P>The constituency of Dublin North-East has been in existence since the foundation of the State and it would have been a shame if it had disappeared.  It has, however, been altered, with Edenmore, which, according to the 2006 census, has a population of 2,758 people transferring to the Dublin North-Central constituency.  However, the areas of Portmarnock, north and south, and Balgriffin, with a combined population of 9,201, have been transferred to Dublin North-East.  I welcome this development, which means that my constituency has enjoyed a net gain of 6,443 people.  The Deputies who represent Dublin North-East will be obliged to listen to the concerns of these individuals.  The people to whom I refer will expect a first-class service and will want their views to be represented in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I will be obliged to face greater challenges because I have a much larger constituency to represent and this will give rise to an increase in the number of queries and issues of concern with which I will be asked to deal.</P>
        <P>As a result of the Constituency Commission&rsquo;s report, Dublin West and Louth will gain seats.  That is fair and is in line with the increases in population in both constituencies.  However, matters will be more difficult for those Members who represent Limerick East and D&uacute;n Laoghaire because each constituency will lose a seat.  Members of the public in the latter constituencies will also encounter difficulties because their level of representation will decrease.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="4" />
        <P>Some 20 other constituencies have been revised in this report, with 19 D&aacute;il constituencies remaining unchanged.  Eleven five-seat, 15 four-seat and 17 three-seat constituencies are proposed.  Of the 20 constituencies that have changed, there is controversy, particularly in respect of County Leitrim which is unable to directly elect a Deputy because the county is divided in two.  Of the 300 submissions received by the Constituency Commission, the vast majority of the objections came from individuals in County Leitrim.</P>
        <P>There is also controversy in some other constituencies where county boundaries have been breached by the Constituency Commission in its review of constituencies.  As the Minister stated, county boundaries have been breached in Kerry-Limerick, Offaly-Tipperary and Louth-Meath.  The commission has tried to avoid this but it is inevitable due to population changes.  The national average is 25,541 people per Deputy.</P>
        <P>In regard to the European Parliament elections, the main change proposed is that the Dublin constituency will lose one seat.  That will make next year&rsquo;s election a lot more competitive.  Dublin currently has four seats but that will be reduced to three.  A transfer of population from counties Longford and Westmeath from Ireland East to Ireland North-West has been proposed in the report.</P><Col N="45"/>
        <P>Sadly, I was surprised to note that only eight public submissions were made to the Constituency Commission in advance of its report regarding the European Parliament elections.  There is a disconnect between the people and what goes on in Europe, and that was demonstrated by the result of the referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  Parties on both sides of the House need to address that in advance of next year&rsquo;s European Parliament elections.</P>
        <P>The Electoral (Amendment) Bill also includes the procedures to be followed by future Constituency Commissions.  In future, their work will begin once the census data are published, which is very welcome.  Currently, it does not happen until a much later stage in the process.  In any event, the work of the Constituency Commission must be completed within three months of the publication of the data.  This will ensure the commission report is available much sooner and that constituencies are revised on a much more regular basis.  I hope that when the next census data are published, the Government will act in a more timely manner than has happened.</P>
        <P>The Bill will also revise the procedures that were adopted in the general election in respect of the nomination of non-party candidates in European Parliament and local elections.  An independent person who is not a member of a political party needs his or her nomination paper signed by 30 people, excluding the candidate and any proposer, who are registered as D&aacute;il electors in the constituency concerned before going forward as a candidate in the general election.  European Parliament elections will now require 60 people to sign the nomination papers while 15 people will be needed to sign the papers in local elections.</P>
        <P>In lieu of obtaining assents, a candidate may choose the alternative of making a deposit which will be returned if the person receives in excess of one quarter of the quota, otherwise he or she will have to forfeit his or her deposit.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael supports the work of the Constituency Commission.  It is an independent group of people which goes about its work in a very professional manner.  It has produced this report which should be respected by all Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Our party will bring forward some amendments on Committee Stage.  We were disappointed that the Minister did not act in a much more timely manner and that the Bill was not published almost immediately after the publication of the Constituency Commission report.  We commend the Bill to the House and look forward to debating it further on Committee Stage.</P>

	<P>Having listened to the Minister and Deputy Terence Flanagan speak about this Bill and considering the D&aacute;il has been in recess for a number of months, I wondered what would I expect to hear debated in the Chamber today if I was a visitor in the Visitors Gallery.  If I was a school boy leaving the Visitors Gallery today and I asked my teacher what Members were talking about, the response would be that politicians were talking about themselves again.</P>
        <P>We are discussing an important issue but given the day that it is in it and what has happened over several months, serious questions must be asked about the priority issues for the Government.  This Bill has been doing the rounds for quite a while and the issue does not need to be resolved before Christmas.  According to everyone&rsquo;s calculations, the next general election will not take place for another four years and there may well be another census before then which will make the facts and figures over which we are deliberating today obsolete.  A school boy leaving the Visitors Gallery today would be of the impression that most of the time what happens in Leinster House has little connection to what is happening outside it.</P>
        <P>Having said that, important points need to be made about this Bill.  The Labour Party fully supports the decisions on constituency boundaries made by the commission which my Labour Party colleague, Deputy Brendan Howlin, provided for in the Electoral Act 1997.  The Govern<Col N="46"/>ment and the Oireachtas should accept the final report of the commission and enact legislation to provide for the changes recommended.  The key aspect of this is the independence of the commission, to which I will refer later.</P>
        <P>I have full confidence in the independence and integrity of the members of the commission.  However, like the rest of us, they are not infallible, which, unfortunately, some of the recommendations made in the most recent report seem to indicate.  We do not know how the commission reaches its conclusions as, quite properly, it conducts its business in private.  The current procedure is that the commission is established and given its terms of reference by the Minister.  This is based on provisions in section 6 of the Electoral Act 1997.  The commission then invites submissions from the public and interested groups and in due course it issues its final report.  There is a sequence in place that needs serious examination.  The Minister indicated the retiming of the commission in regard to the publication of the register but there are outstanding matters there.</P>
        <P>In reviewing the way in which the current system is scheduled, I strongly believe the law should be changed to allow for a two-stage process prior to finalisation of the report.  This could be done by the commission, having considered initial submissions, publishing a draft report and inviting further submissions from the public and interested parties.  That is not provided for in the Bill.</P>
        <P>There is a problem in respect of the sequence in that a <i>fait accompli</i> is being commented on by Members and the public.  I am sure the people of North Kerry and Limerick West have opinions on this.  However, there is no facility for them to give their views because the process has moved on.  If such a provision was in place, it would at least allow people, who believe a particular recommendation is illogical, as the North Kerry-Limerick West case may well be, irrational or inconsistent with the commission&rsquo;s terms of reference, to make their point.</P>

	<P>Regular internal audits are part of the normal governance process of any organisation and I am aware that, of the many internal audits carried out into both F&Aacute;S activities and projects funded by F&Aacute;S, some have shown up irregularities and possible occasions of fraud.  F&Aacute;S has referred two cases of possible fraudulent activity to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Some internal audits have also indicated areas where management or financial controls could be improved.  In my view, the process of internal audit is an important, appropriate and normal activity in any organisation.</P><Col N="47"/>
        <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General in his report on non-commercial semi-State bodies, published in May 2008, reviewed the issues raised in a specific F&Aacute;S internal audit report.  I discussed this matter with the director general of F&Aacute;S and expressed my concerns about the issues raised by both the Comptroller and Auditor General and the internal audit reports and, in particular, the need to secure value for money in public expenditure.</P>
        <P>On my instruction, the Secretary General of my Department wrote to F&Aacute;S on 30 June 2008 seeking the formal assurance of the director general of F&Aacute;S that the practices outlined in the F&Aacute;S internal and Comptroller and Auditor General audit reports had ceased; that adequate systems and controls are in place to prevent any recurrence; and requesting details of the remedial actions taken by F&Aacute;S in respect of the issues raised by the audit reports, with quarterly progress reports on the implementation of the audit reports&rsquo; recommendations.  The F&Aacute;S director general replied on 1 July 2008 confirming that the unacceptable practices referred to in the audit reports had ceased and that adequate systems and controls are now in place to prevent any recurrence.  The next quarterly report is due at the end of September.</P>
        <P>In order to address wider continuing concerns about the management and control systems in place in F&Aacute;S generally, and following further discussions with the chairman and director general of F&Aacute;S, I have also decided that there should be an external investigation into the effectiveness of the agency&rsquo;s financial management and control systems.  This examination is to ensure that appropriate public procurement procedures exist to prevent or detect irregularities or wrongdoing and, in particular, examine and report on the activities of the F&Aacute;S corporate affairs area since 2000.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has agreed to carry out such an investigation with a view to producing a special report on the matter.  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General will be furnished to me by him and will be presented by me to the D&aacute;il in accordance with standard operating procedures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her reply.  I welcome the fact that this investigation has been requested by her and that it will occur.  The response was slow, but a slow response is better than none.  At a time of rising unemployment when we have a skills mismatch between the jobs available and those without jobs, it is important we have a functioning training agency.  While many employees of F&Aacute;S do a good job and much good community work is done through the community employment, CE, schemes, it is clear that F&Aacute;S is failing as an organisation and the situation with regard to those at the top of the organisation is unsatisfactory.</P>
        <P>I have two crucial questions on the issue.  Will the Minister publish the terms of reference of the inquiry and will she assure me that it will not be limited to the corporate affairs section of F&Aacute;S?  It appears that the irregularities, problems and mismanagement of F&Aacute;S go much further than corporate affairs and I would not like to see one department of the organisation hung or scapegoated.  Will the Minister ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to look at the in-company training and services to business department of F&Aacute;S in particular?  Both Deputy Kenny and I warned the Government about the issues in F&Aacute;S a year ago, but it did not listen properly at the time.  Perhaps the Minister will listen to us now and ensure the Comptroller and Auditor General looks at that area also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have initiated an overall review of F&Aacute;S and that process has commenced.  This overall project is outside the specific remit I have asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to consider.  The Deputy is aware that matter will also be discussed at the beginning of October in the context of public accounts.  If the Comptroller and Auditor General is of the view then that there is a need to examine something further, I am sure he will take that into consideration.  There are, therefore, two processes taking place currently, one an overall review which had been considered by the previous Minister and is now under way and the other the specific inquiry on the issue mentioned.</P><Col N="48"/>
        <P>No more than all of my colleagues, I am anxious for the betterment of F&Aacute;S.  As the Deputy said, F&Aacute;S will be pivotal in supporting people who need upskilling and new employment opportunities.  Therefore, I am anxious to ensure the corporate governance issues are addressed.  Equally, I wish to ensure F&Aacute;S is given the support it requires to allow it do its work.  For that reason, my preferred option is to have a specific investigation by the Comptroller and Auditor General and until we receive the outcome of that inquiry, I prefer not to impose any restrictions on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed the investigation will be limited to corporate affairs.  The Minister can be assured that Fine Gael will continue to pursue the irregularities that are occurring in all departments of F&Aacute;S, not just that one.</P>
        <P>When we discussed the issue previously at Question Time, the Minister told us she was satisfied with the assurances given to her by the director general of F&Aacute;S and by senior management.  Is she still satisfied with the assurances she was given by them in June or, in light of her recent announcement, has her view changed?  What caused that change of view?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is nothing to lead me to believe the situation is otherwise.  The overall review of the activities of F&Aacute;S is very important and commenced in the summer of this year.  I am very anxious that review takes place in the context of deciding what the priorities of such a large organisation should be.  Our view is the priorities must be on upskilling and supporting those who have found themselves out of work.  However, in the overall context, the review of the workings of F&Aacute;S is taking place currently.</P>
        <P>On the other issue, it is important that if the Deputy has particular concerns he discusses them with me and I am available in this regard.  Neither I nor any of my colleagues will stand over the misappropriation of funds in any organisation and will work to the best of our ability to ensure this does not happen.  When issues are raised, they will be investigated thoroughly.  I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report, but if there are issues to be addressed, I will wholeheartedly address them.  F&Aacute;S has indicated it will do the same.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>What are the terms of reference for the inquiry?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not decided on the terms of reference.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is anxious to await the discussions in the House.  He would like to consider the discussions of the Committee of Public Accounts before we bring the terms of reference to a finality. </P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 113 together.</P>
        <P>The live register is not designed to measure unemployment.  It includes part-time, seasonal and casual workers entitled to unemployment benefit.  The total number of people recorded on the live register for August 2008 is 247,384, showing an increase of about 73,000 in the 12-month period.</P>
        <P>Employment and unemployment are measured by the quarterly national household survey, QNHS, and published by the Central Statistics Office.  In the second quarter of 2008, the most recent quarter for which data is available, employment has increased by 6,900 over 12 months to a current total of 2,108,500.  Unemployment increased by 15,200 in the same period to 115,500.  The unemployment rate was 5.2%, which compares favourably to the EU 27 members&rsquo; average unemployment rate of 6.8%.</P>
        <P>While the level of employment growth is disappointing, the fall in employment in the construction sector in the past year is a major factor.  The recent easing of employment growth comes after many years of extraordinary growth in the labour force and employment, which could not have lasted indefinitely.  Since the second quarter of 2005, employment has grown by 176,900 with unemployment increasing by only 29,000 in the same period.  It is generally accepted that the rate of growth in the economy and in employment experienced over the past few years could not continue.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S, as the national training and employment authority, is providing a range of proactive job-related services, supports and programmes, to assist individuals to return to the labour market.</P>
        <P>As regards the economic situation and the impact on the labour market, the focus is now on flexibility in the delivery of employment and training programmes so those who are affected by the slowdown and by unemployment can be assisted appropriately and in good time.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S and the Department of Social and Family Affairs are working together to respond quickly to the rising live register numbers.  For example, they have agreed that redundant workers will be referred immediately to F&Aacute;S rather than wait for three months on the live register as was previously the case.  F&Aacute;S has also established a training fund to enable a speedy response to identified re-training needs for low skilled and redundant craft workers.  Alongside the local employment services provided by area based partnerships, F&Aacute;S is currently gearing up its employment services to provide increased capacity for expected increased referrals from the live register.  F&Aacute;S will be providing a range of certified short, flexible and modular programmes designed to upskill redundant workers so they can enhance their prospects of securing employment.  A number of programmes are already in place and the frequency and range of these will be expanded over the coming months.  A range of actions is being implemented by F&Aacute;S for those affected by the construction slowdown, including a focus on providing retraining opportunities for redundant construction workers in emerging areas within the construction sector.  This will include retraining in the following &mdash; the installation of sustainable technologies, environmental activity and compliance and regulatory work.  F&Aacute;S will also assist individuals in any way it can to seek employment in construction in other EU countries.  F&Aacute;S has held a European construction jobs fair for employers from other EU countries.</P>
        <P>Discussions concerning the 2009 budget are ongoing.  The budget for F&Aacute;S is agreed on the basis of detailed discussions between F&Aacute;S, my Department and the Department of Finance in the context of the annual Estimates process and will be announced on budget day.  My Department is commencing a review of the labour market programmes, including training programmes, that it funds.  The review will examine these programmes in terms of efficiency and effectiveness and will draw conclusions about the adequacy and balance of resources in the <Col N="50"/>context of current and future labour market policy challenges taking into account the recommendations of the national skills strategy.</P>
        <P>The enterprise development agencies of my Department, including IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, are working to ensure that we continue to grow the economy and jobs even in the current more challenging environment.  The pipeline of new business for which IDA Ireland is competing is as strong as at any time in recent years.  To facilitate this we need to ensure that our competitiveness is sustained into the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know whether I am living on the same planet as the Government and the Minister of State.  This Government is imbued with inertia, as illustrated by the response I received today, which can be best described as lethargic and limp.  Is the Minister of State trying to tell me that the lists of people who have lost jobs in Waterford, Cappoquin, Tipperary, Tullamore, Cork and Edenderry are figments of my imagination?  I am aware that projects are in the pipeline, including one announced by the Minister in Athlone, but these have been under development for the past two years.  They did not turn up last night.</P>
        <P>The Government is aware that unemployment levels have increased significantly.  The HSE is reported to be about to shed 1,800 jobs.  Company liquidations rose by 71% during the first half of the year.  In August, 247,384 people were on the live register, which represents an increase of 73,178 on the figure for August 2007, 65,935 on the beginning of the year and 45,628 since the election of Deputy Cowen as Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister of State aware that the county enterprise boards, which have been an important stimulant for the economy at the micro level, have not had been able to spend one shilling in capital funding since April?  Is it not time to expand the remit of the boards to fill the gap between Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s activities and what the boards are permitted to do?  Let us have some innovation rather than sterility.</P>
        <P>If the Government wants to take positive action, why can it not redirect the construction sector it loves so well by bringing forward a major schools building programme?  This would give employment to those who lose their jobs in construction, provide much needed accommodation for the 40,000 children currently housed in prefabs and allow the State to offer softer tender prices and better value for money.  Why not proceed with a national insulation scheme?  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, believes such a scheme is already in place.  Talk about living in an ivory tower; the moment he gets off his bicycle he forgets where he is going.</P>
        <P>The country&rsquo;s county councils do not even have a shilling to pay disabled person grants for mobility and housing adaptation.  Small construction companies could focus on this type of project, thereby creating employment.  These grants also provided important comforts to elderly people by allowing them to stay in their own homes.</P>
        <P>Why is the IDA trying to sell lands which it bought in 1973 at the current market value to local authorities which want to develop incubator units that would stimulate the economy?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State should get on the road with new ideas and new innovation because that is what we need.  The Government is too apathetic and complacent.  Anybody can steer a ship on a calm sea but the mark of greatness is steering it through rough waters.  The Government has failed that test miserably.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and the competition in the global market for foreign direct investment.  We are competitive with other countries in terms of a flexible workforce, low corporation taxes and highly educated third-level graduates and Ireland is actively pursuing direct investment.</P>
        <P>For fear that the Deputy takes these matters for granted, it is important that we set out the success of IDA Ireland rather than talk ourselves down.  Zimmer Holdings, a global leader in medical devices, is establishing a new &euro;88 million manufacturing operations base in Shannon, County Clare and is expected to create 250 jobs.  This is a collaborative effort between IDA Ireland and Shannon Development.  Unum is establishing a strategic software centre in Carlow town with the support of IDA Ireland.  This investment will create up to 200 high level positions.  Citco fund services is to expand its Cork city hedge fund administrative operations, which will create 150 jobs over the next three years.  Ely Lilly is to invest up to &euro;400 million in a multi-phase programme to establish a bio-pharmaceutical development and manufacturing facility in Kinsale.  This investment will bring up to 200 jobs over the next five years.  Genzyme, a leading global biotechnology company, is to invest &euro;130 million at its Irish operations plant in Waterford.  This investment will create 170 highly skilled positions and significantly increase the manufacturing capacity of the facility over the next three years.  It is important that we outline the success of the IDA in actively encouraging FDI.</P>
        <P>When Ministers go abroad, we actively sell Ireland as a place that is open and flexible, with the capacity to receive direct investment.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, has met representatives of Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards.  At present, 56 community enterprise applications are being assessed, which is a substantial number.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to focus on the quarterly national household study to which the Minister of State referred.  The study has revealed an increase of 6,900 in employment over the past 12 months.  However, if the figures are studied in detail, the number of Irish nationals in employment has dropped by 14,800, while employment of non-Irish nationals has increased by 21,500.  Is the Minister aware that, at present, non-nationals are out-competing Irish nationals in the employment sector?  In manufacturing, for example, there is a 12.6% differential between Irish and non-Irish employment rates.  The figure is 12.4% for the wholesale and retail sector and, amazingly, in the construction sector the differential is 12.8%.  Part of this is a result of immigrants improving their language skills and moving up the value chain within employment.  That is a positive element in our economy.  However, there are underlying concerns that must be addressed.</P>
        <P>Does the Government have plans to examine those underlying trends and carry out an investigation into the reason for them?  Is it the case, for example, that Irish people are not applying for those jobs or are they not getting the jobs for one reason or other, perhaps because they do not have the appropriate skills?  Is it the case that the jobs are being created in parts of the country that do not suit the Irish workforce &mdash; the migrant workforce is more flexible in moving around the country &mdash; or is it due to the work patterns available?  It is critical that this trend is examined.  We must ensure that indigenous employees can compete effectively for those jobs.  As migrants move up the value chain due to their improving language skills and qualifications, it is important that we ensure Irish workers actively compete for employment.</P>

	<P>Some years ago the Government &mdash; the Irish people endorsed the decision subsequently in a general election &mdash; opened up our labour market.  Is the Deputy implying that we should have a green card system for other EU citizens to work here or <i>vice versa</i>?</P>

	<P>I am asking a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>In the event of an Irish person wishing to work in another European country, should there be stipulations and regulations on their access to that labour market?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister afraid to answer the question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an integral part of the EU.  With regard to immigrants to this country, employers are obliged to comply with employment law.  Every employee is entitled to a minimum wage.  Where there are employment regulation orders, EROs, or registered employment agreements, REAs, the employer is obliged to pay the rate that is struck and lodged before the Labour Court.  If there is exploitation, it is an offence under labour law.  We have increased the number of labour inspectors and established the National Employment Rights Authority to ensure that workers, regardless of whether they are Irish or non-nationals, receive the going rates of the labour market as lodged before the Labour Court either in the REAs or EROs.  We would be concerned if there was exploitation of any individual.</P>
        <P>With regard to students, the Government would obviously be concerned if the primary purpose of students coming to this country was not to learn a language but to work.  We are conscious of this issue and examining it very seriously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister carry out an investigation?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>An investigation is not needed; what is needed is action, and there will be plenty of that from this side of the House.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest> if a speech (details supplied) reflected her views; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[31095/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the remarks to which the Deputy refers are those concerning reform of the public sector contained in the speech delivered by my colleague on 12 September.  The Minister of State, Deputy John McGuinness, has made it clear that the remarks as delivered reflected his own personal views.  The views expressed are some of many sets of views as to how the public sector should be conducting its business on behalf of the taxpayer in 2008 and beyond.</P>
        <P>The Government has listened to views from all sides of public sector reform debate and decided on a course of action that involved asking the OECD to undertake a review of the Irish public sector.  The OECD Report on Public Sector Reform, which was launched in April of this year, contains a set of key recommendations that we have committed to implement.  We have established a task force, whose membership includes respected figures from the private sector, to drive this agenda and I, together with my colleagues in government, will not be found wanting should difficult decisions on reform be required.</P>
        <P>It is my view and experience that there are many excellent people working within the public service, many of whom receive modest salaries in return for a lifetime of service to the public.  That said, real problems exist.  There is a need for more flexibility in the delivery of services to the public, much greater efficiency and better value for money and for further modernisation of systems and working practices.  The OECD&rsquo;s report reflects my views.  It recognises the value of the extensive reform efforts undertaken to date in customer service, e-Government, human resources, financial management and better regulation.  Implementation of the quality customer service programme has brought about improvements visible to citizens.  The performance management development system, PMDS, has resulted in better functioning individual organisations.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding these improvements and reforms, the OECD clearly identified the challenges that remain.  It indicates that if we can better sequence future reforms, we can further improve performance and service delivery and achieve greater efficiencies.  Furthermore, many of the reform initiatives we have introduced to date have focused largely on the Civil Service, which represents only one tenth of the public sector, as opposed to the broader public service.  The public sector needs continuously to review its systems, processes and procedures to ensure that it is responsive and efficient and that it provides high quality, value for money services.  In other words, citizens need to be sure that the public service will deliver the services they expect when, where and as needed.</P>
        <P>The OECD&rsquo;s message is clear, as is mine.  We must put the public at the centre of our public services.  That is our ambition in government and it is at the core of how we are approaching the process of public sector reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a shameful and broad-brushed attack on the Civil Service and public service.  The majority of public servants are decent, hard working people, some of whom are on pitifully low wages and struggling to survive.  Clerical officers are an example.  Of course, there is an urgent need for public service reform.  Everybody knows that and public and civil servants accept it.  However, while this slash and burn approach might garner some kudos for the Minister in the right wing press and among right wing commentators, it contributes nothing to the debate about public sector reform.</P><Col N="54"/>
        <P>Many civil servants are stretched to their limits.  Does the Minister realise that the Department of Social and Family Affairs is struggling to cope with the collapse in employment and the growth in the live register to the extent that there are 38,000 applications for unemployment benefit still to be processed?  The Department does not have enough personnel.  I have some specific questions for the Minister.  Will she outline what changes she has made in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment since she took office?  Does she agree with the Minister of State&rsquo;s remarks and do they apply to her Department?  Is she satisfied that each of the agencies under her remit are, first, value for money; second, being run effectively and, third, well managed?  If so, is the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, simply looking for favourable headlines?  Has the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech been discussed at the Department&rsquo;s internal management meetings?</P>
        <P>Is the Minister of State talking about cutting the home help service, families&rsquo; front-line nursing services, the national educational psychological service or the number of local authority workers, who have already been slashed with the 3% payroll cuts?  A number of those workers will be gone and the public will soon realise it when services will no longer be available.  Is the Minister talking about cutting the number of garda&iacute;?</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s party has been in government since 1997.  What tangible changes have been implemented since then?  If there have been changes, about what is the Minister of State complaining?  If there have not been practical changes, why not?</P>

	<P>That is efficiency.  Some of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions were addressed to me in my role as T&aacute;naiste as opposed to my role as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It is important that there is balance in this area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>My experience in the pay talks categorically shows there is an attitudinal change by employers, unions, politicians and the people who work in the public service.  We must deal with productivity and flexibility issues; that is the only way services can be provided.  There is an acceptance of that.  It is hoped that, on the basis of discussions by the unions and employers, we will have agreement on the pay talks, although I do not wish to pre-empt them.  </P>
        <P>As regards the agencies and changes within the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I have met many of the people who work for me and with me.  I agree with the Deputy, as I stated in my reply, that the work of many people in the public service goes well beyond the financial retribution they are paid because they are part of the public service.  Equated to this is a need to ensure flexibility and change.</P>
        <P>There is an old saying that one should never ask somebody to do something one would not do oneself.  I will be working with officials in my Department to ensure we are receiving value for money, are flexible and are changing and evolving.  Reform is about evolving.  The Deputy will be aware that the Taoiseach is, as are all Members, committed to public service reform.  It is in the context outlined that my Department and agencies will participate in this reform.</P><Col N="55"/>

      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree with the statement made by the Minister of State, Deputy John McGuinness?  If so, what practical actions will she take?  If the Minister does not agree with him, she should say so.  </P>
        <P>I would like to know if it is the position of the leading party in Government that the public service is responsible for the condition of the economy.</P>

	<P>A final brief reply from the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is hard to answer that question.  At the end of the day, the Deputy knows full well that is not the situation.  With all due respect, I do not have the time to get into the complexities of why we are experiencing economic difficulties.  </P>
        <P>It is important to say that the views expressed are my personal views, some of which have been reflected by people outside and within this House.  In my view we need public sector reform.  Those within the public sector agree we need that reform and are more than happy to work towards achieving it.  Arising from the OECD recommendations, we will be taking action, unpalatable or otherwise.</P>
        <P>Deputy Penrose will agree that there are those within the public sector who are wrongly vilified and who do not get the support they need for the work they do.  We need to take a balanced approach to this issue.  As I stated earlier, it is about taking people along, working with them and showing the political leadership to allow that to happen.  That is the format on which this will done.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>F&Aacute;S as an agency of my Department operates two employment schemes, community employment and job initiative.</P><Col N="56"/>
        <P>Community employment is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.  The programme helps unemployed people to progress to the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine and assists them in enhancing-developing their technical and personal skills.</P>
        <P>The job initiative programme provides full-time employment for people who are 35 years of age or over, unemployed for five or more years and in receipt of social welfare payments during that period.  The main purpose of the programme is to assist long-term unemployed people to prepare for work opportunities by providing participants with work experience, training and development opportunities.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to create another employment programme.  However, F&Aacute;S is working to quickly respond to the changing employment market.  In regard to the construction sector, where we have witnessed a substantial number of redundancies during the past 12 months, the Government will continue to work with all of the relevant stakeholders to ensure timely and satisfactory responses to the adjustments taking place.  This will include the continued provision of a range of training opportunities for those who lose their jobs in the construction sector.  F&Aacute;S will also provide retraining to redundant workers in emerging areas of the construction sector which are experiencing growth such as environmental related activity; compliance and regulatory related work; waste management activity; and sustainable energy systems installation.  The Government will also continue to promote access for mobile workers to construction jobs elsewhere in the EU.</P>
        <P>As regards planned capital infrastructure projects, I would expect that it would be open to unemployed workers to apply for any vacant positions with the relevant contractors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot thank the Minister of State for his reply as it is not the reply I wanted to hear.  I am shocked that there are no new initiatives in this area.  The first part of the reply referred to schemes already in place.  I and everybody else knows what schemes are already in place.  I am disappointed with the Minister of State&rsquo;s response to this issue which I have raised at committee level, with F&Aacute;S and with other agencies.  I am asking that the Minister and Ministers of State use their imagination &mdash; this is not rocket science &mdash; and come up schemes that will match up across various Departments unemployed, well-skilled people with jobs.  How hard can that be?  Doing so would be more or less cost neutral given the high cost, social and financial, of unemployment.  </P>
        <P>There is much work to be done in our communities.  Many train stations, bus stations and schools are in disrepair and in need of serious maintenance.  There is an endless amount of work that could be done during these bad times.  This would ensure those who want to work get work.  All I am asking is that people use their imaginations.  I hope I will hear within the next month or so that the Department has some new ideas in this regard.  I was told by F&Aacute;S officials at a committee meeting that they would look into this but they had no answers for me some two months later.  More than 70,000 or 80,000 people have joined the dole queues.  These people are skilled and available to work.  What plans are there to match up these people with jobs?  I accept a great deal is being done in respect of training.</P>
        <P>I hope that the Minister of State can tell me that he and his colleagues are prepared to work during the next couple of months on some new ideas in respect of unemployment relief schemes.  Let us try to match up people with work that needs to be done.  There are dark times ahead and we should try to prepare for them.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="57"/>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for his suggestions.  It is important to stress again that F&Aacute;S, because of the downturn in the construction industry in particular, is actively engaged in meeting people who have been, unfortunately, made redundant and providing them with a personal work programme to assist them in returning to employment.  All of the suggestions made must be considered in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>
        <P>The Government is open to new ideas and if Deputy English has any, he should put them forward for consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no problem putting forward ideas and I will do so.  I have set them out for the Minister of State.  Many people are awaiting the commencement of work under the disabled persons and essential repairs grants schemes, schools are awaiting assistance under the summer work schemes and many of our train stations and bus stations are in need of serious repair.  I have raised this issue at committee level where we are supposed to do good work on a cross-party basis.  Why can we not match up, through the local authorities and F&Aacute;S, unemployed people with work in these areas.  I accept what is required is a type of voluntary scheme but it must be an attractive one.  Surely, it would not be that hard to do this.  </P>
        <P>I raised this issue with the Department more than a month ago.  I will forward detailed plans in this regard if the Minister of State so wishes.  I hope the Minister of State can tell me that he and his colleagues have an open mind on this issue.  The community employment scheme deals with long-term unemployed people and does not suit everybody.  I am asking for a new scheme similar to those in operation in other countries and in Northern Ireland.  All I am asking is that we try something.</P>

        <Quest> if she has been in contact with the National Consumer Agency to establish an alternative dispute resolution procedure as a means of resolving disputes arising out of consumer transactions; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>The statutory mandate of the National Consumer Agency as prescribed under the Consumer Protection Act 2007 specifically includes promoting the development of alternative dispute resolution, ADR, procedures as a means of resolving disputes arising out of consumer transactions.</P><Col N="58"/>
        <P>Currently one of the procedures most used by consumers for achieving redress is the Small Claims Court procedure. The Small Claims Court procedure provides an inexpensive, fast and easy way for consumers to resolve disputes without the need to employ a solicitor.  Since 2006, the Small Claims Court operates an on-line dispute resolution procedure where claims can be filed on-line.  The limit for processing claims in the Small Claims Court was raised to &euro;2,000 with effect from 7 February 2006.</P>
        <P>A further development in the small claims area was the adoption last year of an EU regulation establishing a European small claims procedure.  The regulation will effectively enable a judgment given in a member state in the European small claims procedure to be recognised and enforced in another member state.  I am advised that as part of an overall study in the area of arbitration and redress the National Consumer Agency will later this year, in conjunction with the Courts Service, consider the Small Claims Court and in particular the difficulties consumers can experience in enforcing the judgments of the court.</P>
        <P>The agency has also recently developed a code of practice, with the Irish Home Builders Association, to be followed by developers in the development, interim management and sale of multi-unit development properties.  The code includes specific provisions for dispute resolution and redress and urges unit owners and developers to use alternative out-of-court mechanisms for resolving disputes.</P>
        <P>Europe has been a major catalyst in the development of extra-judicial options for dispute resolution.  Much of the work in this area has been focused on ensuring that European citizens have access to cheaper, quicker and more informal dispute resolution mechanisms, thereby enabling them to better reap the benefits of the Single Market.  In the specific area of disputes relating to consumer transactions, the European Consumer Centres Network is a network of centres established by the European Commission together with the member states which, among other things, promotes ADR schemes.</P>
    
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></P>
        <P>The European Consumer Centre in Dublin is funded jointly by the National Consumer Agency and the European Commission.  Irish consumers who have a dispute with a retailer in another member state, or consumers in other member states who have a dispute with an Irish retailer, can contact the centre, which seeks to resolve such disputes in co-operation with experts in European Consumer Centres across the European Union.  If the centre cannot find a remedy through direct intervention it will seek to assist the parties in taking their disputes to an appropriate ADR body.</P>
        <P>The European Commission has promulgated a number of recommendations in an effort to provide a common minimum European standard for ADR schemes.  The recommendations set out the standards and principles which should apply to bodies involved in out-of-court settlement and consensual resolution of consumer disputes.  The Commission maintains a database of the various ADR bodies in the member states which subscribe to these principles.  My Department is responsible for notifying bodies in Ireland to the Commission for inclusion in its database and has notified four such bodies to the Commission to date.</P>
        <P>In the area of cross-border disputes, a European directive on certain aspects of mediation in civil and commercial matters was promulgated in May this year.  This directive is essentially intended to provide a framework to allow parties to a cross-border dispute to attempt to reach an amicable settlement of their dispute with the help of a mediator.  The directive must be transposed into Irish law by May 2011.  My Department will work closely with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which has overall responsibility for its transposition, on <Col N="59"/>those aspects of the directive relating to cross-border consumer disputes.  At a national level, the Law Reform Commission launched a consultation paper on ADR on 30 July this year.  The consultation paper contains a significant number of proposals for promoting ADR as a means of resolving disputes, including a number of specific proposals with regard to consumer disputes.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will see from the foregoing that a considerable number of initiatives are being undertaken at national and European level in promoting ADR as a means of resolving consumer disputes.  ADR offers a considerable advantage by providing parties with a ready and relatively inexpensive means of resolving disputes.  I am confident that through the work of the National Consumer Agency and the progression of the aforementioned initiatives, ADR will become a more accepted and mainstream means of resolving consumer disputes.</P>
  </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his answer.  I was not really asking about cross-border trade and disputes but about the existing section 8(3) of the Consumer Protection Act, which provides a mandate for the National Consumer Agency to promote and even establish alternative means of dispute resolution between consumers and, for example, retailers.  There are two things that can be done in this regard.  Does the Minister of State agree that the upper limit for a small claim, which is &euro;2,000, should be increased?  Almost any significant purchase, such as a suite of furniture or a foreign holiday, will be more than &euro;2,000, and if there is a dispute one must then go to a higher court.  Does the Minister of State not agree that this threshold should be increased so that consumers who have been ripped off by slightly more than &euro;2,000 can have recourse to the Small Claims Court?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister consider asking the National Consumer Agency to introduce a system of dispute resolution and arbitration for consumers, similar to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board?  Thus the consumer agency itself could take on the job of arbitrating disputes between consumers and those against whom they are making complaints.  This is provided for in the Act; it just requires a bit of leadership to implement it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>It is in the Act.  The Law Reform Commission suggested that the limit be increased from &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,000 and the Minister continues to review such suggestions in the context of these claims.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>How long will she review it for?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>The court has been functioning very well.  It is used widely and is becoming more accessible to the public as they can lodge their claims on-line.  If we continue with our reviews, we can keep pace with what is required by the consumer.  The system is effective.  I do not see a role for the agency, as the Deputy suggests.  Why create another model when the current one is functioning well?  All it requires is to be reviewed from time to time and the Department and the Government are committed to ensuring that occurs.  The upper limit of &euro;2,000 can be reviewed again if necessary.</P>

	<P>That is efficiency.</P>
        <P>The report of the high level group has identified more than &euro;20 million in cost savings to business as a result of simplified administrative procedures of Government.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment is to reduce the administrative burden on Irish business by 25% by 2012 and this demanding target is a key priority.  The task of the high level group is to identify areas in which legislation has imposed an administrative burden, or red tape, on business and to recommend ways to reduce that burden without undermining the policy objectives behind the regulation.  The work of the group is focused on concrete measures in specific policy areas, including taxation, statistics, environment, health and safety, employment and company law.  The first report of the group sets out a number of instances in which procedures have been simplified, making it easier for business to deal with Government; for example, electronic filing of annual returns to the Companies Registration Office, on-line access to tax clearance certificates for Government contracts, increased exemption thresholds for VAT registration, and higher thresholds exempting small businesses from having to conduct statutory audits.  In addition, further changes to reduce the burden on business are expected with regard to procedures for waste collection permits, road haulage permits and employment permits.</P>
        <P>The work of the high level group is estimated to have saved Irish business &euro;20 million in administrative costs this year through reductions in paperwork, revision of the rules for small businesses and provision for better use of on-line services.  The rolling programme of work set out by the group must continue to be ambitious and I look forward to its continued work on the concrete suggestions put forward by the business sector.  If the work of the group is to produce optimal benefits, businesses, especially small business, must continue to come forward with practical proposals for areas in which they feel the burden is greatest.  Small businesses in particular have a lot to gain from participating in this process and making known areas in which they feel over-burdened by red tape.  I encourage the business representatives on the high level group to continue to inform its work.</P>
        <P>In addition to the work of the high level group, my Department has put in place a process across all Departments that will measure the administrative cost of red tape on business arising from domestic legislation.  As in all other countries that have done this, it will take about a year and a half to complete the measurement process.  In line with the recommendation of the Business Regulation Forum, we are adopting a prioritised approach.  Initially, all Departments are required to list the information obligations which their regulations impose on business.  Based on that listing, Departments will assess, in consultation with business, the most burdensome requirements and will measure their actual cost to business.  At that point, the most appropriate approach to achieving the Government target of reducing by 25% the administrative burden of domestic regulation on business by 2012 will be determined.  With regard to future regulations, the Government has agreed that all Departments should measure the admin<Col N="62"/>istrative costs of regulations on business and specifically examine the impact on small businesses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy that we now have a target of 25% in reducing the administrative cost of regulation.  This target does not have to be met until, I assume, the end of 2012.  Does the Minister of State not think there is a good case for having an interim target?  The Minister could report back early next year and tell us how far we have come in achieving the 25% reduction.  In this way we will not have to wait until 2012 for the Government to tell us it has not succeeded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>A review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps an annual review would be appropriate.</P>
        <P>How will the baseline calculation for the cost of regulation be assessed?  What model will be used?  Before something can be reduced by 25% there must be a model to work out what 100% is.  How will that assessment be made and when?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>In answer to the first part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, a reduction of 25% by 2012 is a target, but there is nothing to say we cannot meet the target prior to that date.  I have carried out the assessment and the analysis.  I have met the business organisations and I understand clearly what they are saying.  They have made their submissions and in line with these we will consider a cost-effective way of delivering a smaller burden from Government.  For example, let us consider the range of forms that must be filled in for the Central Statistics Office.  I have met officials from the Central Statistics Office and have reviewed its forms.  I have engaged with the SFA and tried in turn to translate that in a different simplified way to determine whether it would assist business.  I have invited and have met the business organisations in recent months to determine if we can identify other areas that will assist.  In line with what Deputy Penrose said county enterprise boards are significant players in this matter as they engage with the SME sector.  I have used them as an information base to ascertain what is causing the difficulty for small businesses in particular.  Legislation is often passed by this House and the one size does not fit all.  We need to take an overview of that in light of the tight economic circumstances we are experiencing.  We need to try to release the SME sector to do more important business in the real world to create the jobs and profitability they desire.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I might have disagreed with the broad thrust of what the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, said in his previous statement.  However, I am totally <i>ad idem</i> with him on this matter.  The Minister of State should slash and burn all the bureaucracy and he will have my full support.</P>

	<P>There will be no lawyers left.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what we want to do &mdash; eliminate them from it altogether.  In businesses there is the possibility of 100 different forms ranging from seven or eight pages up to 80 pages.  The Minister of State is on the right track, and as he has a business acumen and background I expect him to be able to get it right.  He recognises that businesses are significant collectors of taxes, including VAT, PAYE etc.  Is it not time for entrepreneurs and proprietors of small businesses to get an allowance similar to the PAYE allowance?  There needs to be some collection.  Some accountants are there specifically to deal with the forms that exist.  There <Col N="63"/>are up to 1,000 different legislative provisions that are complex, some of them in the one Act.  They impact on health and safety, company registration offices, the CSO etc.  Businesses are compelled to reply to these.  I have seen it with our own little shop.  We are required to comply or they come back again.  I often wonder why it collects information.  However, that is neither here nor there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>They are used in answer to parliamentary questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>Would the Minister of State consider introducing a red tape index in each Department and across Departments?  This would allow for an instant review every three or four months.  Some people believe the red tape simply exists and we cannot think outside the box.  It is time to think outside the box of bureaucracy.  I attended the Westmeath County Enterprise Board presentation last Friday week.  The Minister of State is correct about the importance of county and city enterprise boards.  While foreign direct investment and the work of IDA Ireland are very important, it is at a micro level that we will get over the hump.  I ask the Minister of State to eliminate as much red tape as possible.  He should slash and burn.  He will be a hero if he does.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know about being a hero.  However, all great truths begin as blasphemies according to George Bernard Shaw.  If the Deputy read my speech he would realise there is not a great difference between any sides in this House &mdash; all we want is the best for the country.</P>
        <P>Deputy Varadkar asked about a measurement.  While it cannot be answered simply as part of the response to this parliamentary question, a measurement exists and I will make the details known to him.  However, if a greater efficiency can be achieved in measuring or identifying the red tape, I would gladly support any measure within the Department to drastically reduce red tape particularly in the SME sector which needs to be released.  I am a practising businessman and understand the complications arising from the need for transparency, reporting etc.  However, it must be simplified.  I encourage the Deputy and small businesses that are interested in the matter to engage with the Department.  The T&aacute;naiste and all the Ministers of State in the Department are anxious to achieve what is best to allow business to operate in a simpler way so people can get on with performing on the front line rather than coming back late at night to complete forms.  Any suggestions will be gratefully received.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the sincerity of the Minister of State in this matter given his background in business.  However, I do not believe he answered either of my questions which I will ask again.  Would he agree it would be appropriate to have an interim target of, for example, 10% by the end of next year so we can review the progress he is making on an annual basis rather than waiting until the end of 2012 to see if he has achieved anything?  The Minister of State said there is a calculation.  I do not believe there is.  I would be very interested to find out as soon as he can inform us what the monetary calculated cost of the administrative burden of regulation to business is and the model used to assess that.  I doubt that is being done, but if it is I would like to hear the figure or even a ballpark figure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>A standard cost model exists and there is a model that is also implemented in other countries, for example the Netherlands.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>However, the Government has not used the standard cost model.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>I will make it available to the Deputy so he can fully understand it and will be able to question me on its specifics without any difficulty.  I answered his first question.  I told him that the target was 25% by 2012 and that my ambition is to reach that <Col N="64"/>target much sooner than 2012 so the Deputy and other Members of the Opposition can measure it as we go along.  To reach that target much earlier than the date we specified requires co-operation with the business sector and all agencies and Departments.  We are committed to doing it and I will gladly report back to the Deputy in a year, in two years or in six months.  I hope to make it better for business.  That is my ambition within the Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>I like quite a lot of the Minister of State&rsquo;s speeches so far &mdash; although not all of them.  Hopefully we will see some action on them.  If he is a man of action can he guarantee that from now on every new Bill we pass in this House will be assessed for the impact it has on businesses?  We were promised that before, but it did not happen in the last term.  Can the Minister of State say that from today it will happen?</P>
        <P>Before the Minister of State&rsquo;s predecessor left he gave a guarantee he would work with the committee to solve the problems of local government regarding business, cost, regulation etc.  Does that commitment still stand for the Minister of State and other Ministers to work with the committee to promptly address the problems of business and local government?  While I believe the Minister of State does, I want a commitment across the board.</P>

	<P>We can double check that and make sure it does happen.  Regarding working with the committee, I have already said to the Chairman that not only would I discuss upcoming legislation, particularly the company law reform Bill, but also I am available to the committee to thrash out any other aspect of business that requires discussion with the committee to get the best possible deal for business.  I am also available for private briefings with spokespersons from Fine Gael and Labour or anybody else in the House.  My interest is ensuring that they do well because the economy will do well if that is the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unfortunate that the economic downturn had to occur before the Government appreciated the need for this reform.  However, we appreciate it and it is better late than never.  Would the Minister of State agree that a number of ideas could be implemented fairly quickly, for example by having electronic versions of some of these forms available to businesses instead of hard copies?  As he knows it is almost all hard copy at present.  As I know some shops and other businesses might prefer hard copies, I am not ruling that out.  Would the Minister of State accept there is great potential for merging the format of many of <Col N="65"/>the forms businesses need to complete?  Currently they all have different formats and are all over the place and surely could be streamlined.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>As small businesses need to deal with a number of agencies, CSO, CRO, Revenue, CEB etc., as a long or even medium-term objective, could the Minister of State introduce a standard form that would suit the application to different agencies?  Businesses should not be required to fill in the same information on many forms which consumes hours of business time and wastes time.  The form should be simplified with four or five pages and not like the form for the carer&rsquo;s allowance.  I filled in that form last night for a woman and it had approximately 20 pages, most of which was raim&eacute;is and wasteful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>The forms for Revenue and company registration are available on-line.  I believe the forms about which the Deputy is complaining are those that generally come from the Central Statistics Office, which take some time to complete.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="6" />
        <P>I have met with the Central Statistics Office to see whether those forms can be simplified or if some of Revenue&rsquo;s information could be used in regard to the statistics it is trying to collect.  We will work with the Central Statistics Office to try to achieve that objective.  That would relieve the burden.  It is a question of identifying the problem and working directly with the agency concerned and the business that identified the problem to resolve it.  Some of those issues can be resolved.  Hopefully, in line with what Revenue collects and what the CSO wants, we can reach a resolution.  There will always be a number of different forms because the CSO is collecting different information.  Those forms need to be simplified.  Sometimes in terms of the EU requirement and our own legislation, it is how the legislation is interpreted in the context of those forms.  They can be simplified.  They just need to be put in layman&rsquo;s language.  We need to understand the requirements of small businesses.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 138 together.</P>
        <P>The Employment Law Compliance Bill 2008 is designed to give effect to shared commitments in Part 2 of the ten year framework social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, to greatly increase public confidence in the system of employment law compliance.  The establishment of a new, statutory office to secure better compliance with employment law through information and enforcement activities, supported by up to 90 labour inspectors with extensive powers, formed one aspect of these commitments.</P>
        <P>Significant progress is being made on delivering the commitments agreed in Towards 2016 and, in this regard, the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, was established on an interim basis in February 2007, pending drafting and enactment of legislation, to undertake greater levels of employment law compliance activities.  The Employment Law Compliance Bill was initiated in this House on 13 March 2008.  Part 2 of the Bill provides for the establishment of the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, on a statutory footing.</P>
        <P>The Bill is substantial and quite complex legislation, and in its final form will provide for necessary amendments to over 30 separate existing enactments from 1946 onwards.  Since publi<Col N="66"/>cation of the Bill, work has been continuing including further drafting of provisions, legal clarification of certain issues and preparation of schedules of amendments to existing employment law.  In addition, account will also be taken of the views expressed by the social partners in the course of negotiations which led to the transitional agreement under Towards 2016 which was concluded last week.  I take this opportunity to congratulate everybody involved &mdash; union representatives, employers and officials &mdash; in bringing forward that transitional agreement.  Any remaining amendments and draft provisions will be the subject of discussion with the Office of the Attorney General and the intention is to have all outstanding work on the Bill quickly completed so it can be enacted as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The National Employment Rights Authority will be established one month after the Employment Law Compliance Bill 2008 is signed into law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>If I remember correctly the Minister of State said the Bill was published in March, only six months ago.  It appears strange that the Bill, the purpose of which was to establish the agency on a statutory footing, was published six months ago and yet has not been brought before the House for debate.  The only explanation that would make sense is that the Bill is essentially a bad one and is flawed and that, among other things, it potentially criminalises employers.  In my case, technically as an employer of my personal assistant and administrative assistant, which is the case for all Fine Gael members, I would have to post a notice in my office, on a regular basis, advising them of their rights and their ability to contact NERA etc.  That is just one aspect of the Bill.</P>
        <P>It appears the Bill, as drafted, was so bad and so objectionable to employers and unions that the Minister of State has not been able to bring it to the House.  Will the Bill come before the House before Christmas and, if so, will it be substantially redrafted?</P>

	<P>Part 2 of the Bill provides for the establishing of the National Employment Rights Authority.  That was the Part of the Bill that was published and presented to the House on 13 March 2008.  It is complex legislation.  We live in an era where social partnership is the bedrock within which much of the discussions take place.  There were further discussions in that context in the interim agreement agreed last week between the social partners.</P>
        <P>We present a Bill to the House.  It is discussed not only by the social partners but by all Members.  There will be an opportunity to discuss it on Committee Stage.  We want to ensure that when the Bill is enacted it reflects what is required in the context of employment law compliance.  It is a complex Bill and there are no quick fix solutions.  There has been ongoing involvement, due to the discussions and changes in the context of the social partnership talks that took place recently.  For that reason the Bill as presented, in certain areas, needs further changes.  I am quite sure that when the Bill is presented and goes through the House it will have the support of all sides.  I look forward to a fruitful discussion with Deputies opposite, who I know are very supportive of social partnership and what we were trying to achieve in the context of the challenges ahead.  Deputy Varadkar is a wholehearted supporter of that process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Minister of State the Labour Party is supportive.  Let us be clear about that.  Why was the Bill published?  Why did not the Minister of State await the outcome of the social partnership talks?  I appreciate he was under pressure from us all.  Every morning the Taoiseach and former Taoiseach got up and replied to questions.  Why did the Minister of State rush to the headland when the Bill was nowhere near the finite product?  What was the reason for the rush?  Given that the Minister of State was aware the social partners disagreed fundamentally with a significant and core element of the Bill, as drafted, at Part 2, why did he present it?  Deputy Varadkar said we had better subject this Bill to bureau<Col N="67"/>cratic evaluation as well because it contains many bureaucratic elements.  While I support the thrust of the Bill, we need to &ldquo;red tape&rdquo; index it.  What significant changes will affect Part 2 of the Bill, following the discussions that took place under the social partnership agreement, which was recently concluded successfully?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason the Bill was published was because a commitment was given in Towards 2016 to publish a Bill and to set up the National Employment Rights Authority on a statutory footing.  The most important point to be made is that NERA is operating and has almost a complete complement of labour inspectors.  It is enforcing employment rights compliance law which is welcome.  It has collected substantial arrears for employees.  The primary purpose of the National Employment Rights Authority is to ensure compliance with employment law.  The Bill has two parts.  Part 2 provides for the establishment of the National Employment Rights Authority on a statutory footing.  It is up and running on an interim basis.</P>
        <P>Over the coming weeks, much work remains to be done.  Discussions are taking place with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office in the context of the most recent agreements arrived at in the social partnership.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>When will we have the Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>We will have it quite soon.  We are trying to ensure when the Bill is published that it is not rushed with amendments railroaded through the House.  We want to have a genuine discussion on it.  We are trying to get the Bill right in the first instance, to have broad agreement from the social partners and a good debate in the House.  It is very complex but the Government is committed not only under the Towards 2016 agreement but under the interim one arrived at last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>To follow up on that and to connect with the comments made by Deputies Penrose and English on regulation, anyone who has read this very complex Bill, as the Minister of State has described it, will see it will have a significant regulatory impact on employers, yet the process being used for regulatory impact analyses decided that after screening, this Bill did not require a full regulatory impact analysis.  That shows how uncommitted the Minister of State is to tackling red tape and regulation.  The Minister of State would take this massive Bill which is flawed and complex, as he has admitted, and screen it for a regulatory impact analysis and say it had no regulatory cost and, therefore, did not need a full regulatory impact analysis.  How can he stand over that?  Will he give a guarantee there will be a full regulatory impact analysis with numbers in it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of Part 2 of the Bill, as published, was to provide for the establishment of the National Employment Rights Authority on a statutory footing.  The employment law is already in place.  Employers must comply with the employment law as it exists.  This does not amend the employment law which exists in the context of minimum wage, holiday entitlements, EROs and registered employment agreements.  Therefore, employers are compelled to comply with existing law.  The issue of inspections does not impose a regulatory burden.  When the Bill evolves and is finally completed we will ensure any burden on business is minimised.  Fundamentally, this Bill is about employment rights, protecting workers, and ensuring they are entitled to their statutory provisions.  NERA is working very effectively and its inspectors have joined up operations with Revenue and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Even though it has not been established on a statutory footing this organisation is working and is out and about.  Deputies have occasionally said to me that it is an over-enthusiastic organisation but at the end of the day it is there to ensure that employers comply with the law.  It is important also that it is trying to foster a culture of compliance.  This is about <Col N="68"/>educating employers, informing them of their various representative organisations such as IBEC and ISME, etc, so that we may achieve a broad compliance culture.  It is not all about inspections but concerns education as well as enforcement.</P>

	<P>The Consumer Protection Act 2007, which commenced in May last year, empowers the National Consumer Agency to prepare and publish guidelines to traders regarding issues of consumer welfare and protection and matters related to commercial practices.  The Act also empowers the agency to review or approve codes of practice submitted to it by traders or by their trade associations where the agency is satisfied that the code of practice protects consumer interests.</P>
        <P>The agency is currently giving priority to producing guidelines for business in a number of areas.  In early September it published a consultation document on guidelines for the retail sector relating to the advertising of price discounts and other associated matters.  The guidelines are intended to facilitate the retail sector in complying with the requirements of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 in respect of a variety of misleading practices.  When finalised, the guidelines will help traders to appreciate better their obligations to provide unambiguous information to consumers, to give clarity on certain aspects of the Act and to provide a basis for a fairer and more evenly balanced approach towards advertising throughout the sector.  The agency is also close to finalising guidelines for the health and fitness sector, following a consultation exercise with key stakeholders.</P>
        <P>The agency has also recently developed a code of practice with the Irish Home Builders Association which is to be followed by developers in their dealings in the development, interim management and sale of multi-unit development properties.  The code, which came into effect at the start of this month, sets out a series of actions aimed to enhance the good operation of the multi-unit dwelling sector and thereby help to ensure that developers and consumers share an understanding of their respective roles and responsibilities in relation to multi-unit developments.  The code includes specific provisions in respect of dispute resolution and redress and urges unit owners and developers to use alternative out of court mechanisms for resolving disputes.</P>
        <P>I welcome the agency&rsquo;s initiatives in these areas and am confident that the production of guidelines in important sectors of the economy such as the retail and health and fitness sectors will help in the development of a strong consumer culture in those sectors.  I support the agency&rsquo;s strategy of engaging constructively with businesses through initiatives such as agency guidelines and consumer codes of practice which will be of benefit not only to consumers but also to the businesses themselves and the economy as a whole.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>Those specific commitments were given in the programme for Government and 15 months later we are still at the stage of evaluation and discussion.  This is the fourth time I have raised this question this year &mdash; I raised it in February, April, June and now September.  When will we actually see this code of conduct?  When will the Government treat consumers with the seriousness they deserve?  Has there been any discussion with the National Consumer Agency about the content of proposed conduct for the two sectors, retail and health and fitness?  For instance, will the code of conduct for the retail sector include a <Col N="69"/>commitment to pass on to consumers savings made by the retailers arising from the variation in currency values?  We all know that one of the biggest rip-offs faced by the Irish consumer over the past year has been the failure of major multiples to pass on the benefits of the increase in value of the euro against sterling and the dollar.  We all know there are serious concerns about the delays in passing on reductions in the price of oil.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister of State aware that many consumers are concerned about gift tokens that are time limited?  When a person buys a gift token the store gets the value of the token but the token expires if it is not used within a specific period.  Can this issue be accommodated?  If a person pays his or her &euro;100 I do not believe a time limit should be imposed and if it is it should certainly be for longer than six months.  I hope that matter will be considered in the code of conduct.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>For the past few days I have been considering how best to address the serious issues that arise from the recent tragic deaths of Ann Moriarty and Edel Kelly following their treatment in Ennis General Hospital.  I have met with the husband and the sister of Ann Moriarty and I intend to meet the family of the other woman next week.  I wish to extend my sympathy to both families on their sad losses.  Ann Moriarty and Edel Kelly were two young women, both mothers.</P>
        <P>The expert clinical advice available to me is that a clinical review of other patients treated in Ennis General Hospital would not be warranted.  I am also conscious that in the context of future lessons for cancer services, breast cancer services have now been transferred from that hospital to the designated specialist centre for the mid-west and Limerick.</P>
        <P>Regarding the treatment of Ann Moriarty in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, I am aware that she was diagnosed with breast cancer two years previously and that she continued to attend the follow-up clinic at the hospital.  Ms Moriarty&rsquo;s most recent follow-up was in April 2007 and at that time a mammogram taken was reported as clear.  Subsequently the hospital has not been able to locate this mammogram in order to have it reviewed.</P>
        <P>Regarding Edel Kelly, both a biopsy taken at Ennis General Hospital in October 2006 and a histopathology report noted that no tumour was identified but read &ldquo;clinical correlation recommended&rdquo;.  This clinical correlation did not occur nor was there a multidisciplinary meeting to discuss Edel Kelly&rsquo;s health.</P>
        <P>The key factor in Ann Moriarty&rsquo;s case was the failure of Ennis General Hospital to refer her to a designated cancer centre when it was known that she had a history of cancer.  In the case of Edel Kelly, the absence of a multidisciplinary team approach resulted in her cancer not being diagnosed.  Since we have now moved breast cancer services from Ennis General Hospital, I feel it is important to have a wider examination of the operation of the hospital that would examine the approach to issues relating to the diagnosis and treatment of patients.  This includes arrangements for quality and safety and communications within the hospital and, in particular, with patients.  I believe there are many lessons to be learned by Ennis General Hospital and by the wider acute hospital sector.</P>
        <P>I am very conscious that the Health Service Executive has worked for some time to reconfigure services in the mid-west region.  It has engaged with clinicians and other health professionals in the region to agree a practical, patient-centred plan for reorganising services between Limerick Regional Hospital, Ennis General Hospital, Nenagh Hospital and St. John&rsquo;s Hospital.  Clinicians in the region have worked positively and have shown strong leadership <Col N="71"/>towards this end.  I am aware that the HSE has placed a particular emphasis on integrating accident and emergency services, with clear roles for all four hospitals, as part of a well-defined emergency care network.  I am also aware that the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, has reviewed documentation relating to the cases of Ann Moriarty and Edel Kelly.  Last week representatives of the authority met Mr. Karl Henry, husband of the late Ann Moriarty, to establish whether a further investigation is necessary.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this, I am now requesting the Health Information and Quality Authority, under section 9(2) of the Health Act 2007, to review the arrangements for providing services at Ennis General Hospital, with particular reference to the diagnosis and follow-up of patients and the communications systems in place in the hospital for patients and staff.  The review, to be completed in three months, will include an explanation of how these arrangements work in the emergency department in particular.  It would be particularly helpful if any of the conclusions or recommendations were applicable to the wider acute hospital sector.</P>
        <P>The HSE is also putting arrangements in place for those patients who attended hospital breast clinics throughout the country in the past two years and who do not have a diagnosis of cancer but have concerns in light of recent events.  A specified referral arrangement for these patients is being put in place and any woman with concerns should contact her general practitioner who will be able to refer her to a specialist breast clinic.</P>
        <P>There is every reason to believe that the vast majority of women have received the correct and appropriate assessment but I believe it is important to offer patients the option of a specialised referral service, following discussions with a general practitioner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will now call on the Deputies to table supplementary questions in the order in which they submitted questions to my office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has awoken to the need for her to show leadership on this issue.  She took a long time to do this but I am happy that she is announcing an inquiry today.  However, from listening to the Minister, it appears to me that the inquiry is more about the agenda of downgrading Ennis General Hospital, Nenagh Hospital and St. John&rsquo;s Hospital than about finding out what happened to these two unfortunate women and their families.  Can the Minister clarify whether this investigation will examine what went wrong in the cases of Ann Moriarty and Edel Kelly?  Will the inquiry study those cases specifically?</P>
        <P>The Minister said that consultation with clinicians in the mid-west is ongoing but when will she engage with patients and the public in the region?  When will the Teamwork report be published?  This is all going on behind closed doors and the public is not supposed to know about it.  We received one leaked document from Nenagh Hospital but we have no idea what is happening in the mid-west.  As I said, I welcome the fact that there is to be an inquiry, but why did the Minister wait so long?  Why did she not immediately ask HIQA to undertake an examination of what went wrong in the two cases concerned?  Can the Minister clarify whether this inquiry will address the concerns of the two stricken families or whether it is about an agenda she holds, along with the HSE, regarding hospitals in the mid-west?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>My agenda is to ensure that the services we provide are as quality assured as possible.  This is why, with regard to the cancer control programme, we are putting in place eight designated centres.  Notwithstanding that expert advice from Ireland and overseas recommends this, there is considerable opposition to it in this House and around the country.  Only last week I met a group of people from the north west who strongly oppose the service being moved from their local hospital.  With regard to breast cancer, all of the evidence from cancer experts in Ireland and elsewhere shows that unless a centre has at least 150 new cases per <Col N="72"/>year, two specialist breast surgeons, two specialist pathologists and two specialist radiologists, a quality-assured service, which improves outcomes for women by up to 25%, cannot be provided.  This means that while five out of five women may survive in a specialist centre only four out of five will survive in a non-specialist centre.</P>
        <P>We know the facts in the case of Edel Kelly.  A clinical correlation was recommended but did not happen and there was no multidisciplinary approach to her case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not know why this did not happen nor whether it applies to other cases.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It did not happen because hospitals like Ennis General Hospital do not have the capacity to provide such a service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course they do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not have specialist breast surgeons and pathologists specialising in breasts in small hospitals.  It would not be possible.  Until recently more than 30 hospitals in this country were involved in breast surgery.  Between 2005 and 2007 there were 17 breast procedures in Ennis General Hospital.  It is not possible to have skilled expertise with volumes as low as that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>They could have dealt with the request for a clinical correlation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the two cases in question, HIQA is considering whether there is a need to assemble a new set of facts.  I told the sister, whom I met last week, and the husband of the late Ann Moriarty, that we will leave no stone unturned to ensure they get the information required in whatever way it can be assembled.  A considerable amount of information has already been assembled as there were three different inquiries into that case.  Mr. Henry and his family still have questions and they are entitled to answers.  HIQA, an independent body, is examining the issues relating to the two specific cases.</P>
        <P>There are wider issues relating to Ennis General Hospital that concern me because Ann Moriarty presented as an accident and emergency department case.  People present every day at accident and emergency departments and I want to ensure that when we provide hospital services we provide quality-assured, safe services to patients, to the best of our capacity as a country.</P>
        <P>This is not about downgrading anything but is about upgrading patient care and safety.  The Deputy asked why there is not patient buy-in, but patients look to the clinical community on these issues, as do I.  I have taken advice from Professor Arnie Hill, head of the Royal College of Surgeons and one of our leading breast surgeons, who is involved with Professor Tom Keane in implementing the new cancer control programme.  I have listened to Professor Keane, a breast radiation oncologist of international repute, and my own medical team at the Department.  This is the advice I must listen to as I am not a clinician.  Even if I were a clinician, it is important to listen to the advice of experts.  I take that advice when it comes to clinical matters.</P>
        <P>We cannot have inquiries into every misdiagnosis that occurs.  Long before I became Minister for Health and Children, in the 30 years I have been in this House, I dealt with constituents who have experienced misdiagnoses and families that have lost a loved one.  This is the reality as even in the best health system in the world errors may occur.  We have had a number of inquiries and will continue to have them when necessary.  However, we cannot tie up the best clinicians in the country in constant inquiries at the expense of services.  This is why so much focus must now be on putting in place the new programme.</P><Col N="73"/>
     
        <P>By March 2009, breast surgery will take place in the eight designated centres.  Nineteen hospitals already have ceased performing breast surgery and at that point, one will be able to state that Ireland is providing the best possible service to breast cancer patients which is on a par with the best that is on offer throughout the world.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the inquiry.  However, from the Minister&rsquo;s remarks, I am unclear whether this inquiry will include the two specific cases mentioned, those of Ms Moriarty and Ms Kelly.  From her remarks I understand it will encompass services of a broader nature at Ennis General Hospital.  Like my Labour Party colleague, I must say, &ldquo;better late than never&rdquo;.  However, it is upsetting and disappointing to be obliged to wait for so long and that the leadership took so long to be seen, as well as to move, act and represent the public interest.  The families were obliged to go through the trauma of public glare to get what was rightfully theirs, namely, justice and transparency for their loved ones.  I refer to the damage done to the credibility of the HSE, as one professional after another was rolled out to pour cold water on the need for an independent inquiry.  The Minister mentioned the gentlemen concerned and I would be the first to acknowledge their expertise, which lies in breast cancer and not in public disquiet or in meeting the concerns of the public.  Such expertise lies within this House, to which Members were elected to represent the people.</P>
         <P>I also am concerned there has been no mention of the disappearance of the mammogram at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital as being part of this inquiry because I believe it is extremely serious.  For instance, is it known whether a digital machine performed this procedure?  If so, is there not a record of it on the hard drive and, if not, why not or how not?  This must be investigated.  I accept the biopsy might have been taken in Ennis General Hospital and examined in Limerick Regional Hospital.  As a clinician, clinical correlation to me means asking whether this fits with what one has seen as a clinician.  That is all it means and if the biopsy is negative, the ultrasound is clear and the mammogram shows nothing to worry about, one must ask the reason the patient was not brought back to have a further review if the lump was still present in a month&rsquo;s time or whatever.  This must be examined and we must find out what went wrong.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s is absolutely correct regarding her further questions on Ennis General Hospital.  We must find out the reason blood markers were not followed up, what happened in the accident and emergency unit and the reason, the patient having been there for four days, it occurred to no one this could be a recurrence of cancer.  In so doing, we must help and support those who were involved in this case in order that they do not make the same mistakes again and to fix the system that allowed this to obtain.  Has this anything to do with the lack of investment in Ennis General Hospital, which my good colleague, Deputy Breen, has informed me has been promised yearly for many years?</P>
        <P>The Minister also made a statement which I do not accept, that one cannot investigate every incident throughout Ireland.  Had we an identifiable patient safety authority, to which people could go with their concerns without being obliged either to resort to publicity and the associated glare and upset it causes for families or to go to the courts, such matters could be dealt with.  Fine Gael has asked for this in the past and while one could be accused of creating another quango, this would not be the case as it could be brought under the remit of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, or <i>vice versa</i>.  The point is that Irish people are entitled to know they and their loved ones are being looked after properly.  I frequently have been on record as stating that while human error always will be with us, a good system will minimise the impact of such human error on the patient.  When human error takes place and has a negative impact, people should not be obliged to go through the trauma through which Mr. Henry and Mr. and Mrs. Kelly were obliged to go.</P><Col N="74"/>
        <P>The Minister mentioned the movement to the eight centres.  It does not matter what these centres are called, be they centres of excellence, specialist centres or whatever, unless they are funded and resourced appropriately to carry out the job they must do, we will have more of the same.  I specifically refer to Waterford Regional Hospital, which originally was due to take all breast cancer cases in the south east by November 2009.  Last week, it was informed that the process must be completed by the end of next month.  There is no confidence there that it has the theatres, staff or resources to deal with the influx of patients with which it will be obliged to deal.  There is a sense there of being set up to fail, rather like Portlaoise hospital, which also was a designated centre.</P>
        <P>I would be grateful were the Minister to respond to my concerns.  I will finish by again welcoming the independent inquiry.  I hope it will be expeditious and does not transpire to be like the inquiry on the north east, on which one still waits, despite it having been promised last July.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Many questions have been raised by the Deputy.  First, the terms of reference will mandate that the inquiry be concluded within three months because speed is important.  It is important for confidence in Ennis General Hospital, for the patients who attend there and for everyone else who is involved.  Second, the mammogram in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital was analogue and not digital.  However, I understand it is now digital.  The mammogram was taken in the private hospital, which at the time was not part of the PACS system and was of the other breast.  Unlike Deputy Reilly, I am not a clinician but the report of the mammogram states it was clear.  Doctors have told me it is highly likely that the cancer does not spread to the other breast but to other parts of the body.  I understand this was metastatic cancer.  However, in the dialogue HIQA has had with Mr. Henry, the issue of the missing mammogram in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital has been part of their consideration.</P>
        <P>As for the issue of expertise, the expertise in respect of whether we have clinical look-backs rests more with people such as Professor Hill and Professor Keane than with anyone in this House.  I reject the suggestion, which places a question over their professionalism, that people on their level with reputations such as theirs would be rolled out or used by anyone.  Certainly there is no question of me asking anyone, not least someone at that level, to perform a function they do not wish to do.  If they are invited by the media to participate in programmes and agree to so do, they give their honest views on matters as they perceive them.</P>
        <P>As a general practitioner, the Deputy will acknowledge that the speed of the transformation in breast cancer services in recent months has been incredible.  It has happened with incredible speed, which is impressing clinicians.  Only last night I spoke to a clinician from Galway who, as a doctor, was really inspired by the speed at which the reforms have been put in place.  I welcome this and that is the reason the target date for the completion of the transition of breast services from the smaller hospitals to the eight centres has been brought forward.  It is precisely because women themselves wished to attend such centres and did not wish to attend hospitals that were not designated centres.</P>
        <P>Professor Keane sought and received resources for the transition last year.  He has sought resources for next year for prostate and lung cancer in particular and will receive those resources, notwithstanding the changed economic circumstances.  He has made the point that we spend considerable resources in the area of cancer.  Successive Ministers for Health and Children, including Deputy Noonan, who is present, invested considerable resources in cancer.  However, when such investment is fragmented, the same benefit does not accrue from those resources as would be the case were the resources and expertise brought together.  This is what is taking place and much of the additional resources involves transferring the resource from <Col N="75"/>the local hospital to the centre.  For example, Mr. Barry in Mayo will move to Galway from Castlebar hospital for two days a week to perform breast surgery.  The same also will apply to other breast surgeons.  I understand one already has moved from Kilkenny to Waterford and so on.</P>
        <P>As for the two individual cases and what other facts must emerge, we know a lot about what went wrong in both cases.  Although Ann Moriarty should have been referred back to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, where she had been treated for breast cancer, that did not happen.  As for Edel Kelly, while the Deputy knows more about this than do I, the HIQA report in respect of Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley made recommendations about fine needle biopsies.  As I understand it, one does not simply go in with a needle, take a sample and send it for a biopsy.  Instead, I understand one also uses ultrasound to guide one as to which tissue to remove.  I understand that did not happen.  Therefore, I presume the tissue that was subject to the pathology examination in Limerick Regional Hospital probably was fine.  I understand the issue is whether the appropriate tissue was examined.</P>
        <P>HIQA is a patient safety authority.  Its job is to set and enforce standards in the health care system.  Such standards are set and enforced with a view to improving services for patients.  We have had the report of the patient safety commission and, among others things, we must introduce a licensing or accreditation system.  The reality is that we do not have particular standards of care and criteria for the opening and functioning of hospitals.  That, in particular, is very unsatisfactory from a patient safety perspective.  I will bring the recommendations of the commission to Cabinet very shortly with a recommendation for their implementation.</P>
        <P>With regard to the comments about me not acting speedily, I met Mr. Henry last week.  I became aware of the Edel Kelly case late last week.  I am always interested in meeting patients and I meet a number every week.  Many cases never get into the public domain and many patients are satisfied with how their complaint has been resolved at a local level.  The Deputy would know that.  Many people feel they are listened to and supported while others feel their complaint was not taken seriously or dealt with as sensitively or speedily as they would have wished.</P>
        <P>I met Mr. Henry and the late Ann Moriarty&rsquo;s sister.  I will meet the Kelly family next week.  I emphasise that every time we have a misdiagnosis or error &mdash; we have them every day and even when we have the eight centres of excellence I am advised by experts there will be an approximate 1% error rate &mdash; we cannot continue to have inquiries which tie up the best experts we have in the country.  As there has been a second case in addition to that of Edel Kelly, it is important for the hospital that people can have confidence in the services.  The cancer services have closed but other services continue to be provided.  I understand many telephone calls have been made to the hospital and others in the region, with people worried not just about cancer, but about other services in the hospital.</P>
        <P>We owe it to the hospital, patients and staff to ensure we clinically review what is happening there with a view to ensuring that anything which needs to be put right is done as quickly as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome that the Minister has called HIQA in to look at the services in Ennis General Hospital, as we have a serious situation in County Clare.</P>
        <P>I take the Minister back to last May, when she said she acted speedily.  I do not believe this.  At that time, the Minister told the Oireachtas Members from Clare, three of whom are present today, along with the mayors of Clare, that she would be down in Clare within two weeks to compliment staff on the way they treated the C. difficile crisis that emerged in the hospital at <Col N="76"/>that time.  She stated she would probably include Ennis in the capital programme for 2008, which was what we all expected.  We did not see the Minister then and still have not seen her.</P>
        <P>A very serious issue has emerged with those two cases.  When the Minister responded to the recommendations of the Portlaoise and Barrington cases reports, she said patients&rsquo; interests come first.  This has not been the case regarding what the Minister has said this afternoon, that an investigation cannot take place with everybody.  Every case is important.</P>
        <P>I visited the Kelly family yesterday morning.  They were on local radio and the girls in my office cried upon hearing what they said.  I was touched by these people, who just want answers and not publicity.  We need to know what happened and why.  In the case of Ann Moriarty, we must know why the suspect blood was put on the shelf and why the X-ray was not read properly.  X-rays are taken every day outside of cancer services in Ennis General Hospital and blood samples are also taken daily.  We must know why the problem happened and if it was a resource or staffing problem.  We need answers quickly.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s announcement this afternoon of an investigation by HIQA will help but there are other issues.  I want to know why the Minister has not put funding for the development plan in place.  She promised she would visit the area.</P>
        <P>The issue of mammograms is related to what we are talking about.  Why is it that a patient with a family history of cancer but without symptoms is not being given a mammogram currently?  Why has BreastCheck not been rolled out in the mid-west region?  Women are extremely worried about themselves following the incidents in Ennis General Hospital.  When will the roll-out happen?  It is an important action but only people with symptoms are being referred for mammograms currently.  There are many worried women in County Clare now, particularly public patients, who cannot go for mammograms as a result.</P>
        <P>I have two other questions.  A CAT scanner was announced by the Minister at the May meeting but I have never heard of a CAT scanner working for just five days a week, which is the Minister&rsquo;s proposal.  People do not get sick only between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. but rather on a 24 hours a day basis.  Car accidents can happen at any time.  A CAT scanner is a necessary piece of equipment in a hospital but the Minister is only putting it in place for five days a week.  What is stopping a technician being appointed, with the film being sent to the Limerick centre of excellence for a report?</P>
        <P>Is the Minister aware of any other cases of misdiagnosis in Ennis General Hospital aside from the third case we know of from last night?  Are there other cases and has the Minister been in touch with the HSE in this regard?  We must know this information.</P>
        <P>When will the Minister come to the hospital to give assurances to the Clare people and the staff, whose morale is very low?  She should assure these people that investment is going into the hospital as we cannot put it on the long finger any more.  The Minister does not act speedily but rather very slowly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret some of the comments made by the Deputy as I have met him on many occasions with regard to Clare matters.  I stated that I was planning a private visit to Clare and would call into the hospital.  I did not make the private visit, as it happened &mdash; I was going to attend a private family event and circumstances dictated I could not attend.  I would be more than happy if in Clare to visit Ennis General Hospital but I am not into PR stunts.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="77"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not make a significant number of hospital visits because I am quite busy working in the office as much as I can.  I meet people from Ennis and I have met with the Deputy on many occasions, as he knows.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is not delivering.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to capital investment, I gave a commitment that provision will be made in the 2008 capital plan for capital works at Ennis.  That is a fact and there are parliamentary questions down today where I have answered that issue.  The capital works must be compatible with the developments taking place at the hospital.  As I stated in my earlier reply, significant work has been under way between the four hospitals in the region, all of which have accident and emergency departments.</P>
        <P>Many Members may have heard Professor Drumm say this morning something he has said on many occasions, that we have many hospitals in the country where we have four times more doctors employed than admissions per day.  Deputies do not need me to tell them that in such an environment, quality care is not possible.  It is not a good use of resources.</P>
        <P>The whole reform effort aims to get clinical buy-in to the change and listen to the clinical experts on the ground and nationally.  For 30 years this country has sought to reform its health service but has always fallen down because of a failure to achieve clinical buy-in, which is the key to success.  This is particularly true of the cancer programme, where there is significant buy-in from the clinical community in Ireland to what we are doing.</P>
        <P>With regard to mammograms, BreastCheck has been rolled out to the mid-west, although it has not yet been rolled out in Clare.  There are approximately five or six counties left to roll out BreastCheck, which is happening as we speak.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not happening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the issues arising for BreastCheck is the recruitment of specialist radiographers.  As a result of difficulties in seeking to recruit these specialist radiographers, arrangements have been put in place with the NHS in Britain and it may be possible to second radiographers for a short period to BreastCheck in order to facilitate the roll-out to those counties where this has not happened.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>When does the Minister expect it to happen in County Clare?</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="7" />
    </Speaker><!--Fix-->
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot give a precise date and have never done so.  I do not know.  We have provided the resources for the roll-out nationally and the centres have been constructed and are operational in Cork and Galway.  The mobile units are in place in many counties around the country.  It is regrettable that take-up in some areas, for example, County Mayo, is disappointing.  We all need to apply our collective efforts to encouraging women to come forward for a mammogram because we know early detection is essential.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked about two specific cases.  HIQA, which is examining the facts of the cases as it knows them, may conclude a review of the cases, over and beyond the information we have, is warranted.  Mr. Henry wants other questions answered, particularly on clinical care and contact made between a clinician and Mr. Henry&rsquo;s family concerning how the complaint was handled.  I hope these outstanding issues can be addressed to his satisfaction.  We have a considerable amount of information about what went wrong in the cases of Ms Edel Kelly and from the three reports into the death of Ann Moriarty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to sympathise with the bereaved families.  The loss of a wife and mother is very difficult for a family, even more so when the events which caused the death <Col N="78"/>could have been avoided, as appears to be the case here.  I welcome the inquiry.  In my question I asked the Minister to include in its remit the issue of misreading of smear tests.  However, she failed to answer that part of the question.  I made this request because I have not yet received replies to a letter I wrote several weeks ago to both the Minister and Professor Drumm in which I provided documentary evidence showing there had been a misreading of several smear tests and that two false negatives had been issued from a laboratory in Galway, as was proven to be the case when archival samples were retested.</P>
        <P>The woman involved in the case in question is now very seriously ill.  I did not want to raise the case publicly because the woman and her family want to maintain their anonymity.  However, I have forced into a position in which I must raise the issue because I am unable to obtain a reply from the Minister or Professor Drumm.  Although the former acknowledged the correspondence, I expected I would have received a substantive reply by now given that I wrote to her almost three weeks ago.  When I wrote to Professor Drumm I received the usual, ludicrous answer with which Deputies are familiar, namely, that the matter was being referred to the parliamentary affairs section of the Health Service Executive.  For the HSE to refer to its parliamentary affairs section a letter about a person who is seriously ill with cancer following the misreading of a smear test as if it were a routine inquiry by a Deputy makes one wonder what is going on in that organisation.  While I presume the matter has been brought to the Minister&rsquo;s attention, failing that I ask her to seek out the information.</P>
        <P>A woman whom I know quite well is extremely ill with cancer.  The circumstances of the case are that a general practitioner took a smear test for cervical cancer in 2006.  The test was sent to Galway and the result was negative.  However, when inquiries took place earlier in the summer, it was found that a smear test had also been sent for analysis in 2001.  When the 2006 archival sample was retested, it showed clearly that the indicators of cancer were present in the sample.  The 2001 sample, taken five years previously, also showed that pre-cancerous cells were present.  At a minimum, precautions should have been taken at that stage and the woman in question made the subject of observation.</P>
        <P>Did the Minister&rsquo;s officials show her my correspondence?  I did not make an allegation or send a routine letter but provided her with the results of the archival laboratory tests to show that the family who raised the matter with me are speaking the absolute and simple truth and are supported by their clinicians.  Did the Minister have a conversation with Professor Drumm?  It seemed from something he said this morning that he may have been made aware of the case last night because he referred to a third case.  I am not certain he was referring to the woman in question.</P>
        <P>I am constrained by the fact that the family in question do not want publicity about the case and while I will not name names today, I regard this as an extremely serious issue which has been very badly handled.  There may be reasons for this.  Perhaps matters are being inquired into in the Department or a substantive reply is on its way to me.  However, in view of the gravity of the case and the serious condition in which the woman in question finds herself, I would have expected to have been contacted by the Department and Professor Drumm.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The focus of the questions is Ennis General Hospital and the tragic deaths of two individuals.  I am, however, familiar with the Deputy&rsquo;s correspondence which was received in my Department on 28 or 29 August.  He also tabled a parliamentary question which I cleared last night.  In my reply to the question, I indicated that the matters raised are being fully examined, that I have asked the Health Service Executive for a report and that I will communicate with the Deputy by the end of this week as the report is almost complete.  </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have done so already.  My office brought the matter to my attention and the Department is aware of the Deputy&rsquo;s correspondence.  All patient safety issues are now referred to the chief medical officer in the Department.  A new medical officer who will be appointed some time in October &mdash; a recruitment campaign is under way &mdash; will head up a new patient safety division in the Department for the first time.  Obviously, we must get the facts before we can respond.  However, the Department sent the Deputy an acknowledgement.</P>
        <P>Earlier this month, when we were rolling out the new cervical screening programme, our main priority when sourcing cytology was to ensure it was quality assured.  Without quality assured cytology services, a screening programme is not of great value.  Considerable controversy arose about this issue.</P>

I hope to have all the facts of the case and to be in a position to communicate with the Deputy by Friday.  If the facts, as suggested by the Deputy, are borne out, we will have had a cytology failing in one of our hospitals.  I would regret that very much. </P>

      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for the frank manner in which she has dealt with this matter which is a serious issue both for the two families concerned and all those who are worried at this time.  I also welcome the review she announced, which will help to restore confidence in Ennis General Hospital and assist patients who have an ongoing relationship with the hospital.  Having met both the families in question, I am hopeful the review will go a long way in addressing their individual concerns.  As the Minister noted, however, it may not fully address the concerns of one of the families, although I hope the involvement of HIQA will help to do so.  </P>
        <P>When does the Minister expect the specialised referral service to be up and running?  This service will be critical to restoring confidence among patients of the hospital, particularly those who had dealings with its breast-related cancer services before they were transferred to the centre in Limerick.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister on the manner in which she has dealt with the families in question.  I am aware she has met the family of one patient and intends to meet others.  Her approach shows that she cares and helps to build confidence in the health service and political system.</P>
        <P>On the terms of reference of the review, will it be possible to examine the culture of dealing with mistakes, specifically the possibility of introducing a process or protocol for communicating with patients or, in the case of patients who are deceased, with their families when mistakes are identified?  I am aware there is always a difficulty in the context of accepting <Col N="80"/>liability and responsibility but such an acceptance is important to families and those affected by matters of this nature.  Will the Minister indicate whether it might be possible to put in place a process of arbitration or mediation which would allow those who are seriously ill or their families to avoid the necessity of seeking redress through the courts?  Anything that would prevent people from being obliged to take the legal route would be of assistance.  Perhaps the review might extend to providing some guidance in respect of future cases of this nature.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for his comments.  A process relating to referrals for women who have concerns is, in effect, up and running.  I understand the HSE is in contact with general practitioners in order to make available to them information relating to the precise referral arrangements in each region.  This matter relates to hospitals other than that in Ennis.  The idea is that there will be a person in each region whom general practitioners can contact.  Referral appointments can be made after women have contacted their GPs.</P>
        <P>There is a culture of denial, embarrassment and, perhaps, guilt that takes hold when mistakes occur.  The medical community here is probably no different than those in other countries.  I have attended many patient safety seminars in Ireland and elsewhere since I became Minister for Health and Children and the pattern often appears to be the same.  One would hope, particularly in light of enterprise liability, it would be somewhat easier to come to terms with errors.  We have a great deal to do in the context of changing the culture relating to how we respond to patients or their loved ones when an error has occurred.  It will take some time to achieve this because changing a culture is one of the most difficult things to do in any walk of life, not least in the area of medicine.</P>
        <P>We recently appointed a new medical council, the majority of the members of which are lay persons.  The purpose of that was to bring a wider dimension to the regulation, training and education of medics in this country.  Some doctors who are on the council and who were reluctant for a majority of its members to be lay persons are of the view, even after only a few meetings, that this is a worthwhile development.</P>
        <P>I am strongly of the view that when it is clear that an error has occurred, people should not be forced to have recourse to the courts in order &mdash; I do not know if this is the appropriate language to use &mdash; that they might be compensated.  An arbitration system is far more compassionate and responsive.  I have already spoken to the HSE in respect of this matter, not only in respect of these cases but also regarding others where errors occurred.  Too often in the past we forced people to litigate and they were obliged to cope with all of the trauma associated therewith.  One mother who lost her son ten or 12 years ago informed me that the need to pursue litigation compounded the trauma of the original error and that in many ways it made matters worse.</P>
        <P>As already stated, there is much to do in the context of changing the culture.  A huge effort is under way in the HSE in this regard.  The Director of Consumer Affairs, Mary Culleton, her staff and many other people are extremely sensitive to the need to respond to patients.  Many of the letters etc., I receive come from people who have good things to say regarding how complaints were dealt with.  Equally, however, I receive communications which indicate the reverse.  Particular individuals respond differently.  However, one would hope that, over time, the response would be appropriate in every set of circumstances.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>If a woman in County Clare has concerns, what procedure should she follow?  If she had a test carried out during the period in question and is worried that the results may not have been accurate, should she contact her GP in order to obtain a referral?</P><Col N="81"/>
        <P>The second matter I wish to raise relates to a question posed by Deputy Breen to which a reply was not given.  I refer to the announcement by Professor Keane that routine mammograms would not be carried out at centres of excellence and that women would have to be referred by their GPs when it was established that symptoms were present.  There are families in which there is a history of breast cancer.  In the region in which I live, women cannot access mammography services of any kind unless symptoms are present.  That is causing a great deal of distress in areas &mdash; I refer her to Clare and five or six other counties &mdash; where BreastCheck is not in operation.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister request that the position in this regard be reviewed?  I am aware of cases where three or four sisters in particular families died as a result of breast cancer and where a surviving sister who does not have symptoms wants to have a mammogram carried out in order that she might be reassured.  It is cruel that such women cannot avail of routine mammograms.  Even if one manages to scrape the money together, I understand that, since the closure of the Barrington&rsquo;s service, one cannot avail of a mammogram in the mid-west region.</P>

	<P>Women in Clare or anywhere else who are concerned should go to their general practitioners who will be able to refer them to one of the eight centres of excellence.  The idea is that the centres deal with those suffering from symptomatic cancer.  However, they also deal with families that are in the high-risk category.  Earlier this week I was visited in my office by a group from another part of the country.  One of the women present was diagnosed with breast cancer as part of a routine follow up which resulted from her mother being diagnosed with the disease.  There must be a misunderstanding regarding the matter to which the Deputy refers.  It would not be the intention to prevent members of families in which there is a history of cancer to attend specialist clinics.  If there is a particular issue in the mid-west region, I would like to speak to Professor Keane about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the impression that was given.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There are family history clinics at a number of locations, including the Mater Hospital, Drogheda and elsewhere.  If there is an issue regarding the mid-west region, I will communicate with Professor Keane in respect of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not my intention to digress but the Minister referred to cervical screening, which commenced at the beginning of the month.  I made a number of telephone calls last night and discovered that only one practice in north Dublin had received a kit.  I made my feelings on that matter known in the past and was castigated for doing so.  However, there is no point in announcing a service when it is not available.  Prematurity only undermines the position.</P>
        <P>I referred earlier to Waterford but the Minister did not respond.  In what way will resources be provided in order to allow the authorities there to achieve in a month what was supposed to take one year?  Will the Minister address the concerns of the people who work there?</P>
        <P>Despite the fact that matter has been the subject of media reports for two to three weeks, I received a telephone message from a journalist earlier this afternoon to the effect that there is no advice on the HSE&rsquo;s website for people who were misdiagnosed.  A telephone number has <Col N="82"/>not been provided and there is no indication of what they should do.  Perhaps the Minister will check the position and ensure this matter is resolved.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to the Commission on Patient Safety, which recommended in its report that a patient safety authority be established.  She also referred to HIQA enforcing standards.  How can HIQA do so when it is not in a position to censure hospitals?  It can set standards and impose them on hospitals but when its officials return 12 months later, they will be informed by the powers that be that they did not get around to implementing them.  Nothing can be done in such circumstances.  In the case of a private facility, HIQA may be in a position to revoke the licence.  In terms of enforcement, the authority lacks teeth.</P>
        <P>As usual, the Minister engaged in one of her favourite tricks, namely, reframing the comments I made in respect of Professor Keane and others.  I stated that public representatives are the best people to judge public concerns and that experts should be left to their areas of expertise.  Their expert opinion in respect of a look-back goes a step further.  I stated that HIQA should carry out an independent inquiry and that if, as a result of the latter, a full review is required, it should be carried out expeditiously.  I am glad the Minister has taken my view on board in that regard.</P>
        <P>Deputy Breen inquired if the Minister is aware of any further cases but she did not provide a reply.  Will she indicate whether the biopsy from Limerick was reviewed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the biopsy relating to Edel Kelly has been reviewed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Was it clear?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I believe that to be the case.  As the Deputy is aware, there is a recommendation in the Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley report regarding which tissue should be the subject of a fine needle aspiration.  I understand that doctors should be guided by ultrasound scans in order to identify which tissue to take.</P>
        <P>Professor Drumm stated that another case is being investigated.  That is not the cytology case to which Deputy Noonan referred and I apologise for not responding to his earlier question.  I do not believe any information has been assembled as to whether there was a possible delayed diagnosis.  The case in question does not involve a death but there may have been someone whose diagnosis was delayed.  The case relates to Ennis and not any of the other hospitals.</P>
        <P>In regard to Waterford, the breast surgeon from Clonmel has gone there.  Professor Keane does not transfer services from a hospital until he is certain the resources are in place.  Interviews took place recently and ten cancer doctors are being recruited, one for each centre.  Some of them are surgeons and many are specialist radiologists.  I understand there was a high level of interest from many excellent doctors.  Further interviews are to take place to recruit other specialists for the eight centres.</P>
        <P>In regard to licensing and so on, we do not have a licensing regime here for the public or the private sector.  That is a deficiency we must act on as quickly as possible.  It requires legislation which will be drafted and forthcoming as quickly as possible.  Until we have a licensing regime, it is not possible to establish an organisation to close things down if we allow people to open without any permit or authorisation.  We must ensure that in the way we fund hospitals, we only fund those places which operate to the standards we deem necessary.</P>
        <P>For example, in regard to breast cancer, I spoke to the insurers to ensure they do not fund through insurance activities in places which do not live up to the new national standards.  I <Col N="83"/>have got that assurance from the VHI and I believe it will be forthcoming from the other insurers as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome that because I spoke to the Minister about it last year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>We spoke about two cases and possibly a third case of which the Minister said she is aware.  Are there other cases?  We spoke about misdiagnoses but much good work is done in the hospital.  People must work in very difficult circumstances.  Most days the accident and emergency department in Ennis is crowded.  It is small and cramped and there are not enough beds.  There are not even rooms in the hospital to give people privacy in the event of a loved one being seriously ill.</P>
        <P>The Minister did not answer my question about the CAT scan.  I urge her to put the development plan in place as soon as possible.  We need to restore confidence in the hospital.  As I said, staff are hardworking and I do not want the HSE to use these misdiagnoses as a means to downgrade the hospital.  We want the hospital, particularly for the people of west Clare who must travel long distances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The only other case in regard to Ennis of which I am aware is the one to which I referred.  I understand the HSE is investigating whether a breast cancer diagnosis was delayed.  However, as Minister and a representative for Dublin Mid-West, I am aware of many cases around the country where there were misdiagnoses.</P>
        <P>To put this in context and to be fair, because it is not often understood by the public, errors are made in even the best hospitals in the world, including the most resourced, the best equipped and a hospital I visited last year, M. D. Anderson in Texas, that deals with 78,000 cancers per year, which is nearly four times more cancers than we have in this country.  In the developed world where research has taken place, it is estimated that in approximately 10% of hospital experiences are adverse and that 1% of them can result in a fatality.  What we are trying to do in the reorganisation of our services is not to eliminate error because, as everybody acknowledges, that is impossible but to minimise the capacity for error making.</P>
        <P>In regard to the scanner and any other equipment put in place, there are 37 hospitals in this country with accident and emergency departments for a population of 4.3 million.  People do not need me to tell them that one cannot resource to the standards which might be expected in 37 hospitals with all the modern equipment necessary.  It is not financially sustainable or possible, nor is it possible to get the kind of clinical expertise with that type of dispersion.  It is very difficult to get top doctors to work in an environment with small volumes.  That is the case in many of our hospitals and that is why we are trying to work to bring a network of hospitals together so that they complement each other and the clinicians work as part of a team in the region, such as the mid-west region where there are four hospitals.  That is the ideal scenario.</P>
        <P>The hospital is only of use to the patients in its catchment area if it can provide high quality services.  I have no doubt that is what patients want and that is what we will have in Ennis.  That is why the review I have asked HIQA to do will ensure that can be guaranteed in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Are there plans to appoint additional consultant oncologists in the mid-west region?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand one of the ten appointments now being made is a radiologist for Limerick.  Limerick will have a minimum of two full-time breast surgeons, two radiologists with a specialist interest in breasts, two pathologists and additional medical oncologists.  The recruitment process is under way and ten appointments have been made, or certainly <Col N="84"/>people have been offered appointments.  Further appointments will be made in the coming months.  </P>

    <Title>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2008: Second Stage (Resumed). </Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I will summarise the point I made earlier, given the gravity of the debate which has concluded.  One must ask about today&rsquo;s Order of Business.  Why is the House discussing the Electoral (Amendment) Bill when people outside it are talking about the economy, job losses, the health service and other important matters?  If a child in the Visitors Gallery heard the debate which just took place, he or she would be aware of the importance of this House but if he or she had heard only the earlier debate on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, he or she would be of the view that politicians were talking about themselves at a time when everybody else wanted the House to talk about what is happening in the country.</P>
        <P>As I said earlier, the Labour Party accepts the report of the commission and values the work it does.  However, how it goes about its business needs to be examined as the terms of reference of the commission are set up by the Minister.  The Labour Party believes the process, as currently sequenced, needs very serious examination.  Currently, when the commission reports, the report comes to the House as a <i>fait accompli</i>.  We would like an interim report to be sent to the stakeholders and those with an interest so that decisions made by the commission can be examined.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill provides that within three months of a census report being published, the commission will begin to engage in its work again.  However, there is a year between when the preliminary reports come out and when the census reports are fully published.  The commission could begin to do its work even at the preliminary stage.  There is no doubt that if boundaries had been reviewed in advance of the most recent election and they had reflected the changes in population experienced since 2002, the outcome of a number of constituencies would have been very different.  However, nobody can say whether this would have changed the overall outcome of the election.  Nevertheless, the structure of the most recent general election should have been examined in terms of how the constituencies were set out.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference for the commission set out in the 1997 Act should be amended to protect our system of proportional representation and this should be the key reference for any work of the future commission.  This is not just my view or that of a political party; it should be a constitutional requirement on the commission.  Given the position of the stipulated voting system within the Constitution, this is not just a point of debate, but a constitutional fact.</P>
        <P>In practical terms, this means if there are two or more possible configurations for constituencies in a particular locality, with due regard having been given to all relevant factors, the commission&rsquo;s leaning should be for one that provides for a smaller number of constituencies returning a greater number of Members, rather than a multiplicity of three-seat constituencies.  Unfortunately, this is the practice developing from one commission report to another.</P>
        <P>It is, therefore, necessary to set out the basic mathematics that show the purpose of proportional representation and a single transferable vote election is most successfully achieved in constituencies that return more than one Member.  In the submission made last year by the Labour Party, we argued that a fundamental requirement of the commission was to protect the element of proportionality to ensure the closest possible correlation between the share of votes a party gets to the number of seats it secures.  Statistics we provided to the commission clearly demonstrated that larger constituencies provide the greater degree of proportionality.</P><Col N="86"/>
        <P>Unfortunately, the commission took little account of this, leaving the proportion of three, four and five-seat constituencies largely the same.  More than one third of all constituencies are now three-seaters, the configuration that produces the least proportional outcome.  For example, because the Ceann Comhairle is automatically returned, Kerry South will actually become a two-seater, which comes close to rendering the constitutional right of the people of Kerry South to proportional representation null and void.  This situation will recur in any three-seater constituency with a sitting Ceann Comhairle.</P>
        <P>The people have voted in referenda on two occasions to retain proportional representation.  We should ensure that the value of this system is not undermined by inadequate terms of reference for the commission.  I suggest the 1997 Act should be amended through the insertion of the following new paragraph in the commission&rsquo;s terms of reference:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Commission shall, so far as practicable, recommend such arrangements in relation to the constituencies as are best calculated to result in an outcome where the number of Members of each qualifying party elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, as a proportion of the total number of Members of the D&aacute;il belonging to qualified parties, is the same proportion as the total number of first preference votes obtained by the candidates of each such qualifying party at the general election and this bears to the total number of first preference votes obtained by candidates of all qualifying parties at that election.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This would provide a more democratic outcome in a proportional representation system and I urge the Minister to take this on board.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference should also be changed to allow for the creation of six-seater constituencies. We do not have any of these currently, but this should have been considered in the Kerry scenario and would have been appropriate and more favourable than our current two three-seat constituencies.  These changes would result in a more open and transparent system for reviewing the constituencies, while preserving the principle of an independent process.  They would provide results in which the public would have greater confidence and provide a bulwark against the further erosion of our system proportional representation.  The commission itself should be looked at in the overall context of institutional reform.  The role of the commission is not something that operates in isolation from other parts of the electoral process.  This examination should result in a number of significant changes to the manner in which elections are organised and conducted in the State.</P>
        <P>In order to achieve this goal, I intend to bring before the House an electoral commission Bill that would establish a new electoral and public offices commission to take over the powers of the existing Standards in Public Office Commission and the Referendum and Constituency Commission.  The new body would also take over responsibility from local authorities for the electoral register and from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for the running of elections.  Currently there is much talk about the convergence of State agencies to bring about greater efficiency.  This area is a very obvious area for convergence.  Not only would it provide more efficient elections, but we would also get an independent structure that would ensure the basic principles of the election process, particularly of proportional representation, are protected.</P>
        <P>The Bill also provides for major changes in the process by which the constituencies are revised.  In redrawing the constituencies, the commission will be required, so far as practicable, to recommend an arrangement of constituency sizes and boundaries that is best calculated to produce an overall proportionate result.  To achieve this result, it will be able to recommend <Col N="87"/>constituencies returning three, four, five or six Members.  Currently, the maximum number is five.</P>
        <P>The commission would also be able to commence work on redrawing the constituencies on the basis of the preliminary census figures, which would be more effective than the current system.  However, I welcome the tidying up of this area to some extent within the three-month schedule, but by doing this at preliminary result stage, the job would be far easier to manage and provide for a better timeframe.  If, for example, a census is envisaged within the lifetime of the current Government, we could find ourselves in a position where we are in the middle of a commission going into the next general election.  I do not think that should be the case or that we should have commissions immediately after elections.  Commissions should have their work completed well in advance, from 18 months to two years, before any general election.</P>
        <P>The publication of a preliminary or draft report would address one of the major shortcomings of the current system, whereby once the commission produces its report, it cannot be asked to review the decision, no matter how illogical, irrational or inconsistent with its own terms of reference it may be.  This situation was reflected in the Kerry-Limerick situation, where two local authorities, operating in two different counties and incorporating two different areas, have converged.  This is probably a situation that will be redrawn and revised when the error of this approach becomes apparent.  Some of the recommendations made in the most recent report, such as the transfer of 14,000 County Limerick voters to the Kerry North constituency would fall into this category.  I am sure other Members are aware of similar cases in other constituencies.</P>
        <P>The other major area of reform relates to the compilation of the electoral register.  Despite some belated efforts made prior to the most recent election to update the register, anyone involved in active politics will be aware just how inaccurate the register remains.  Before the most recent election, some &euro;6 million was spent by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in an attempt to tidy up the register of electors, but this attempt failed spectacularly.  In some parts of Ireland the register figures exceeded the census figures by 105%.  There is something radically wrong when we have a situation where there are more registered voters for a constituency than are registered as living in it.  Northern Ireland has a smaller population than us, but it can manage an almost perfectly accurate register of electors on a budget of &euro;2.5 million a year.  We threw &euro;6 million at our system, on top of the existing budget, but still got it wrong.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>My Bill also proposes to transfer to the commission the functions of local authorities for preparing and publishing the register of electors.  The commission must seek to achieve the comprehensive, accurate and timely registration of persons entitled to be registered as electors in an efficient and economical manner.  Currently we have 34 local authorities using 34 different systems with 34 varying levels of priority.  Some local authorities take the management of the electoral system seriously, but others do not and deal with it in the basement of the city, county or town hall.  It does not have equal priority and, therefore, a disparity exists in the register of electors figures across the country.  I propose that a new commission would be entitled to access information from statutory bodies and utility companies in order to accurately record the names and addresses of electors.  Such a commission would be able to use public service identity numbers to ensure the accuracy of the register, which is the case in Northern Ireland.</P>
      
        <P>While many aspects of this Bill are positive, a number of opportunities have been lost.  The most obvious of these is the opportunity to fundamentally reform the overall structure, not by tinkering with boundaries and constituencies but by creating a commission that governs the <Col N="88"/>process of elections in this country on an independent basis.  That would result in a more efficient, effective and measurable means of running elections in this country.</P>
        <P>We are repeating the former system in regard to electoral reform.  Where 12 five seat constituencies existed, we now have 11.  The number of four seat constituencies has increased from 13 to 15, while three seat constituencies have decreased from 18 to 17.  The overall trend is a drift away from five seat constituencies.  However, an examination of the proportional representation shows that the larger the seat ratio per constituency, the better the proportional representation and the greater the democratic outcome.  Most important of all, we have more assurance that the public will have the type of representation they seek.  Unfortunately, that has been eroded by the commission&rsquo;s report and this Bill.</P>
        <P>The electoral process is the cornerstone of our democratic system.  It is essential that the public have full confidence in the reliability of the electoral register and the way in which constituency boundaries are determined.  We need to examine this issue as a totality in terms of the systems of elections as well as the structures within which they are held.  There is a need for reform in both areas.  Structural reforms are needed in respect of expanding the remit of the commission and there is a need to tidy up the systems which currently exist.  One obvious means of achieving these ends is the draft report which has been brought before us.  However, if we are to be truthful to ourselves, we should admit that our current debate holds little prospect of for this outcome.  I ask for changes to the process so that a democratic input is facilitated because the public needs to have confidence in the system.</P>
        <P>The most glaring omission in this Bill is its missed opportunity to introduce spending limits on local elections.  An anomaly exists in that while expenditure limits are imposed on general election candidates, there is no ceiling on local election spending, despite smaller voter bases and geographical areas.  The only requirement is that records of expenditure must be supplied.  We could be debating boundaries once again in three or four years time but the most immediate issue before us is the local elections.  I question the Minister&rsquo;s position on this matter, given his earlier comments on it.  It appears that his involvement in Government has diluted his opinion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm seans a fh&aacute;il labhairt ar an mBille t&aacute;bhachtach seo.  I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this issue once again and am relieved that the proposals contained in the constituency boundary report are at last being taken seriously.  When I was last afforded the opportunity to speak on the Constituency Commission&rsquo;s proposals, it was merely to make a statement on them.  I expressed disappointment at the time that members would not have an opportunity to vote on the issue and that it would be treated as an interim report.  Such was the level of respectful objection among many of the speakers that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, agreed to bring the issue back to the House in the form of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2008.</P>
        <P>Although I am disappointed that the Bill adopts the same recommendations as those of the Constituency Commission&rsquo;s report, I now have the opportunity, with other Deputies who suggested a re-examination of the recommendations, to appeal for real change.  I hope we will have some leverage to compel the relevant committee to include our suggestions on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>When I previously spoke on this subject last May, I made clear my objections to some of the Constituency Commission&rsquo;s proposals.  In particular, I remain convinced that the plan to rejig parts of north Dublin into the Dublin West constituency is ludicrous.  Many other areas will also be affected.  Limerick West is to be incorporated into Kerry North, parts of east County Meath are to be included in Louth, parts of south County Offaly will move to North Tipperary and Leitrim remains divided into two D&aacute;il constituencies.</P><Col N="89"/>
        <P>I acknowledge the reasons for this proposal and I am in no way criticising the commission itself as I know it is acting independently and has no agenda.  However, I believe it to be short-sighted in some of its recommendations.  In a bid to address the balance among the constituencies, the commission has commenced this slash and burn plan.  It is arbitrarily hacking apart constituencies and adding a portion of one constituency to another.  This slapdash approach will undoubtedly satisfy the representation ratio of 30,000 per Deputy but it is ripping apart communities and disenfranchising thousands of people.</P>
        <P>The situation in my constituency of Dublin North and neighbouring Dublin West is a case in point.  Both constituencies have too many people and too few public representatives.  It is proposed to make up the shortfall in the hugely under represented Dublin West by chopping an area containing 13,000 people out of the town of Swords.  This allows for the creation of one more seat in Dublin West.  By shifting the boundary, the population of Dublin North is also reduced to such a degree that the ratio of seats to population is more closely satisfied.</P>
        <P>Swords is the largest town in my constituency.  It has a population of 33,000 and is growing rapidly.  Fingal County Council estimates that the population of Swords will grow to upwards of 100,000 people in the next 20 years and is taking this prediction so seriously that members recently passed a plan, Your Swords, an Emerging City, to cater for the growth.  Swords is already the tenth largest town in Ireland and is larger than Navan and Kilkenny.  It is geographically isolated from Dublin West by virtue of 11 miles of agricultural land, while the M50 and the airport prevent it from sprawling into the more urban centres of Santry and Ballymun and the M1 means it will never grow as far as Malahide.  Swords is one of the single most identifiable stand-alone towns in north County Dublin, so to split it between two constituencies seems madness.  The proposals in the Constituency Commission&rsquo;s report, and now the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, definitely serve a purpose, but the same result could have been achieved through detailed consideration of all the constituencies.  Proper consideration is necessary to prevent towns being split across different constituencies just to make up the numbers.</P>
        <P>The proposal for Swords is preposterous.  It is planned to split Swords down the Main Street, with everyone to the west of the street voting in Dublin West and everyone else voting in Dublin North.  Consider the case of the River Valley area of Swords.  This is a large housing estate which generates an enormous number of queries for me every year.  The people are politically active and well aware of their public representatives.  If somebody living in the Boroimhe Estate in Swords, for example, whose children go to school in Swords village, has a problem with that school, who will they consult?  Will it be me as the representative for Dublin North or my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, because they will now vote in Dublin West?  What was a close-knit, politically active community will be bewildered as to who represents them on these issues.  I predict their disillusionment with politics.</P>
        <P>The same confusion will exist for local councillors as they prepare to work with the Deputies from two different constituencies to deal with the same issues.  This is just one example of the jurisdictional problems that will arise from the proposal to split Swords and the River Valley-Forest Road area.  The housing estates of Boroimhe, Ridgewood, Forest Road, Knocksedan and Highfields are all destined to join Castleknock, Blanchardstown, Porterstown, Clonsilla and Mulhuddart in Dublin West.  All of these areas will have a weakened electoral power.</P>
        <P>The hundreds of residents who contacted me after the commission issued its report live in fear of disenfranchisement.  At the next election they believe they will be considered the last outpost before the boundary with Dublin North, and their views will not be canvassed.  They are aware they will make up just 12% of the population of Dublin West and their opinions and needs will be secondary to those of the larger urban areas of Castleknock and Blanchardstown.  Even more galling is the likelihood that when the population expands in both constituencies, <Col N="90"/>which is certain, Swords will once again be reunified with Dublin North, making this exercise entirely pointless.  If Swords grows to 100,000 people, as predicted, and similar growth is experienced in Dublin West it is likely that both populations will support additional seats in their own right.</P>
        <P>Another ludicrous suggestion is the proposal to move the airport into the Dublin West constituency.  If one asked anybody where the airport is located, Dublin West would not be the obvious answer.  The airport is an ideological symbol of Dublin North.  It is incredibly important to the population of Dublin North, whom I represent.  To move it into the constituency of another group of Deputies is, at best, unwise and, at worst, ridiculous.</P>
        <P>In addition, areas of Portmarnock are being moved from Dublin North to Dublin North-East.  In fact, their removal is further proof of the slapdash approach the commission employed in making its recommendations.  Deputy Terence Flanagan spoke on the Bill earlier.  In the map used by the commission, two estates will remain in Dublin North while the rest of Portmarnock will be moved into Dublin North-East.  This shows how ridiculous these proposals are.  A small group of people living in Portmarnock, ten metres from their neighbours, will be represented by Deputies for Dublin North, and I will be happy to represent them, but the rest of the people will be represented by Deputies for Dublin North-East.  These proposals are short-sighted and ridiculous.</P>
        <P>I mentioned earlier that Swords is seen as a stand-alone town.  It also identifies itself primarily as a north Dublin town.  The residents of Swords have issues that are very specific to north County Dublin and they align themselves historically with the nearby towns of Balbriggan, Skerries, Donabate, Rush, Lusk, Malahide and Portmarnock.  I have been contacted by hundreds of people from Swords on this issue.  Never have I seen a proposal so violently opposed by such large numbers.  Such is the level of opposition that the community has formed a non-partisan, non-political group called the Swords Electoral Boundary Action Group.  I suggest that the Minister and the members of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government examine the group&rsquo;s excellent submission document and take on board its recommendations.</P>
        <P>The Swords Electoral Boundary Action Group raises the issue of contiguous areas and how the 1997 Electoral Act states that each constituency &ldquo;shall be composed of contiguous areas&rdquo; and that &ldquo;there shall be regard for geographical considerations including significant physical features and the extent and the density of population in each constituency&rdquo;.  This means we are legally obliged to take account of the natural geographical boundaries.  I believe the 11 km of farm land and the N2 lying between Swords and Blanchardstown should be considered the boundaries.</P>
        <P>The commission and the Minister have been at pains to explain the motivation for moving a proportion of Swords into Dublin West.  Again, it comes back to the issue of re-addressing boundaries and both would argue that the constitutional obligation to provide a balanced constituency far outweighs the legal ramifications of not obeying geographical boundaries.  However, in weighing up the issue of equality of representation versus adherence to natural townland boundaries, the Supreme Court, as outlined in the Constituency Commission&rsquo;s report, deferred to Deputies and local representatives to identify the problems arising out of redrawing boundaries.  In the section of the report relating to equality of representation, the commission quotes the Supreme Court judgment on the matter of Article 26 of the Constitution and in the matter of the Electoral Amendment Bill 1961: &ldquo;The problem of what is practicable is primarily one for the Oireachtas, whose members have knowledge of the problems and difficulties to be solved, which this court cannot have.&rdquo;</P><Col N="91"/>
        <P>These reports should be interim reports.  The Members of this House are better aware of the issues involved than a small group of people who are not as familiar with the areas.  The commission&rsquo;s report goes so far as to suggest that where the boundaries of counties, townlands and electoral divisions are to be disrupted by proposed changes, there can be a departure from the constitutional requirements relating to equality of representation.  It appears out of kilter, therefore, for the Commission to recommend the removal of 13,000 voters from Swords and to transfer them to the Dublin West constituency.</P>
        <P>As I have said previously, and I will continue to say it until somebody listens, the proposal to split Swords between two constituencies is madness.  It is a nightmare for the people of the area, the public representatives and the infrastructural services provided in the area.  The local election boundary report did not recommend that Swords be split.  The committee was recommended to follow D&aacute;il constituency boundaries and it agreed that Swords should remain a single area.  I am extremely disappointed the Minister has not taken the opportunity with this Bill to listen to the many Deputies throughout the House who can point out these deficiencies.  I hope our proposals will be listened to on Committee Stage.  That would be in the best interests of democracy.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Jimmy Deenihan.  I echo the sentiments of previous speakers.  We are debating something today that should have been debated long ago.  It is not a priority.  The commission&rsquo;s report was published last October but we are only seeing the Bill a year later.  At the same time, the health service is malfunctioning.  Women are worrying about their lives, people are dying and the economy is on its knees yet we have set aside at least an hour or two to debate this Bill.  We should be debating issues of relevance to the daily lives of people in terms of health and jobs.  However, that is not what we are doing.  We should not be discussing today a Bill that should have been dealt with months ago.  </P>
        <P>While recognising the independence of the commission and its findings, in particular in regard to the Limerick East constituency which I represent, it appears unusual that the people of Limerick are to be divided between three constituencies rather than two.  The current constituencies are Limerick East and Limerick West and it is proposed to divide Limerick into three constituencies, namely, Limerick city, Limerick and Kerry North-West Limerick.</P>
        <P>Our job is to represent the people who elect us.  More than 17,000 voters in the Limerick West constituency are to be transferred to the constituency of Limerick.  People are upset they will no longer be represented by the representatives of Limerick East with whom they have dealt for decades.  I and, I have no doubt, other representatives from the Limerick East constituency, will continue to represent these people although they will not be in a position to vote for us at the next election.</P>
        <P>The Limerick West constituency will be known as the constituency of Limerick.  More than 13,000 of the population of Limerick West will be transferred to the constituency of Kerry North-West Limerick.  These people also feel disenfranchised.  What has happened is that Kerry, in terms of population, could not sustain two three-seater constituencies.  The commission was directed in its terms of reference to ensure, where practicable, constituencies were retained within county boundaries.  Transferring a population of 13,000 from one constituency to a constituency in another county does not make sense.</P>
        <P>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch stated earlier that the constituency of Limerick West will fall between two local authority areas, Kerry and Limerick, which will cause difficulties in operational terms.  People are anxious.  Areas such as Kilteely, Cappamore, Doon, Pallasgreen, Oolagh, Moroe, Herbertstown, Hospital and Caherconlish currently part of Limerick East will be part of a new constituency.  Clearly, Limerick was sacrificed to ensure the retention of the two three-seater <Col N="92"/>constituencies in Kerry.  I mean no disrespect to the people of Kerry who are great neighbours.  However, given it is stated in the terms of reference that constituencies should be retained in county boundaries, one must question this decision.</P>
        <P>In summary, we should not be debating this issue today.  There are far more important things happening at the moment.  One such issue was raised earlier by way of private notice question.  Issues of concern are those relating to health and people&rsquo;s worries about the economy going forward in terms of employment.  I will continue to represent the people of Limerick East who will be part of the new constituency of Limerick.  They gave me a mandate to represent them and I will continue to do so.</P>
        <P>I regret that this issue is being debated in the House today.  There are far more important issues we could be debating.  It is difficult for the people of the eastern part of Limerick to accept what is happening.  However, we accept the independence of the commission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously, I am affected to a large extent by this Bill.  As previous speakers including Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell have said, the county of Limerick is to be divided into three different constituencies, Limerick, Limerick city and Kerry North-West Limerick.  This will create a great deal of confusion for people in this region and may result in representatives from boundary areas being closer to them than those who represent them.  </P>
        <P>I would like if the Minister could give us some assurance that these will be the boundaries going into the next election.  If not, there will be considerable pressure on representatives in terms of the level of service they provide to their constituents.  This would be unfair to representatives and the communities they represent.  It would make little sense if we were to have another review and another formation of constituencies.  I appeal to any future commission to ensure it puts in place what is being proposed here today.</P>
        <P>More than 5,098 of the population of north Kerry will be transferred to the Kerry South constituency.  Obviously, I will miss that part of my constituency because I had built up a strong connection with a large number of the electorate there.  Many of the communities involved are disappointed that I and other representatives with whom they are familiar will no longer be representing them.  However, being transferred to the constituency of Kerry South may not affect them as much as will the transfer of more than 13,000 people from Limerick West to the constituency of Kerry North, given that transfer will take them over a county boundary.  I hope the new constituency will be recognised as the constituency of Limerick West and Kerry North.  It is important to impress upon the communities of Limerick West that this will be the case and that they will not be isolated.  It is not the case that they are being plucked and put into the constituency of Kerry North.  Politicians representing that area will be representing a different geographical area and should represent it accordingly.</P>
        <P>I have examined precedent in this regard.  Coincidentally, during the second and third D&aacute;la, Kerry and Limerick West were part of the same constituency.  It was an eight-seater at that time and the constituency of Limerick city and Limerick East was a four-seater.  In the third D&aacute;il, which was in June 1922 &mdash; the first D&aacute;il was in May 1921 &mdash; Kerry and Limerick West were one constituency.  Thus, there is a precedent for a connection between Kerry and Limerick West.  In 1923, Kerry became a seven-seater and Limerick a seven-seater.  In a way, it is history repeating itself.</P>
        <P>West Limerick has a close affinity with north Kerry, especially in border communities such as Athea and Moyvane.  Over the years there has been much to-ing and fro-ing across the border.  They have great cultural links through music and dance.  West Limerick has a strong literary tradition and poets such as D&aacute;ibh&iacute; &Oacute; Bruadair and Michael Hartnett had strong connections with north Kerry.  In agriculture, both north Kerry and west Limerick are strong dairying <Col N="93"/>areas.  Now most of the milk suppliers provide milk to the Kerry group because of the amalgamation of Golden Vale and Kerry.  There are bonds among the agricultural community as well.</P>
        <P>With regard to infrastructure, the N69 is an important road for both west Limerick and north Kerry.  This certainly represents a connection between the two parts of the constituency.  The Shannon Estuary also represents a strong bond between the two areas, knitting together both sides of the constituency.  Now, with exciting things happening in the Shannon Estuary, including a natural gas project, the new arrangement may provide more focus on this area and on the important land bank in Tarbert and Ballylongford.  This will benefit communities in both north Kerry and west Limerick, and will give a new focus to the Shannon Estuary and new hope to Tarbert Island now that the power station is being privatised and taken over by a Spanish company.  Certainly, it will lead to a new dynamic within those parts of Kerry and Limerick.  For that reason, the new constituency may have many advantages for both communities.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to refer to the status of the change.  Is there certainty that these constituencies will be in place going into the next election?  It is important that the position is clarified.  Will the commission sit again, with the result that new constituencies will be formed going into the next election?  I ask the Minister to reassure us on that point.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate, the subject of which will have a severe impact on me and the area I represent in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in the future.</P>
        <P>The report of the Constituency Commission recommends further partitioning of the area I represent in the House.  It recommends transferring a further 6,776 people, the electorate of the areas of Kells town, Kells rural district and Stahalmog, from the constituency of Meath West to Meath East.  County town and parish boundaries have been disregarded and, under the proposals, Kells town and its natural hinterland are to be in separate constituencies.  Kells is a rural town with close links to the surrounding villages and smaller towns of north Meath.  The future economic well-being of the greater Kells area would be best served by keeping the entire area in one D&aacute;il constituency.</P>
        <P>The greater north Meath area has been subjected to serious territorial change over the years.  In 1973, part of it was transferred into the constituency of Cavan.  The population of the area then helped elect the late and great John P. Wilson, a former Minister and T&aacute;naiste, to this House.  Another part of north Meath was transferred to the constituency of Monaghan, where its electorate helped elect the great former Minister and Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Rory O&rsquo;Hanlon.  In later years, however, both areas were returned to the Meath constituency.  Indeed, my great friend and colleague with whom I have served for more than 34 years, Michael Lynch, who was elected to this House on two occasions and to Seanad &Eacute;ireann, is from this area.</P>
        <P>Prior to the 2007 election, County Meath was divided again when the constituencies of Meath West and Meath East were established.  Unfortunately, I lost a large part of my constituency, in Slane, Navan and, in the case of Kells, an area extending from Moynalty to Meath Hill, to my colleague and great friend Deputy Thomas Byrne.  This included areas such as Carlanstown, Newcastle, Tierworker, Kilmainham Wood, Kilbeg, Nobber and Drumcondra, which were part of the Kells electoral area.  Unfortunately, this area is now being changed again.  The previous changes affected parish boundaries and the new proposals in the latest review will transfer three quarters of my parish of Kells to Meath East.  Parts of the parishes of Carlanstown and <Col N="94"/>Carnaross were transferred to Meath East under the previous boundary changes.  It is unfair to split parishes in two.  I take the opportunity to thank the people of Kells and Stahalmog for giving me over 60% of the vote in that area in previous elections.  As a public representative, first as a county councillor and now as a TD, I have represented the town of Kells and its rural hinterland for more than 34 years.  The electorate of the area do not want to lose a representative who has served them for such a long time.  The Kells area has been affected most by the decision to divide the county into two constituencies.</P>
        <P>I note in respect of the Meath and Louth constituencies that the commission recommends extending the Louth constituency by moving the Meath East environs of Drogheda into the electoral constituency of Louth.  The report also highlights the need for a transfer of population from Meath West to Meath East.  I note the Constituency Commission does not make a recommendation in this regard but instead proposes the transfer of a population of 6,776 in the Ceanannas M&oacute;r area from Meath West to Meath East.  If the rapid population growth in Meath West and Meath East continues at the rates indicated in the latest census, further changes will be required in the next constituency review.  In consideration of this and based on the difference in the words used, the commission&rsquo;s proposal, as opposed to recommendation, to move Kells from Meath West to Meath East does not require implementation.</P>
        <P>The recommendations of the report are inconsistent, confusing and unprecedented, and do not take into account the preservation of natural communities.  While I fully recognise that the Constituency Commission is an independent body, its independence does not confer on it the status of infallibility.  Recommendations made from a mathematical perspective with no consideration for the democratic rights of local communities are wrong.  The fragmentation of closely knit communities across north Meath threatens the co-ordination of future growth in the area.  The Electoral Act 1997 states that &ldquo;each constituency shall be composed of contiguous areas&rdquo; and that &ldquo;there shall be regard to geographic considerations including significant physical features and the extent of and the density of population in each constituency&rdquo;.  Surely people in north Meath should not be disenfranchised because of the density of population in towns such as Ratoath, Dunboyne and Ashbourne.  I do not understand why the Constituency Commission chose not to consider moving those areas to Dublin constituencies such as Dublin West and Dublin North with which they are more aligned, rather than depriving people in parts of north Meath of a Deputy who has served them for 34 years.  It is very unfair.  I cannot understand why they never looked at those areas.</P>
        <P>In the previous change, I was lucky that part of Westmeath &mdash; the Coole electoral area &mdash; came into the Meath West constituency.</P>
        <P>I ask the Acting Chairman to tell me when my time is up.</P>

	<P>Unfortunately this time I am getting no extra ground which is very unfair.  In the new European constituencies, most of Meath West is in the Ireland East constituency and part of the Meath West constituency &mdash; the Coole area of Westmeath &mdash; will be in the Ireland North-West constituency, which is also very unfair to the people of that area.</P>
        <P>Section 6(2)(<i>f</i>) also states: &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this section, the Commission shall endeavour to maintain continuity in relation to the arrangement of constituencies&rdquo;.  The Electoral Act 1997 also recommends that &ldquo;the breaching of county boundaries shall be avoided as far as practicable&rdquo;.  On behalf of the people I have represented in this House for the past 11 <Col N="95"/>years I ask why north Meath should be subjected to such divisive and unfair decisions for electoral purposes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeBehan"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Behan</NameTxt>
	<P>At the outset I take the opportunity to thank the staff of the Oireachtas Library and research service whose work is vital to the quality of debate in the D&aacute;il and Seanad Chambers.  I have used the special debate packs on a number of occasions to date and I have found them to be an excellent aid to preparation and research prior to making a contribution to a debate such as this.  I have read all of the debate pack regarding this vital legislation and I have yet again found it to contain all the essential background material necessary to achieve a broad understanding of the Bill as well as being informative as to the views of interested parties within and outside the House.</P>
        <P>I will of course be supporting the passage of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill through this Chamber as it reflects the decision of the Government to implement the recommendations of the Constituency Commission report of 2007 as well as including other legislative amendments reflecting court decisions regarding electoral law.  However, I will also be taking up the invitation of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government as quoted by the <i>Irish Examiner</i> on 24 October 2007 when he said: &ldquo;Deputies from all sides of the House will no doubt have views on specific recommendations and they will have the opportunity to raise them during debate on the legislation.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill to comply with the High Court judgment of June 2007 allowing for the establishment of future constituency commissions on publication by the CSO of preliminary census results and allowing for the finalisation of the commission&rsquo;s work after the CSO final report is published.  I note this allows much work to be done in a timely manner while ensuring final decisions are made on the final figures.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the relaxation of the onerous assent requirements on non-party candidates in future local and European Parliament elections.  I also welcome the reasonable deposit rates set out for local and European Parliament candidates in lieu of obtaining assents.  I believe passionately that democracy is a precious gift bequeathed to us by our forefathers and it is essential the barriers to any citizen of this State wishing to stand for election should be so small as to be invisible.  I would quibble with the provision to withhold the deposit from candidates who receive less than 25% of a quota, but I still believe the basic deposit required is achievable for all who wish to stand.</P>
        <P>Those are elements of the Bill which I praise.  I turn to some elements of the proposed legislation with which I have some difficulty or to put it more accurately with the Constituency Commission report and its implications for democracy.  I cannot understand why the commission did not increase the total number of Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann from the present total of 166 to the number to which it could have statutorily agreed which is 168.  The number of 166 has been set since 1980 &mdash; 28 years ago.  Our population as measured at that time was 3,368,217.  Our population according to the 2006 census was 4,239,848, an increase of more than 25%.  It is unbelievable that the commission did not see fit to decide that the people were entitled to the maximum allowable number of D&aacute;il Deputies given such an increase in population.  What is even more astounding is the lack of comment on this failure across the political spectrum.  I do not know whether this is because of political correctness or whether it is because the media are constantly critical of Members of this House right across party lines and it might have been seen as an attempt to increase the number of these &ldquo;useless&rdquo; Deputies.  It is amazing that we as a body did not respond more vigorously to what I regard as a very basic failure of the commission to allow two additional Deputies when we have a 25% increase in the population.  This failure is one of the most significant of all in this commission report and I remain completely unconvinced by the weak justification offered for this failure.</P><Col N="96"/>
        <P>I agree with many Members of this House, some of whom have already spoken, in my exasperation at the continuing trampling by the Constituency Commission across county boundaries.  The people of more and more counties must acclimatise to electoral boundaries which make absolutely no geographical or administrative sense.  Given that the county has been the administrative unit of our country since the foundation of the State I cannot understand how this tradition can be ignored so fundamentally every time a new Constituency Commission report is prepared.  It is high time that we, as elected Members of this body, take this matter extremely seriously.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will shortly personalise the matter to my constituency.  However, Members should first consider the much-quoted example of County Leitrim.  It would be easy for natives of County Leitrim to believe that this Constituency Commission is out to get them because not alone has the county been split in two but the division in population decided by the commission is such that it is impossible for Leitrim to elect a Deputy of its own.  This state of affairs is completely unacceptable.  I have nothing to gain from any change regarding Leitrim but it is not right and should be addressed as a matter of urgency.  It is important to note that the largest number of submissions on any issue received by the commission was made on behalf of people living in Leitrim who wanted to include all of County Leitrim in one constituency.  However, the commission stated it was not possible to find a solution that met the concerns in the submissions and had no undesirable impact on the configuration of other constituencies.  So the message the people of Leitrim can take from that is that it is acceptable to have decisions undesirable to Leitrim people but not to anyone else.  The people of Leitrim are being classed by this commission as second-class citizens which is wrong.  It is unacceptable to me and it should be unacceptable to all of us as democrats.  My constituency suffers from this geographically nonsensical approach by the Constituency Commission.  Happy and willing as I am to serve the needs of my constituents from east Carlow &mdash; Rathvilly, Hacketstown and Clonmore &mdash; they are not well served where their local county administration is in County Carlow but their TDs are in County Wicklow.  It is madness and it must change.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to the Taoiseach who, before the summer, floated an idea in the Chamber that perhaps members of all parties could get together to discuss the implications of this report to see if the lack of respect for county boundaries could be addressed.  It is regrettable that the idea was seized on as an effort to interfere with the impartial and independent process set up by the commission.  What happened was that the Government said it would allow the report to go through to the D&aacute;il Members.  We, as Members, have a responsibility to try to address this issue and, if necessary, change the law and the Constitution to ensure that all future constituencies, whether single or double county, are coterminous with county boundaries.  The people who live in disenfranchised counties, such as Leitrim, deserve no less.  Furthermore, if this matter was to put to a vote of the people it would be resoundingly supported.</P>

	<P>Despite the fact that the report was published last October, we are only discussing the Bill now, almost 12 months later.  There has been much delay and uncertainty as to whether the Government would introduce the report as it was or, as the Taoiseach suggested, discuss the division of counties.  He was particularly vulnerable on that point because the proposals in the commission&rsquo;s report affect his own constituency.  Nevertheless, we are discussing it now.  Given that the report implements the CSO figures prior to the 2007 general election, the delay is considerable.  I am pleased that one part of the Bill stipulates that in <Col N="97"/>future once the CSO figures are produced that will kick start such a report and it will be able to use the preliminary figures rather than the final report.  That is a positive development, given the time delay in getting to this point.  The Bill still has to go through Committee and Remaining Stages.  If that is the case, we expect the next CSO publication in 2011, following which there should be a report in 2012.  Some speakers have said they hope there will be no further change before the next general election.  Nobody knows.  According to the figures I have given, the chances are there will be a new review before the next general election if the Government goes full term.  I hope we do not get to that because we had difficulties prior to the 2007 general election where the constitutionality of the boundaries in place at that time was challenged.  As a result of that judicial review there is a provision in the Bill which provides that once the CSO publishes its figures that will kick start a boundary review.</P>
        <P>My constituency is not affected.  However, the adjacent constituency, Cork North-Central, will go from four seats to five.  In the previous review, Cork City and county had 18 seats but will now have 19.  Also in this review it is proposed that there will be a seat loss in the Limerick-Kerry area, the Acting-Chairman&rsquo;s area.  This is a stark reminder of how these seats have gone to the east of the country and it underlines the population drift.  That is for another debate, and one that should take place, in regard to where we are going in terms of decentralisation and investing in the regions to ensure there is not over-population of the east.  What is happening is that everything is drifting to the east.  Looking to the future, we need to invest in the regions to ensure a vibrant population in those areas.  That seats are drifting to the east in this review underlines that fact.</P>
        <P>While my constituency has not been affected, I agree that county boundaries should not be divided.  Leitrim is a point in case.  It is probably impossible to elect a representative from the Leitrim area now.  Kerry North-Limerick East is a new constituency.  There are people in that area who will have representation from a different county.  That is not the ideal way forward.  That same applies in Tipperary North and Offaly.  There will be different local authorities in those areas.  There will be a D&aacute;il constituency but yet two local authorities will be responsible for that constituency.  That is difficult and not an ideal situation.</P>
        <P>The recent local authority boundary review tried as far as possible to stick with the D&aacute;il constituency boundaries.  That is welcome.  Under this review, five counties are affected, including Leitrim.  I hope this trend does not continue because the people living in those areas are not be happy, and certainly their representatives are not happy.  It will lead to difficulties and confusion in regard to local authority areas.  I would like to see that issue addressed.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that the number of five seat constituencies has been reduced as they contributed much to our democracy.  They gave smaller parties an opportunity to gain representation which would not happen if there was a dearth of three seat constituencies.  It is important to maintain them because when one looks back at previous elections and the way in which proportional representation delivered seats for the smaller parties, it happened generally in the five seat constituencies.</P>
        <P>I am pleased the programme for Government proposed that an electoral commission be established to look at constituency boundaries, maintain the electoral register and act as a watchdog for political funding.  It is an interesting proposal. Professor Richard Sinnott has been engaged by the Minister to look at the proposal.  I will be interested to see his findings.</P>
        <P>Much work needs to be done on the electoral register.  We have had many negative reports, although it varies across local authority areas.  It was good in my area but there are areas which had a population of 105%.  Obviously there is a great deal of movement in the population with people renting homes and apartments and the register is not up to speed.  I look forward to the report on that issue.</P><Col N="98"/>
        <P>It is a shame there has been such a long delay in getting to this point.  I hope the provision in the Bill that will kick start a review, once the CSO figures are produced will help us to avoid such a long delay in the future.  Following a two and a half month break from the House, I am disappointed that in a Bill such this, which has been kicking around for a long time, that is all the Government has to put on the table today.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the debate later this evening on the economy.  It will be an opportunity for people to share their views.  Certainly my party has some positive proposals in that area.  However, we would have preferred if the Government had devoted its time to such a debate today.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Dinny McGinley.  Like Deputy Clune I thought there would be much more important business in the D&aacute;il today.  That is not to say that this matter is not important but the thinking of the Government must be that it will not last long.  I suppose it wants to get its act together and deal with this business.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I listened recently to proposals by the Green Party, made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.  What he mentioned was new, namely, funding between elections and the amount of money councillors can spend.  The latest thing is that the Minister does not want posters and therefore we cannot have posters up on poles or outside polling booths.  Now that Deputy Gormley is in government he will be like all the others and will never wish to leave it.  The sad thing, and one cannot know what may happen, is that he might bring in a Bill putting an end to further elections and might stay in power forever.</P>
        <P>The Minister must watch himself.  One time there was a party known as the PDs.  Its Deputies used to sit over with Fianna F&aacute;il.  They are not there anymore.  I can assure the House that the Green Party will go the same way after the next elections.  It will no longer sit where it used to and it will not be on this side of the House either.  The Minister ought not to rush to get rid of posters and elections.</P>
        <P>I have a few observations to make in respect of this particular Bill.  One concerns the European election.  I heard Deputy Brady express concerns and he is right.  A huge constituency will be created in the north west, to include Mayo, Galway, Roscommon, Donegal, Westmeath, extending to Longford.  For a three-seater constituency this is an enormous area.  I wish to assure the Deputy that if I am still in the field and am elected, I will look after Meath for him.  He need not worry.  The people of Meath will not be forgotten as long as I am there.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In respect of this Bill there is an issue I would have preferred the Minister to discuss when he was talking about boundary changes in both the European and the D&aacute;il elections.  I cannot understand why there is such resistance to appointing people to deal with the registers.  There is no doubt that local authorities have failed.  We saw this happen before the last election and, in all fairness to the Minister, he had to put funding in place to allow local authorities put people on the register.  What is nobody&rsquo;s business is everybody&rsquo;s business.  The time has come for the Minister to give that responsibility to somebody.  At present the updating of the register is not even given out as a summer job scheme for students.  They <Col N="99"/>might earn some euro going out and knocking on doors, at apartments and flats, trying to get people onto the register.  Nothing is more annoying at election time than to have people who genuinely want to vote being prevented from doing so.</P>
        <P>What has happened in my own consitutuency is that certain people who were on the register have been knocked off it, for one reason or another, when it was reprinted.  There is also the situation of people who have been dead for years but whose cards come through the door during every election period causing upset to their families.  Their loved ones may have been dead for up to seven years without the matter having been sorted out.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I say to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and to the Government that there are enough people in Departments now who might be able to think up a scheme or do something about this electoral issue.  It should be taken away from local authorities, which are not prepared to deal with it, and should be given to somebody although not to an agency.  We have enough quangos in this country.  The undertaking could be given to schools during the summer.  A certain number of people in each county might be employed in a summer job scheme.  They would earn a few euro to get into college and they would be given some responsibility.  In that way, the register would be updated every year.  It is a simple suggestion and would not cost a fortune.</P>
        <P>Local authorities take people on for the summer.  In this case why not have, for instance, 40 people employed in each local authority?  Their job would be to update the register of electors and they would be paid for the summer months.  I see nothing wrong with the suggestion and it should be taken on board by the Minister and the Government.  That would stop the situation whereby, in every election I have fought, from town council to county council to the D&aacute;il, there has always been criticism of the register.  I cannot understand why we, as practising politicians, do not put such a scheme in place.  The suggestion I have offered the Minister is not a big idea and it is one that the Government might consider.</P>
        <P>I shall finish on this note.  I am in a five-seat constituency which at one time was two three-seaters.  I have spoken about this before and now I put it on the record once again.  It is unfair when boundaries are extended beyond natural areas, counties and actual borders.  Mayo is one of the largest counties in the country and it is impossible to travel from one part of the constituency to the other.  I say the following against myself, as I have done previously.  I see nothing wrong with having even a three-seater and a two-seater but to have a five-seater in such a large county is ridiculous.  It is not good for the health of Deputies to travel all over the county.  I leave my home on a Saturday and go to north Mayo and am 70 miles away, doing clinics.  If I have to go to Ballina the situation is the same.  At a public meeting the other night I was 35 miles from my home.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is all very well for the media to say that such work is not part of my job.  I say to the Dublin 4 brigade that it may not be the job but if a Deputy does not keep in touch with the people and does not go to public meetings the people will soon put him or her out of this House.  It is a pity that the Dublin 4 media can help to put a Deputy out but they cannot help put one in.  If a Deputy does not keep in contact with the people, those same people will soon lose contact with him or her.</P>

        <P>We appreciate that there is an independent commission, though it has been a year since its report, which was a year late.  I wonder if what we are discussing today and what is embodied in this Bill will be relevant in 2012 as there will be another census in 2011.  This remains to be seen.</P>
        <P>There are two constituencies in my county and Donegal South-West seems to always gain territory on Donegal North-East.  As far as I am concerned, we in Donegal South-West have now gained Lifford, Raphoe, Ballindrait and down as far as St. Johnston to near Manorcunningham.  I welcome these areas to Donegal South-West as the changes indicate that the population of Letterkenny has exploded and that my constituency must get more territory to balance this.</P>
        <P>I assure people in these places that I will give them the same service and attention that I have given to the rest of south Donegal in the past 27 years.</P>

	<P>I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2008.  I am glad I was in the House to hear the profound statements of Deputies Ring and McGinley, both of whom seem to be dealing with their future political prospects.  I hope Deputy Flanagan will convey my good wishes to them in that regard.</P><Col N="101"/>
        <P>The Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2008 provides for the revision of D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies in accordance with the recommendations of the report of the Constituency Commission which was presented to the Ceann Comhairle in October 2007.  It is appropriate to remind ourselves that the Bill also provides for the establishment of future constituency commissions, on publication by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, of its preliminary results in respect of a census of population and for the work of a commission to be completed following the publication of final population data relating to the relevant census.</P>
        <P>I have been listening carefully to the debate thus far and it is interesting to hear the different perspectives of colleagues from all sides of the House.  This is an important Bill.  Opposition colleagues are entitled to make the points they have about the kind of day we are having and the kind of business we should deal with but many of their speeches have been so impressive and pertinent that I wonder why they suggested we should not have this debate.  This is a good debate and there will be time for other issues to be raised on other occasions, including this evening.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I had a long discussion today with my colleague, Deputy Michael Mulcahy, who represents Crumlin, where I come from, in Dublin South-Central.  We discussed D&aacute;il constituency boundaries.  It is right that they form part of this debate but we should also discuss boundaries for the forthcoming local and European elections and the effect they will have.  I will take a leaf from Deputy Michael Ring&rsquo;s book and clarify that I will not seek a Fianna F&aacute;il nomination for the European elections next year.  I look forward to supporting my Dublin colleague, Eoin Ryan.</P>
        <P>The European elections will be very interesting because section 8 of the Bill says it will provide for European Parliament constituencies and the number of members to be elected from Ireland by substituting a new third schedule to the European Parliament Elections Act 1997.  In the context of 12 representatives from this country in the European Parliament, this provides for the reduction of one seat in the Dublin constituency and the transfer of the population of counties Longford and Westmeath from the east to the north-west constituency.  Deputy Michael Ring referred to this matter so I will not dwell on it.</P>
        <P>However, I am interested in Dublin and there is a great deal of disappointment there regarding this matter.  Europe is very important to the whole country and I do not want to make a speech that focuses solely on Dublin.  Nonetheless, Dublin is the capital city and it is important that it be strongly represented.  It is a pity Dublin is to lose a seat but this will make for a competitive election &mdash; it is only a little over 250 days away.  I wish all of the sitting MEPs in Dublin well, particularly Eoin Ryan.  There is a debate to be had on the level of representation and the reduction in seats will be of concern to people.  I find that as I go about my business in Dublin people are beginning to talk about the European and local elections.  This debate will become more relevant as the elections approach.  We should, therefore, look at it in the context of this Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was a little older than some when I was first elected to the local authority in Dublin in 1991.  The local authority was subsequently divided and South Dublin County Council was founded in 1994.  I remained a member of the local authority until after a D&aacute;il election, when I stood down in favour of a colleague.  I have been lucky in my D&aacute;il career because my constituency is fairly well formed.  Deputy Ring spoke of having to travel 70 or 80 miles and I know many colleagues, including those in the House at the moment, share that difficulty.  However, I find that, as a Dublin-based TD who lives only eight miles from the city centre, I experience other challenges.  My challenges are different from those facing colleagues who must travel 70 or 80 miles to attend meetings but sometimes it can be just as difficult getting around a densely populated urban setting such as Dublin South-West.  I do not want to seem like a martyr; I am <Col N="102"/>merely saying that there are other challenges that face urban-based Deputies.  There are still problems but I have been lucky in how my constituency has been formed.</P>
        <P>I listened carefully to Deputy Joe Behan as he spoke from a Wicklow perspective.  I reminded him that when I first moved to Tallaght with an employer in 1969 it was part of the Dublin South constituency.  I inform my Opposition colleagues that in those days there were three Fine Gael TDs there, including a good man, Richard Burke.  I mention him because he was very good to me and was a fine EU Commissioner and Minister for Education.  When I first attended the D&aacute;il as a Deputy in 2002 he happened to be here, greeted me and brought me for lunch.  I always remember him and the courtesy he extended me when I did not even know my way around the building.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 1977 the new mid-county constituency was founded and the three Deputies elected were Se&aacute;n Walsh and S&iacute;le de Valera for Fianna F&aacute;il and Larry McMahon for Fine Gael.  In those days the constituency stretched from Rathfarnham, through parts of Templeogue, into Tallaght and out to Blessington.  Quite a few people who were originally from my constituency have moved to Blessington and any Deputies for Dublin South-West will attest that we still receive calls from Blessington.  I do not say this to upset my Wicklow colleagues.  To put things in perspective, places like Blessington are closer to Tallaght than to Bray.  I do not mean to put pressure on my Wicklow colleagues but this illustrates that Constituency Commission reports do not always reach conclusions that everyone can understand.  The people I meet at front doors certainly do not understand the decisions in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When I was first elected in 2002 parts of Firhouse had been taken from Dublin South and joined Tallaght, Templeogue and parts of Terenure in Dublin South-West.  It is interesting that the subsequent Constituency Commission report referred to these boundaries, particularly on the M50 side.  It observed that the M50 would act as a natural boundary for Dublin South-West.  However, the commission did not follow through on this nor does the latest report.  Many Members travel in that direction on their way home, to the south in particular, and Dublin South-West stretches from Walkinstown, through parts of Terenure and Templeogue, on to Firhouse and into Bohernabreena.  It extends across the mountain into parts of Brittas and back down into Tallaght and the Naas Road acts as a boundary.</P>
        <P>While it is for other people to make decisions on this issue, I often drive out of Tallaght heading for Brittas or County Wicklow and pass houses that are located in the Dublin Mid-West constituency, which forms part of Lucan.  Brittas itself is divided, as parts of it lie within Dublin South-West while the remainder is represented by my colleagues in Dublin Mid-West.  One wonders how such decisions about the boundaries are taken.</P>
        <P>I put this in the context of listening to colleagues discussing the changes within counties Kerry or Limerick or, as did Deputy Michael Kennedy, about north Dublin.  Clearly, the Constituency Commission has thrown up different kinds of problems for them than it has for me.  However, although my country-based colleagues may not greatly appreciate it, this throws up challenges for parts of my constituency.  It throws up confusion for some constituents who are unsure exactly where is the boundary or what constituency they are in.  This presents a challenge for all Members and it is right to say this during a debate on the Constituency Commission&rsquo;s report.  I repeat that I consider my D&aacute;il boundary to be reasonable.  However, given population changes and with further development, certainly in west Tallaght, Ballycullen and elsewhere, future boundary commissions, perhaps even the next one, may make some decisions in that regard, as well as making some significant changes.</P>
        <P>I also wish to speak about significant changes in the context of the forthcoming local elections, which are due to be held next June and which will be challenging in political terms.  I <Col N="103"/>already have made the point that I was proud to be a member of the local authority from 1991.  When I was first selected, I represented Tallaght-Rathcoole.  When I was re-elected in 1999, I represented Tallaght Central.  Those Members who are familiar with Tallaght know that at present, there are ten seats in two electoral areas in Tallaght, namely, Tallaght South and Tallaght Central.  The proposals from the Constituency Commission on the local elections will change them into two separate new constituencies, called Tallaght South and Tallaght Central, which are five-seaters and six-seaters, respectively.</P>
        <P>Tallaght Central stretches almost from the County Kildare border at Old Kingswood on the Naas Road, through the Tallaght west estates, on into Springfield where I live, down through parts of Tallaght towards what is understood at present to be the Terenure electoral area.  As Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh will understand, it then continues down Wainsfort Road into Fortfield and people who are represented by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh and other colleagues.  When knocking on doors in such areas, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh will be telling people they are in Tallaght Central.  The Constituency Commission has thrown up the kind of challenge that has nothing to do with community development because local authority boundaries, like any boundary, should have some meaning.  While I do not wish to be controversial by talking about parts of Dublin South-Central, colleagues from all parties will be obliged to stretch themselves in that fashion.</P>
        <P>I have been surprised there has not been a reaction thus far from the communities to calling such a huge electoral area Tallaght Central.  It will cause problems for colleagues and while I will not predict the outcome of the elections, it is a six-seater and it will be interesting to learn how it will work out.  Such a constituency will give rise to challenges about how many seats will be won at one end of it, in this case Tallaght, and the other.  As it breaches D&aacute;il constituency boundaries, it will make for quite a challenge and debate.  I have been surprised there has not been more community reaction.  As someone who came from a strong community background and who strongly believes in representing local people on local issues, the work should be about ensuring proper community development and cohesion.  Everyone has difficulties and problems when representing different communities.  This certainly is the case in my constituency.  However, I believe the new Tallaght Central electoral area that has been thrown up by the Constituency Commission will be particularly difficult and it will be interesting to learn how it works out.</P>
        <P>While people may think politicians do not look forward to elections, they always are interesting and demanding.  Many of my colleagues already are counting off the 250-odd days to the election and are looking forward to them.</P>

	<P>While it had been my intention to speak on this issue before it was raised by Deputy Ring, he made an important point regarding the work of local authorities in respect of future elections.  There have been great debates previously on the register of electors and the manner in which it is dealt with.  In common with all Members, not a day passes in which I do not receive a call to the effect that I have written to someone who has moved on or, unfortunately, has died.  It happens to all Members and always is upsetting.  However, for all those who work from the registers and try to make sense of them while simultaneously trying to interpret them from a perspective of local knowledge, there always are times when people will be upset because one has written to them, called on them or whatever.  My father, who was living in Kilnamanagh, Tallaght at the time of his death, has been dead for 12 years and my sister still receives occasional letters addressed to him for all sorts of reasons, although he has been off the register for a considerable time.</P><Col N="104"/>
        <P Just="Left">Although this happens, I believe the register of electors still is seriously flawed.  This does not simply pertain to Tallaght, Dublin South-West or south County Dublin because I listen to colleagues on all sides who make exactly the same point.  I am sure the Ministers of State who are present, Deputies M&aacute;ire Hoctor and Tony Killeen, understand the same issues.  It is important to establish that something must be done in this regard.  In recent years, the issue has come up on a regular basis and it certainly arises when elections approach.  Although Members hold debates and discuss how the registers will be organised, problems remain.  I glanced at the Dublin South-West register over the weekend and even with my limited knowledge, found people who no longer are at the addresses provided and who, for one reason or other, no longer seek their vote there.  Together with other colleagues, I would be interested to know the extent of the problem and what will be done about it.</P>
        <P>While I apologise for mentioning Deputy Ring so frequently, he referred to one solution to deal with this issue.  While I always have taken the view the local authority should be in the best position to deal with the issues because it is on the ground, to an extent this does not work.  Last time, many attempts were made nationwide to tidy up the register and to create a situation whereby people who did not inform the local authority somehow found themselves off the register.  People, not simply in my community, who had been on the register for all their lives suddenly found themselves going to the polling station only to discover they were not on the register.</P>
        <P>While I do not wish to say too much about this case, during the vote on the Lisbon treaty I spoke to a local bishop who did not get a vote.  As a local bishop, he is well known.  However, he went to his polling station, produced his identification and was not given his ballot.  I cannot understand how this can happen.  It emphasises the point made by me and by Members on all sides that the register of electors needs attention.  Members keep talking about it and demanding action.  As day follows night, next June and July colleagues will be here making the point that constituents went to a polling station but could not vote.  It is relevant to this business at a time when we are talking strongly about promoting voting in all areas.  Parts of my constituency of Dublin South-West have particular challenges with regard to getting people out to vote and I spend much time, as other colleagues do, trying to get the message across to groups such as secondary school pupils about the importance of voting.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have always taken the view that citizenship is the more important issue.  If one is to look for votes, they will certainly not come about if people are not registered or not coming out to vote.  We all have a role to play in that regard and we must keep to getting that message across.  To be parochial, we have a local organisation in Tallaght with An Cos&aacute;n, of which I am sure many Deputies have heard.  It engaged with the four local Deputies &mdash; Deputies Conor Lenihan, Brian Hayes, Pat Rabbitte and myself &mdash; at the last election and we helped promote a project to get people registered and interested in voting.  It is important we do so.</P>
        <P>I know other colleagues have different views about the kind of day we have had in the D&aacute;il.  I am very happy we are back.  My young granddaughter, Heather, told me this morning that she had heard adults saying I was back in work.  I had to gently correct her and say all Deputies had been working away throughout the summer, apart from a short break.  Whatever the kind of agenda we have today, the business before us is important and I look forward to the passage of this Bill.  I wish the Minister well as he goes about his business and thank the Acting Chairman for his courtesy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill will pass, as the previous speaker has stated, but I am not certain at this stage that it should.  We all believe the establishment of an independent commission to consider boundary revisions because of shifts in population, such as increases or decreases, was a very good idea.  We all have an interest in the democratic process but those of us with a specific personal interest should never be part of the boundary process.  Everyone would agree that the independence of the commission is vital.</P>
        <P>Being independent does not make it infallible, although some of the lads behind me might not think that true.  I know two of the people on this commission.  Despite the fact that the people are very eminent, well read and versed in politics, what they have done in redrawing in this case makes no sense in many areas.</P>
        <P>I will speak about my own constituency as that is the place we all know best.  When it was last redrawn, Cork North-Central went down to four seats for all sorts of reasons.  I take the view in life that one takes the hand that is dealt.  It went to four seats because a five-seater constituency could not be sustained due to population shift.</P>
        <P>This shift is explained away very easily as the type of infrastructural development which took place on the south side of Cork city was not matched by the same type of infrastructure and development on the north side.  On the south side there are ring roads, colleges, university hospitals, CITs etc., and with regard to the north side, it would not take me too long to list what we do not have.  As a result of the uneven development of the city, the population made a clear shift and the extra seat could not be sustained.</P>
        <P>The general election before last, we were dealing with people out as far as St. Finbarr&rsquo;s Hospital.  Anybody who knows Cork city would realise that was an unnatural division.  We were so deep into Cork South-Central in order to take chunks of population to shore up the five-seater as to be unreasonable.  People rightly asked why we were out there as we could not possibly represent them.  It was too far away.</P>
        <P>We got a new commission and the least we can expect from a commission sitting to redraw boundaries is that it has a knowledge of the country&rsquo;s geography.  Cork North-Central now runs from the north channel of the Lee to the River Blackwater, with Dripsey on the one hand and Mallow on the other.  It came home to me very forcibly at that stage.  The people are all lovely and have welcomed us with open arms.  They are glad to have people representing them and they are the same as people everywhere in the world who want representation.  That is not the difficulty.</P>
        <P>The difficulty is that at 11.10 p.m one night I found myself leaving Mallow to drive to Cork city.  It is not a two hour drive by any stretch of the imagination but takes approximately half an hour.  The notion that a constituency would be redrawn in this way clearly comes from people who did not know the area.  Some 14,000 people in Limerick now find themselves in Kerry, so there is clearly no understanding of the area or geography involved.  At the same time, people in the constituency of the Ceann Comhairle find that because he will be automatically elected next time, their constituency essentially becomes a two-seater.</P>
        <P>There are all sorts of issues that we must deal with.  It is incredible the way constituencies have been redrawn.  Towns have been split down the middle.  I wonder how it was done.  Did these people sit down with maps and a biro, taking sections and splitting the country up as best they could?  It looks like this in some cases.  We cannot say that because we must come in and state the independent commission is a sacred cow that cannot be touched.  Being independent does not make it infallible.</P>
        <P>As a party we suggest that the commission publish a preliminary review, which would be put to public consultation in order that people with an interest could make submissions.  Obvious issues, such as 14,000 people from Limerick going to Kerry, could be stopped.  We are serious <Col N="106"/>about proportional representation because the people of this country twice voted for it in referenda, so we must take a very serious look at increasing the sizes of constituencies.  Proportional representation is not served by a two-seat constituency.  All figures show that the bigger a constituency and the more seats involved, the more true a reflection of proportional representation one gets.  That is what we should be looking at.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference given to the commission did not help so we must alter them.  The idea that we can continue to draw a line on a map just because it fits the population size is wrong.  There are natural boundaries in this country which are not just geographical.  They deal with population and the type of area, as well as everything else.  The commission must begin considering them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Why must we wait for the definitive census and what is stopping the commission from sitting as soon as preliminary figures are published?  There is little between the two figures, barring the people who realise they are not on the register and who register themselves.  This would give the commission time to publish preliminary findings and allow people to comment.  The commission does not have to alter its findings because people disagree but the obvious issues could be altered.  The people sitting on the commission are sensible and will recognise when things are not right.</P>
        <P>There is so much in this Bill and yet a full and frank debate is very difficult because politicians are having it but are not supposed to interfere.  Clearly, some parts need to be changed.  While it is right to have an independent Constituency Commission, we must also correct wrongs where they occur.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Connor is correct that the voting register is a mess.  We have not invested sufficient money in gathering the necessary information.  Irrespective of our political views or the party to which we belong, it is essential that those who wish to vote are able to do so when they go to a polling station.  It is vital, therefore, that we gather the information needed to make democracy work.  When this information is collated, either by census or other means, and given to others to complete a task on our behalf, those individuals or bodies should not be above criticism.</P>
        <P>The Bill includes blatant anomalies but it will be passed because people &mdash; correctly &mdash; do not want to interfere with the independence of the Constituency Commission.  It has been argued that constituency boundaries will be redrawn again before the next general election because a census is due before the election.  In that case, surely we should take our time and modify the terms of reference of the Constituency Commission to enable it to conduct its business properly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>On Deputy Kathleen Lynch&rsquo;s final point, even at this late stage we have an opportunity to ensure the next Constituency Commission has different terms of reference.  We need to amend the Electoral Act 1997 to ensure the commission has greater scope when examining constituency boundaries.  The recommendations of the Constituency Commission breach the terms of reference set out in the 1997 Act.</P>
        <P>I recall the decision to move my area of Ballyfermot from Dublin West to the Dublin Central constituency, despite the fact that the district was separated from the constituency by a geographical boundary &mdash; the River Liffey &mdash; which should not have been breached.  This Constituency Commission has also proposed major changes which are contrary to section 6(2)(<i>c</i>) of the Electoral Act 1997, which states, &ldquo;the breaching of county boundaries shall be avoided as far as practicable&rdquo;.  The commission did not properly consider this requirement as its proposals for some constituencies are illogical.</P><Col N="107"/>
        <P Just="Left">It is possible that the tendency of previous boundary commissions to increase the number of three and four-seat constituencies drove the deliberations of this Constituency Commission, which chose not to increase the number of five-seat constituencies.  The provision in the Electoral Act precluding the establishment of six, seven, eight or nine-seat constituencies should be examined on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>The PR system of the single transferable vote, which was used in the election to the first D&aacute;il, has been used for the past 90 years.  General elections held after the Civil War included constituencies with six, seven and eight Deputies and resulted in a wide variety of views being represented in the House.  In one of the two general elections held in 1927, candidates from seven different parties were returned to the House, including Jim Larkin of the Irish Workers League and 12 Independent Deputies.  The latter differed from the current body of Independent Deputies in that they were Unionists or former members of the old Irish Party.  This was good for democracy, particularly given that the purpose of the PR system is to reflect diverse views.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If we continue to move towards three-seat constituencies or a first past the post system, as the Fianna F&aacute;il Party sought in the past but was prevented from doing by the people in a vote, it will be bad for democracy.  We are trying to encourage people to participate in the electoral process but continually changing constituency boundaries causes confusion and undermines voters&rsquo; identification and affinity with their constituency.</P>
        <P>The changes to the Kerry North and Limerick West constituencies and to counties Tipperary, Offaly, Louth, Meath and Leitrim could have been avoided if the Constituency Commission had greater scope to act.  It chose to cannibalise County Limerick by merging part of west Limerick, from where my mother comes, with Kerry North, despite there being no affinity between Abbeyfeale and Tralee.  In the case of County Leitrim, a small county has been cannibalised when it would not be a major task to produce a realistic solution which did not divide the county between constituencies.  If we had one, two or three counties in one constituency, it would be possible to maintain county identities which have developed over centuries, as we saw last weekend in Croke Park.  Who would the constituents of the new Kerry-Limerick constituency cheer for if both counties ended up in an all-Ireland final?</P>
        <P>It is still possible to resolve these problems.  While I accept the independence of the Constituency Commission and I am aware of the practice in the House of putting through its recommendations unchanged or on the nod, as it were, there is nothing to prevent the House from asking the commission to review its findings.  If, having done so, it decides the recommendations should proceed, it would be possible to change its terms of reference.</P>
        <P>The transfer of Deelis, Kilgobban, Knockglass and certain Castleisland districts to Kerry South distorts the traditional integrity of the Kerry North constituency and patterns of local representation.  Other Deputies will be in a better position to detail the history of the area but having lived for some time in Corca Duibhne, where I spent a number of months on several occasions, there is no logic in having the area in the Kerry South constituency.  Corca Duibhne has always been regarded by local people and visitors to the area as part of north Kerry.  If boundary changes are to be made, it would be logical to include Corca Duibhne with its natural hinterland and the central town of Tralee.</P>
        <P>On the recommendations to break up counties, the question must be posed as to whether the people of County Leitrim or the part of County Limerick included in the revised Kerry North constituency will ever have a chance to elect a representative from their county to the D&aacute;il.  Given the small number of electors from west Limerick in the proposed new constituency, I foresee that the area will not be represented by a local person unless an all-for-one candidate manages to garner 100% of local votes.  It may be that the constituency will be discriminated against or will prove to be an afterthought.  I hope that will not be the case.  I intend no slight <Col N="108"/>on people who will put themselves forward as candidates in the constituency in the future or on those who are incumbent there at present.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To return to the break up of the counties, the views I have already outlined also apply in respect of the transfer of south Offaly into Tipperary North, the position regarding north Meath and the division and transfer of the Leitrim constituency into two new constituencies, Sligo-North Leitrim and Roscommon-South Leitrim.  Anyone who lives outside County Leitrim might be of the view that this is a trivial matter.  However, that is not the opinion of those who reside there.  There are those of the view that this will further disadvantage what is already one of the most disadvantaged regions in the country.</P>
        <P>We need to bring about change.  As is the case with all legislation that comes before the House, Members have an opportunity to instigate such change in the context of this Bill.  We have been presented with the opportunity to call a halt to something that is wrong.  The Bill should be changed and the commission should be given greater scope to ensure that additional seats will be created in various constituencies in the future.  We must ensure that what we do in respect of this matter reflects the original idea behind the PR-STV system that was introduced to great effect some 90 years ago.  That would be the best way to commemorate or celebrate what was envisaged by an ch&eacute;ad D&aacute;il as the correct electoral system for Ireland.  We must ensure that there is better representation for the public in order to break down the disconnect that exists between the people and what happens in this Chamber.  The more local people that are elected, the greater will be the understanding of what happens here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy Cyprian Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill, which, in its own way, is controversial.  Anyone who has ever stood for election is aware of the fragile nature of people&rsquo;s votes and how difficult it is to encourage people to vote.  Anything that interferes with people&rsquo;s ability, right or privilege to vote must be treated warily.</P>
        <P>I have considered the detail of the Bill, the purpose of which is to revise constituencies, provide for the number of members to be elected for those constituencies and revise the procedures to be followed by future constituency commissions and also those relating to the nomination of non-party candidates.  The Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2008 aims to modernise an electoral law which is extremely complicated and update it in light of changes in population demographics.  Parts 2 and 3 deal with the revision of D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies following the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Constituency Commission&rsquo;s report on such constituencies in 2007.</P>
        <P>The commission was established to report on the constituencies in light of issues relating to representation that were illustrated in the 2006 census.  The information collated in a census is extremely important when it comes to deciding how our democracy will operate into the future.</P>
        <P>Part 4 of the Bill outlines procedures to be followed by the Constituency Commission.  The main consequence of the provisions it contains will be that future commissions will be established on the publication by the Central Statistics Office of its interim findings.  Prior to the most recent general election, we debated whether the commission would be capable of reporting on such preliminary findings.  Collating and assimilating the level of information garnered in a census is a complicated business.  The changes being introduced in the Bill will enable the existing commission and those that will succeed it &mdash; if they are put in place &mdash; to deal with the complicated issue of deciding upon constituency boundaries and the number of seats in each constituency.</P>
        <P>The Bill also provides two alternative procedures for the nomination of non-party candidates at European Parliament and local elections.  These procedures will be in line with those put in <Col N="109"/>place in respect of D&aacute;il elections in the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2007.  The provisions in this regard are outlined in Parts 5 and 6 of the Bill.</P>
        <P>The dual system being introduced in the Bill, whereby people may obtain assents or put forward deposits, is the fairest and most equitable method of dealing with this issue.  Under the Bill, 60 assentors will be required in respect of a European Parliament election and 15 will be needed for a local election.  The level of deposit required &mdash; &euro;1,800 for a European Parliament election and &euro;100 for other elections &mdash; is reasonable.  I am glad this system is being put in place.</P>
        <P>Under the Bill, total D&aacute;il membership will remain at 166 across 43 constituencies.  A major debate took place in the past on whether there should be an increase in the number of Members of this House.  In my opinion, the decision that has been taken in this regard is correct.  As previous speakers stated, the division, etc., of constituencies has had a negative effect on long-serving public representatives.  The sad aspect of this is that it affects the people those individuals represent.  Confusion can arise in respect of changes to boundaries, particularly when these cross county or parish lines, and can lead to a lack of representation, which proved to be the case in some recent instances.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the changes is to ensure, across the State, equality of representation in the D&aacute;il and at the European Parliament.  The 2006 census illustrated the disproportionality in certain constituencies.  As a result of recent changes in population, some constituencies are either over-represented or under-represented.  While my constituency, Dublin Central, has remained unchanged, I acknowledge that changes in other constituencies have given rise to problems.  Previous speakers referred to the constituencies that have been affected.  The most obvious is Leitrim, a small county that is under-represented.  Despite receiving almost 200 submissions on the issue, the commission has almost guaranteed that there will be no Deputy from Leitrim in the House.  Dublin North, which is adjacent to my constituency, is massively under-represented but has remained as a four-seater.  These issues must be considered and addressed in due course.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Although my constituency has not changed on this occasion, I am aware of the implications of changes such as those to which I refer.  Prior to the 1997 general election, my constituency, Dublin Central, was altered such that it spanned what is probably the most natural boundary in the country, namely, the River Liffey, and took in areas of the southside of the city that had no relevance to or connection with those on the northside.  The commission appointed before the 2002 election decided to correct the mistake made by its predecessor, which gave rise to serious consequences and a great deal of confusion among constituents regarding by whom they were represented.  It is difficult enough to encourage people to vote in the first instance.  If confusion such as that to which I refer is created prior to and during an election campaign, it gives rise to extreme difficulties.  As a result, people lose out and the level of representation they enjoy can deteriorate.</P>

	<P>The Fine Gael motion condemns the Government for its reckless economic policies over the past five years that have undermined the stability and competitiveness of the Irish economy and that are now sabotaging our country&rsquo;s ability to withstand tougher economic times.  The motion sets out the changes we believe are now necessary to address the difficulties we face.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have a problem that has spread fear throughout every corner of this country.  There are already 75,000 additional people on the dole, who have never been on the dole before.  By Christmas, the figure will be at least 100,000.  Strong businesses are being forced to close their doors and say to dedicated workers that the game is over.  We have seen young people pay huge prices for houses, the value of which will perhaps never again approach what they paid for them.</P>
        <P>This is the crisis that has occurred yet there is an air of unreality in the House today with the Government debating changes in electoral boundaries.  There is a huge and yawning gulf between the crisis in the country and the craving in the country for leadership and what we are being offered on the first day back after the recess.  It is for that reason that we have set this as a critical time.</P>
        <P>The D&aacute;il should now debate the crisis affecting every business and family in the country.  Together we should be working out what we need to do, what are the true figures we face, what are the options we have, what are the challenges we face and what are the things to avoid.  That is the debate which should be occurring but it is not happening.</P><Col N="111"/>
        <P>I refer to the impact of the recession on Ireland.  We hear people talk about international factors.  Let us be very blunt about it &mdash; the impact on Ireland is grossly magnified compared to other countries.  Taking our nearest neighbour, there is a sense of crisis in the United Kingdom but there is at least a sense that somebody is beginning to show leadership.  The deterioration in our growth is four times that which has occurred in the United Kingdom.  The deterioration in our public debt is six times that which has occurred in the United Kingdom and the deterioration in our unemployment figures is 12 times that which has happened in the United Kingdom.  There are international factors but this Government has exposed our people to pressures and threats to which people in other countries are not exposed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is alarming that after so many months, the Government has still not put a strategy in place to address this.  People are beginning to despair that the Government has the capacity to offer any leadership in this situation.  It is difficult to believe that the people who destroyed the economic fundamentals which underpinned the Celtic tiger are the ones who will suddenly come up with the answer to those problems.</P>
        <P>Let us make no mistake about it &mdash; this Government has destroyed the economic model which was the core strength of our economy for so many years.  That model was built on strong export competitiveness, on building up market share, on very prudent use of public money, on nimble Government capable of adapting to changing circumstances and on cost competitiveness.  Every one of those has been destroyed by a Government which decided that its priority was the pursuit of electoral politics.</P>
        <P>It ran budgets which expanded each year under the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, when the need was not there.  It acted as cheerleader for a property boom which was plainly unsustainable.  It made huge public spending commitments on the back revenues coming from property which are now gone.  It has caused the worst deterioration in our public finances in the history of this State.  In 2006, we were in surplus to the tune of &euro;2 billion but at the end of this year, we will be in deficit to the tune of &euro;11 billion.  We will be way outside our commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact.</P>
        <P>That has happened because the Government has not paid attention to the basic lessons one must learn if one is to manage a small, open economy successfully.  One must be prudent in one&rsquo;s use of public money, one must spend in a way that is sustainable, one must hunt down waste and inefficiency and one must ensure that cost competitiveness is at the heart of one&rsquo;s strategy.  All those habits, which were learned the hard way in the 1980s and 1990s and which created a dynamic economy, were destroyed in a very short period of time by this dangerous flirtation with the property boom and the friends in the property sector and which has brought this country to its knees.</P>
        <P>Ireland is the most exposed country to these threats coming from the international crisis simply because the Government sabotaged our capacity to do what a government should do in times like this.  The Government should now have the resources to look at accelerating our infrastructural investment and not at slowing it down and to look at new opportunities to create employment and not talk about cutting services left, right and centre.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should look at what other countries have done.  There is a salutary lesson.  Our Government refused to recognise the gathering storm clouds.  Last year&rsquo;s budget was wholly inappropriate and at the time I described it as a hit and hope budget.  It was a hit and hope budget hoping that we would have the so-called &ldquo;soft landing&rdquo; when the soft landing was clearly not going to happen.  Those who warned that would not happen were treated with disdain.  Their warnings fell on deaf and arrogant ears.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government persisted in denial right through the budget formation to the middle of the year when it was brought to its senses by the collapse of tax revenue.  A feeble response came <Col N="112"/>in July.  It was the sort of response one would expect from a child.  Far from looking at the business of Ireland Inc., looking for the successful parts of public sending and deciding on the priorities to survive, it said let us cut 3% off the payroll everywhere so the most successful elements of our public service were put under the same pressure as the ones which should have been abandoned.  Instead of doing a forensic search for waste and ensuring we made decisions which would value the things that would be important in difficult times, there was this mindless cutting everything a little bit, but it came unstuck.</P>
        <P>We are back here two months later and all the talk about this being a temporary little adjustment, that the fundamentals are strong and that we would be back on the horse&rsquo;s back in no time has been abandoned.  Where is the strategy?  All we have had from the Government is an upgrading of the storm to force four.  We all know that, as do people who are losing their jobs, people who are struggling to pay for their houses and people who are folding their businesses.  It is only the Government, which has been in this bubble, that did not realise what was happening.  We need a government capable of leadership but that has not come forward.</P>
        <P>We should contrast that with what happened to the Spanish Government.  It was faced with a similar situation.  It did not go off on holidays and put up a &ldquo;do not disturb&rdquo; sign because it was too busy.  The Prime Minister of Spain called back his Ministers from holidays.  He told them they should be at their desks with their computers powered up and that they should look at what was necessary to get Spain through the recession.  That is what they did.  They brought forward new infrastructural packages, they said top earners in the public sector would have to take a pay cut and they said there would have to be a tax stimulus to get things going.  Now commentators believe Spain will get through these difficulties without a recession.  That is not the situation in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Our Government sat on its hands, went off on holidays and appointed a few task forces and decided to wait to see what they came up with when it came back.  That is not leadership or what this country craves at this time.  Many measures could be taken now and not in three weeks at budget time.  Measures could be taken now to open up sectors which have been protected for too long so that we could have vibrant competition and start to bring down costs and create new opportunities in renewable energy and bus transport if Government would only move on some of the things it said it would do for years.  We need to reinvent our economy and to look at the opportunities and build for them now.  We must make solid investments in areas that will reap returns, such as interconnectors, broadband and areas that can create a knowledge economy.  However, the Government is ignorant of all of this.  Its strategy for e-Government collapsed on its face.  Under the Government&rsquo;s strategy for the knowledge economy, we dropped from being the leading country in Europe in terms of e-Government to 17th on the list.  That happened under a strategy of change.</P>
        <P>We failed dismally under the Government strategy to address climate change.  That strategy was launched in 2000, but after eight years it has had a zero impact on our emissions.  The penny must drop for Ministers that when strategies go wrong when there is plenty of money available, mismanagement is going on.  The trouble with the Government is that it will not wake up to reality and does not show any understanding of the mistakes it has made that have put us in this hole and made us the most exposed country in Europe.</P>
        <P>Until the Government wakes up and realises that it is its mistakes, its reckless expansion of spending on unsustainable revenues, its acting as cheerleader for an unsustainable property boom and its destruction of our exporting sector by the high-cost environment it created, we can have no confidence that it has the diagnosis to get us out of this hole.  If it had, we would already see the signs of leadership and see investment in training for people who are being displaced so that they will not be long-term unemployed.  We would see the prioritising of <Col N="113"/>investments and see the publishing of cost-benefit analyses that showed which investments were priorities and should be protected at all costs.  We would see a Government in control and taking leadership.</P>
        <P>Even in the case of the financial crisis, the Government is dragged kicking and screaming to respond.  It is only at the last minute that it comes up with something to protect depositors, although it was clear 11 months ago when Northern Rock went down that Irish savers were exposed, with less protection for their savings than was the case for savers in the United Kingdom.  It was obvious we should move, but the Government would not move alone and felt it had to wait for some committee in Europe to decide.</P>
        <P>The Government must take leadership on issues that matter to Ireland.  It is Irish people who are losing their jobs, Irish businesses that are on the line and the Irish nation that needs leadership from the Government.  The tragedy is that there is a growing sense that the Government does not know what it takes to change Ireland, to reinvent the economic model we have destroyed and to reform public services in a radical way where it is performance that matters.  Failure to perform has consequences and Ministers and public servants must take responsibility for what happens.  Choice must be generated within the public sector so we have alternatives and variety that will allow the best options to be developed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have not had that change; instead, tragically, we have seen time and again the Government take the soft option.  Benchmarking was a unique vehicle capable of driving a massive reform package within our public service, but what did the Government do about it?  It sat on its hands and refused to put a reform package on the table and decided to dish out the money anyhow through the ATM machines.  We have paid in spades for that, not only the &euro;1.3 billion it cost, but by not getting the reform.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Even more seriously, we needed the talents of our public servants focused on delivering real change to the way we deliver services, so that we could, with the significant moneys spent, ensure that young people who were suicidal and elderly people in accident and emergency departments got help.  That did not happen and instead of driving our public service to deliver at the front line, their energies were wasted and they were demoralised through a decentralisation programme that was dreamt up on the back of a betting slip.  This has sabotaged our public service and demoralised compassionate and committed people who should and could be driving serious reform.  That has not happened over the past number of years because the energy and talents of many public servants have been wasted in fruitless moving around and the destruction of skill bases built up over years.</P>
        <P>This has been a Government that has not understood the importance of reform, change and the building of a strong, competitive and nimble economy with a public service to match that would meet the ambitions of the people generating the revenues to fund it.  That is the fatal error and the reason we are in such a hole.  It is the reason we need strong leadership, which, sadly, is not forthcoming from the Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael brought forward this motion as a result of its concern.  We brought it forward in good faith and expected the Government to respond in good faith.  We sought a debate on the issue, but the Government would not provide time for it.  We have spent much of the day discussing an electoral Bill that has been around for a year without discussion.</P>
        <P>I will comment on the Government&rsquo;s reckless economic policies and competitiveness.  The Government allowed the property boom to get out of control.  When the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, took up the position of Minister for Finance, we saw a rapid decline in our exports and a rapid increase in construction.  There was over reliance on the construction sector and, as a result, we now have negative equity.  The Government has been somewhat disingenuous in this regard.  It has floated the notion that it will help first-time buyers buy houses.  People know houses are overpriced.  The only people who will benefit from such a move are the Government and builders.  Hard-pressed first-time buyers could now end up in a situation where the houses they buy will leave them in negative equity within a short period.  Fine Gael feels strongly on this issue.  The Government should be truthful with the electorate, but it is not.</P>
        <P>The Government has failed to respond quickly when necessary.  Last December, the situation was clear.  The credit crunch was in full swing, unemployment was rising and, through successive budgets, Deputy Bruton called for proper public sector reform.  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report for 2007 makes specific reference to the HSE.  With regard to value for money, in the past ten years the number of people employed in the HSE has increased by 71% to 47,000.  Many of those are in bureaucratic positions and are not accountable.  Furthermore, the health budget has increased fivefold.  The question is, do we have a better health service today?  We had Private Notice Questions today on the state of the health service.  We are not getting value for money.</P>
        <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report made specific reference to the HSE&rsquo;s failure to respond swiftly.  It stated that a dysfunctional consequence of delaying action was that savings must be targeted across the board at units operating within budget as well as those that are not.  The Government has made a 3% cut in the HSE&rsquo;s payroll.  We know people are being let go throughout the public sector, but that is not proper public sector reform.  That is just sleight of hand.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What should have been done should have happened last December.  However, the Government only decided to do something in June, when there were 50,000 extra on the live register and a &euro;3 billion tax shortfall projected by the end of the year.  All the Government did was make vague utterances on moving things around.  Its three-page document did not even add up because it was &euro;14 million short and a further 20,000 people were forced onto the live register before any action was taken.</P>
        <P>The Government must now take control of the public finances and protect essential frontline services.  The incremental system of budgeting is outdated and other models should be con<Col N="115"/>sidered.  New Zealand has a system whereby a 1% saving is sought across all government departments.  Advance notice is given, which allows for proper public sector reform rather than our <i>laissez faire</i> attitude of overnight cuts.  Departments here lack the time to adjust to cuts which affect frontline services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has failed to put in place a proper anti-inflationary policy.  When we joined the eurozone, we lost control over our exchange and interest rates and the only area over which we retained control was inflation.  Everyone knows that if interest rates are low, inflation should be low, but inflation was allowed to spin out of control.  The European Central Bank has an inflation target of zero to 2%.  The Government should have set out a target for inflation prior to the national pay talks so people could have a sense of where the country is going.  We have become uncompetitive and have lost export market share over the past five years.  Since 2000, our prices have risen 50 times faster than the EU average and 45% of non-mortgage inflation is Government fuelled.  Health care is three times the EU average and education for hard pressed parents of children, housing, water and energy are twice the EU average.</P>
        <P>In its ludicrous reply, the Government claims its stewardship of the economy and public finances allows Ireland to meet the current economic situation from a position of strength.  Given that nothing is left in the kitty, there is no strength, unlike Spain which built up a reserve to allow its economy to be pumped.  Several months ago, the Taoiseach proposed a cyclical stimulus budget which would allow him to pump the economy but he is not mentioning that now.  The kitty is empty because of mismanagement on the part of the Government.</P>
        <P>The adoption of sensible measures would have created the right economic and fiscal conditions.  How can we regard the claims made by the Taoiseach in 2005 and 2006 that the fundamentals of the economy were fine and that we should continue to build?  This was a foolhardy and unsustainable policy.  Exports continued to fall.  This is a small open economy and we need to return to basics.  The Government claims that many of the factors currently impacting on the economy are external in origin.  While that may be the case, it failed to exercise its control over internal factors to implement the deposit protection scheme earlier or control inflation.  The hallmark of this Government is procrastination.  It is either acting on the basis of arrogance or because it does not know what is going on.  I am not certain which is worse but both are absolutely unacceptable.</P>
        <P>The budget for 2009 is supposed to provide clarity and confidence but the Government is failing to provide either.  The only reason the budget is being brought forward is because the preliminary income tax figures for 2008 will fall far short of projections when they are produced on 14 November.  The people were mislead on the budget, which was based on a projection of 55,000 housing completions.  Everyone knew at the time that the maximum figure for completions was 30,000, with a &euro;1 billion shortfall in tax take for every 10,000 houses.  I had to table a parliamentary question to find out the number of housing completions used as a basis for the budget.  Budget expenditure was reliant on the construction sector.</P>
        <P>I commend this motion to the House and hope the Minister for Finance and other Government Deputies will attend this well-informed debate on putting the economy back on the road to recovery.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>In an attempt to have us forget about Government inaction over the past several years, the Taoiseach said this morning that he had to deal with the situation that confronts him now.  The reality is that it did not arrive out of nowhere to confront him over the past few days because he helped to create it.  I acknowledge that a crisis has arisen internationally to which we are not immune but it is undeniable and unforgivable that its impact on us is already greater than elsewhere and will probably be more long lasting.  My colleagues have already referred to the rapidness of the collapse in our growth and employment rates. <Col N="116"/> We are the worst on any scale.  Our inflation rate over the past ten years has been twice the EU average.  It is no wonder that we are the most expensive country in Europe.  Regardless of the picture which the Taoiseach and his Cabinet colleagues try to paint, these factors did not arise by accident.  They are specific to Ireland and were under our control but the Government did nothing about them.</P>
        <P>That we have to face them now is entirely due to a feckless Government which spent with abandon over many years.  During the Taoiseach&rsquo;s tenure as Minister for Finance, he increased spending at twice the rate of economic growth.  Even a child knows that if pocket money increases by &euro;1 per week, he or she cannot spend &euro;2.  Spending was based on unsustainable property taxes, despite the warnings of every expert.  Indeed, any child could have told the Government about this.</P>
        <P>While all this heady spending continued, long-term thinking was forgotten.  Preparation for a rainy day was put off and there was no search for value for money, reform of public services or regulations and no drive for competitiveness.  There was no sense of urgency about broadband services, energy or transport.  God knows what our very well resourced training body, which was supposed to give us a cutting edge labour force, was doing.  After ten years of continuous growth, we should have been in a better position than other countries to face a global recession but, with more expensive goods and services than any other country, we are in the worst possible position.  At the same time, our coffers are bare and we have no reserves.</P>
        <P>Our Government has made no response to these issues.  It was in complete denial and ignored all the warning signs.  It held parties for the incoming and outgoing taoisigh but did nothing about the gathering storm clouds for which the rest of the world was preparing.  In July, it briefly acknowledged that a problem existed but then allowed it to drift throughout the summer, emerging only briefly to announce it would do something in October.  Weeks of unease about the security of our banking system were completely ignored.  People were withdrawing money and putting it under their mattresses.  Joe Duffy was blamed for this, even though he was merely reflecting what the people in the streets had been discussing for months.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s first response to these problems was to announce that it was giving us all a pay rise.  There is something surreal about concluding a pay deal in the very month in which we announced the highest ever increase in unemployment.  At the same time, there was almost a run on the banks.  This is nonsense.  At a time of such uncertainty, I do not know how we, as part of the public sector, can promise to pay ourselves more.  Private sector workers are being asked to work harder and longer to produce more and pay more taxes at a time when they do not know whether they will have jobs, much less pensions.  What else did the Government do?  When the directors of Aer Lingus were trying to put together a business plan to save the airline the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, told them she was not happy with it.  To the best of my knowledge the reason the Government privatised Aer Lingus was to give it freedom of operation.  I recall a specific promise from the Government that, despite holding a considerable shareholding of the company, it would not interfere in the running of the airline as this would impact negatively on the share price.  However, that is exactly what the Minister did, at a time when there were as many airlines as banks going to the wall.</P>
        <P>The final straw was an increase of 8% yesterday in taxi fares.  This shows how out of touch the Government is with the realities of the market at present.  Taxis are largely a discretionary spend for people, so this increase will result in a reduction in taxi usage.  It is completely bizarre and damaging not just to the economy, but also to the tourism industry.  The Government must realise that the days of easy money are over.  It cannot spend its way out of every problem now.  There is a new world order and the Government will have to start making its own luck. <Col N="117"/> It will have to husband resources, target investment priorities, reform public services and upskill the workforce.  There is no sign that the Government has any idea of the challenge it is facing, how it will deal with it or, indeed, that it even realises there is a challenge.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;I would get rid of six of them, for a start.  I would get rid of half the programme managers and advisers and all the waste in public offices.  The Minister was also late last week.  Everybody in the country was talking about what was happening in the economy.  The Minister might recall the film &ldquo;Mary Poppins&rdquo;.  In that film the young child went into the bank but would not lodge his two pence.  As a result, there was a run on the bank for the first time in 100 years.  The same thing happened in this country last week but the Minister did not make a move until Saturday.  He nearly left it too late.</P>
        <P>People were ringing me and every other Deputy to ask if their money was safe.  What we need now is leadership &mdash; a strong Government, Taoiseach and Minister for Finance.  What did we have last week?  We could not get a Minister to speak.  The Minister spoke on Friday and said he would not interfere with the market or the banks.  However, at lunchtime on Saturday he had to tell people that the Government would underwrite deposits of up to &euro;100,000.  That was correct but if the Minister had spoken sooner it would not have been necessary.  However, the Minister and the Government were gone all week.  They took their eyes off the ball.</P>
        <P>In the past few months, since the previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, became Taoiseach, 45,000 jobs have been lost in this country.  Where was the Government for the summer?  When every other government in Europe was trying to figure out how to save their economies, this Government was gone, travelling all over the world.  It should have been here.  A special Cabinet meeting should have been held in August to show the people that the Government was doing something about the economy, that it was in charge and would not let the country go down the drain.  However, there was no Minister or Taoiseach to be found throughout the summer.</P>
        <P>This is serious business.  There are 45,000 people who will not have a job this Christmas.  Other people are wondering whether their jobs will be safe tomorrow, next week, next month or next year.  We need to hear from the Minister for Finance.  He should not take the soft options when he introduces the budget in two weeks.  He must not attack the social insurance fund again.  That is the working people&rsquo;s fund; the money that has been put away for the rainy day and for pensions.  The Minister must not raid it.  The former Minister, Charlie McCreevy, raided it in good times but this Minister had better not raid it in bad times.  That fund is for people&rsquo;s pensions and for the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If the Minister wished to show leadership, he would tackle the oil companies.  The price of diesel and petrol goes up and down but the price at the pump does not.  That is a simple job and the T&aacute;naiste should deal with it.  She should speak to representatives of the oil companies and ask them why this is happening.  I travelled from the west to the east of this country last night.  There was a different price for petrol and diesel at the pumps in every village and town.  That should not happen.  If the Government was doing its job, it would tackle the people who are ripping us off.  We are being ripped off by all sides.</P><Col N="118"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister for Finance has a job to do and he must take it seriously.  He must ensure the economy does not go down the drain.  For the past ten years the Government spent, spent and spent.  What would happen to a householder who did the same?  People have always put a few pounds or euro away for the rainy day but this Government did not.  The Government thought the boom was never going to end.  When it did, who did it blame?  It blamed Fine Gael and Deputy Richard Bruton, accusing us of talking down the economy.  Where were the advisers and the people in the Department of Finance?  Did they not know that taxation revenue was not coming in?  Did they not see a downturn over the past two years?  No, like the Government they were telling people about all the taxes that were being paid and what would be done to spend those taxes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to express my frustration that I will have less than five minutes to speak on this motion.  It is truly extraordinary that we will not get an opportunity to debate in depth the concerns every household in the country is discussing at present.  Many colleagues in Fine Gael and in the Labour Party wished to make a proper, lengthy contribution to a detailed debate on the challenges we currently face, but we have not been given that opportunity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This House went into recess for nearly three months.  In that period, 23,000 people lost their jobs in Ireland.  That is a total of 300 per day.  People are worried about their future, their jobs and their financial commitments such as mortgages and loans.  They expect leadership from the Government.  They expect the people they elect to run the country to give leadership when it is needed.  What did they get in response?  This is the first sitting of the D&aacute;il for three months, following a meltdown in international money markets and a series of uncertainties that affect the economy and people&rsquo;s pensions and jobs.  The Government&rsquo;s response is a refusal to even facilitate a two-day debate on the issue.  This was requested last week; it is not as if the Government was taken by surprise by the request.</P>
        <P>Instead, the Government is content to discuss the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, which is irrelevant in the context of the challenges the country faces at present.  A discussion on boundary changes for three and a half year hence is what it considers a priority for discussion in the D&aacute;il this week.  Is it any wonder that people view this House and many of its Members as irrelevant to their lives and the challenges they face?  If Fine Gael had not forced a debate on the economy during Private Members&rsquo; business this evening, there would have been no opportunity to discuss the issue, apart from during Leaders&rsquo; Questions.  We are accused of playing political games for trying to hold an arrogant and lazy Government to account, a Government that does not have the political courage to face a proper debate on the economy.</P>
        <P>To put recent job losses in context, in the last month in Cork 180 people lost their jobs in Pfizer, 280 jobs were lost in Howley Civil Engineering in Carrigtwohill and yesterday there were 150 job losses in Swiss Co. in Little Island.  Today we have been told there will probably be an announcement tomorrow of 200 job losses in Tyco Sensormatic on the Model Farm Road.  People are talking about that, not the boundaries of D&aacute;il constituencies in the next general election.  We should be reflecting people&rsquo;s concerns.  They want answers from us about what direction the country is taking and what challenges and hardships they can expect.  People know that is the reality they face for the next year or 18 months, or whatever the time frame will be.  Eleven of the top 88 worst unemployment blackspots are in Cork.  Last week a dole queue in Cork city stretched for almost half a mile, and crossed one of the bridges in the city.  This picture was on the front page of the <i>Evening Echo</i> in Cork last week, a sight many people of my age have never seen.  People are worried about this and want a response from people like the Minister who they see as offering new leadership in Ireland.</P>

	<P>On a point of order, is there a Deputy in the House called A.N. Other for whom we need to leave an open slot should he or she arrive?  Is this a precedent for this House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Nolan is welcome.  I assumed there was a bevy of other Deputies who might honour us with an appearance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Well done a Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are in the middle of an acute global financial and economic storm and this country is not immune from its impact.  However, let us not lose perspective.</P>
        <P>During the past five years, we have had an average growth rate of 5.5%, among the highest in the EU.  Our Government debt in 2007 fell from 32% to 23% of GNP.  We have put more than &euro;15 billion into the National Pension Reserve Fund since we took the prudent step of establishing that fund in 2001.  It now stands at &euro;19.5 billion.  Also, we have invested more than &euro;30 billion in the biggest public infrastructure investment programme <i>per capita</i> in the EU.</P>
        <P>This is the record that has been dismissed as &ldquo;reckless budgetary policies&rdquo; in the motion tabled by the Deputies opposite.  By all means, let us have debate about the economy but let us not engage in the kind of dishonesty and misrepresentation that does no service to this House or to our economic achievement in recent years, achievements not alone by Government but by the people.  Our record is there for all to see.  Based on that record, we will take the necessary action to ensure we safeguard and protect the substantial gains that have been made during the past 15 years.</P>
        <P>The continuing turmoil in the global financial markets is having a detrimental effect on economies right across the developed world.  Growth forecasts in all of our trading partners have been revised downwards.  As a small open economy, Ireland was never going to be insulated from this international downturn and these developments combined with the appreciation of the euro exchange rate have created a difficult trading environment for our exporting sector.</P>
        <P>In addition to this unprecedented conjunction of unfavourable international factors, we are experiencing a very sharp correction in the house building sector which has been exacerbated by the global liquidity crisis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>And the national crisis.</P>

	<P>It just happened out of nowhere.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no doubt that over time, housing output will return to more sustainable levels but there is a process of adjustment and it is important that it be allowed to take place. We must remind ourselves that the beneficiaries of falling property prices will be first-time buyers who have found it so difficult to get on the property ladder in recent years.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="121"/>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to address some criticism that has been levelled at the Government about its actions in this area.  It is the height of hypocrisy for the Opposition to blame the Government for allegedly over heating the property market when it was Fine Gael that did its damnedest to destabilise that market through its half-baked, ill-conceived proposals to reform stamp duty. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Members may not like the medicine but they should at least listen to what I have to say.  That particular plan which was rejected by the people would have pushed prices far higher and resulted in an even greater crash.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s changes to the stamp duty regime were measured and they were only introduced when it was clear the market was already correcting and when it was safe to do so.  Our concern has always been the long-term stability and sustainability of the housing market.</P>

	<P>No one believes any of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The rapid deterioration in our economy and the speed with which international factors outside of our control have impacted on us has taken everybody by surprise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Not only international factors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>When we brought forward our savings initiative last July, my Department forecast a revenue shortfall of &euro;3 billion for this year.  At the time, I said the savings of &euro;440 million to be achieved this year was the very minimum we had to do and that additional savings would have to be made in the event of a further deterioration in our fiscal position.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We monitored the position throughout July and August and when in August returns confirmed there had been a further significant weakening of the tax take, we decided to bring forward the budget to 14 October.  Following analysis of the end-September tax revenues, my Department will set out its assessment in the normal manner at the end-quarter press conference.  In advance of knowing the exact details I do not propose to say anymore on the size of the shortfall.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Minister does not want to say anymore.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I assure Deputy Richard Bruton that he will be briefed subsequent to the end-September forecast.  I will do everything in my power to ensure he is properly briefed in what I appreciate is a tight budgetary cycle in time terms.  It is clear the scale of the economic and fiscal challenges require us as a Government to take immediate steps to ensure Ireland is <Col N="122"/>fiscally sustainable in the years ahead.  Bringing the budget forward allows us to present a balanced and coherent plan to address the difficulties we now face.  It also focuses everyone&rsquo;s mind on the absolute necessity to take corrective measures now so as to boost confidence in the economy among investors, business people, workers and those on welfare.</P>
        <P>I am not going to get into the details of the budget this evening, but I can say it will set out steps to stabilise and restore balance to the public finances by prioritising current and capital public expenditure to reflect the changed realities.</P>
        <P>We face very difficult choices.  We will have ample time for serious economic discussion in this House on budget day and in the weeks subsequent to it.  We will, of course, seek to protect the most vulnerable and to protect the productive sector which must generate the income we need to provide the public services in education and in health that our people deserve.</P>
        <P>The House can be assured the Government will leave no stone unturned to protect the gains that have been made and they are substantial.  We now have more than 2 million people at work.  Since 1997, under successive Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments, more than 700,000 jobs have been created, a startling achievement.</P>
        <P>We have a highly educated and young workforce and, by international standards, a very low tax environment for workers and business and this has been an important driver of economic growth.  This transformation has been achieved by the hard work and enterprise of our citizens underpinned by the sound economic policies of this Government.  It has placed us in a better position than most to weather this downturn.  As long as we take the tough decisions now, we will be well positioned to take advantage of the upturn when it comes.</P>
        <P>We in this House will have to face real choices.  The Opposition cannot take refuge in rhetoric as we make these choices.  It will have to come forward with alternatives if it is not prepared to accept the policies brought forward by Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the Government; what will it do?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is all up to us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In previous economic downturns, we have made the mistake of cutting back on capital investment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Government waiting for?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is easy to cut capital investment.  The challenge now is to ensure that in the changed economic circumstances we produce more with less money.  That is possible given the competitive environment that now exists for tendering.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It certainly is possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course, the delivery of Transport 21 and the national development plan is affected by the level of economic growth and the resources available to the Government in the medium term.  It is clear that we will have to prioritise and extend the period within which it can be implemented, but the plan stands.</P>
        <P>Last year alone, we spent &euro;8 billion of Exchequer funds on capital projects.  By 2010, we will have completed the motorway network connecting Dublin to Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway and Belfast.  Work will also begin on the Atlantic road corridor.  The second terminal in Dublin Airport will be open for business in 2010.  There will be significant development of public transport in the greater Dublin area.  We have an ongoing programme of investment in <Col N="123"/>our environmental services infrastructure and we will provide increased energy security through the North-South and East-West interconnector projects.</P>
        <P>The plan stands and as we have indicated, despite expenditure pressures which have arisen this year, capital expenditure will remain a top priority.  As part of the Estimates process, we are reviewing all capital projects for 2009 to 2011 to ensure scarce resources are targeted at investment in core economic infrastructure that will add to our productive capacity, improve our competitiveness and ensure we are in an advantageous position when the present economic downturn abates.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The rapidity of deterioration in our economy has, as I stated, surprised all not alone at home but around the world.  We have known for some time that growth was going to slow.  That is why in his budget last year, the Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Finance, introduced an efficiency review with the objective of getting better value for the money we spend on public services.  When he became Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen reiterated our commitment as a Government to public sector reform.  As Members know, a task force will report shortly on the implementation of the OECD report on this subject.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, the savings initiative we introduced last July is being implemented and the efficiencies it will yield in terms of administrative budgets and the rationalisation of State agencies will be of continuing benefit to our economy when prevailing circumstances improve.  There will be a redundancy programme for administrative staff in the HSE and I would like to see such a programme applied in the wider public service as well.  The Government is determined to secure maximum value for money in our public services.  By targeting better payroll management, seeking savings in the services we buy and prioritising productive capital projects, we will enhance the delivery and effectiveness of public services and maximise the return from capital investment.</P>
        <P>As in many other countries, the pick-up in Irish inflation in the past year or so has been driven primarily by the global rise in food and oil prices.  In Ireland, increases in interest rates have also had a direct impact on inflation.  Recent inflation trends have been more positive.  The annual rate of CPI inflation eased to 4.3% in August from 5% two months earlier.  On an EU harmonised basis, annual inflation in August was 3.2%, significantly below the 3.8% increase recorded in the euro area.  My Department expects to see an easing in the average rate of inflation in the later part of this year and into next year.</P>
        <P>These are indeed challenging times.  However, we should not lose sight of the fact that the level of economic activity remains very high, as does the level of employment and income <i>per capita</i>.  The underlying health of our economy remains robust.  The Government will bring forward initiatives that will promote additional economic activity and provide firm support for those parts of our economy that are continuing to perform well.  However, effective management of the public finances and sensible fiscal policies are fundamental to our economic recovery.  There is no easy way out if we are to protect the extraordinary progress we have made in the past two decades.</P>
        <P>It is the job of the Opposition to hold the Government to account.  I understand that the largest Opposition party, in particular, will want to make political hay out of the current difficulties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>That is completely wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MJNolan"><NameTxt>Deputy M. J. Nolan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  The extent and speed of the downturn in our economy has caught everybody by surprise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>We will have more tuppences before this is over.  It is &ldquo;Mary Poppins&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MJNolan"><NameTxt>Deputy M. J. Nolan</NameTxt>
	<P>Even the learned gentlemen across the way did not have a monopoly on that.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and the fact that he is facing up to the difficulties faced by the economy.  In the short time I have I will highlight one or two issues that concern me.  In the context of the budget being introduced by the Minister on 14 October, I ask that areas such as education, which has been the bedrock of the Irish economy in the past 20 years and the reason it has been so successful, do not see serious cuts.  As a result of our education system and our young, well educated workforce we have succeeded in attracting more foreign direct investment than any other European country.  Any changes or savings that have to be made should be made outside that Department.</P>
        <P>In addition, State agencies, particularly F&Aacute;S, must put in place or alter their courses to suit the current economic climate, in which an increasing number of young people are coming onto the live register.  I heard reports recently that individuals who went to F&Aacute;S seeking particular courses were advised that no such courses were available.  We cannot wait six months or a year for F&Aacute;S to get its act together and put on courses that are urgently needed.</P>
        <P>The current downturn in the economy will have a serious effect on the resources that Ministers will have to run their Departments.  However, I was glad to hear the Minister state that unlike in previous downturns, in which capital budgets were severely cut as a result of fall-offs in revenue, he intends to prioritise spending in the capital area and that programmes such as the inter-city road network will be completed by 2010.  I would also like to see continuous investment in public transport, particularly the rail network, which has benefited significantly in the past ten years.</P>
        <P>Nobody in this House could have anticipated the speed of the decline.  Indeed, most of it is outside our control and we are to a large extent at the mercy of international financial markets.  I wish the Minister well in his task, which will not be an easy one.  However, the fundamentals, as he continues to tell us, are sound, and based on that I believe we are healthy enough to ride out the recession.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy Cyprian Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I too welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Nobody on this side of the House denies that we are facing into a difficult period for this economy.  Our GNP has been steadily decreasing and our economic growth is declining.  However, the entire developed world is also facing a period of economic turbulence.  Rising fuel and food prices and the fallout from the ever-worrying credit crunch are having a negative impact on <Col N="125"/>growth throughout the world.  However, as the Minister pointed out, we are in a much better position to weather the storm now than we were in the 1980s.  Irish exports remain strong.  Exports of business services and software grew by an incredible 25% in 2007 and now earn as much as pharmaceutical exports.  The inflow of foreign direct investment remains strong and FDI will be the key to driving the Irish economy towards recovery in 2009.  IDA Ireland continues to win projects and create employment here.  In my constituency, for example, the success of the Irish Financial Services Centre has been remarkable and it continues to create employment and attract new business, with major financial institutions continuing to establish a presence in the IFSC.</P>
        <P>The Government has successfully managed the boom and is well equipped to ensure we manage our way through the tough times that are before us.  The fact that the budget is being brought forward to 14 October illustrates the commitment of the Government.  I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s efforts with regard to guarantees on bank deposits.  This is an issue that affects many people.  People were confused about their entitlements and the fact that the issue was clarified in such a speedy way is to be welcomed.</P>
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I must express my concern at the lending practices and lack of prudence of some banks.  There have been cases in which 100% mortgages have been given to individuals who cannot afford the repayments.  A number of these were given on an interest-free basis for five years.  After those five years the borrowers must repay the full principal and interest, and many are facing negative equity.  In a number of cases, the borrower cannot afford the full amount that will be charged.  Representatives of the banks attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service a few weeks ago and reassurances were given.  For example, there was a reassurance that Bank of Ireland would retain its dividend.  However, this has now been slashed by 50% due to more challenging trading conditions.  While Irish banks do not seem to be exposed to the sub-prime mortgage crisis, they are being hit far more badly than most banks in Europe.  This is worrying.</P>
        <P>We can overcome this current period of slowing growth.  We are still attracting foreign direct investment and we must continue to do so.  Our construction industry has contracted, but we are creating employment in other areas such as financial services, pharmaceuticals, IT and the service sector as a whole.  I express my concern, however, at some of the practices of a number of our banks and I would like to see more transparency in this area.</P>
    
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I commend the Government on its stewardship of the economy in the past ten years.  What is the first advice a financial adviser would give to any family when paying down a mortgage when it comes into more money or achieves a higher income than previously?  He would recommend paying off the mortgage, which is what the Government has done in the past ten years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>The debt to national wealth ratio is now down to 23% from a high of 96% in the early 1990s, which is an outstanding achievement by any set of standards.  While it is given no credit by any member of the Opposition, the people at home understand that.  If we consider other countries with national debts, in Japan it is 180% of its wealth.  The USA has added $1 trillion to national debt in recent weeks with the rescue of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and the general bail-out of the banks.  In the UK the ratio is approximately 40%.  Ours is 23% which is an outstanding achievement that allows the Government in tougher economic times to borrow as necessary to maintain the services and keep us in a good position <Col N="126"/>for when the global situation recovers.  That outstanding achievement of the Government needs to be recognised.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately the Opposition does not recognise that we are a small island economy totally dependent on international investment and on our exports to other countries.  That has been put into clear focus by the pairing issue the Opposition has introduced whereby it is refusing to allow possibly even the Taoiseach to attend an important meeting in New York and the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to attend meetings in Europe.  It is an absolute disgrace and shows no knowledge of the situation Ireland faces and the reality that our Ministers need to be abroad promoting the country as they have been doing for the past ten years and attracting foreign direct investment, which despite what the Opposition might claim is still coming in at very good rates.  While we need to keep it up, the Opposition has shown no understanding of that.</P>
        <P>Deputy Bruton will come into the Chamber and criticise the Government for spending too much money, yet tomorrow morning on local radio we will hear a litany of requests for more money for all sorts of projects.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Fine Gael Deputies and councillors cannot have it both ways.  They cannot say they want more money spent when their finance spokesperson and deputy leader criticises us in the D&aacute;il for spending too much money over the years.  The people know the tricks they are playing.</P>
        <P>The Government has done a fantastic job.  It established the National Pensions Reserve Fund despite some criticism for doing so.  We now have the scope to borrow and maintain our position.  The Government has responsibility for managing the public services and creating the environment in which people can work.  Low taxes have been a feature of that environment for individuals and businesses and they allow people to get on with what they want to do.  We could not be in a better position to get through the unprecedented global economic downturn.  We can afford to borrow a certain amount of money to get us over the slight difficulty in which we find ourselves.  We will either swim or sink with international exports and foreign direct investment, which is very important.  We need to put our best foot forward at home and abroad, which is what Ministers and IDA Ireland with other agencies have been doing with great success in recent years.  Fine Gael is trying to diminish this effort with what it has done regarding pairing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The national pay agreement has been criticised in various quarters.  However, it gives people confidence that Irish industrial relations are peaceful and that people can invest in Ireland without the threat of industrial relations bringing everything to a halt.</P>
        <P>Regardless of the economic reality that house prices may fall, homeowners in my constituency would be surprised by Fine Gael calling for house prices to fall, as its motion does.  It calls for house prices to return to fair values.  While we know it is an economic reality, making that political call is unprecedented.  People who suffer from negative equity will look for more than <Col N="127"/>a call for house prices to be reduced.  We do not yet have a large number of repossessions, which may well come.  Action would need to be taken if that becomes a serious problem.  While I know of some in my constituency, they are not yet at the crisis level that would affect a broad range of people, as they are in some parts of the United States.</P>
        <P>We need to put our best foot forward despite the Opposition.  We need to continue these policies.  While we need to cut back, we do not need to slam on the brakes.  We need to keep rolling along, borrow as much as we need and set the country up right for when things turn internationally, as they will.  I believe the people will thank us for it when the turnaround comes.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and reflect on some of the comments of members of the Opposition, who suggest we should have this debate without any commentary on what is happening elsewhere in the world.  This debate is taking place one day after the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, and US Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, introduced a package to save the banks and the economy in the United States.  I would never have thought we would have seen the US Government take over Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and that there would be problems with Merrill Lynch and AIG.  There has been such a movement in the world finances that those organisations are now in crisis.  The Opposition must acknowledge that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>We have done so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>It diminishes confidence in Irish business and business throughout the world that that would happen.  It is up to governments to address the problem as best they can.  Ireland, with a population of 4 million, 2 million of whom are working, needs to do things in terms of business, which I respect.  People look to the Government for leadership.  Leadership was shown by what the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, did in July.  On the basis of the figures available then he introduced certain cutbacks, redefined policy and reprioritised projects.</P>

	<P>It is not too late because no one could gauge.  It was something that happened.  Some of the biggest fund managers in the world lost billions overnight because they could not gauge it.  They were the ones central to whole financial activity because no one knew what was in those toxic loans&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;or the packages that were passed around like parcels until the music stopped when each bank in a row fell.  Let us place it where it is.  We now need to recognise the positive aspects.  The financial sector employs 10,000 people.  Some of the biggest and best recognised companies have a presence in this country.  If we are to look positively to the future we first need to separate the rhetoric and take the best advice, as the Minister for Finance did when he took those initiatives in July.  We are now faced with answering the question as to whether we have the bottle as parliamentarians to stand up and give leadership to the rest of the country in the context of them doing business for Ireland.  That is what we should be focused on.  I lead trade missions abroad with some of the best companies in the country, including some fledgling companies that are trying to make an impact on world markets.  They are showing the bottle and are taking the risk.  They are not speaking like the Opposition.  They are in markets doing business, as we should recognise.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>We all know the international financial system is in chaos and that Ireland&rsquo;s economic woes are mounting &mdash; even Fianna F&aacute;il is gradually conceding that.  The Taoiseach and Minister for Finance surely must be refreshed, relaxed and ready to roll up their sleeves now that summer has been and gone.  If they do not start to get real about our economy, there is a danger that the autumn D&aacute;il session will be a bridge between the Government&rsquo;s summer slumber and a winter of discontent.  </P>
        <P>The number one difficulty facing the economy is rising unemployment.  Young men losing jobs on building sites are particularly affected.  As we are in the distinguished presence of two men who have become Ministers of State since the new Government was formed, I remind them that since then 46,000 people have lost their jobs.  That is a record for the 140 days they have been in office.  The Government must make unemployment public enemy number one.</P>
        <P>All our reluctant Minister for Finance seems to be able to muster is whinge after whinge after whinge.  There is not an ounce of sympathy there.  In fact, whingeing has been the most notable feature of Deputy Brian Lenihan&rsquo;s tenure as Minister for Finance to date.  He said, before the summer, that businesses and consumers should stop whingeing about rising fuel prices.  This showed just how out of touch he is with ordinary people.  More recently, the Minister for whinge had the gall to blame the public for the housing bubble; his rationale was that &ldquo;you get what you voted for&rdquo;.  Let us not forget the Minister&rsquo;s most recent whinge last week when he blamed Joe Duffy for undermining the Irish banks when it is their own lax lending which has them in a bind as well as the failure of the Government to raise the deposit guarantee scheme as I and the Labour Party have requested for well over a year.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance realises that Government oversight of the banking sector has been dysfunctional and he wanted to divert the spotlight.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have been consistent in their whingeing about international factors; they refuse to face up to the fact that our economic downturn is largely home-grown and the fault of this Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  Whingeing, passing the buck and laying off blame will not get our economy back on the right track.</P>
        <P>Bringing the budget forward was a cynical attempt at media manipulation.  The Minister has bought a six-week window during which he can brief the press that at least the Government is <Col N="130"/>doing something.  His refusal to release either budget estimates or a pre-budget outlook is wrong.  He and his officials, unless they are from the same school of arithmetic that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, patronises, has to know the estimates and the likely outlook for next year.  If not, they do not deserve to be put in charge of beer mat economics, from which the Minister for Education and Science&rsquo;s estimates seem to come.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance&rsquo;s refusal to release the pre-budget outlook is consistent with the stunt former Minister Charlie McCreevy pulled on decentralisation.  It leaves the element of surprise for the Minister on budget day when he can pull rabbits out of hats and leave little ability to analyse what becomes a done deal.  Decentralisation backfired not so much on the Government because it won Fianna F&aacute;il votes, but massively on the public finances where it has cost us untold billions of euro over and above what a normal ordinary quality programme of negotiated decentralisation would have done.</P>
        <P>We are in a serious economic situation and now is not the time for such theatrics.  The Minister should put the economy ahead of his own vanity.  He should release realistic estimates for 2009 spending in advance of the budget as happens every other year.  In the information vacuum that appears to be developing, it is difficult to see how the best decisions can be made in the interests of families in Ireland.</P>
        <P>With financial markets facing their deepest crisis since the great depression, there is a growing consensus that the deregulation agenda of the past two decades has done more harm than good and must be reversed.  We do not need to ban financial innovation &mdash; we need to regulate it so that it does not put the financial system itself in jeopardy.  Part of the answer to the current financial crisis is the innovative regulation of derivative financial products.</P>
        <P>Just this week the European Parliament adopted a bipartisan resolution on financial service regulation.  There is agreement across the European political spectrum that the time for re-regulation is now.  In the face of this common sense consensus, European bankers are fighting a strong rearguard action, aided and abetted, unfortunately, by pliant Governments, including our own.  We should not take regulation from bankers.  It ought to be parliaments who decide what is in the best interest of investment, depositor, saver and lender.  The banks prioritise their own profit.  They say regulation undermines competitiveness.  What they actually mean is that regulation undermines their ability to make mega-profits by taking on mega-risks with other peoples&rsquo; money.  We need sensible regulation to restore financial stability.</P>
        <P>Just as we have safety standards governing the food we eat, the cars we drive and the medicines we take, we need safety standards for financial products to protect the stability of the financial system.  International financial regulators must be empowered to ensure that financial innovation never again gets so out of hand that it threatens the entire economy.  We have not yet seen the impact on European banks of the results of what has happened in America because we do not know how much of the derivative products, much of which are financial rubbish, is in their balance sheets.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the international scene we need a redesign of the financial regulatory architecture to ensure that any newly devised or existing financial products pass a consumer health check.  Banking executives&rsquo; bonus schemes should not incentivise excessive risk-taking, the masters of the universe, whether down in the IFSC, Wall Street or in the City of London.  Bonuses and annual payments of &euro;4 million, &euro;10 million or &euro;40 million are paid to them to gamble excessively with other people&rsquo;s money.  We need an early warning system to ward off asset bubbles and an alignment of interests between mortgage lenders and mortgage investors.</P>
        <P>The crisis of delinquent capitalism has already claimed high profile victims on Wall Street.  The worry is that the financial crisis will spill over to claim its victims on the high street and <Col N="131"/>main street of every Irish town and village.  People up and down the country are facing real problems in the real economy and they need a Government that is the real deal.</P>
        <P>Economic growth in Ireland is at its lowest level since 1988, unemployment has topped 6% and over 2,000 people are losing their jobs every week.  The cost of living is increasing at 4.3% and is three times the rate the Government inherited in 1997.  Consumer confidence is weakening and retail sales are falling for the first time since 2004.  The CSO construction employment index is down by 16% in the past 12 months.  Entrepreneurs with solid business plans cannot access finance and the Government has allowed for a deficit the public finances.  I notice the Minister&rsquo;s careful words where he acknowledges a deficit of &euro;5 billion, but we could be heading for &euro;7 billion by the end of 2008.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party rejects the conservative consensus that the public finances are the root cause of the problems in the economy, rather than a symptom of them.  International factors are making a recovery more difficult, but the root of our problems is the home-grown housing bubble.  There the Taoiseach led the field.  He stoked this in the budget of 2006-07 in order to win the election.  In the budget last year when Fianna F&aacute;il was back in power, he stoked it again in order to win his party&rsquo;s leadership.</P>
        <P>This is Deputy Brian Cowen&rsquo;s recession.  When we come to write the history of the financial times of this period in Ireland I hope historians will describe it in those terms.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Labour Party for sharing time.  I appreciate this and I also appreciate that Fine Gael moved this motion in its Private Members&rsquo; time.  It should not have been necessary, of course.  The Government should have afforded at least one full day, preferably two, to debating this most important matter.</P>
        <P>The economic challenges this State faces in the coming period are substantial but with well thought out and responsible policies they are not insurmountable.  Without doubt, some of what we face today can be attributed to the international credit crunch and a global downturn. Major investment banks, such as Lehman Brothers, collapsed, sending shockwaves throughout the financial world and causive massive liquidity problems.</P>
        <P>However, as much as we are exposed to outside factors, the Government can no longer hide from the fact that it is Government policy and mismanagement that has brought us to this point in the Irish economy.  Irish banks were not exposed in any comparable way to the sub-prime catastrophe that has hit the world&rsquo;s financial institutions.  However, because of years when domestic credit was made freely available to developers and speculators, our economy was allowed to develop on the back of an unsustainable and unstable property market.</P>
        <P>The false bubble referred to by the previous speaker, with whose comments I agree, was not capitalised upon by Government.  It was used to give absolute tax breaks to those doing very well out of the economy and was also used to bolster election chances.</P>
        <P>The Government presided over many investment failures in respect of value for money.  No major infrastructural projects came in on time.  Strategic investment was not made in providing broadband nationally, in revitalising rural Ireland, in public transport or in renewable energy.  The Government relied instead on property-based tax reliefs, leaving us with many hotels, car parks and shopping centres instead of social housing, buses and wind farms.</P>
        <P>The Government also failed to invest in measures to combat poverty.  As a consequence, almost 300,000 people live in consistent poverty and will remain there if this Government has its way.  It continues to boast that the fundamentals of the economy are sound when it is clear that economic growth in this State was driven by unreliable domestic consumption rather than by robust export policy and sustainable industry.</P><Col N="132"/>
        <P>Government policy produced a high-cost base for business, poor competitiveness, poor public services and huge private debt.  Its strategy of high indirect taxes means that, as consumer spending falls, the Government will lose still further revenue, thereby putting even greater pressure on the economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Over the summer months, however, the Government all but disappeared.  It took no action until it was dragged back into the House in late September.  The bringing forward of the budget is simply for the optics.  The Government must take charge.  It is time its members accept that the buck stops with them when it comes to running the economy.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, faces into his Budget Statement 2009 with a shortfall in tax receipts projected to exceed &euro;5 billion by the end of the year, and an Exchequer deficit which, by the end of August, had reached &euro;8.4 billion.  Nobody who has managed to make such a considerable miscalculation of the State&rsquo;s finances has any right to act smugly about the condition of the economy.</P>
        <P>A Government response to the current situation that seeks to address the shortfall in public finances by resorting to cutbacks in public services is not acceptable.  Our public services are already characterised by a lack of capacity and quality.  Of all the countries of Europe, only Estonia and Lithuania have lower public spending than we do.   There is a need to look at how and where the Government has wasted public money in recent years.  Opposition parties are correct to blame Government mismanagement for our present predicament but those of us in opposition also have a responsibility to propose solutions and outline what we would do, if in power.  It is not enough to say that Government must keep taxes low and must protect public services solely by seeking value for money in those services.  The present motion proposes as much.  That said, my party supports the motion.</P>
        <P>Our public spending is the third lowest in Europe.  Waste and duplication must be eradicated but let us not fool ourselves about the so-called black hole in public spending.  It does not exist.  Government spending is nowhere near the level it needs to be at in order to reverse the deficits that were allowed to build up in our social and physical infrastructure.  It is irresponsible of any of us in opposition to try to sell that line to the public.  Some members of the Opposition would quite happily stand over cuts in public services proposed by the Government rather than use innovative thinking to stimulate the economy and build the revenue that is needed to fund our public services appropriately.  We must offer responsible solutions as to how the Government might dig itself out of this mess in the short and medium term, while protecting the most vulnerable who have so often in the past proved a target for budgetary cuts.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in urges the Government to use the budget for 2009 in a number of ways in order to stimulate the economy.  We want job creation to be prioritised.  In particular, we want an immediate re-training programme for construction workers to get them into areas such as renewable energy, retro-fitting and other industries.  We want the Government to address underperforming export markets.  Approximately 90% of our exports in 2006 came from foreign owned companies based here, rather than from indigenous industry.  That is a shocking statistic.  A well-known American economist has commented that what we had was not so much a Celtic tiger but rather an American tiger trapped in a Celtic zoo.</P>
        <P>We want national development plan commitments in social and affordable housing and school buildings to be frontloaded.  This will re-employ construction workers and will help contribute revenue as well as keep those people out of dole queues.  We also want the Government to take action to reduce the cost of living pressure on low-income families and those dependent on social welfare, by establishing an anti-inflation package and awarding social welfare increases.  It is also imperative that the Government brings forward a set of proposals <Col N="133"/>to reduce cost pressures on small businesses.  This should include the fast-tracking of company law legislation in order to reduce regulatory burdens while protecting the rights of workers.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>There must be a fundamental reform of the tax system to ensure that we have both a low and a fair tax regime.  In the interim, however, the Government must use the tax system to assist those on low incomes.  Tax breaks and loopholes used by the super rich to avoid paying tax must be removed and those at the higher end of the scale must pay their fair share in order that sufficient revenue is generated for current and longer-term spending demands.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Over the coming two years Sinn F&eacute;in wants to see the following &mdash; national development plan investment prioritised and directed towards projects that address our infrastructual deficits; the development of a public sector reform plan, in partnership with the trade unions, that will combine increased investment in frontline services, with improved effectiveness; and the delivery of a national action plan for social inclusion to redress the inequalities in our society.</P>
        <P>In the longer term we must turn our economy around.  We need an economic model based on principles of high quality employment, environmental sustainability, tax justice and world class public services.  These matters are what both Government and Opposition parties must discuss.  Of course we do not have enough time to tease out these issues in the time afforded by the Fine Gael Private Members&rsquo; motion.  Again, I acknowledge this motion and I appreciate its introduction.  Unfortunately, there are many other issues, such as the prioritisation of job creation and dealing with how we must work ourselves out of the mess the Government currently finds itself in, of its own creation. I look forward to the opportunity to have a more lengthy debate in the future.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important issue, along with my constituency colleague, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.</P>
        <P>Monaghan General Hospital must be allowed remain on call and retain its accident and emergency and high care units.  According to senior personnel in the HSE, it is under order to wind down the service at Monaghan General Hospital as quickly as possible and specifically to take the hospital off call, leaving only a day service available in the accident and emergency area.  This is to be done in spite of the fact there is clearly no alternative available either now or in the foreseeable future.  A similar order was in place for Roscommon County Hospital, but this has now been removed by the Minister, allowing the HSE to retain the services there.  I beg the Minister to do the same in Monaghan and I urge my constituency colleagues in the Government party to ensure this happens.  The HSE recently gave my council and town council colleagues the same message, which is that they are only doing what they are under order to do by the Government.</P>
        <P>In the past ten days I have come across two cases of people who were sent home from Cavan General Hospital.  One man, who was 90 years of age, was sent home by ambulance at 1.30 a.m.  The other was a lady who was sent home and passed away a few hours later.  It is absolutely clear that Cavan General Hospital is not in a position to cope with its own patients, never mind the additional load from Monaghan.</P><Col N="134"/>
        <P>We have an excellent cardiac unit with an extremely strong independent report to state its records of success are at the highest level.  Our accident and emergency unit, named by the HSE as a treatment room, is of the highest calibre and we have the most modern bed units.  Nothing can justify the Minister&rsquo;s orders to wind down such a unit.  The people of Monaghan need this service more than ever.  Existing industries and potential new industries depend on such a hospital service.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt the actions of the Minister and this Government are nothing short of an introduction of euthanasia through the backdoor.  Home help and home care are not available, subvention for nursing homes has never been sorted out and now patients are being pushed by the Minister into areas where there is no service to cope.</P>
        <P>I realise the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has never felt the need in her heart to visit either Cavan General Hospital or Monaghan General Hospital, but if lives are to be saved she must either change the order that she and her Government have given to wind down our Monaghan General Hospital or take the only honourable alternative and step down from her position.</P>

	<P>I note again, with some vexation, that the Minister has not seen fit to take this Adjournment debate.  Perhaps it is past her bedtime, or does she continue to have little or no interest in hospital services in the north east?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Health Service Executive confirmed in a letter to me two weeks ago its plans to remove all acute care from Monaghan General Hospital and to downgrade it, essentially, to a minor injuries unit. The HSE has confirmed the death sentence for Monaghan General Hospital and in reply to my D&aacute;il question today the Minister also confirmed that sentence.  The Minister and the HSE confirm the ongoing implementation of the so-called transformation report, which I revealed in April.  The HSE is denuding Monaghan of services and working towards a deadline that, if adhered to, will mean that by Christmas 2008 Monaghan General Hospital, as we have known it for some years, will no longer be a hospital.</P>
        
        <P>When read carefully the HSE letter, entitled &ldquo;Developments in Cavan &amp; Monaghan Hospital Group Services&rdquo; and dated 3 September 2008, reveals a number of inconsistencies, raising huge concern about future patient care.  It speaks of having specific measures &ldquo;in place and bedded down prior to or in parallel with the transfer of acute care to Cavan&rdquo; by the end of November.  I note that those words are repeated in the Minister&rsquo;s reply to my parliamentary question today.  What does &ldquo;in parallel with&rdquo; actually mean?</P>
        <P>The HSE says it is committed to the enhancement of ambulance services, including an additional 24 hour emergency ambulance at Monaghan ambulance station, bringing the number of ambulances from two to three.  Will we be faced with a situation where acute care is removed from Monaghan before the extra ambulance is provided?  How long would such a gap in services be allowed to continue?  We have seen in the past where the HSE commits in principle to provide new services but we wait months or years to see them delivered.</P>
        <P>There are currently 3,000 acute medical admissions to Monaghan General Hospital per annum.  By the end of November this service will have to be provided by Cavan General Hospital, which already has to cater for 5,000 acute medical admissions per annum and has 160% bed occupancy.  This is to be done under this plan without a single extra bed being provided in Cavan.  How can this be achieved?</P><Col N="135"/>
        <P>The plan for the destruction of Monaghan General Hospital must be opposed in the strongest possible manner by the entire community and every elected representative.  I welcome Deputy Rory O&rsquo;Hanlon who is here to view the debate this evening because I believe it must include the Fianna F&aacute;il TDs for the Cavan-Monaghan constituency.  Like all Opposition Members, they too must be called to account on this matter.</P>
        <P>Surely what is good for Roscommon is also good for Monaghan.  How is it that we have not been able to prevent the loss of services at Monaghan General Hospital through the years, yet, with apparently little effort, such a situation can be put on hold, checked or reversed with regard to a hospital elsewhere in the State?  We want equality of access to health services for all citizens.</P>

	<P>I am taking the adjournment on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</P>
        <P>The Teamwork report, prepared for the Health Service Executive, clearly indicated that the service configuration in the north-east region was unsustainable.  It recommended a reconfiguration of hospital services across the existing five hospital sites to ensure the highest level of patient safety.  The report also identified a significant future role for all five hospital sites in the provision of acute hospital services.</P>
        <P>The report has helped to inform the approach being adopted by the HSE to the implementation of its transformation programme.  The programme involves widespread and fundamental change and is designed to build a health system that is in line with the model of care emerging internationally.  The overriding aim, which the Minister fully supports, is the improvement of safety and standards of care for patients in the region.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As part of the reconfiguration of acute hospital services in the north east the HSE previously indicated that it plans to transfer acute inpatient services from Monaghan to Cavan and to develop services at Monaghan.  The transfer is scheduled to take place later this year.  The HSE is working to ensure the necessary capacity is in place prior to or in parallel with the planned transfer date to ensure a smooth and safe transition.</P>

	<P>It is not doing that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>The necessary capacity is to be generated in a number of ways.  For example, a medical assessment unit is to be established at Cavan to help manage the anticipated increase in activity.  Beyond that measures are needed to ensure a more efficient use of available capacity and this has been highlighted in the national bed utilisation capacity report prepared for the HSE.  The average length of stay for inpatients needs to be reduced in line with best practice.  The discharge planning process also needs to be improved.  Alternatives to acute inpatient care are required through the provision of additional packages of care in the Cavan-Monaghan community care area.</P>

	<P>Where are they?  They are not there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>The capacity at Monaghan is to be increased through, for example, the development of additional respite and rehabilitation services.  Enhancements in pre-hospital care in the Cavan-Monaghan area are also required.</P><Col N="136"/>
        <P>Deputy Crawford referred to the position at Roscommon County Hospital.  In the past, Roscommon County Hospital and Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, have operated independently, with two consultant general surgeons in each hospital.  The difficulties faced by Roscommon and Portiuncula in maintaining surgical services independently, and the need for closer co-operation between them, were highlighted by the former Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al in March 2006.  Advances in clinical care and ever-increasing levels of specialisation mean the present model of care faces important practical difficulties, which must be addressed.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="10" />
        <P>In the light of these factors, the best way of retaining and developing services in Roscommon and Portiuncula hospitals is for these hospitals to work closely together.  The HSE has indicated it is proceeding with the proposal for a joint department of surgery and anaesthesia at Roscommon County Hospital and Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe.  The establishment of a joint department of surgery already is in place in the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group and is operating very successfully.  A joint department of emergency medicine is also in place and is operating across both hospitals.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked for this Adjournment debate because of continuing press reports that the abolition of the Combat Poverty Agency is imminent.  A review steering committee has, since June 2007, been examining the workings, value and role of the agency and in recent weeks has made recommendations to the Government.  Various reports suggest the agency may be merged with either the office for social inclusion or the National Economic and Social Development office or may simply be abolished altogether.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party strongly believes that undermining the independence of the Combat Poverty Agency would be a retrograde step.  It would completely destroy the objectivity of the only statutory organisation with a specific and all-encompassing role in the eradication of poverty.  It would represent nothing less than the silencing of criticism of the Government, however objective and constructive that criticism may be.  The Combat Poverty Agency was established in 1986 with a specific remit to help the Government to eradicate poverty.  It now appears the Government is about to tell us that while poverty always will be with us, the Combat Poverty Agency may not.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Of all Government agencies, it is incredible that this is the one which the Government targets first.  Poverty and social exclusion are still alive and well in Ireland.  One in nine children under 14 has substandard living conditions and the number signing on the live register has increased by 93,000 since the Government took office.  This week, for example, the Dublin Simon Community claimed it had been obliged to hand out three times as many sleeping bags in the first six months of this year than in the same period last year.  Unless one understands such problems, one has no hope of fixing them and understanding poverty constitutes precisely the value of the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Combat Poverty Agency has played a vital role in the past 22 years.  Without the agency, we would not have the facts about the chronic rate of poverty among children of low income families and the extent of poverty among lone parent households.  Without the agency, increases for old age pensioners may never have been secured because the hard data on the extent of pensioner poverty would not have been available.  It also was the Combat Poverty Agency that first proposed the establishment of the money advice and budgeting service, which has proved to be so successful.  It promoted, secured and developed the first national anti-poverty strategy and pioneered community development programmes throughout the country.</P><Col N="137"/>
        <P>One wonders what exactly the Government is trying to achieve.  The Exchequer grant to the agency this year is &euro;4.6 million.  In a Department that will spend &euro;17 billion this year, for the service provided, the sum of &euro;4.6 million is relatively small.  The same Department recently wrote off &euro;82 million in overpaid benefits and last year handed back &euro;64 million in unspent funding.  Why is the Minister targeting the Combat Poverty Agency when clearly, there are savings to be made elsewhere?</P>
        <P>It is my understanding that the review offers no figure for overall savings in costs or staff numbers, identifies no value for money issues and pinpoints very few areas in which the work of the Combat Poverty Agency is duplicated in another organisation or Department.  It appears that the only saving the Government is seeking to make is the embarrassment of an independent body telling it that it has 300,000 people living in consistent poverty after ten years of bulging Government coffers.  The point is that if this proposal is not being driven by savings, it must simply be by politics.</P>
        <P>For more than 20 years, the Combat Poverty Agency has provided an important service by identifying and analysing the causes of poverty and by providing a framework in which to address such problems.  It also has offered an important independent critique of the record of successive Governments.  Subsuming the agency into the Department of Social and Family Affairs would completely neuter the agency and rob it of its independence.  Rather than providing an independent assessment of Government policy on poverty, it simply would become another mouthpiece for the Minister.  The most vulnerable in our society deserve much more than that.  The Minister must reject these recommendations and give this House an assurance that the independence of the Combat Poverty Agency will be preserved.  I look forward to such an assurance this evening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Mary Hanafin.</P>
        <P>The Government decided in June 2007 that a review of the Combat Poverty Agency should be undertaken by the Department of Social and Family Affairs in association with other relevant Departments. The review forms part of the Department&rsquo;s value for money and policy review initiative programme for 2006-08.  The review, which commenced in December 2007, was overseen by a steering committee which was chaired by Mr. Niall Callan, former Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and comprised senior officials from relevant Departments and the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
        <P>The review&rsquo;s terms of reference were threefold.  First, it was to examine the role of the agency in the light of the emergence since 1986 of comprehensive strategies and programmes for social inclusion and extensive new institutional developments in support of social inclusion.  Second, it was to consider the operations of the agency in the context of efficiency and value for money.  Third, it was to identify the extent to which newer developments or arrangements may duplicate, overlap or complement the agency&rsquo;s role, report on the ongoing validity of its remit, bring forward proposals as appropriate for enhancement or rationalisation, or both, and make recommendations to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P>The review was presented to the Minister on 12 September 2008.  The Minister, Deputy Hanafin, is considering its findings and recommendations and intends to bring forward proposals to the Government on the future of the agency in the near future.  The Combat Poverty Agency has forwarded its views to the Minister and she will take them into account while formulating her proposals.</P>

      <sTitle>County Kerry Bogslide.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the evening of Friday, 22 August 2008, a number of local people, who were working in the Maghanknockane area of the Stacks Mountains, felt trembling on the bog.  They found this to be highly unusual as it had never happened previously in the area.  Bog movement became more visible the following morning.  It gained momentum throughout the afternoon and by evening, a bogslide close to 50 m wide and 12 ft. deep simply flowed down the hillside, following a path of approximately 3 km, along the valley of the Glashareag River.  It moved into an area known locally as Scanlon&rsquo;s Bridge.  <i>En route</i> to Scanlon&rsquo;s Bridge, the bogslide engulfed the bridge leading to the house of Denis Harris.  He was cut off for a number of days and was lucky not to have been on the bridge at the time of the slide.  His wife Maureen and son Padraig were unable to return home that Saturday and were obliged to stay with family and friends for a number of days.  Thanks to Kerry County Council, the bridge was put back into operation after a week or so.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>The Scanlon family, including Eamon Scanlon&rsquo;s 94 year old mother, were lucky not to be engulfed in the bogslide.  Initially, they were able to remain in their home.  However, following further movement of the bog, which came perilously close to their home, they subsequently were moved by Kerry County Council to a house in Tralee.  Unfortunately, over the past weekend, their vacated home was burgled, which was a heinous act.</P>
        <P>Kerry County Council&rsquo;s workers and engineering staff now have both bridges back in operation and the main through road through Macca is functioning at present.  The county council also has constructed a dam 4 km from the source of the slide, which serves as a siltation lagoon that prevents peat silt from moving downstream.</P>
        <P>A fish kill occurred in both the Glashoreag River and the upper Smearlagh River during this period.  It is estimated that approximately 5,000 fish perished, most of which were juvenile salmon and sea trout and which constitute the next generation for the Feale and Smearlagh rivers.  A fish survey is under way at present to determine the impact on the habitat and the extent of the fish kill.  This report is expected shortly.  It will no doubt take years for these very important and valuable spawning grounds to fully recover.</P>
        <P>Shannon Regional Fisheries Board has worked with Kerry County Council to advise on the construction of the two settlement ponds and jointly engaged BMA consultants to assess the present status of the landslide and its possible origins.  I hope this report will be completed and available shortly.</P>
        <P>Kerry County Council is continuing to remove peat from the upper sections of the Glashoreag river.  The company building a windfarm in the area has erected a dam to prevent a further large movement of peat.  The company has also commissioned Carlow-based geotechnical consultants AGEC to undertake a study into the cause of the landslide.  I hope both of these reports will be available in the near future as it is very important at this stage to allay the fears of the local people, make known the cause of the bogslide and take corrective action.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to consider helping those people affected by the bogslide, as both the Harris and Scanlon families surely deserve some compensation for the inconvenience caused.  A number of people have now been deprived of their fuel for winter because the area of bog they had turf harvested on was removed.  Some bags of turf for the winter were also lost.  The Minister, through Kerry County Council, should look favourably at helping these people.</P>
        <P>I understand there has been another bogslide today in the west of Ireland.  These are becoming all too prevalent.  It is time we have some national action to prevent these bogslides.  Whatever the reason behind them, surely it is possible to take such action.  The last landslide in the <Col N="139"/>Lyreacrompane area was more than 100 years ago and although I realise we had much rain this summer, there must be some reason for such a bogslide.  It does not happen by accident.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to give a very positive response and outline proposed actions to prevent a reoccurrence of this incident.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley.</P>
        <P>I sympathise very much with the people whose livelihoods have been affected by this bogslide.  I understand Kerry County Council is carrying out an investigation into its cause.  Unfortunately, the bogslide also resulted in serious damage to habitats and species.  The investigation should address whether and to what extent the works associated with a windfarm development in the area contributed to the bogslide.</P>
        <P>I will briefly mention the planning history of this case.  The planning application, accompanied by an EIA, was lodged with Kerry County Council in December 2002; the council subsequently granted permission for the development in October 2003, subject to 15 conditions.  In considering the case on appeal, I understand that An Bord Plean&aacute;la sought from the planning applicant a report from a qualified hydrogeologist or other suitable expert regarding the stability of the peat and soil cover on the site and the potential risk of landslides arising from the construction of the proposed development.  The applicant submitted a report on site stability in January 2004.</P>
        <P>I also understand that in March 2004 the board requested an additional report from the hydrogeologist assessing the impact of the potential construction works on soil stability with particular reference to construction methods and design and construction of turbine foundations.  This was supplied in April 2004 and following its consideration the board granted planning permission for this development on 16 June 2004, subject to 15 conditions.</P>
        <P>Separate bog slides on 23 August and 3 September 2008 caused damage to two designated European conservation sites &mdash; one special area of conservation and one special protection area.  The special protection area was designated particularly for the hen harrier, and an area of suitable foraging habitat for this species has been lost.  The special area of conservation was designated for salmon and otter habitat.  Spawning beds and feeding habitat have been extensively damaged for these species.</P>
        <P>The Feale river is recognised as one of the most important salmon rivers in the Shannon catchment.  For that reason, the lower River Shannon special area of conservation was extended to include a considerable stretch of the river, including its tributary, the Smearlagh.  Several kilometres of the Glashoreag river, which is a tributary of the Smearlagh, were also included in the extended special area of conservation, as they contained good stretches of salmonid spawning beds and nursery areas.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that 4 km to 5 km of fish spawning grounds have been destroyed and now lie under a metre or more of silt.  Fisheries officers have estimated that it may take ten years for the spawning grounds to recover.  There are now no fish in the affected parts of these rivers, and it is feared that silt will travel downstream and cause further damage.  The effects on biodiversity may also be significant, as otters in the area, which depend on fish, have lost their food source.</P>
        <P>The otter is strictly protected under the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997 to 2005, and it is an offence to damage or destroy the breeding site or resting place of this species.</P><Col N="140"/>
        <P Just="Left">The council is working closely with Shannon Regional Fisheries Board as well as the national parks and wildlife service of the Department.  Any restoration plan or measure would have to be screened by NPWS in the interests of necessary compliance with the natural habitats regulations.</P>

      <sTitle>Farm Waste Management.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JohnOMahony"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this very important issue with the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  I am disappointed the Minister is not here in person as I know thousands of farmers affected by this would have loved for him to answer this question once and for all.</P>
        <P>I will highlight two problems relating to the farm waste management scheme introduced two years ago to much fanfare in the Department that are causing panic in the farming community around the country, including my constituency of Mayo.  More than 20,000 farmers countrywide who have been approved for funding under the scheme face the impossible task of trying to complete the approved work before the expiration of the approved deadline, which has been set by the Department as 31 December 2008.</P>
        <P>I will briefly outline some of the history of the issue.  The fault for this impossible task lies firmly with the Government because it put in place a system which was clearly unable to cope with the significant demand that could have been expected in 2006.  Despite asking for and receiving an extended deadline, the Government failed to speed up the application process and granting of funds for buildings under this scheme.  This has greatly curtailed the time available for farmers to complete the approved works.  In doing so, this has left Irish farmers at a distinct disadvantage to EU counterparts.</P>
        <P>The progress of such works over the summer months has been confounded by certain unforeseen circumstances, most notably the inclement weather that has seen us having our wettest summer for over 70 years.  The Government&rsquo;s misjudgment, inaction and mismanagement of the scheme in this way has seriously affected farmers, as is evidenced by the many queries received by my office and clinics in Mayo and the experience of all Deputies from rural constituencies from all sides of the House to whom I have spoken.</P>
        <P>I have also been informed by my MEP colleague, Mr. Jim Higgins, that the Minister has informed him there are no plans to seek a further extension of the scheme.  This problem has wider implications than those for the farming community.  If no extension is granted to the impossible deadline, thousands more people will be laid off from building industries in January 2009.  As well as supporting the farming community, will the Minister remove the risk to these construction jobs at a time when the housing crisis has already caused havoc in the sector?  He can do so by going to Europe to seek a deadline extension.</P>
        <P>The second issue relating to the farm waste management scheme is the delay in payment by the Department to farmers who have already completed their projects.  I have been inundated with queries from farmers put under severe pressure by banks and lending institutions for money they rightly assumed they should get once the approved work was inspected and complete.</P>
     
         <P>On contacting the relevant section in the Department, officials admitted they had been waiting for months for cheques to be signed off.  We have all heard rumours to the effect that all funding for the scheme has been drawn down and no one will be paid between now and <Col N="141"/>December.  I call on the Minister to urgently clarify the position.  Will he confirm that the farmers in question will be paid immediately?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I attended a meeting in Crossmolina, County Mayo, last night attended by 400 angry farmers who have taken many hits over the years.  The issue last night was the closure of the Teagasc office in the town and its transfer to the urban setting of Ballina.  The issue is on the Minister&rsquo;s desk.  The 400 farmers who attended last night&rsquo;s meeting are an example of members of a rural community who have given their lives to farming and need our support now more than ever.  The Minister is not paying them what they are due and he is depriving them of the opportunity to meet the deadlines for the farm waste management scheme.  Now he is closing the Teagasc office in Crossmolina.  I urge him, once and for all, to stand up and be counted on these major issues.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, is unable to attend the debate because he was detained longer than he had anticipated fulfilling engagements in Kilkenny as a result of the decision by the Fine Gael Party to refuse a pair today to allow him to undertake important work at the national ploughing championships. </P>
        <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to clarify the current position regarding the end of 2008 deadline for completion of work under the revised farm waste management scheme.  The revised scheme was introduced by the Department in March 2006 to assist farmers to meet the additional requirements of the nitrates directive.  The amendments to the scheme included, in particular, an increase in the standard grant rate from the previous 40% to 60%, with 70% being available in the four zone C counties of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim and Monaghan.  In addition, the new scheme provided for an increase in the maximum eligible investment ceiling from &euro;75,000 to &euro;120,000 and removed any minimum income requirements from farming from the scheme in order that all small farmers could participate in the scheme.</P>
        <P>The immense success of the farm waste management scheme is demonstrated by the 48,580 applications received from farmers by the closing date of the end of December 2006, of which more than 30,000 were received during the final month.  More than 42,200 approvals to commence work have issued to date to farmers under the scheme, with the remaining applications either having been withdrawn, refused planning permission or explained by the receipt of multiple applications from a single farmer.</P>
        <P>The financial commitment of the Government to the farm waste management scheme is substantial, particularly during these challenging economic times.  This is demonstrated by the fact that to date in 2008, &euro;181.8 million has been paid out to farmers under the scheme compared to &euro;21 million in 2006 and &euro;114 million in 2007.  The Department is continuing to process payments under the scheme and I hardly need to confirm again that all farmers who complete investment works in accordance with the terms and conditions of the scheme will be paid their full entitlements.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt the farm waste management scheme has dramatically transformed the Irish farming infrastructure through this major injection of capital and will leave the sector well positioned to meet the highest international environmental standards required of Irish farming, as well as changing market requirements.  It will also continue to strengthen the competitiveness of Irish agriculture.</P>
        <P>The deadline of 31 December 2008 for completion of investment works under the scheme is a condition of the EU state aid approval governing the scheme and the European Commission has recently reaffirmed that it expects Ireland to respect this deadline strictly.  It should be noted that the farm waste management scheme has been in place since March 2006.</P><Col N="142"/>
        <P>The terms and conditions of the scheme make it clear that payment of grant aid is conditional on the time limit being respected and the Department has consistently held this position since the commencement of the scheme.  The Department is issuing its second written reminder to all farmers approved to commence work under the scheme to ensure all work is completed and a payment claim submitted to the Department by the end of this year.  No farmer can therefore be unaware of the importance of meeting this deadline.</P>
        <P>I thank the Deputy again for giving me an opportunity to clarify the current position on this matter.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 and 144 together. </P>
        <P>The fact that Dell is undertaking a fundamental review of its manufacturing operations and global business model has been in the public domain for some time.   More recently, Hewlitt Packard announced plans to implement a restructuring programme for one of its business groups.  It is standard IDA practice, where any of its client companies is undertaking restructuring of this type, to engage with the company with a view to mitigating the impact on the company&rsquo;s Irish operations.  I can confirm that IDA has been engaged in extensive discussions with the companies concerned at the highest level.</P>
        <P>I have been fully briefed on these discussions as they have occurred. I need hardly say that such contacts always proceed on a confidential basis and it is vitally important, if the best possible outcome for the Irish plants is to be secured, that such confidentiality is respected.</P>

        <P>The ICT sector has played a hugely significant role in the development of Ireland as the location of choice for foreign direct investment.  Specifically, it:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Directly employs 70,000 people</P><Col N="144"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Has enabled the development of sophisticated management and leadership capability in the economy</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Contributes circ. &euro;30 billion to the Irish economy on an annual basis in wages &amp; salaries, services and corporate tax</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Represents 43% of exports, estimated at &euro;46 billion</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Has led the innovation agenda in new technologies and business models</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Has assisted the national science &amp; innovation agenda and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Has spawned much of the indigenous ICT portfolio development.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The transformation of the Irish economy has been greatly influenced by the scale and quality of ICT related multinational investments over the last number of years. Many companies, both large and small, commenced operations in Ireland with single mandate manufacturing or a services function. They transformed over time to take on new responsibilities in other areas such as complex high end manufacturing and higher value services including Research and Development, and technical support functions.</P>
        <P>IDA&rsquo;s ICT portfolio now spans the entire ICT industry from semiconductor design and advanced manufacturing, to telecommunications software to IT Services from many of the world&rsquo;s leading companies and thought-leaders.</P>
        <P>Since 2006, IDA has seen significant wins across the sector with no fewer than 43 different projects approved. The projects were spread across the country and with overall investment volumes doubled from 2006 to 2007 yielding an employment potential of 3688 jobs. The capital investment over this period was in the region of circa &euro;700 million while RD&amp;I investments was in excess of &euro;217 million.</P>
        <P>The quality of new investments from global companies in Ireland reflects the continuous transformation of the industry and the development of the operating environment in Ireland.  Ireland is now an advanced economy with a cost base and living standards comparable to some of the wealthiest nations in the world.  We must compete against these developed economies as well as many emerging economies as a location of choice for FDI.</P>
        <P>In a time of relative economic turbulence overall cost competitiveness will place some operations in Ireland under pressure as they are benchmarked against sister sites.  Lower level or less complex manufacturing operations as well as low end service activities such as call centres are under increasing pressure from lower cost locations such as Eastern Europe and Asia. We can anticipate a churn in the region of 15-20% as the industry transforms and more cost sensitive operations move to alternative locations.  IDA expects most of the associated job losses to be offset and replaced by higher level activities.</P>
        <P>The risks, however, are not confined to the obvious categories outlined above as Ireland adjusts to the changing economic realities brought about by globalisation of markets and the ever-faster pace of technological change. Rapid industry transformation will lead to earlier product obsolescence and faster replacement needs. The consequence of this is that higher end manufacturing and services operations will not be immune from rationalisation. Ireland must adjust to the changing economic realities brought about by globalisation of markets and the ever-faster pace of technological change. IDA success in developing the ICT sector will hinge on our ability to differentiate ourselves in a meaningful way from our competitors.  Given their <Col N="145"/>remarkable record in meeting similar challenges in the past, I am satisfied that the strategy being pursued by IDA will secure the continued success of this vital sector in the future.</P>

	<P>I have previously advised the House of legal advice received from the Attorney General that specific provisions of the Consumer Protection Act 2007, namely Sections 48 and 49, were not compatible with EU law. In this regard it is important to point out that Sections 48 and 49 prohibit traders from imposing additional charges solely by reason of customers choosing to make payment by one relevant payment method over another and are more comprehensive in their effect than a simple prohibition on credit card surcharges. Accordingly, any interpretation of Sections 48 and 49 as being limited to a prohibition on credit card surcharges would not be correct.</P>
        <P>In so far as credit card surcharges are concerned, the Deputy may be aware of the recently promulgated Payment Services Directive, which is concerned with the manner in which payment services are provided throughout the EU. The Directive, whose transposition is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Finance, contains particular provisions in relation to payment method charges. Specifically the Directive &mdash; whilst stipulating that payment service providers, such as credit card companies, may not prevent retailers from imposing charges for the use of payment instruments, such as a credit card &mdash; does give Member States a discretion to prohibit such charges taking into account the need to encourage competition and promote the use of efficient methods of payment. The question as to whether Ireland should exercise this discretion is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment </TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>Trade unions who hold a negotiating licence are free to engage in collective bargaining on wages and conditions of employment. Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is based on a voluntary approach with terms and conditions of employment being determined in the main by a process of voluntary collective bargaining between the parties, without the intervention of the State. The collective bargaining process can cover the entire range of issues arising from the employment relationship. </P>
        <P>The State has sought to facilitate the bargaining process through establishing, by legislation, a number of agencies to assist in the resolution of disputes. These agencies are: the Labour Relations Commission, the Labour Court and the Rights Commissioner Service. There are also statutory provisions designed to back up the voluntary process in areas where collective bargaining does not operate effectively. The most important provisions are those concerning Joint Labour Committees and Registered Employment Agreements. In addition, the 2004 Enhanced <Col N="147"/>Code of Practice on Voluntary Dispute Resolution and the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001, as amended by the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004, provide mechanisms for the resolution of disputes in situations where collective bargaining does not occur and the internal dispute resolution procedures normally used fail to resolve the dispute.</P>
        <P>The issue of employee representation was considered in the context of the recent Social Partnership talks. In that context, the draft Agreement provides for the establishment of a review process which will consider the legal and other steps which are required to enable the mechanisms which were established under previous Agreements to operate as they had been intended. The review is to be completed by the end of March 2009 with a view to enactment of the necessary legislation in June 2009.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, the Social Partners have agreed a number of measures to prohibit victimisation and incentivisation (i.e. financial or other incentives to encourage persons not to join trade unions), and to provide effective protection and means of redress to employees when engaged in the exercise of their constitutional right to trade union membership or activity on behalf of a Trade Union or non-membership.</P>

        <P>The Competition Act, 2002 was introduced on foot of the Report of the Competition and Mergers Review Group which made a number of recommendations in relation to national competition and merger law.

        <P>As the majority of the provisions in the Act have been in force for more than five years, it was considered time to review how the legislation is operating in practice.  In October, 2007, my Department published advertisements in national newspapers seeking submissions on the operation and implementation of the Act.</P>
        <P>A number of submissions have been received from a variety of interested parties, including legal practitioners, trade unions, representative bodies and the Competition Authority.

	<P>The Government is well aware of the importance of secure, competitive and sustainable energy supplies for the business sector and economic competitiveness.  The Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security compliment regular Cabinet deliberations on competitiveness issues, including energy costs.</P>
        <P>My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, has responsibility for energy policy and the Commission for Energy Regulation has direct responsibility for setting electricity and gas prices for business users in Ireland. My Department works closely with the CER through a Competitiveness Forum, established in 2007, to ensure that competitiveness concerns are taken into account in the decision-making process.</P>
        <P>Oil and gas prices are, of course, decided internationally. Ireland is a price-taker in this regard.  We have witnessed remarkable fluctuation in energy prices in recent times, with price increases for gas and oil of 130% and 85% respectively in the twelve months to July 2008.</P>
        <P>Though Ireland cannot influence world energy prices, we can maximise value for money by increasing competition in the Irish energy market.  The Government is already committed to increasing competition in the electricity generation sector, with the target of reducing ESB&rsquo;s market share to below 40% by 2010.  The all-island Single Electricity Market, live since November 2007, is designed to create a more attractive electricity market for international investment. The recent sale of two generating facilities and two sites with electricity grid connections to the Spanish electricity company, Endesa, is a significant step to improving competition, giving Endesa approximately a 16% share of the Irish market.</P>
        <P>Competition is also being enhanced by the expansion of electricity interconnector capacity.  Significant progress has already been made on the East-West interconnector, which will be owned and operated by EirGrid, under the regulatory oversight of the CER.  EirGrid is also exploring the possibility of constructing an additional North-South interconnector.  Proposals for a 400kv power line between Cavan and Tyrone are currently at the pre-planning consulting stage.</P>
        <P>Irish businesses are encouraged to engage with Sustainable Energy Ireland. Last week, SEI launched a major awareness campaign highlighting the possibility of businesses reducing their energy bills by 20% or more through availing of the SEI Energy Assessment service.  I understand that five hundred Irish SMEs have already availed of this service, identifying potential energy savings of over &euro;25 million.</P>
        <P>My Department continues to engage on these issues in the interests of enterprises.  Keeping costs down for businesses in Ireland is essential to maintaining competitiveness in this challenging economic environment.</P>

	<P>The Company Law Review Group (CLRG) was asked, as part of its Work Programme for 2007, to examine the issue of &lsquo;Limited Liability Partnerships&rsquo; (LLPs). This follows from concerns, particularly of the legal and auditing professions, about the consequences of unlimited liability on partners in a firm. </P>
        <P>The Report of the CLRG on its 2007 Work Programme has been presented to me and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>In its Report, the CLRG outlines the problems which current partnership law is perceived to cause for certain types of business organisation in Ireland and concludes that the problems are real and substantial. The CLRG explores how the introduction of LLP legislation could address these problems and the types of safeguards which might need to be put in place to protect clients, customers and third parties generally, in their dealings with LLPs. The CLRG also considers whether the problems raised by current partnership law can be resolved by other means, without the need to amend the law of partnership.</P>
        <P>The CLRG came to the conclusion that a final decision on whether legislation on LLPs should be introduced, and on the shape and form which LLP legislation should take, can only be reached after a full consultation process involving all of those affected by the issues arising.  Such consultation should also include consideration of whether the general statutory limitation on twenty members should be maintained. The consultation process will take place during the coming months as part of the CLRG&rsquo;s 2008-2009 Work Programme.  The Group will then reconsider the matter based on the responses received.</P>
        <P>I await the CLRG&rsquo;s further examination of the issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would advise the Deputy that I have met the Chief Executive of the National Consumer Agency on two separate occasions since my initial meeting on 21st May 2008. In addition my officials <Col N="150"/>liaise with the Agency on almost a daily basis. A range of issues were discussed in the course of these meetings including the issue of prices, grocery prices and the pricing of UK goods in Ireland. In particular, I discussed with the Chief Executive the initiatives being undertaken by the Agency through its price comparison surveys to raise consumers&rsquo; awareness of prices, highlighting the value to be found by consumers making strategic decisions in relation to their grocery shopping and as a result encouraging increased competition between retailers.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome the fact that the available evidence indicates that the Agency&rsquo;s efforts in raising price awareness among consumers is having a material effect and that more people are changing their shopping habits, spreading their grocery shopping and are now prioritising price considerations when making their decisions on where to shop. Recent research commissioned by the Agency showed that 56% of grocery shoppers are shopping in a particular store based on price and that convenience is no longer the primary reason for choosing a particular grocery store. This significant shift in consumer attitude is reflected in the fact that the price of food, as measured by the Consumer Price Index published by the Central Statistics Office, continues to fall. The CSO&rsquo;s returns show that food prices have fallen for the past three months in a row.</P>
        <P>In addition to its initiatives in the area of food prices, the Deputy may also be aware that I recently requested the Agency to undertake a survey into the underlying reasons as to why pump prices for petrol and diesel have not fallen in line with the drop in the wholesale price of oil. Given the impact that transport costs can have on the average household budget, it is incumbent on fuel retailers to explain why the pump price of their products have not reduced proportionately to the reductions in the wholesale price of oil.</P>
        <P>Aside from its price awareness initiatives, the Agency has also been active in advocating a fair deal for consumers in a range of other areas. In this regard, the Agency successfully negotiated on behalf of 2,500 concert-goers with the promoter of a concert for varying levels of compensation arising out of difficulties experienced at that concert.  The Agency also successfully intervened to advocate on behalf of consumers who had booked flights to the USA at a particular price which the airline was not prepared to honour. In addition the Agency advocated on behalf of broadband users and in co-operation with the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland and the Communications Regulator put in place measures to address difficulties in relation to the manner in which broadband services are advertised, particularly in the areas of service delivery and performance. Another advocacy initiative undertaken by the Agency was the establishment of its Stakeholder Forum on Multi-Unit Developments. The aim of the Forum is, through the involvement of the various stakeholders, to try to address some of the problems being experienced by dwellers of Multi-Unit Developments. As a result of the work of the Forum, the Agency has published specific Guidance and Educational material to assist Multi-Unit Development dwellers.</P>
        <P>The mandate given to the National Consumer Agency under the Consumer Protection Act 2007 was specifically framed to enable the Agency to act as a powerful voice for the consumer including  raising awareness of consumer welfare and advocating the consumer&rsquo;s case against unscrupulous practices. I welcome the manner in which the Agency is embracing its mandate and I fully support it in its efforts to ensure that consumers do not suffer from unnecessary price increases and unfair commercial practices.</P>

	<P>Several of the agencies for which my Department has responsibility provide training to those in employment or those seeking employment. However the bulk of such training is provided by F&Aacute;S, the Training and Employment Authority. The current F&Aacute;S Strategy Statement outlines the vision and direction for F&Aacute;S for the period 2006 to 2009. The Strategy is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that the mix of training and employment programmes available respond to the changing needs of the economy, including those of the trainees.  </P>
        <P>The process of developing the next strategy statement to cover the period 2010 to 2013 has already commenced. This process will involve close collaboration with my Department and include a comprehensive internal and external consultation process involving all relevant stakeholders.</P>
        <P>In addition to the F&Aacute;S funded and F&Aacute;S provided programmes, the Skillnets model provides an effective response to the dramatic economic changes underway. As economic changes impact upon Skillnets networks, programmes are revised to match the priorities of member companies.  This process reflects the essential strength of the Skillnets model.  The model ensures each network has the flexibility to adapt quickly to change and keep their offering relevant to the needs of Irish industry.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently commencing a review into labour market programmes, including training programmes. This review will examine these programmes in terms of efficiency and effectiveness and draw conclusions about the adequacy and balance of resources in the context of current and future labour market policy challenges taking into account the recommendations of the National Skills Strategy.</P>

	<P>Broadband infrastructure and telecommunications policy is the primary responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural resources.</P>
        <P>This Government is fully aware of the importance of communications infrastructure for our economic competitiveness.   The Government is committed to improving our broadband infrastructure and I would like to make the point that substantial progress has been made.  There has been significant changes in the Irish market in recent times, including enhanced enforcement powers for ComReg, progress in local loop unbundling, and increased competition in the Irish broadband market.</P>
        <P>With a view to our future needs in the domain of telecommunications, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources released a consultation Paper on Broadband and NGNs on July 3rd 2008. The Paper sets out an ambitious objective to have ubiquitous access to broadband by next year and that by 2012, speeds equivalent to or higher than those in comparator EU regions will be available over a variety of platforms.</P>
        <P>As set out in the Consultation Paper the proposed approach of Government is at two levels. Firstly, Next Generation Broadband will be primarily delivered by private investment. The role <Col N="152"/>of Government is to encourage and facilitate this investment across a range of competing technology platforms.  To support the necessary investment the Government will ensure a robust regulatory environment is in place.  Secondly, Government will invest in infrastructure in a targeted way in specific cases of market failure.  It will do so to facilitate public policy goals in key areas, of public service delivery e.g. to make sure we do not see a regional or social Digital Divide develop in our country.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome this Consultation Paper and I look forward to the conclusion of the consultation process.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 and 206 together.</P>
        <P>Regular Internal Audits are part of the normal governance process of any organisation and I am aware that of the many Internal Audits carried out into both F&Aacute;S activities and projects funded by F&Aacute;S, some have shown up irregularities and possible occasions of fraud.  F&Aacute;S has referred two cases of possible fraudulent activity to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Some Internal Audits have also indicated areas where management or financial controls could be improved. In my view the process of internal audit is an important, appropriate and normal activity in any organisation.</P>
        <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General in his report on non-commercial Semi-State bodies, published in May 2008, reviewed the issues raised in one specific F&Aacute;S internal audit report.</P>
        <P>I discussed this matter with the Director General of F&Aacute;S and expressed my concerns about the issues raised by both the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Internal Audit reports, and in particular, the need to secure value for money in public expenditure.</P>
        <P>On my instruction, the Secretary General of my Department wrote to F&Aacute;S on 30th June 2008 seeking the formal assurance of the Director General of F&Aacute;S that:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the practices outlined in the F&Aacute;S Internal and Comptroller and Auditor General Audit Reports had ceased;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />that adequate systems and controls are in place to prevent any recurrence; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />requesting details of the remedial actions taken by F&Aacute;S in respect of the issues raised by the audit reports, with quarterly progress reports on the implementation of the Audit Reports recommendations.</P><Col N="153"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The F&Aacute;S Director General replied on 1st July 2008 confirming that the unacceptable practices referred to in the Audit Reports had ceased and that adequate systems and controls are now in place to prevent any recurrence.  The next quarterly report is due at the end of September.</P>
        <P>In order to address wider continuing concerns about the management and control systems in place in F&Aacute;S generally, and following further discussions with the Chairman and Director General of F&Aacute;S, I have also now decided that there should be an external investigation into the effectiveness of the agency&rsquo;s financial management and control systems.</P>
        <P>This examination is to ensure that appropriate public procurement procedures exist to prevent or detect irregularities or wrongdoing and, in particular, to examine and report on the activities of the F&Aacute;S Corporate Affairs area since 2000. The Comptroller and Auditor General has agreed to carry out such an investigation with a view to producing a special report on the matter.</P>
        <P>The Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General will be furnished to me by the Comptroller and Auditor General and will be presented by me to the D&aacute;il in accordance with standard operating procedures.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136, 141 and 159 together.</P>
        <P>The number of deaths recorded in workplace accidents during 2007 was 67 compared to 51 in 2006 with a considerable amount of this increase being accounted for by a number of fishing accidents.</P>
        <P>Of the 2007 total, 18 occurred in the construction sector.  This was an increase of 5 fatal accidents on the 2006 figure. The construction sector ranked third in relation to fatality rates, at 5 per 100,000 workers, in 2007. This figure is higher than the rate of 4.3 fatalities per 100,000 workers in 2006 (the lowest recorded rate for the sector) but maintains the general downward trend in the fatality rate seen since 2002.</P>
        <P>There have been 46 workplace deaths reported to the Authority so far in 2008 (22.09.08). For the first eight months, there were 43 workplace deaths. For the first eight months of the previous years, the figures are: 47 in 2007; 42 in 2006; 60 in 2005; 35 in 2004; 45 in 2003; and 40 in 2002.</P><Col N="154"/>
        <P>Construction and agriculture are consistently the highest risk sectors in which to work, based on the number of fatalities.</P>
        <P>Non-fatal accidents, resulting in absence of more than three days from normal work following the accident, are required to be reported to the Authority. There were 7,757 non-fatal work related accidents reported to the Health and Safety Authority in 2007.  The most up-to-date comparative figures that are available to the Authority at the moment refer to the first six months of those years.   For the first six months of 2008, there were 4,821 non-fatal accidents reported to the Authority. This compares to 3,865 non-fatal accidents reported in the first six months of 2007, 4,001 for the same period in 2006, 3,841 for 2005, 3,419 for 2004, 2,096 for 2003, and 1,823 for 2002.</P>
        <P>Safe workplaces can only truly be delivered by those who work in them. Responsibility for safety at work rests ultimately on the shoulders of employers and employees.</P>
        <P>However, I am on record as having voiced the Government&rsquo;s concerns at the increase in fatalities both generally and in the construction sector. The Health and Safety Authority is an independent Agency charged with the statutory responsibility for promoting an awareness of health and safety in the workplace and enforcing health and safety legislation.</P>
        <P>Based on its own risk assessment, the Authority is prioritising in 2008, the high-risk sectors of agriculture, construction, transportation and storage as well as mines and quarries. It continues to work with employer and employee organisations to make safety and health an integral part of doing business in every workplace.</P>
        <P>In relation to the construction sector, I am informed that the Authority has plans to carry out 7,000 construction-site inspections in 2008. Also, it will continue to implement the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2006 and the Safe System of Work Plan (SSWP).</P>
        <P>I formally launched the Construction Safety Partnership Plan 2008-2010 on Tuesday, 17th June 2008. The Construction Safety Partnership (CSP) includes representatives of the Construction Industry Federation (CIF), Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), Health and Safety Authority (HSA) and other relevant Agencies and Government Departments and its overall aim is to achieve the highest possible standard of safety, health and welfare in Irish construction.</P>

	<P>The number of employment rights inspections/visits/calls undertaken by the Inspection Services of the National Employment Rights Authority in 2008 to date is 21,711. During the same period in 2007 some 7,189 inspections/visits/calls were undertaken.       </P>
        <P>Of the 21,711 inspections/visits/calls to date in 2008, breaches were detected in 3,502 cases.  In the same period in 2007 breaches were detected in 1,349 cases.</P>
        <P>To date in 2008, &euro;1.66 million in underpayments of wages due to employees has been recovered by NERA Inspection Services compared to &euro;1.8 million for the corresponding period in 2007.</P><Col N="155"/>
        <P>The outputs and outcomes to date in 2008 reflect both the more focussed and targeted activities being undertaken by NERA in relation to employment rights promotion and compliance and the increased number of NERA Inspectors.</P>

	<P>The purpose of the strategies and policies being pursued by the Industrial Development agencies in Tallaght is to support enterprise development and provide employment opportunities in the area.  The agencies work closely with each other and with local interests thereby using an integrated approach in order to increase the flow of potential investors and promote job creation in Tallaght and south Co. Dublin. A special conference took place on 10 July last. This involved all the key players. A Strategic Plan is now being prepared for the area to address the problems arising from the current economic situation.</P>
        <P>The area has a number of attractions including a Third Level Institute and excellent infrastructural facilities at Citywest and Grangecastle.  The development of the Grangecastle Business Park and the City West Business Park ensures that the area remains an attractive location for investment.  Planning Permission has been approved for an Advance Integrated Circuit Manufacturing and Research facility at Grangecastle &mdash; this is the largest planning application to date in the State. This will be an invaluable tool for the future marketing of Grangecastle as a potential source of high quality and large-scale employment for the overall area.</P>
        <P>Only last year, Microsoft Corporation selected Grangecastle as the location for its new European data centre involving a $500 million investment and 75 jobs.  This reflects very well on our standing internationally as a global knowledge based economy.  It also demonstrates our commitment to growing next generation business in south west Dublin and it shows the suitability of the area for world-class investments.  Furthermore, Wyeth Biopharma has established the world&rsquo;s largest biopharma campus facility at Grangecastle and it is investing in dedicated research and development facilities. In June this year, Business Objects announced that it is to invest &euro;29 million in establishing a research and development centre in Citywest. This significant new development will create a research and development team of 100 people over a four-year period.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the strategies and policies being pursued by the State agencies in the area will continue to be successful in terms of investment and job creation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 140 and 150 together.</P>
        <P>Forecasting employment figures is a difficult business and subject to a variety of unforeseen, often extraneous, variables influencing estimates of that nature. However, I still expect employment growth &mdash; being the excess of jobs created over jobs lost &mdash; to continue in 2008 and beyond, albeit at a slower pace than in previous years. The latest available employment data from CSO indicates that at Quarter 2 2008 there were almost 7,000 additional people in employment compared with the corresponding period in 2007. This is a testament to the resilience of our economy at a time of great uncertainty in global economic conditions, the continued strength of the euro and the dramatic downturn in the construction sector.</P>
        <P>The Irish economy is undergoing a certain amount of adjustment and while the rate of employment growth is expected to slow it must be viewed in the context of historically unprecedented numbers of people in work. Since 1997, over half a million new jobs have been created in Ireland and the number in employment exceeds 2.1 million.  In the period 2002-2007 the Enterprise Development Agencies created over 156,000 new full time jobs across all sectors &mdash; note the table below.</P>
        <P>The recently launched &ldquo;Report of the High Level Group on Manufacturing&rdquo; contains 26 recommendations directed at key areas of innovation and productivity leading to transformational change, reskilling and management development for the innovative firm, increasing awareness and take up of existing supports. The implementation of the recommendations set out in this report will help to ensure that manufacturing will remain an integral component of our economy providing high value sustainable employment.</P>
        <P>In tandem with our focus on adding value to the manufacturing sector, over the last two decades we have developed a very significant Services Sector which now employs two out of every three Irish workers. We are one of the world&rsquo;s leading service exporting countries and currently ranked the 10th highest exporter of services in the world. Earlier this month, I launched the report of the Services Strategy Group, &ldquo;Catching the Wave:  A Services Strategy for Ireland&rdquo;. The report sets out new policy proposals on how we can ensure the continued development and growth of Ireland&rsquo;s services sector. I believe that the implementation of these recommendations will enable Irish service companies to exploit new and exciting opportunities, such as eLearning, business and financial services, professional and consultancy services and others which will lead to significant employment opportunities for our workforce.</P>
        <P>Competition for foreign direct investment (FDI) is relentless but Ireland continues to punch above its weight when it comes to attracting overseas investment.  The pipeline of new business for which IDA Ireland is competing is strong, as evidenced by a number of high profile recent announcements. Already this year 28 new IDA investments have been announced with the potential to create 2,100 jobs over the coming years.</P>
        <P>Looking to the future, neither the Government nor my Department are complacent regarding the varied challenges facing the country&rsquo;s economy. One of our main tasks is to ensure that Ireland remains an attractive place to do business and to support the development of economic competencies higher up the value chain. In that regard, we continue to work to maintain and enhance our framework competitive conditions, and promote new areas of competitive advantage by developing our R&amp;D, base, investing in critical physical and communications infrastructures, and promoting tertiary education and lifelong learning.</P>
        <P>We will continue to pursue policies to promote lifelong learning and up-skilling to improve labour market flexibility and, where necessary, ensure that appropriate training supports are provided for workers in sectors that are no longer competitive should they need to find alternative employment. Our priority remains the creation of high quality, sustainable employment, <Col N="157"/>driven by companies with higher profitability, that are more technologically advanced and prove a better fit with the competitive characteristics of our economy. </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 142 and 161 together.</P>
        <P>The issue of employee representation was considered in the context of the recent Social Partnership talks. In that context, the draft Agreement provides for the establishment of a review process which will consider the legal and other steps which are required to enable the mechanisms which were established under previous agreements to operate as they had been intended. The review is to be completed by the end of March 2009 with a view to enactment of the necessary legislation in June 2009.</P>
        <P>The Employment Agency Regulation Bill will repeal and replace the Employment Agency Act 1971. The purpose of the Bill is to provide for updated regulation of the employment agency sector including licensing of employment agencies. Adherence to a code of practice setting out standards for the sector will be a condition of qualifying for a licence. The Bill will also provide for the establishment of a Monitoring and Advisory Committee, which will include representatives of the Social Partners, and which will have the task of drawing up the code of practice.</P>
        <P>I intend to publish the Bill before the end of 2008.</P>
        <P>Ministers of twenty-seven EU Member States reached political agreement at the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council on 9/10 June 2008, on the long-standing issue of the Temporary Agency Work Directive.  The Council Common Position on this Directive will now be submitted to the European Parliament, as foreseen by the co-decision procedure.</P>
        <P>As the Directive is at present at draft stage, action in relation to its transposition into Irish law can only commence after its adoption and in this connection the draft Directive provides for its transposition into national legislation within a period of three years of its adoption.</P>

	<P>The table of figures below shows the actual number of employees who were paid statutory redundancy lump sums on a year by year basis from January 2002 to end August 2008.  This does not reflect those who lost their jobs having less than two years service in an employment as this does not qualify for payment under the Redundancy Acts.</P>
        <P>My Department carried out an analysis last year in which the average annual level of redundancies for the period 2002-2006 was compared with the level of redundancies in the period 1995-2001. It was found that the level of redundancy had almost doubled and the cause may be attributed to two factors:</P>
        <P>Firstly, there were more people at work in the more recent period; this accounted for 20% of the increase in the level of redundancies.</P>
        <P>Secondly, the risk of redundancy increased significantly in the second period and this accounted for 80% of the increase in the level of redundancy. </P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Government policy on the Doha Development Round of trade talks at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) is to secure a comprehensive, ambitious and balanced trade agreement. Such an outcome would have been an important fillip to the world economy. It would have delivered tangible gains to Irish exporters, consumers and of course developing countries, especially the least developed countries. This latter point is important because the Doha Round was launched as a development round to provide better economic and trade opportunities for developing countries. Consequently, it is a disappointment that the Ministerial meeting at the WTO last July did not manage to agree the main elements of an agreement, and so pave the way to a final wide ranging trade consensus. </P>
        <P>The scope of the negotiations is very wide and covers many areas where Ireland would benefit, for example, in the reduction of tariffs for our manufacturing exports and the removal of barriers for our service providers who trade internationally. In that regard, there were some positive signs at the Geneva Ministerial Meeting. Although the main focus of the Ministerial meeting was to agree a framework for reducing tariffs and domestic support in agriculture and non-agricultural market access (NAMA), it was emerging that the package under discussion could be worth in excess of half a billion euro to Irish exporters of goods and services, to consumers in terms of lower import tariffs and from broader economic benefits. These possible opportunities have to be set against an agreement that would also pose some very serious challenges for us, most notably in regarding proposals on agriculture. Whenever a final outcome to the negotiations is to be assessed the extent of these challenges will be an essential feature in our consideration.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to predict what may happen now in the negotiations. Talks are continuing at senior official level in Geneva to see if there is a possibility to move closer to agreement sooner rather than later. However, there are many complex issues still to be ironed out before any package can be presented to Ministers and it seems unlikely that this stage can be achieved in the short term.</P>
        <P>The Government remains committed to a balanced outcome to this WTO trade round and we will continue to firmly press our concerns in every Doha related forum. The importance of these, particularly concerning our agriculture sector, will continue to be at the forefront of our negotiating position whenever the talks recommence in a more substantive manner.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>Data from the CSO quarterly industrial survey shows that average industrial earnings per hour for male industrial workers on adult rates in June 2007 was &euro;16.62. For female industrial workers the average rate was &euro;12.73.  </P><Col N="160"/>
        <P>From the CSO National Employment Survey for October 2006, average hourly earnings were &euro;20.50 for males and &euro;17.67 for females. These latter figures cover the entire economy in October 2006 (excluding employees in agriculture, forestry and fishing).</P>
        <P>The gender pay gap has fallen consistently and is now below the EU average of 15%.  The most recent official figures from Eurostat (2005) put the Irish gender pay gap at 9%, placing us fourth lowest among the EU27.  This compares with a rate of 14% in 2003, showing a drop of 5% in two years. However, Eurostat acknowledges that these data are provisional and not wholly comparable between Member States.</P>
        <P>Addressing the factors behind the gender pay gap is a multifaceted task involving a number of Government Departments and agencies as outlined in the National Women&rsquo;s Strategy, 2007-2016 launched last year by An Taoiseach.  Overall coordination of the National Women&rsquo;s Strategy is led by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible for a number of actions which are thought to impact upon the gender pay gap.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Labour Affairs, I am responsible for the National Minimum Wage legislation.  The national minimum wage was introduced in Ireland in April 2000.  Since its introduction there have been six increases to the minimum rate.  The most recent increase saw the minimum wage increase to &euro;8.65 per hour, which is the second highest in the EU. The introduction of the national minimum wage in 2000 has had a positive impact on women who previously were more likely to have received very low wages in sectors which were predominantly female.  Prior to the introduction of the minimum wage, the gender pay gap was at 22%.</P>
        <P>My Department is responsible for chairing and providing the secretariat for the National Framework Committee on Work/life Balance Policies. This Committee, which was established under the social partnership process, comprises representatives from IBEC, ICTU, the Equality Authority and a number of Government Departments.  The Committee has undertaken and continues to undertake a range of activities to raise awareness and encourage the provision of work/life balance at the level of the enterprise and these can help to encourage greater female participation in the workforce, including at senior levels which in turn can help narrow the earnings gap.</P>
        <P>Similarly, &ldquo;Expanding the Workforce&rdquo;, which is run by F&Aacute;S, is aimed at proactively encouraging women to return to work. The initiative facilitates women returnees by ensuring that training is provided in a flexible manner and is tailored to meet business requirements and skills needs of employers.</P>

	<P>Ireland has transformed as an economy over recent years, and we are well positioned to continue this transformation over coming years. We will rely increasingly on the performance of the enterprise base, particularly the traded sectors to restore the economy to a growth path.  Our competitive advantages which served us well in the past such as our skilled and flexible workforce, favourable regulatory environment and pro-enterprise policies will be preserved, developed and exploited to the full.  We will also work on developing new sources of competitive advantage in areas such as our knowledge and skills base.  We will ensure that our education and training systems are flexible and adaptive and are producing a talented workforce with the right balance of skills to meet the requirements of the changing structure of the economy into the medium to long term. </P>
        <P>We will continue to nurture the strong enterprise spirit in the economy and we will shortly bring forward a policy statement on entrepreneurship that will further improve the range and delivery of the extensive support services available to entrepreneurs.</P>
        <P>Enterprise policy has traditionally recognised the importance of services exports and I welcome the report of the Services Strategy Group, &ldquo;Catching the Wave: A Services Strategy for Ireland&rdquo;, which was published on 12th September 2008.  This Report sets out to broaden our <Col N="162"/>thinking on how services can contribute to our success and identifies strategic aims for future services policy in Ireland.  This report will guide the development of our services strategy into the future to exploit the opportunities which this sector presents.</P>
        <P>Our manufacturing sector is in transition but is well positioned to meet future challenges.  Ireland&rsquo;s manufacturing future depends on a manufacturing sector that is capital intensive, knowledge intensive and skills intensive, focused on developing innovative products, services and solutions and meeting the needs of markets and customers. The report of the High Level Group on Manufacturing identifies the focused actions needed by employers, employees and Government to respond to challenges and take advantage of opportunities to further develop the sector in Ireland. The Government is committed to ensuring the recommendations of this Group receive a high level of priority to ensure that the manufacturing sector continues to evolve and to provide high value added and high quality employment for the future. The Group&rsquo;s report is currently being considered by the Social Partnership Forum as part of the ongoing review of &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Ireland maintains an open and attractive environment for overseas investment.  The IDA continually adjusts its strategy to ensure that its offering to investors matches the changing requirements of the multinational companies it is targeting.  Ireland continues to be capable of winning advanced, high value and high skill investments.   In the first half of 2008, IDA announced 22 investments with a capital investment of &euro;916m and a potential to create c.1600 jobs.</P>

The European Communities (Requirements to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations 2002 require retailers to display the selling and, where appropriate, the unit price (the price per litre or kilo) for all products covered by the scope of the Regulations. The Commission will be reviewing the Directive upon which these Regulations are based and I will support measures to enhance the information to be made available to consumers. This review is part of the general review of the Consumer Acquis. </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 154 and 166 together.</P>
        <P>In July this year, the Minister for Finance announced that he had asked for a review of State agencies to be carried out to examine whether they could share services, whether it would be appropriate to absorb some of their functions back into their parent Departments, or whether some agencies should be amalgamated or abolished.  The Minister stated that the outcome of this review would be considered by the Government in the Autumn.</P>
        <P>The review has not yet been completed and has not been considered by the Government.  In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter.</P>

	<P>In accordance with commitments given under Towards 2016, the Social Partnership Agreement, the number of Inspectors was scheduled to increase from 31 to 90.  Competitions were held in 2007 for the recruitment of the additional fifty-nine Inspectors and, fifty-nine inspectors have been assigned to NERA from these competitions. </P>
        <P>All new inspectors have completed the NERA Inspection Services Introductory Training Programme and are currently undertaking further training, including on-the-job training with experienced inspectors.  This involves working with experienced Inspectors in carrying out inspections and other associated enquiries at places of work with a view to determining compliance with certain employment rights legislation.</P>
        <P>Nine Inspectors have left NERA over the past year as a result of promotion or internal and external Departmental transfers and re-assignments.  As a result, the total number of NERA Inspectors currently stands at eighty-one.</P>
        <P>The panels established in 2007 as a result of the recruitment competitions have now been exhausted.  When new panels are established, NERA would be hoping to renew its intake of Inspectors.</P>

	<P>The number of calls/visits/inspections carried out in relation to the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000 during which breaches of the Act were detected and the number of prosecutions initiated is as follows:</P><Col N="164"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />in 2006: 2,002 calls/visits/inspections were undertaken; in 104 cases breaches were detected and in one case a prosecution was initiated.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />in 2007: 1,942 calls/visits/inspections were undertaken; in 192 cases breaches were detected and no prosecutions were initiated.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />in 2008: 2,532 calls/visits/inspections have been undertaken; in 205 cases breaches have been detected and in one case a prosecution was initiated.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">NERA undertook a targeted campaign, which focused on compliance with the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, during the period 14 April to 11 May 2008. Such campaigns, accompanied by awareness and promotional activities, are a significant feature of the National Employment Rights Authority&rsquo;s employment rights compliance and information strategy.</P>
        <P>The primary role of the National Employment Rights Authority in the case of breaches of employment rights legislation, is to seek compliance and rectification of any breaches identified, including redress for the employees concerned and payment of any arrears due to those employees.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that in the majority of cases employers rectify breaches of employment law and pay underpayments of wages due to employees without prosecution. However, the National Employment Rights Authority reserves the right to initiate prosecutions in respect of breaches of certain employment legislation.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should be aware that Rights Commissioners of the Labour Relations Commission also hear complaints concerning breaches of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons (including those with a disability) with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.  CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.</P>
        <P>The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  F&Aacute;S makes every effort to ensure that differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.  F&Aacute;S also operates the programme flexibly as far as possible to ensure the continuation of community projects.</P>
        <P>In conclusion then, I would say that this Government will continue to support the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time <Col N="165"/>providing essential services to communities.  I have no plans to amend the eligibility criteria for participation on Community Employment Schemes, however, the operation of the Scheme is kept under constant review.</P>

In the course of that statement, I also reaffirmed the Government&rsquo;s strong belief that arming consumers with all the necessary facts and figures to make informed choices in relation to the goods and services that they buy is the best way to ensure that consumers can achieve a fair deal. In this regard I took the opportunity to discuss with the Chief Executive the Agency&rsquo;s initiatives in the area of Price Comparison Surveys.</P>
        <P>Since the meeting, the Deputy will be aware that the Agency published its most recent Grocery Price Comparison Survey on the 11th September. The survey found that there has been a significant decrease in the prices of own brand goods across all the retailers in the grocery sector unlike the position in relation to branded products where the price differential between retailers seems to be narrowing.</P>
        <P>Research commissioned by the Agency shows that price is becoming more and more of a priority to consumers when making their decisions where to shop. The research showed that 56% of grocery shoppers are shopping in a particular store based on price and that convenience is no longer the primary reason for choosing a particular grocery store. This significant shift in consumer attitude is reflected in the fact that the price of food, as measured by the Consumer Price Index published by the Central Statistics Office, continues to fall. The CSO&rsquo;s returns show that food prices fell by 0.3% in August, the third month in a row that the food price index has fallen. These welcome price decreases are concrete endorsements that the Agency&rsquo;s efforts in raising price awareness among consumers is having a material effect and that more people are changing their shopping habits.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding these developments and other indications of the catalytic effect that consumer behaviour is having by way of enhancing competition among retailers in the grocery sector, there is, as I remarked in my public statement, some way to go particularly in relation to the price differentials in the branded goods area. It also remains a matter of concern that the differential between the price of groceries in Ireland and the price of groceries in Northern Ireland or in the UK remains relatively high given the appreciation in value of the Euro against sterling.  In this regard I have requested Forf&aacute;s to carry out an assessment of the relative cost of doing business in a number of selected locations, including locations in this jurisdiction, Northern Ireland and the UK. I intend to continue to engage with the retail sector on this issue once the results of Forf&aacute;s&rsquo; assessment are available.</P>
        <P>I welcome the initiatives undertaken by the National Consumer Agency to ensure that Irish consumers have the necessary information to make informed choices in relation to the goods and services that they buy. In conjunction with the Agency, I am determined that progress continues to be made to ensure that consumers get a fair deal and do not suffer from unjustified price increases.</P>

	<P>My Department engages with the State enterprise bodies on both operational and policy matters on an ongoing basis, and their expenditure and operations are monitored closely throughout the year. There are strict uniform financial procedures in place to ensure proper governance with regard to the funds that are being drawn down. The annual Estimate process also, involves my Department examining agency expenditure in detail.  </P>
        <P>In addition, there is a formal liaison structure in place between my Department and the Agencies. As part of that structure, senior officials from my Department meet regularly with senior officials from the Agencies to discuss not just budgetary issues but all matters pertaining to their operation. The ongoing nature of this contact ensures close scrutiny of agency expenditure and activities and provides my officials with an overview on the progress of all the various work programmes.</P>
        <P>Specific reviews targeted at the particular modus operandi of individual agencies and taking account of their different roles have been undertaken periodically. An expenditure review of Forf&aacute;s, conducted by my Department in 2002, made a number of recommendations in order to formalise the agency&rsquo;s interactions with my Department, tighten its focus and increase efficiency and transparency. All recommendations arising from this review have been implemented.</P>
        <P>In the case of the IDA, an expenditure Review of their Property Programme was carried out by my Department in 2004. This review concluded that the property programme was being managed efficiently and effectively by the Agency and approved of the Agency&rsquo;s policy of disposing of property no longer needed while, at the same time, recognizing the Agency&rsquo;s need to have a set of property  solutions available for marketing at any one time.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland is engaged in a review process through a series of ongoing reviews of budgetary, programme and corporate procedures. This includes, inter alia, assessment of progress against EI targets associated with agreed agency Strategy and review of specific EI funding schemes/programmes. More specifically, an expenditure review, led by my Department, was completed on Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Overseas Office Network in 2004, which made a number of recommendations that have since been adopted.</P>
        <P>A Value for Money review of Science Foundation Ireland programmes was recently completed on behalf of my Department, as part of the Government&rsquo;s Value for Money and Policy <Col N="169"/>Review Initiative. The report, which was published in July of this year, examined the Foundation&rsquo;s funding programmes over the first years of operation. My Department and I are firmly of the opinion that the review will assist in securing value for money and maximising the economic impact from SFI investments.</P>
        <P>Performance reviews are, and will continue to be, an integral component, for my Department, in monitoring the activities of the Agencies. A suite of indicators comprising input, output and impact indicators, for the Management Information Framework of my Department is in place and the availability of this information enables managers to measure efficiencies within their own areas. I am satisfied that there exists a vigorous system &mdash; both formal and informal &mdash; for the ongoing monitoring and review of all aspects of operations and expenditure of the Enterprise Agencies.</P>

	<P>Ireland has an open policy when it comes to international trade. My Department encourages free trade and applies limited restrictions or limitations on imports. Any limitations that are applied are implemented to enable Ireland meet its EU or other international obligations, such as may be agreed by the United Nations. Under the EU Treaty, the Common Commercial Policy (which regulates the EU international trade policy) generally gives the Commission authority to negotiate international trade arrangements with countries outside the Union, based on a mandate from Member States.</P>
        <P>Import limitations will normally take the form of either import quotas, sanctions / prohibitions, or licences through which the level of imports of specific goods is monitored. Import limitations may also be applied for certain products such as agricultural produce, firearms/weapons, fireworks/explosives etc., the arrangements for which would be under the remit of other Departments such as the Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>The Licensing Unit of my Department issues import licences in conjunction with the EU Commission. The following are the principle areas affecting trade in which import limitations/restrictions apply together with details of the applicable EU regulations under which the limitations are applied.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Textiles:</i></P>
        <P el="0">EU trade policy restricts the importation of certain textiles and textile garments originating in specified third countries into the EU. These goods may not be imported into the EU without an import licence. The following are the main countries involved.</P>
        <P><i>China and Uzbekistan:</i></P>
        <P el="0">The importation into the EU of certain categories of textiles originating in the Peoples Republic of China and Uzbekistan are subject to double surveillance measures and require an import licence under Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1217/2007 which amended Annex III to Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3030/93 on common rules for imports of certain textile products from third countries.</P><Col N="170"/>
      <P el="10"><?oasys _fc ?><i>Belarus and North Korea:</i></P>
       <P el="0">The importation into the EU of certain categories textiles originating in Belarus and North Korea is subject to quantitative quotas under Commission Regulations (EC) No. 1402/2007 and 517/94 and require an import licence.</P>
        <P el="5"><i>Iron &amp; Steel Products:</i></P>
       <P el="0">The importation into the EU of certain iron and steel products originating in countries outside the EU are subject to either quantitative restrictions, double surveillance or prior surveillance measures (as contained in Commission Decisions No. 2136/97/ECSC, 1401/97/ECSC and 2744/1999/ECSC) and require an import licence.</P>
        <P el="5"><i>Potassium Chloride:</i></P>
       <P el="0">The importation into the EU of potassium chloride originating in Belarus is subject to anti-dumping measures and requires an import licence under Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1050/2006.</P>
        <P el="5"><i>Sanctions:</i></P>
       <P el="0">Trade sanctions are increasingly used by the international Community as a means of exerting influence on various issues of international concern. Ireland fully subscribes to its international obligations in this regard. My Department plays a central role in co-ordinating the implementation of the various United Nations and EC measures which have been adopted concerning trade. The impact of these measures on trade is, however insignificant, in the context of our well established international trading alliances. Where financial sanctions are in place, these are managed by the Department of Finance.</P>

The draft Agreement will now be considered by the parties with a view to ratification and it is my hope that the Agreement will be ratified by all sides.</P>
        <P>The draft Agreement provides for a number of commitments, including through legislation proposals, aimed at strengthening protections for employment standards, while also ensuring that Ireland continues to provide an excellent environment for business and job creation. These commitments are being examined within my Department to determine the optimum legislative approach and timeframe for delivery of the policy objectives in the draft Agreement.</P>
        <P>For my part, and without seeking to pre-empt in any way the ratification process, I look forward to working with the Social Partners and my Ministerial colleagues in making speedy progress on the commitments entered into under this Agreement, including those requiring legislative enactment. It is difficult to be specific about timetables for legislation as this is primarily a matter for the House and for the Seanad. However, the Deputy may be assured that no effort will be spared to meet the commitments in the Transitional Agreement.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 170 to 172, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Various labour market projections are available.  For example, F&Aacute;S, in its latest Quarterly Labour Market Commentary, for Quarter 2 2008 has forecast that construction employment will fall by &minus;6.9% (&minus;19,000) this year and by a further &minus;9.2% (&minus;24,000) in 2009.</P>
        <P>This estimated drop in construction employment of around 43,000 would bring it back to 2004 levels.  The recent easing of employment growth generally and construction employment in particular comes after many years of extraordinary growth, which could not have lasted indefinitely.  For example since 2004, total employment has grown by 273,900 with employment in the construction sector increasing by 50,300.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S and the Department of Social and Family Affairs are working together so they can respond quickly to the increase in unemployment, for example:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&Aacute;S and the Department of Social and Family Affairs have agreed that redundant workers will be referred immediately to F&Aacute;S rather than wait for three months on the Live Register as was the case before.  F&Aacute;S has also established a training fund to enable a speedy response to identified re-training needs for low skilled and redundant craft workers.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&Aacute;S is, with the Local Employment Services provided by Area-Based Partnerships, currently gearing up its Employment Services further to provide increased capacity for expected increased referrals from the Live Register.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&Aacute;S will be providing a range of certified, short, flexible, modular programmes designed to upskill redundant workers so that they can enhance their prospect of securing employment.  A number of programmes are already in place and the frequency and range of these will be expanded over the coming months.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A range of actions are being implemented by F&Aacute;S for those affected by the construction slowdown, including:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&Aacute;S will focus on providing retraining opportunities for: </P>
<P el="5" LI="2"><Miles com="bull66" />the installation of sustainable technologies</P>
<P el="5" LI="2"><Miles com="bull66" />environmental activity</P>
<P el="5" LI="2"><Miles com="bull66" />compliance and regulatory work</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&Aacute;S will also assist individuals in anyway they can in seeking employment abroad in construction in other EU countries. F&Aacute;S have held European construction jobs fairs for employers from other EU countries.</P><Col N="173"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Discussions concerning the 2009 budget are still ongoing. The budget for F&Aacute;S is agreed on the basis of detailed discussions between F&Aacute;S, my Department and the Department of Finance in the context of the annual Estimates process and will be announced on Budget Day.</P>

	<P>Following the repeal of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987 in March 2006, the then Minister requested the Competition Authority to review and monitor developments in the grocery sector in light of the new regulatory environment.  </P>
        <P>In March this year, the Authority presented to me two reports as part of the Grocery Monitor Project. The first report, A Description of the Structure and Operation of Grocery Retailing and Wholesaling in Ireland: 2001 to 2006 provides a description of the market structure at the wholesale and retail levels of the Irish grocery sector.</P>
        <P>The second report is entitled Price Trends in the Irish Retail Grocery Sector: A Description of the Evolution of Retail Grocery Prices between 2001 and 2007.  In this report, the Competition Authority has considered the impact of the removal of the Groceries Order by examining the evolution of the aggregate retail grocery price trends since 2001 by analysis of price data published by the CSO.</P>
        <P>These reports were noted by Government in April and were published by the Authority shortly thereafter.</P>
        <P>At that stage, the Authority indicated its intention to publish a third Report examining the retail planning system as it applies to the retail grocery sector.  Following the submission of that Report to me, I brought it to Government in July and this third Report, &lsquo;Retail Planning System as applied to the Grocery Sector 2001-2007&rsquo;, was published by the Authority on 10th September 2008.  This report identifies a number of features of the retail planning system that affect competition in the grocery sector. It contains seven recommendations aimed at promoting competition in grocery retailing in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I would like to advise the Deputy that the three Reports are available on the Authority&rsquo;s website www.tca.ie.</P>

The Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) provides estimates of the number of persons employed in the construction sector on a quarterly basis but does not directly measure job losses per se.

        <P>An allocation of &euro;200,000 has been set aside for 2008 under Subhead K of the Vote of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department to cover administration costs relating to the work of the Active Citizenship Office in co-ordinating the implementation of the recommendations of the Taskforce on Active Citizenship.  The Active Citizenship Office has been established under the direction of Government Chief Whip, Mr. Pat Carey, T.D, who has special responsibility for the active citizenship initiative.  The Department has assigned 4 staff to the Office.</P>
        <P>A substantial number of the recommendations of the Taskforce relate to a number of Departments and funding for activities supporting the recommendations will be carried in the Votes of these Departments.  The role of the Office is essentially a steering and co-ordinating role between public sector, community and voluntary sector, business, educational interests and it does not have a role as a grant giving body.</P>

	<P>I am confident that all agencies and bodies under my Department&rsquo;s responsibility comply fully with the Department of Finance guidelines for goods and services.</P>
        <P>The Internal Audit report on the National Forum on Europe, dated December 2006, concluded that the appropriate Department of Finance procurement procedures are being employed for the tendering of services.  The Forum Secretariat is currently undertaking a review of all contracts with suppliers to ensure that compliance with the guidelines is on-going.</P>
        <P>The CSO operates under its own internal procurement policy. This internal procurement policy was developed to reflect all obligations which CSO purchasers of goods and services must comply with, in accordance with all national and EU guidelines.</P>
        <P>The CSO does not have a full-time procurement unit. However, the CSO Procurement Officer, and Corporate Support staff, conduct regular information sessions to ensure that CSO <Col N="175"/>staff are aware of the relevant rules and regulations, and &lsquo;Value for money&rsquo; requirements, with regard to the spending of public monies.  The internal Corporate Support Unit also maintains an updated Procurement Information Homepage to reflect any changes in the limits or obligations.</P>
        <P>In addition, an internal audit was carried out on the National Economic and Social Development Office (NESDO) earlier this year. The report concluded, inter alia, that &ldquo;all appropriate procedures for financial reporting and procurement have been followed with two exceptions&rdquo;. The two exceptions related to relatively minor breaches of public procurement procedures relating to the form of procurement adopted and these were remedied.</P>

	<P>The Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, which was established in October 2007, provides a valuable forum to members of both Houses of the Oireachtas to discuss the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and related matters with Members of the Westminster Parliament elected for constituencies in Northern Ireland. In its relatively short time in existence, it has already done very valuable work.</P>
        <P>The establishment of a North/South Joint Parliamentary Forum to bring together representatives of the Oireachtas and of the Northern Ireland Assembly which was proposed in the Good Friday Agreement is the next priority for the Government in this area.</P>
        <P>It would make a major contribution to dialogue and mutual understanding between North and South.  This was discussed at the Sixth Plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council last February and progress will be reported at its next meeting scheduled for 3 October next.</P>
        <P>The Government also supports ongoing engagement with the unionist parties in Northern Ireland with a view to their future participation in the East/West parliamentary forum.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 181 and 182 together.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the views of the Council of Irish Genealogical Organisations regarding access to the 1926 Census returns.</P>
        <P>The position is that the confidentiality of all statistical returns from individuals, households and business is guaranteed by law, and this guarantee is the cornerstone of all CSO surveys, not least Censuses of Population.</P>
        <P>The Censuses of Population between 1926 and 1991 were carried out under the 1926 Statistics Act which did not permit any access to Census records, at any time.  However, the 1993 Statistics Act repealed the 1926 and 1946 Statistics Acts and provided for the release of census forms for these Censuses 100 years after the date of the relevant Census.</P>
        <P>When this provision was debated in the Seanad at the time, the view was expressed that the proposed 100 years period should be reduced to 75, or even 50 years.  However, while the retrospective introduction of the 100 years exemption was seen by some as undermining the original guarantee given to householders, it was generally accepted that 100 years was a reasonable compromise in all the circumstances, including having regard to life expectancy considerations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am satisfied, therefore, that the 100 years period provided for in the 1993 Act strikes the right balance in facilitating legitimate historical and sociological research on the one hand, while protecting the confidentiality of Census data and the integrity of CSO procedures on the other.</P>

        <Quest> if the Central Statistics Office has determined the way the proposed transfer of funds from pension funds of certain non-commercial <Col N="180"/>State sponsored bodies to the Exchequer would be treated in the Government accounts in that the move adds both liabilities and assets to the Exchequers position; and if the EU have been asked to comment on the impact on the general Government deficit. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The CSO has not to date been formally  asked to determine the treatment in the Government Accounts of the transfer of the assets of funded pension schemes of  Non-Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies (NCSSBs) to the State in return for the Government assuming responsibility for future  pension payments to beneficiaries on a pay-as-you-go basis. </P>
        <P>The  Government Accounts and General Government Balance (GGB) are calculated according to the accounting rules of the  European System of Accounts (ESA95), as supplemented by the Eurostat Manual on Government Deficit and Debt (MGDD).  The rules in this system for recording pension fund transfers are complex, but in general the transfer of the pension fund&rsquo;s assets to the  State may be recorded as a receipt in the Government Accounts if:  a) the transferring agency is classified outside of the General Government sector (i.e. if it is not controlled by Government or if it  covers more than 50% of its costs from its own resources &mdash; according to these criteria, most NCSSBs are classified within General  Government but some non-profit institutions, including universities, are classified outside), OR b) the transferring agency is classified within the General Government sector, but the pension scheme is established as a trust,  legally separate from the agency.</P>
        <P>The accounting rules do not recognise an up-front liability for the obligations accrued in the case of pay-as-you-go pension schemes, so no counterpart is recorded to this revenue and the initial up-front GGB impact is positive.</P>
        <P>This initial revenue would be offset in the future by the payment of the pension benefits, which would be recorded as Government  expenditure at the time of payment.  In the longer term the impact on the GGB would therefore be expected to be neutral, provided the scheme is fully funded.</P>
        <P>Given the complexity, the CSO would have to determine the treatment of any pension fund transfers on a case by case basis.  Generally, Eurostat would only be consulted if a particular scheme was very complex and the accounting treatment was not fully clear.  The Government Accounts and the calculation of the GGB are, of course, subject to Eurostat approval so any accounting treatments adopted could subsequently be subjected to Eurostat examination.</P>

	<P>Since the enactment of the Official Languages Act in 2003, my Department and agencies have spent &euro;2,969.64 on advertisements in Irish alone and &euro;385,681.25 on advertisements in both Irish and English.  Assuming that something less than half of the latter cost relates to the content in Irish, the total amount requested by the Deputy is less than &euro;195,810.27.</P>
        <P>These costs relate in the main to public notices for events such as the National Day of Commemoration and the 1916 Commemoration, and to public consultation processes such as the recent OECD Review.  It has long been the practice of my Department to publish such notices in both of the official languages.  This practice pre-dates the enactment of the Official <Col N="181"/>Languages Act and demonstrates my Department&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to providing a high standard of service in both languages to our customers.</P>

	<P>Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to <Col N="186"/>engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis. CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.</P>
        <P>I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, that depending on their circumstances, people who are participating on Community Employment Schemes may be entitled to the following additional payments (known as secondary benefits) which are provided by a number of different agencies:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the national and  smokeless fuel schemes, rent and mortgage supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, back to school clothing and footwear allowance from the Department of Social and Family Affairs);</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the medical card (from the Health Services Executive); and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the local authority differential rent scheme (from the local authorities).</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In conclusion then, I would say that this Government will continue to support the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.  In this regard, we are keeping the operation of the Scheme under constant review.</P>

	<P>My Department only requires the use of one motor vehicle for Departmental purposes. In July 2005 the Department purchased a Renault Kangoo van for &euro;13,450. That vehicle was replaced in July 2008 by another Renault Kangoo van which cost &euro;8,800 net on the trade in of the other van. The technical specifications of the Renault Kangoo van model states that on average the vehicle emits 141 grams of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> per kilometre. The two vehicles purchased by my Department in the past three years have together clocked up approximately 36,416 kilometres, which would give a CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emission figure of 5.13475 metric tonnes for both of the vehicles.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>The role of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) is to provide support for micro-enterprise in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential, and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local <Col N="187"/>level. The Boards can support individuals, firms and community groups provided that the proposed projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability. </P>
        <P>The Boards can offer both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter. The forms of financial intervention, which are available subject to certain restrictions, include Capital Grants, Employment Grants, and Feasibility Study Grants. Boards are required to ensure that a proportion of their grants are issued in a refundable form. Boards may also take preference shares in companies. The criteria under which financial intervention is available is based primarily on factors such as the sector of the economy in which an enterprise is operating or intends to operate and the size, or proposed size, of the enterprise. The enterprise must be in the commercial sphere, must demonstrate a market for the proposed product/service, must have a capacity for growth and new job creation and must not employ more than 10 people. Boards give priority to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector and they must always give consideration to any potential for deadweight and displacement arising from a proposed enterprise. All Boards operate the above criteria in respect of the financial assistance which they can provide to eligible projects and they are also subject to the same upper limitation levels in relation to the amount of finance which they can provide i.e.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Capital Grants up to a maximum of 50% of the cost of capital and other investment or &euro;75,000, whichever is the lesser; a portion of the grant in excess of 40% (in the BMW Region) or 35% (in the S&amp;E Region) to be in refundable form;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Employment grants in exceptional circumstances, a grant of up &euro;7,500 per new job, to a maximum of 10 new jobs.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Feasibility study grants up to a maximum of 60% (in the BMW Region) or 50% (in the S&amp;E Region) of the cost of a feasibility study and business plan, subject to an overall limit of &euro;6,350 (in the BMW Region) or &euro;5,100 (in the S&amp;E Region).</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">However, while the Boards work off an identical suite of financial interventions, there are certain differences between Boards as to how they apply these interventions e.g. the individual level of a grant or the refundability level applying to a grant payment may vary. I am of the view that it is appropriate and feasible to allow individual Boards a level of discretion and flexibility in the way in which they provide financial assistance to enable them to take account of the economic conditions and sectoral demands particular to their area of responsibility and the overall budget available to them in any given year.</P>

	<P>Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons (including those with a disability) with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.</P>
        <P>Participation on Community Employment has an upper age limit of 65 years of age, i.e. a CE participant/Supervisor can remain on CE until the day before their 66th birthday, provided they meet all other eligibility requirements. F&Aacute;S cannot make funding available to a Sponsor for any participant or Supervisor aged 66 years or over.  To do so would mean that the state would effectively be double-funding both the CE place and the participant&rsquo;s state pension simultaneously.</P>
        <P>The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  F&Aacute;S makes every effort to ensure that differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.  F&Aacute;S also operates the programme flexibly as far as possible to ensure the continuation of community projects.</P>
        <P>In conclusion then, I would say that this Government will continue to support the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.

	<P>My Department is very conscious of its obligations under the Data Protection Acts, and adopts a proactive approach to ensuring that personal data stored by it is kept secure.  Physical safeguards, a secure ICT infrastructure and staff awareness programmes play a key role in supporting data protection in my Department. Regarding ICT this is a continuous process, involving a combination of appropriately skilled people and the implementation of best-practice processes and technologies.  Last year, my Department conducted a comprehensive review of ICT security across the Department and its Offices.  The findings of the report now form a significant part of my Department&rsquo;s new ICT Strategy (2008-2010) and a programme of work is currently being undertaken which is designed to deliver ongoing improvements in the security of the Department&rsquo;s ICT systems, thereby minimising the risk of compromising data and/or security breaches.

        <P>Enterprise Ireland has supported indigenous industry in Arklow and has given substantial financial support ( &euro;782,000) to the Arklow Enterprise Centre.</P>
        <P>A significant number of Enterprise Ireland supported companies in Co. Wicklow are actively growing their businesses and creating employment.  In 2006 and 2007 EI approved financial <Col N="192"/>funding of &euro;4.8m and &euro;3.9m respectively to Wicklow-based firms that are committed to increasing their sales exports and employment.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by the State Development agencies and other interested parties together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development will continue to bear fruit in terms of investment and employment for Co. Wicklow in general and Arklow in particular.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons (including those with a disability) with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.  CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.</P>
        <P>In July 2006 my Department published its Sectoral Plan under the Disability Act, 2005.   One of the key highlights of this Plan was the increased participation rates of people with disabilities on CE over the period of the Plan and the raised CE participation limits for people with disabilities in order to provide additional training to assist progression to employment:</P><Col N="194"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />For people with disabilities under 55 years of age, the participation limit was raised by one year from 3 to 4 years; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />For people with disabilities over 55 years of age, the participation limit was also raised by one year from 6 to 7 years.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  F&Aacute;S makes every effort to ensure that differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.  F&Aacute;S also operates the programme flexibly as far as possible to ensure the continuation of community projects.</P>
        <P>In conclusion then, I would say that this Government will continue to support the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.  In this regard, we are keeping the operation of the Scheme under constant review.</P>

	<P>As part of Government policy on mainstreaming all F&Aacute;S Services are open to people with disabilities.  In this regard the services and programmes in place may be summarised as follows:</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Main Services provided by F&Aacute;S:</i></P>
        <P el="0">F&Aacute;S operates training and employment programmes; provides a recruitment service to jobseekers and employers; an advisory service for industry; and supports community based enterprises.  Services for people with disabilities are mainstreamed within this context.  Programmes for people with disabilities are &lsquo;demand&ndash;led&rsquo; in that take up of same is voluntary, and there is no element of penalty involved for those who do not wish to engage, for whatever reason.</P>
        <P>People with disabilities may call into a F&Aacute;S Employment Services Office or Local Employment Service Office to meet with an Employment Services Officer or Mediator who will provide them with full information, advice and guidance in relation to training and employment.  People with disabilities, who meet the entry criteria, are able to participate in the full range of F&Aacute;S programmes and services, including mainline training provision.  For example, there are currently 5,942 participants, or 28 % of total participants, with disabilities on Community Employment.   F&Aacute;S also provides a range of positive action measures to assist the entry into employment of people with disabilities.  These include:</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Specialist Training Providers</i></P>
        <P el="0">F&Aacute;S contracts with 20 specialist training providers, such as the National Learning Network, in 55 centres to deliver vocational training to people with disabilities who require more intensive support than would be available in the mainline options.  This training is provided exclusively to people with disabilities within a segregated setting.  A budget of &euro;54.95m is being provided to specialist training provision in 2008.</P><Col N="195"/>
         <P el="10"><i>Supported Employment Programme</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Supported Employment Programme is an open labour market initiative providing people with disabilities, who are &lsquo;job-ready&rsquo;, with supports to help them access the open labour market.  It is implemented by sponsor organisations, on behalf of F&Aacute;S, which employ Job Coaches to provide a range of supports tailored to the individual needs of a jobseeker.  A review of the programme has recently been carried out and a F&Aacute;S Action Plan on foot of reforms recommended in the review is nearing completion.  A budget of &euro;8.8m is being provided to the programme in 2008.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Wage Subsidy Scheme</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Wage Subsidy Scheme provides financial incentives to employers, outside the public sector, to employ people with disabilities who work more than 20 hours per week.  The scheme provides payment of a wage subsidy to the employer to compensate for the reduced productivity of the disabled worker.  The scheme is designed to provide incentive to employers to look more closely at the potential of people with disabilities to meet their labour force requirements.  A review of this scheme has also been carried out and a response to the review recommendations is currently under consideration.  For 2008, a budget of &euro;10.5m is being provided to the scheme.</P>
       <P el="10"><i>Employee Retention Grant Scheme</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Employee Retention Grant Scheme is available to private sector employers when an employee acquires a disability whether occupational or not.  It provides funding to identify accommodation or training to enable the employee to remain in their current position, or to re-train them to take up another position within the organisation.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Workplace Equipment Adaptation Grant</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Workplace Equipment Adaptation Grant is available to employers in the private sector who need to adapt equipment or the workplace to accommodate people with disabilities.  The maximum grant provided is &euro;6,350 and covers minor building modifications such as ramps or accessible toilets; assistive technology; amplifiers for telephones, etc.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Job Interview/Induction Interpreter Grant</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Job Interview/Induction Interpreter Grant is available to cover the costs of an interpreter up to a maximum of &euro;106.68 for a three-hour period for interview and induction purposes, where an interviewee or new staff member is deaf, hard of hearing, or has a speech impediment.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Personal Reader Grant</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Personal Reader Grant is available for the blind or visually impaired who require assistance with job-related reading, this is a grant to permit the employment of a personal reader.  F&Aacute;S will pay a fee per hour for this service, in line with the national minimum wage for a maximum of 640 hours per annum.</P>
         <P el="10"><i>Disability Awareness Training Support Scheme</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Disability Awareness Training Support Scheme assists the integration of people with disabilities into the workplace and helps to eliminate mistaken perceptions about them.  It is available to all companies in the private sector who are interested in employing, retaining or <Col N="196"/>relating to people with disabilities.  Funding of up to 90% of training costs is available in the first year, and up to 80% of costs in subsequent years, with an annual limit of &euro;20,000 payable to an organisation.  To avail of this funding training must be carried out by a F&Aacute;S approved training organisation or trainer.</P>
        <P>The combined budget in 2008 for the Employee Retention Grant Scheme, Workplace Equipment Adaptation Grant, Job Interview Interpreter Grant, Personal Reader Grant and Disability Awareness Training Support Scheme amounts to &euro;2.1 million. This gives a total budget of &euro; 76.350 million for disability-specific programmes.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S schemes and programmes are monitored and kept under regular review as part of overall employment and training policy for people with disabilities under the Sectoral Plan of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>The Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977 to 2007 protect employees from being unfairly dismissed from their jobs by laying down criteria by which dismissals are to be judged unfair and by providing an adjudication system and redress for an employee whose dismissal has been found to be unfair.</P>
        <P>To qualify under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, an employee is normally expected to have at least one year&rsquo;s continuous service with the employer.  A claim for redress under the Acts may be submitted initially to either of the adjudicative bodies specified in the Acts i.e. a Rights Commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal within 6 months of the date of dismissal (this can be extended to 12 months in exceptional circumstances).  Either party may appeal a <Col N="199"/>determination of the Employment Appeals Tribunal to the Circuit Court.  Redress may take the form of either financial compensation, re-instatement or re-engagement, whichever the relevant adjudicative body considers appropriate having regard to all the circumstances.</P>
        <P>Alternatively, it is always open to individuals to seek professional legal advice on the remedies available under the common law in relation to dismissal.  However, an individual is not entitled to recover both damages at common law for &ldquo;wrongful dismissal&rdquo; and redress under the Unfair Dismissals Acts for &ldquo;unfair dismissal&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>If the reason for dismissal was related to any of the nine grounds of discrimination under the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2008, the employee may wish to consider making a complaint of discrimination under those Acts to the Equality Tribunal. The Employment Equality Acts are administered by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform through the Equality Authority. However it is important to note that redress is not available under more than one of the above-mentioned pieces of legislation.</P>
        <P>An explanatory booklet on the Unfair Dismissals Acts is available on the National Employment Rights Authority&rsquo;s website at www.employmentrights.ie or by contacting the Employment Rights Information Unit of the Authority at  (059) 9178990 or on Lo-call 1890 80 80 90.</P>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest> if a participant in a community employment scheme, on reaching the age of 64, can have their period of employment extended until they reach old age pension age. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons (including those with a disability) with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.  CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.</P>
        <P>Participation on Community Employment has an upper age limit of 65 years of age, i.e. a CE participant/Supervisor can remain on CE until the day before their 66th birthday, provided they meet all other eligibility requirements. F&Aacute;S cannot make funding available to a Sponsor for any participant or Supervisor aged 66 years or over.</P>
        <P>The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  F&Aacute;S makes every effort to ensure that differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.  F&Aacute;S also operates the programme flexibly as far as possible to ensure the continuation of community projects.</P>
        <P>In conclusion then, I would say that this Government will continue to support the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.  In this regard, we are keeping the operation of the Scheme under constant review.</P>

	<P>Given the significant reduction in construction related activity and the subsequent increase in the numbers of construction workers who have been made redundant, I am very conscious of the need to try and accommodate apprentices in the completion of their apprenticeships.</P>
        <P>To achieve this, both my Department and F&Aacute;S have been actively examining this issue and have put in place a series of actions to facilitate redundant apprentices in completing their studies. These include the following:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Through their Employment Services Division, F&Aacute;S are focusing on assisting redundant apprentices to source employment, in order that they can complete their apprenticeship by receiving the appropriate on-the-job training and undertaking the associated competence-based assessments.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />As an interim measure, F&Aacute;S now allows apprentices who are made redundant to progress to their next off-the-job training phase of their apprenticeship, without having to do the next on-the-job phase first.</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&Aacute;S have put into place a register of Redundant Apprentices by Trade in order to identify these people at the earliest possible point in time and F&Aacute;S have prioritised the need to locate an employer to sponsor the completion of the Apprentices &ldquo;off-the-job&rdquo; training.</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&Aacute;S will not allow employers who make an apprentice redundant to subsequently recruit another apprentice in the same trade before the apprenticeship period of the redundant apprentice has expired.</P>
   <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&Aacute;S has met with the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) to discuss the impact of the slowdown in the Construction Industry on the Apprenticeship Programme.  The CIF agreed to consult with members and to report back to F&Aacute;S with their views and proposals.</P><Col N="202"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&Aacute;S have opened discussions with relevant bodies and authorities regarding the accreditation of on-the-job work experience and competency based assessments where the apprentice has obtained employment abroad.</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&Aacute;S will explore the feasibility of creating new apprenticeships in those highly skilled occupations, which have become extensively required in the Construction Industry (e.g. glazing, insulation).</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">My Department and F&Aacute;S will continue to monitor the trends and activities in the industry and will work with all of the relevant stakeholders to ensure timely and satisfactory responses to assist redundant apprentices to complete their apprenticeships.</P>

	<P>Donegal is a target location for the IDA with the County now competing for a different type of business to labour intensive manufacturing, which had been the key target over the past four decades.  Overseas investors are now seeking locations for more advanced manufacturing or office based solutions, to a great extent depending on high skill and high value work.  While this has required a significant change of strategy by the IDA, progress has been made in securing new high value investments from Pacificare, Pramerica, SITA and Abbott Diabetes, with some 1,200 new jobs being added in the County by overseas firms over the last five years.  These companies continue to recruit and are actively seeking new staff.  </P><Col N="203"/>
        <P>As regards Enterprise Ireland, which serves the indigenous sector, it provides a wide range of supports for high potential start up companies including financial supports, business and marketing advice, mentoring, product development etc.   As part of its infrastructural support for start-up companies, Enterprise Ireland has approved some &euro;3.5m in recent years for developments at Letterkenny Institute of Technology, which is an important aspect of supporting and attracting business to the region.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s results for jobs created in client companies in County Donegal for 2007 show a net gain for the third year in a row with a net increase of over 440 jobs.  A growth of 15% over the last three years reflects the investment Donegal companies are making in competing successfully both at home and abroad.  During the 3 year period to December 2007, Enterprise Ireland approved over &euro;14m to companies in County Donegal to support the development of new sales, exports and jobs.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland has also been very active in supporting the development of community enterprise centres in the North West Region, which are critical to continued enterprise development in rural areas and to the development of an entrepreneurial culture.  Nine Community Enterprise Centres in County Donegal have received funding of approx. &euro;2m under the Community Enterprise Centre Scheme to date.</P>
        <P>The role of the Donegal County Enterprise Board, is to provide support to micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level. Through the provision of both financial and non-financial support, the Board supports individuals, firms and community groups, provided that the proposed projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability.  Financial support is available in the form of Capital Grants, Employment Grants and Feasibility Study grants.  In relation to non-financial support, Donegal CEB engages in a range of activities to stimulate enterprise and to support small businesses.</P>
        <P>Despite past difficulties in County Donegal, due to the demise of traditional industries such as agriculture, fishing and textiles, there is clear evidence that the county is successfully engaged in a transition to the new economy.  Most recently, with the support of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, Forward Emphasis International is set to expand its workforce by 100 at a new facility in the Gaoth Dobhair Business Park with Euro Iomp&uacute; Teo also set to expand its workforce by 100 in Gaoth Dobhair.  A major investment by Randox Laboratories, in Dungloe, will lead to the creation of a further 135 jobs.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that funding support and initiatives for enterprises in County Donegal is, and will remain, a priority for the State development agencies under the auspices of my Department.</P>

	<P>It is current Government policy to issue new employment permits for highly skilled, highly paid positions or to non-EEA nationals already legally resident in the State on existing valid employment permits.  There are some exception categories under this policy, including ethnic restaurants, where a limited number of applications for fully trained head chefs are being considered.  However, it is considered in this instance that a suitable employee from the <Col N="204"/>enlarged EU can fill the position this employer seeks to fill.  Having examined the appeal, the Appeals Officer has upheld the original decision in this case.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 232, 233 and 237 together.</P><Col N="205"/>
        <P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions. The marketing of individual areas for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency. While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Industrial Development Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Agency that to date in 2008, there have been no site visits by potential investors to either Mallow, Michelstown or Fermoy.  While IDA Ireland can and does encourage clients to visit particular locations, the final decision on where to visit or locate is taken in all cases by the clients.</P>
        <P>In line with the National Spatial Strategy, IDA Ireland is focused on delivering investments to all of the Gateway and Hub locations.  Mallow is a hub town.  Through its network of overseas offices, the Agency is marketing the North Cork region which includes the towns of Mallow, Kanturk, Charleville, Newmarket, Millstreet, Fermoy and Mitchelstown to prospective investors across the full range of IDA targeted sectors, such as Pharmaceuticals, Medical Technologies, Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) and Internationally Traded Services.</P>
        <P>In June 2007 Sanmina-SCI, a leading electronics contract manufacturer, announced it is to undertake a &euro;30 million investment for the transformation of its Fermoy facility into a manufacturing and design Centre-of-Excellence for the medical industry.  Up to 50 highly skilled engineering and other professional positions will be created as a result.  It will also consolidate the existing employment in Fermoy, further enhance the facility&rsquo;s position within the parent company and will make it a flagship operation within Sanmina-SCI.</P>
        <P>In addition to attracting new foreign direct investment, IDA continues to work closely with its existing clients in North Cork to encourage them to expand their operations.</P>

        <P>I understand that the Board of IDA approved the sale of all these lands to Kildare County Council at its Board meeting on April 9th 2003.  However, this transaction was never finalised due to a failure in negotiations.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 244, 246 and 247 together. </P>
        <P>In the period 2003-2007, annual growth in total Irish exports has averaged 6.7%.  In relation to Merchandise exports, the growth has averaged 2%, while Services exports grew at an average of 15.3% during this period.  Services exports have risen steadily from 31% of total exports in 2003 to 43% in 2007.  Of total exports of &euro;154.4bn in 2007, our trade surplus was an extremely healthy &euro;23.3 bn, the biggest surplus in any of those 5 years. This very positive trend was achieved despite poor economic growth in many of our trading partners and also against the backdrop of adverse exchange rate trends in our two biggest export markets, the United States and the United Kingdom, due to the rise of the Euro against both the US Dollar and Sterling.</P>
        <P>In relation to manufacturing, this sector is in transition but is well positioned to meet future challenges.  Ireland&rsquo;s manufacturing future depends on a manufacturing sector that is capital intensive, knowledge intensive and skills intensive, focused on developing innovative products, services and solutions and meeting the needs of markets and customers. The report of the High Level Group on Manufacturing, which was launched by Minister Miche&aacute;l Martin, in April last, identifies the focused actions needed by employers, employees and Government to respond to challenges and take advantage of opportunities to further develop the sector in Ireland.</P>
        <P>That report contains 26 recommendations, directed at the key areas of:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Innovation and productivity, leading to transformational change.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Reskilling and management development for the innovative firm.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Increasing awareness and take-up of existing supports.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The restoration of cost competitiveness, which is of critical importance.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The establishment of a Manufacturing Forum to progress the implementation of the recommendations outlined in the report and to act as a strong advocate and champion for the manufacturing sector.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Government is committed to ensuring that the recommendations of this Group receive a high level of priority to ensure that the manufacturing sector continues to evolve and to provide high value added and high quality employment for the future. The report is currently being considered by the Social Partnership Forum, as part of the ongoing review of &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>In relation to Services, almost two thirds of the Irish workforce is currently employed in services and Ireland is now the 10th highest exporter of services in the world. The future performance in services activities will therefore be increasingly important to overall growth in the economy.</P>
        <P>The Services Strategy Group, which was set up last year by Forfas and my Department, published its report &mdash; &ldquo;Catching the Wave: A Services Strategy for Ireland&rdquo;, earlier this <Col N="209"/>month. The report sets out new policy proposals on how the State can ensure the continued development and growth of Ireland&rsquo;s services sector. It deals with the following issues:</P>
<?oasys _cl13.5- ?>

	<P>While the Services Sector is clearly an important and growing source of employment and exports, the Manufacturing Sector is and will continue to be an integral component of the Irish economy. The sector continues to be a significant employer &mdash; the latest available data on manufacturing employment compiled by the Central Statistics Office (Earnings and Labour Costs Release) published in May 2008 indicates that at Quarter 4 2007, there were over 225,000 persons directly employed in manufacturing which equates to 11% of total employment. In addition the sector sustains an additional 165,000 through secondary employment in associated services. In 2006 the sector was accountable for approx 23% of total economic output. Our manufacturing sector continues to perform strongly and 2007 represented a very good year with production growing by 7.5 per cent, the highest annual change since 2002. </P>
        <P>Not only does manufacturing contribute directly to employment, economic output and exports but it is also a key driver of innovation and technological advance. It increases opportunities for attracting and embedding research and development activities, collaboration with the higher education sector and stimulating networks.  Ireland&rsquo;s management capability, high quality outputs, productivity growth and project management skills have evolved as a result of our success in attracting high quality foreign direct investment in manufacturing and in stimulating the growth of indigenous firms with a focus on exports.</P>
        <P>The manufacturing sector in Ireland has evolved noticeably since 2000, in terms of the composition of industry and the nature of activities, and is likely to continue to do so.  The model of manufacturing in developed economies has changed and Irish enterprises are adapting to those changes and engaging in higher value added activities in order to compete in the global marketplace. In order to sustain and grow the sector, the Irish based manufacturing enterprises will have to continue the progression to high value added sectors and activities, and continue to increase productivity through investments in human capital, technology and innovation. Innovation and the productivity gains that flow from it are the new foundations for competitiveness. Irish manufacturers who engage in specialised, sophisticated, high technology and value added activities can continue to compete successfully on international markets.</P>
        <P>The recently launched Report of the High-Level Manufacturing Group contains some 26 recommendations directed at key areas of innovation and productivity leading to transformational change, reskilling and management development for the innovative firm, increasing awareness and take up of existing supports. In addition the group recommends the establishment of a Manufacturing Forum to take responsibility to progress the implementation of the <Col N="210"/>recommendations outlined in the report and to act as a strong advocate and champion for the manufacturing sector to ensure that manufacturing remains central to current and future industrial policy.</P>
        <P>The Social Partners agreed, as part of the recently concluded review of Towards 2016. that a manufacturing Forum should be established in line with the recommendation of the High Level Group. This matter will be progressed by my department in consultation with the Department of An Taoiseach and the Social Partners.</P>

        <P FLI="0">It should be noted that the training provided by F&Aacute;S is split between their Training Services Division, which focuses on the provision of training to help people secure employment and their Services to Business Division, which focuses on the provision of training to people in employment.

	<P>Employment and unemployment are measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey and published by the Central Statistics Office.  While an increase in unemployment (22,600) is recorded throughout the country in the last two years, this is more than exceeded by the increase in employment (87,500) in all regions in the same period bar a slight decrease in the Mid-West region.   </P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S and the Department of Social and Family Affairs are working together so they can respond quickly to the increase in unemployment, for example:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&Aacute;S and the Department of Social and Family Affairs have agreed that redundant workers will be referred immediately to F&Aacute;S rather than wait for three months on the Live Register as was the case before.  F&Aacute;S has also established a training fund to enable a speedy response to identified re-training needs for low skilled and redundant craft workers.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&Aacute;S is, with the Local Employment Services provided by Area-Based Partnerships, currently gearing up its Employment Services further to provide increased capacity for expected increased referrals from the Live Register.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&Aacute;S will be providing a range of certified, short, flexible, modular programmes designed to upskill redundant workers so that they can enhance their prospect of securing employment.  A number of programmes are already in place and the frequency and range of these will be expanded over the coming months.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A range of actions are being implemented by F&Aacute;S for those affected by the construction slowdown, including &ndash;</P>

        <P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />compliance and regulatory work</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&Aacute;S will also assist individuals in anyway they can in seeking employment aboard in construction in other EU countries. F&Aacute;S have held European construction jobs fairs for employers from other EU countries.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Strong, balanced regional development and a thriving culture of entrepreneurship in all parts of Ireland are key strategic objectives for the Department and the development agencies under its remit.  The Agencies are working to ensure that the economy and jobs continue to grow even in the current more challenging environment and have had some notable successes already to report this year.  The pipeline of new business for which IDA Ireland is competing is as strong as at any time in recent years.</P>
        <P>In respect of IDA Ireland, winning FDI requires focused co-operation and collaboration between all key stakeholders including Institutes of Technology, Universities, Research <Col N="213"/>Institutes, Local Authorities, Government Departments, Employers/Industry Organisations, Chambers of Commerce, Utility Providers (e.g. Eirgrid / Bord G&aacute;is etc.), Infrastructure Providers (e.g. NRA), Service Providers, Construction Industry, and Sister Agencies such as SFI, Enterprise Ireland, Forf&aacute;s and F&Aacute;S.  IDA has a close working relationship with its sister agencies.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland, as part of a renewed focus on securing FDI, has targeted new sources of FDI in Mumbai, Shanghai, Boston, and Sth California.  It has also increased its resources in our London and Atlanta offices.</P>
        <P>In addition, IDA Ireland has an active programme of client engagement to support the existing clients and secure additional investments.  In this respect it pays particular attention to clients in vulnerable sectors in regional locations and works with them to continue to secure their investment in Ireland.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 255, 257 and 361 together.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works is advancing a programme of Flood Risk Management measures in co-operation with other relevant Departments and the Local Authorities.</P>
        <P>OPW has a programme of works at various stages of design and execution to deal with localised flood risk from rivers.  These are being undertaken in partnership with the responsible Local Authorities.  OPW also maintains rivers and channels, which are part of Arterial Drainage Schemes constructed since 1945.  Local Authorities have responsibility for the maintenance of certain rivers, where drainage works were completed prior to 1945.</P>
        <P>OPW is also undertaking a number of measures in furtherance of the Government policy of preventing the creation of future risk where possible.  These include the preparation, in partnership with the Department of Environment, Heritage, and Local Government, of Guidance on the Management of Flood Risk in Planning and Development and the preparation of Catchment Flood Risk Management Plans, which will include predictive flood hazard and flood risk maps.  The Commissioners have published historic flood risk maps at www.floodmaps.ie as well as information for people who may be at risk of flooding, on how to plan and prepare to protect their property and mitigate loss at www.flooding.ie, and have assisted the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government in drafting best practice procedure guidelines for Local Authorities for the management of emergency response to flood events.</P>
        <P>The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, deals with coastal flood risk and is developing flood risk maps in respect of coastal areas.  It also deals with coastal erosion, which is sometimes associated with flooding.</P>
        <P>The recent flooding in August and September which occurred in several areas including some on the Northside of Dublin, was mainly due to the inability of the urban drainage systems in the various areas to convey the exceptional volumes of water resulting from the concentrated heavy downpours, where in some cases almost a month&rsquo;s rainfall fell in a period of 4-6 hours, rather than from rivers for which the Office of Public Works (OPW) has direct responsibility.  OPW officials are, however, examining the matter and any measures considered necessary will be discussed with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which together with Local Authorities has responsibility for urban drainage systems.</P><Col N="215"/>
        <P>OPW, together with Dublin City Council, is confident that the measures undertaken since the completion of the River Tolka Flooding Report in 2003 have brought the level of protection in the Distillery Road area up to the accepted standard of protection, i.e. protection against a flood with a 1% probability of occurring in any given year.  All of the recommendations contained in the Report for that area have now been implemented.</P>
        <P>Local residents from the Tolka Road area asked Dublin City Council in 2006 to have the wall replaced on the right bank downstream of Distillery Bridge to Luke Kelly Bridge.  The Council had the existing wall assessed as a result, and the assessment confirmed that the wall was in good condition.  In the circumstances, therefore, the replacement of the wall could not be undertaken as a flood relief measure by the OPW under the Flood Relief Programme.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Office of Public Works has prepared a flood relief scheme for Carlow which is broken into three stand alone phases.  As the works in Phase A (consisting of works on the east bank of the Barrow River, North of its confluence with the Burrin River, and also works along the North bank of the Burrin River) are in the same area of the town as elements of the proposed Main Drainage Scheme, it was agreed that the Phase A flood relief works be incorporated into the main drainage works, with funding provided by OPW.  The tender assessment process for these works is not yet completed, but the appointment of a contractor is imminent, and flooding which occurred recently in the Centaur Street / Kennedy Street / John Street area of Carlow will be addressed by these works.</P>
        <P>In relation to the recent flooding at Graiguecullen (which is on the left bank of the Barrow River and is scheduled for inclusion in Phase B of the proposed Flood Relief Scheme), Carlow County Council is currently in the process of identifying certain intermediary works which might be carried out in order to address flooding in this area.</P>

	<P>Section 105 Finance Act 2007 provides for a stamp duty exemption, subject to conditions, on the conveyance, transfer or lease of lands to an approved sports body.  An approved sports body is an &ldquo;approved body of persons&rdquo; within the meaning of section 235(1) Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.</P>
        <P>Section 54 of the Finance Act 2007 made changes to Schedule 15 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which lists bodies that are exempt from Capital Gains Tax.  Paragraph 37 provides that an approved body (within the meaning of section 235(1)) is exempt from Capital Gains Tax to the extent that the proceeds of the disposal giving rise to the gain or, if greater, the consideration for the disposal under the Act have been or will be applied to the sole purpose of promoting athletic or amateur games or sports.  As such, a sporting body can avail of both reliefs if it satisfies the conditions in relation to each provision.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 270, 271 and 280 together.</P>
        <P>The 2003 EU Energy Tax Directive contained special derogations that allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of Member States. In Ireland&rsquo;s case, these derogations allowed for reduced rates of excise duty for fuel used for public transport services, including school transport services. These derogations expired on 31 December 2006.  Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date, but the European Commission, who is the deciding authority, refused such requests.</P>
        <P>Consequently, the Finance Act 2008 made the legislative changes to withdraw the relief in respect of fuel used for public passenger transport vehicles. The relief will be withdrawn with effect from 1 November 2008 and the appropriate full excise rates will apply from that date.</P>
        <P>The Department of Transport and other relevant line Departments, in conjunction with my Department, have examined the implications of this.  They have explored alternative mechanisms that might be used to direct Exchequer resources toward such services from that date, subject of course to compatibility with competition and EU State Aid requirements.  Any such expenditure decision on this matter will be made in the context of the Estimates process now underway.</P>

        <Quest>   the circumstances in which VAT can be refunded to persons doing small home improvements or one-off building; if a more generous regime of VAT rebate applies in Northern Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.   </Quest>
        <QRef>[29761/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that the VAT regime generally and the rate of tax applying to the supply of goods and services are subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the rate at which Irish VAT is charged on the supply of buildings and on the service of carrying out home improvements is generally the reduced rate of 13.5%, while the VAT rate on the supply of materials used in buildings and in home improvements is normally the standard rate of 21%.  When VAT is charged to persons who are registered for VAT, those persons are entitled to reclaim that VAT subject to the normal rules.  However, when VAT is charged to persons acting in a private and personal capacity, those persons are not entitled to reclaim it.</P><Col N="222"/>
        <P>Accordingly, VAT cannot be refunded to private persons constructing one-off buildings or doing home improvements.  An exception is made, however, in the case of certain goods supplied to disabled persons.  The Value-Added (Refund of Tax) Order 1981, SI No. 428 of 1981, enables VAT on qualifying goods to be refunded where the goods are purchased for the exclusive use of disabled persons suffering a specified degree of disablement.  Building constructed or adapted exclusively for use by disabled persons may qualify for a VAT refund.  Refunds are dealt with on a case by case basis by the Revenue Commissioners depending on the circumstances of the goods and the disability of the person concerned.</P>
        <P>I would also point out that a scheme of disabled persons grants is operated by local authorities with capital provision from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  These grants are designed to meet the needs of persons who are either physically handicapped or are suffering from severe mental illness. Where a new dwelling is being bought or built a maximum grant of &euro;12,700 is payable. In the case of adaptation of an existing dwelling, 95% of the approved cost of the works is available up to an effective maximum grant of &euro;30,000.  Full details of the scheme and the conditions applicable are available from the local authority in whose area the dwelling is situated.</P>
        <P>In so far as a comparison with the position in Northern Ireland is concerned, the position is that in Northern Ireland and in the UK generally the rate at which VAT is charged on the supply of a building designed as a dwelling is the rate of 0%, while the VAT rate on the renovation or alteration of qualifying residential premises is generally the UK reduced VAT rate, which is 5%.  Furthermore, when certain building services are supplied to disabled persons VAT can be charged at the rate of 0%.</P>
        <P>Under the EU VAT Directive a Member State may retain a 0% rate and a reduced rate of VAT on supplies of goods and services where those rates applied on 1 January 1991.  However, Member States cannot now extend a 0% rate to supplies of other goods and services, and can only extend the reduced rate to supplies of goods and services where this is specifically allowed for in the VAT Directive.  Accordingly, I am not in a position to extend the 0% rate of VAT to the &lsquo;one-off building&rsquo; of homes or on small home improvements.</P>

        <QRef>[29767/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The existing legislation does not provide for any circumstances in which any taxpayer may qualify for tax relief or credits for expenditure incurred on childcare. However, I assume the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to the benefit-in-kind exemption where employers provide free or subsidised childcare for their employees. This exemption applies where an employer provides such childcare facilities &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; or in other premises made available by the employer. The exemption also applies if an employer provides childcare facilities jointly with other employers. The exemption also covers situations where an <Col N="223"/>employer makes a contribution to the capital costs of an independent supplier of childcare facilities. </P>
        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that as taxpayers are not required to provide details of the receipt of this benefit-in-kind in their tax returns, there is no basis on which an estimate of the cost to the Exchequer of this tax exemption, or of the numbers availing of it, can be provided.</P>
        <P>In the case of employers, the expense of providing or subsidising childcare facilities for employees is allowable as a deduction in arriving at profits for tax purposes. However, the employer&rsquo;s tax return of income does not contain an entry in respect of this item and the employer&rsquo;s profit and loss account does not normally distinguish between this particular expense and other employment-related expenses. In these circumstances, there is also no basis on which a reliable estimate of numbers involved can be provided.</P>
        <P>There is no upper ceiling on the tax exempt amount of the benefit-in-kind that employers can provide through the provision of childcare facilities.</P>
        <P>While a small enterprise might not be able to provide childcare facilities on its own, the legislation allows such an enterprise to join with other employers to provide co-located facilities, contributing proportionately to costs, and jointly providing the childcare service. In this way, smaller enterprises can collectively address the differences of scale in the provision of facilities. This reduces the potential for any inequity in the system as between small and large firms and their employees.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 278 and 308 together.</P>
        <P>I assume that the questions refer to the exemption from Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) in certain circumstances and the application of exit taxes under the &ldquo;gross roll up&rdquo; regime.</P>
        <P>Since the enactment of the Finance Act 2007, individuals are exempt from Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) on their savings income provided they or their spouse are aged 65 or over, or permanently incapacitated, and their total income in a year (including the savings <Col N="224"/>income) is below the annual exemption limit &mdash; currently &euro;20,000 in the case of a single person and &euro;40,000 in the case of a married couple. In any case where DIRT was deducted and the individual would otherwise qualify for the exemption, he or she is entitled to claim a refund of that tax directly from the Revenue Commissioners after the end of the tax year.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>In the case of investment products which are linked to life assurance policies or to collective investment funds in which an individual has invested, the &ldquo;gross roll up&rdquo; regime applies under which the investor&rsquo;s funds may accumulate tax free while invested in the policy or fund.  However, an exit tax at 23 per cent applies on the sale or redemption, or at the end of the 8 year period following the acquisition of the investment. This 23 per cent tax is the only tax paid on the income and gains accumulated in the policy or the fund over this period. There is no provision for exemption or refund of this tax other than to non-resident investors or to permanently incapacitated persons.</P>
        <P>The Deputies will be aware that it is customary for a Minister for Finance not to comment on possible tax changes in advance of the Budget which is due to be delivered on 14 October 2008.</P>

	<P>Four officials from the Department of Finance attended the 4th Annual Public Private Partnership Forum, held on Thursday the 19th June 2008. As they were all due to speak at the forum no charge was incurred by the Department in respect of their attendance.  One officer of the Revenue Commissioners attended the forum at a cost of &euro;592.90.</P>
        <P>In addition, two members of staff of the National Development Finance Agency attended the forum. One of these was a speaker at the conference and consequently did not pay an attendance fee. In respect of the second member of staff who attended the forum, a reduced fee of &euro;470.09 was paid as the NDFA had a speaker at the conference. There were no other costs incurred by the NDFA in relation to this forum.</P>

        <Quest>   if changes to penalties imposed on the personal representatives and estate of a deceased non-compliant taxpayer, which were incorporated into Irish Law in response to the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 and have been implemented here since 18 March 2008, will be backdated with the result that Revenue will not seek recovery of any penalty element for a deceased person&rsquo;s personal representatives and will discontinue proceedings for recovery of such penalties if they have been initiated since that date but penalties already agreed do not appear to be subject to refund or full recognition in view of the fact that imposing penalties on deceased taxpayer&rsquo; estates is contrary to Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights; and if he will make a statement on the matter.   </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the  Revenue Commissioners that they have reviewed their procedures in relation to the imposition of penalties in relation <Col N="225"/>to tax settlements for deceased persons.  Arising from this review, revised procedures apply with  effect from 18 March 2008 (the date of publication of the new procedures).  In accordance with these new arrangements, where the taxpayer dies before a settlement has been agreed with Revenue, Revenue will not seek recovery of any penalty element from the deceased&rsquo;s personal representatives (and will discontinue proceedings for recovery of such penalty if they have been initiated). </P>
        <P>I should point out that where a settlement that includes a penalty element has been agreed between Revenue and a deceased taxpayer prior to his/her death (or where a penalty has been awarded in proceedings finalised prior to the taxpayer&rsquo;s death), and that penalty remains unpaid or not fully paid as at the date of death, Revenue will continue to proceed against the personal representatives of the deceased for the recovery of that unpaid penalty. There is no change to existing Revenue practice in these particular circumstances.</P>
        <P>I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that settlements finalised before 18 March 2008 will not be reopened. These negotiated settlements, made in good faith by both parties, will generally have involved unreserved letters of offer and acceptance and are considered to be binding.</P>

	<P>Discussions are in train with the trustees/administrators of the funded pension schemes of the five older universities and certain non-commercial semi-State bodies (SSBs), which have funded pension schemes, with a view to providing consistency and clarity for the future in terms of meeting the liabilities of the schemes.  </P>
        <P>This follows consideration some time ago of the pension difficulties facing those universities by a working group under the Higher Education Authority, which recommended such discussions. The background to this is that all funded schemes must now meet minimum funding standards under EU law unless they are covered by the State. This has presented problems for the universities and non-commercial SSBs with funded pension schemes where the State ultimately carries the liability but where this is not clear enough to warrant exemption under EU law. In that context, and provided all the schemes concerned agree, it is proposed that the assets of those schemes would be transferred to the State along with the liabilities which would then be met, effectively, by the State on a pay as you go basis in the future. The terms and conditions of the schemes would be no better nor worse than the members would be entitled to anyway. If agreement is reached, legislation to give effect to all this would be required.</P>
        <P>I am informed that the estimated value of the assets of the funds in question at end-2007 was in the region of 2.3 billion euro, but this will have changed in the interim and is subject to market fluctuations.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 299 and 333 together. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Tonnage tax provides an alternative method for calculating the shipping related profits of a company for Corporation Tax purposes. The profits are calculated by reference to the tonnage of the ships used in a company&rsquo;s shipping trade and once calculated, using the tonnage tax method, are subject to the 12.5 per cent Corporation Tax rate.</P>
        <P>Companies availing of the tonnage tax regime are required to complete a supplementary form to the CT1 tax return form made annually to the Revenue Commissioners. They are obliged to provide details on the supplementary form of all ships qualifying for the tonnage tax regime.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners, that under the Revenue Customer Service Charter, information provided by its customers must be treated in strictest confidence. Unfortunately the information sought by the Deputy cannot, therefore, be provided by the Revenue Commissioners. However, I can confirm that at present 20 companies (and approximately 100 qualifying ships) are included in the Irish tonnage tax scheme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 300, 302, 360, 363 and 365 together.</P>
        <P>The Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999, as amended, provides for a Stamp Duty Exemption on the purchase of farm land by Young Trained Farmers.  To qualify for the relief, an individual must, on the date of execution of the instrument of transfer, be under 35 years of age and hold a relevant qualification.</P>
        <P>The relevant qualifications are set out in Schedules to the Act.  A degree in Agri-Environmental Science awarded by University College Dublin is not a specified qualification for the purposes of the relief.  However, the legislation provides that the Revenue Commissioners will treat another qualification as a relevant qualification where Teagasc certifies that:</P>
        <P el="5">a. <Miles com="ix" />the other qualification corresponds to a relevant qualification, and</P>
        <P el="5">b. <Miles com="ix" />the other qualification is deemed by the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland to be at least at a level equivalent to the specified relevant qualifications.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">Teagasc has examined the Agri-Environmental Sciences Degree and has taken the view that it does not have sufficient production agriculture and farm business management content in the core modules to meet the stamp duty relief and installation aid requirement as &ldquo;young trained farmers&rdquo;.  However, it is recognised that some students may have chosen production agriculture and farm business management as their options/electives in the degree programme. Teagasc and UCD have agreed on a list of options/electives, when achieved as components of, or additions to the Agri-Environmental Sciences Degree that will enable Teagasc to issue letters of equivalence for stamp duty relief and installation aid.</P>
        <P>I would suggest that any individual with concerns about this Degree contacts UCD to determine, firstly, if the options/electives he has completed meet the above requirements and, secondly, what additional option/electives he must undertake in order to meet the qualification requirements for stamp duty relief and installation aid. Otherwise the general position is that an Agri-Environmental Sciences degree holder is treated as holding a non-agricultural award and may be required to complete the new FETAC Level 6 Advanced Certificate in Agriculture course programme with Teagasc in order to meet the qualification requirements.</P>

        <P>Regarding the proposition that the scheme should be expanded to include the cost of parking facilities at train stations, the extension of the scheme in this manner would involve additional loss of tax revenue and it is not clear that it would contribute significantly to a reduction in traffic congestion.</P>

	<P>The question of undertaking a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) was considered during the preparation of the National Development Plan 2007-2013 (NDP).  The outcome of this consideration, which included taking legal advice, was that an SEA was not required because the new plan is:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />primarily a strategic document setting out levels of financial investment across a range of areas;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />is not unduly prescriptive regarding projects to be undertaken over its lifetime; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />does not set the framework for future development consent.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">On 27 June 2007, the European Commission sent a letter of formal notice seeking information on the NDP and its status as it was their opinion that the NDP appeared to be a Plan or Programme subject to the SEA Directive.  A reply was sent to the Commission in September 2007 setting out our position that the NDP is not subject to the SEA Directive.</P>
        <P>The Commission sent a revised letter of formal notice on the 3rd of April last.  This was examined in detail and a reply sent to the Commission in July 2008 confirming our considered opinion that the NDP was not subject to the SEA Directive.</P>
        <P>Environmental sustainability is built into the NDP as one of the strategic policy goals that will inform all of its investment priorities.  This goal will be underpinned by the integration of all required environmental considerations into the planning and execution of capital projects, including formal Environmental Impact Assessments where appropriate.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the relevant information available relates to receipts of Betting Duty, Bookmaking Premises Duty and Bookmakers Licences Duty.  Bets placed with bookmakers in the State are liable to Betting Duty at 1%. However, an exemption applies to the Betting Duty in relation to bets accepted by on-course bookmakers at horserace or greyhound race meetings but the exemption does not extend to bets accepted by on-course bookmakers by any means of telecommunications. Bets placed with the Tote are also exempt from betting duty.  </P>
        <P>Figures of the total duties collected from 2001 to 2007, and to date in 2008 where available, in relation to Bookmakers together with the excise duty on Gaming, Gaming Machines and Amusement Machine Licences are as follows:</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated turnover based on betting duty receipts from 2001 to 2007 and to the end of the second quarter of 2008 is detailed in the table below. It should be noted the rate of duty was 10% up to 1 July 1999 when it was reduced to 5%. The rate was reduced to 2% with effect from 1 May 2002 and to 1% from 1 July 2006. Quarterly payments were introduced in 2005. In calculating the annual turnover based on receipts, allowances were made for the change in collection dates in 2005 to quarterly and for the various rate changes over the years.</P>

	<P>The Minister meets his colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, continually in carrying out the normal business of Government. In examining policy and expenditure for the Arts, Sport and Tourism programme, the Horse and Greyhound Fund would have been raised, along with other issues, during these discussions.  Any such meetings in previous years would have arisen in the context of the Budget in the various years concerned.</P>

In this case the project was identified on the sign in question as the Suir River (Clonmel West) Drainage Scheme and identified the Office of Public Works, Clonmel Borough Council, South Tipperary County Council and Waterford County Council as the Public Bodies involved.  Mott MacDonald Pettit were identified as the Consulting Engineers on the project. The sign in question cost &euro;3,100 excluding VAT.</P>

        <P>The figure is an estimate from the Revenue tax forecasting model using actual data for the year 2005 adjusted as necessary for income and employment growth for the year in question. It is therefore provisional and likely to be revised. It should be noted that a married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The figures provided in this reply for VAT receipts for 2008 are estimates of the amount of VAT yield that would be generated by the volume of clearances of oil products up to the end of August. Mineral Oil Tax is paid in the month of clearance of the product but, depending on the nature of the registration status of a trader, VAT returns can be made monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, half yearly or annually and this will dictate the point in time when VAT on sales will actually be paid.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 328 and 329 together.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the information furnished on tax returns does not generally require the yield from a particular sector or sub-sector of economic activity to be identified. In these circumstances the amount of tax revenues collected in respect of the activities specified in the question cannot be readily identified from the overall yield from these taxes. Accordingly, the specific information requested by the Deputy is not readily available and could not be obtained without conducting a protracted examination of the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; records.</P>
        <P>However, the amount of Betting Duty paid for 2007 was  &euro;36.44 million,   &euro;177,900 was paid on Bookmakers Licences and  &euro;529,720 was paid on Bookmaking Premises Duty.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> the estimated yield from re-introducing a direct tax on betting of 10%. </Quest>
        <QRef>[30661/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the amount of Betting Duty paid for 2007 was &euro;36.44 million.  As the rate in that year was 1 per cent, one could at first glance assume that the yield from a 10 per cent rate would be around tens times that amount.</P>
        <P>However, such a figure would not be realised. Although the onus is currently on the industry to pay betting duty at the 1 per cent rate, it is extremely unlikely that the industry could afford to carry a ten per cent rate betting duty. The reduction in recent years from 2 per cent to 1 per cent was designed to eliminate the incentive for more and more customers to bet tax free on the internet and at the same time to eliminate tax driven competition that was damaging small local betting offices.</P>
        <P>If the rate were to be payable by the customer, one would have to factor in the effects of a significant rise in betting duty on customer behaviour. Given that it is not feasible to tax on-line betting services provided by operations outside the State, which are taxed in the state where the operation is based, it is likely that significant numbers of bettors would turn to on-line gambling to avoid the duty. In addition such a rate would be likely to encourage the re-emergence of illegal betting.</P>

	<P>Betting duty is payable by the bookmaker. Therefore, were a bookmaker to establish an on-line betting operation within the State, the bookmaker would be liable to pay betting duty at the normal 1% rate. </P>
        <P>While a tax could be set on on-course betting, the on-course levy currently stands at zero having been exempted under Section 68 of the Finance Act 2002. It was exempted in the context of the reduction in the off-course duty at that time and the importance of supporting attendances at race meetings.</P>

	<P>In relation to the VAT treatment of purchases by sporting organisations, the position is that bodies supplying educational services and non-profit organisations are exempt from VAT under the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply. This means they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase. Essentially only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT.  In this respect, sporting organisations purchasing buses are liable to pay VAT on such purchases.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to grant schemes available for sports clubs to purchase buses or mini-buses, I am informed by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism that under the sports capital programme, which is administered by that Department, funding  is  allocated  to  sporting  and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country towards the provision of sporting facilities. The programme is advertised on an annual basis.  It is open to sporting and community organisations, should they have a project which satisfies the terms and conditions of the programme, to apply when the next round of the programme is announced.</P>

	<P>As part of the work on the Green Paper on Pensions, a review was carried out into the current regime of tax incentives for supplementary pension provision. This was done with a view to developing more comprehensive and reliable estimates of the cost of reliefs in this area. Arising from the review, the following revised and up to date estimates of the cost of tax and other reliefs for private pension provision for 2006 have been made. Estimates on a consistent basis are not available for earlier years.</P>

        <Quest> the savings to the Exchequer of applying tax breaks for private pensions at the standard rate only for all taxpayers. </Quest>
        <QRef>[31057/08]</QRef>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Tax relief on individual pension contributions is allowed at the taxpayer&rsquo;s marginal tax rate, that is, at the standard or higher rate as appropriate in each case. It is assumed that the change mentioned by the Deputy is to confine tax relief to the standard rate of 20 per cent, for all pension contributions by individuals, including those currently relieved at the higher rate.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to estimate the cost in income tax foregone at the higher rate of relief in respect of employee contributions to occupational pension schemes because the relevant data in relation to contributions is not captured in such a way as to provide a dedicated basis for compiling this information. Tax relief for pension contributions by employees is normally given by way of a deduction from total income in arriving at income for tax purposes i.e. the income for tax purposes of employees is net of their pension contributions (the &lsquo;net pay&rsquo; arrangement).</P><Col N="249"/>
        <P>Provisions were included in Finance Act 2004 with a view to improving data quality and transparency without overburdening taxpayers/employers. The Act includes provisions that require employers to provide data on superannuation contributions in the P35 form to be filed by employers in respect of 2005 and subsequent years. The resulting data provides additional information regarding the overall cost of tax relief for pension contributions. However, as the returns are aggregated at employer level, they do not provide a basis for measuring the potential impact on the Exchequer of changes in the rate of relief at individual level such as that mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>As regards the self-employed and certain employees in pensionable employment, data is available in relation to relief on contributions for Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) for the income tax year 2005. On that basis, the full year yield to the Exchequer from confining tax relief to the standard rate of 20 per cent in respect of all contributions to RACs and PRSAs is tentatively estimated at about &euro;175 million in terms of income tax forgone.</P>

	<P>The prompt actions by international central banks, including the European Central Bank, to provide major injections of liquidity have contributed to greater stability in financial markets internationally, though they continue to remain subject to significant uncertainties. The ability of Irish banks to access liquidity from the European Central Bank has been a major benefit and provided a significant strength in assisting the Irish financial system to withstand difficult financial conditions over the last year. Agreement on the extensive and far-reaching plans announced recently by the US authorities should help to restore confidence to their financial markets with beneficial knock-on effects on wider international markets. </P>
        <P>EU Finance Ministers have adopted an extensive roadmap of actions incorporating a work programme aimed at putting in place a comprehensive response to developments in financial markets. This programme includes reviewing along with the EU&rsquo;s international partners how <Col N="250"/>to further improve transparency of complex financial instruments, valuation standards, the prudential framework, risk management and supervision and market functioning including the role of ratings agencies.</P>
        <P>Ireland is participating fully in this work at EU level to ensure there is an effective EU-wide system to maintain financial stability taking into account the important cross-border linkages that now exist in EU financial markets. Facilitated by the EU framework for maintaining financial stability my Department is in on-going close contact with both the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator in relation to financial market developments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Any proposed changes in VAT must be considered in the context of EU law.  There is no provision in European VAT law that would allow the application of a reduced VAT rate on supplies of goods or services based on their environmental impact per se.  While Member States can retain the zero rating provisions which they had in existence on 1 January 1991, they cannot introduce any new ones.  Therefore, it is not possible for Ireland to apply a zero rate to the supply of insulation materials.</P>
        <P>The supply of certain environmental products, such as insulation materials, wind turbine equipment, wood pellet boilers and solar panels, are chargeable at the standard VAT rate which in Ireland is 21%.  However, the reduced VAT rate of 13.5% may be applied to such products where they are provided under a single supply and install contract where the VAT exclusive cost of the goods does not exceed two-thirds of the total VAT exclusive charge to the customer.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to examine the current VAT classifications with a view to reducing the rate of VAT applied to certain environmental goods and services from the standard VAT rate of 21 per cent to the reduced VAT rate of 13.5 per cent.  In this regard the Finance Act 2008 provided for the VAT rate applicable on the supply of miscanthus rhizomes, seeds, bulbs, roots and similar goods used for the agricultural production of bio-fuels being reduced from 21% to 13.5%.  This and other measures under the Programme for Government clearly demonstrate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to addressing the environmental challenges which we face.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to be aware that the EU Commission are undertaking a study of the possibility of using reduced VAT rates as a tool to support the climate change agenda. Ireland has expressed support for such a study.</P>

        <P>The Evaluation Unit has also undertaken a substantial programme of direct spot checks of individual capital projects.  This programme which commenced in 2007 encompassed over 20 projects across six different Departments &mdash; Transport; Environment, Heritage and Local Government; Education and Science; Health and Children; Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and Arts, Sport and Tourism.  A number of these spot checks were carried over into 2008 and this first programme of direct spot checks is now virtually complete.

	<P>The scheme of capital allowances for the construction or refurbishment of buildings used as private hospitals was introduced in the Finance Act 2001 and came into effect in May 2002. Provided that capital expenditure on the proposed co-located private hospitals, which are designed to free-up capacity in public hospitals, conforms with the existing legislation governing that scheme, normal tax relief will apply. The cost of such tax relief will ultimately depend on the level of qualifying capital expenditure and the amounts claimed by investors; to date no such expenditure on the proposed co-located hospitals has yet been incurred. For each &euro;100 million of qualifying capital expenditure on these hospitals, the cost of tax relief to investors (assuming a marginal tax rate of 41% for those investors) would amount in gross terms to &euro;41 million spread over 7 years or approximately &euro;5.9 million per annum over that 7 year period. Given the additional activity generated by the construction of the hospitals, the employment generated and the related services provided on which taxes will be paid, additional revenues would accrue to the Exchequer.</P><Col N="255"/>
        <P>I have been informed by the Minister for Health and Children that the Board of the Health Service Executive has approved preferred bidder status for the development of co-located hospitals at the following six sites: Beaumont Hospital, Cork University Hospital, Limerick Regional Hospital, St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, Waterford Regional Hospital, and Sligo General Hospital.  Connolly Hospital and Tallaght Hospital, which are also participating in the co-location initiative, are at an earlier stage of the procurement process.</P>

        <QRef>[31115/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>At the outset I should point out that the safe home programme is a matter for my colleague Miche&aacute;l Martin T.D., Minister for Foreign Affairs and I am replying on his behalf.</P>
        <P>Funding for the Safe Home Programme has been provided annually by the Department of Foreign Affairs since 2003. Emigrant Support (then D&iacute;on) grants were also awarded to the Safe Home Programme in 2001 (&euro;63,487) and 2002 (&euro;82,500), at a time when the Emigrant Support Programme in Britain was administered by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
        <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs remains very supportive of the excellent work of the Safe Home programme. The award of a &euro;249,900 grant in April of this year brought the Department&rsquo;s total funding for Safe Home since 2003 to over &euro;1,100,000 (see attached table for annual breakdown). This substantial funding is testament to the high value which the Government places on the work performed by the Safe Home Programme in enabling elderly Irish emigrants to return to live in Ireland.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Department has progressively increased the level of funding available for emigrant services in recent years, from &euro;3 million in 2003 to a record &euro;15.183 million this year. These significant increases have enabled the Emigrant Support Programme, administered by the Irish Abroad Unit, to provide far greater financial support to the most vulnerable members of our overseas communities.</P>
        <P>Organisations are required to satisfy strict criteria in order to qualify for Emigrant Support funding, which are set out in detail on the grant application form, available on the Department&rsquo;s website, www.dfa.ie. Former grant recipients are also required to supply detailed documentation, including audited accounts, as set out in the letters of offer accompanying all Government grants awarded under the Programme.</P><Col N="256"/>
        <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, all grant applications for Emigrant Support funding are reviewed on their respective merits each year. However, my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Miche&aacute;l Martin TD, has asked that I assure the Deputy that his Department will maintain the current very significant level of funding to frontline welfare organisations in the period ahead.</P>
        <P>Since its inception, I am informed that Safe Home has also received funding from the Department of Social and Family Affairs (totalling &euro;262,245) and the Department of Environment and Local Government (totalling &euro;307,860).  Details are shown in the following tables.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006 -2010 (NCIP), which will invest &euro;575 million over 5 years,  with &euro;154.2 million allocated over a 3 year period to the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS).</P>
        <P>There are currently 841 Community based childcare facilities approved for funding under the CCSS.  This figure includes 51 services approved for entry to the Scheme since 1 January 2008, of which 24 had not previously been in receipt of any support under the scheme or its predecessor, under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006.  My office is aware of 9 services which have left the scheme since January 2008 and of 5 services which have closed this year generally for reasons unconnected with the scheme e.g. the venue for the service no longer being available.  One of these services is currently the subject of discussion with a view to reopening shortly under a new management committee.  I understand that the proposed reopening will involve a substantial increase in the level of service being provided.</P>
        <P>Applications for CCSS funding for 2009 have been invited and are due to be returned by the end of this week.  When processed these returns will provide data in regard to the number of services, and the number of childcare places they propose to provide, in respect of 2009.</P>

	<P>Section 10(c) of the Adoption Act, 1952, as amended by Section 2 of the 1964 Act provides that, in order to be eligible for adoption, a child must be &ldquo;illegitimate or an orphan&rdquo; or be a child who has been legitimated, but whose birth has not been re-registered. The Adoption Act, 1988, does permit the adoption of any child (including children of marriage) but only in exceptional and very limited circumstances where the parents are shown to have completely abandoned their parental duties, and there is an expectation that they will continue to do so until the child reaches the age of eighteen. After its passage through the Oireachtas, the President referred the Adoption Bill, 1988 to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution, for a decision on whether the provisions of the Bill were repugnant to the Constitution. While it was found to be Constitutional, and subsequently became the Adoption Act, 1988,  it was clear that these narrow circumstances, based on Article 42.5 of the Constitution, were the basis for the decision of the Supreme Court.  </P>
        <P>The Twenty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2007 was published in February 2007 and contained the Government&rsquo;s proposal to amend the Constitution in relation to children and included a provision to ensure that all children would be eligible for voluntary adoption, subject to appropriate consents. The Programme for Government of June 2007 committed to deepening consensus on the Twenty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2007 and to this end, the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children [JCCAC] was established in November, 2007, to report back within four months, on the proposals set out in the Bill. The Committee recently received D&aacute;il and Seanad approval for an extension of their timeframe to 30th November 2008. The Committee is now progressing with its work and the Government awaits the outcome of its deliberations before proceeding further with the proposed amendment of the Constitution in relation to children.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the Early Childcare Supplement (ECS) was introduced in April 2006.  The ECS, which is payable in respect of all children under 6 years of age, is a direct, universal, non-<Col N="260"/>taxable payment.  The payment was increased from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,100 in 2008.

        <P>No definite estimate is available of the cost of the ECS payment if it was confined to families earning less than &euro;100,000 per annum.  However, according to the Revenue Commissioners, it is estimated that approximately 86% of all tax units with children (regardless of the age of the child) earned less than &euro;100,000 per annum in 2007.  Assuming that this is representative of all current recipients of the ECS, the cost of the payment in 2008 would be in the region of &euro;435m.</P>

	<P>One of the key challenges facing the health service is the need to ensure that services are planned and provided in line with the clinical needs of the patient. A number of experimental initiatives have been put in place by the Health Service Executive with a view to providing care in community based rather than hospital based settings where clinically appropriate.  The &ldquo;Hospital in the Home&rdquo; service is one such initiative along with the introduction of Primary Care Teams, Community Intervention Teams, a Rapid Access Service for the Elderly and the GP Out of Hours service.</P>
        <P>The &ldquo;Hospital in the Home&rdquo; service was delivered by a private service provider on the basis of a service level agreement with the HSE and was for a period of one year.  This agreement came to an end on 16th March and was extended by agreement until 11th May 2008.  During the year, the service treated in the region of 2,000 patients at an annual cost of &euro;6.83 million.</P>
        <P>A review of the service was carried out between January and March of this year under an independent Chairperson.  The review made a number of recommendations.  The main recommendation, which has been adopted by the HSE, is that the concept of the &ldquo;Hospital in the Home&rdquo; be retained and that the service should be repatriated within existing HSE services.</P>
        <P>The HSE has emphasised that no patient was disadvantaged by this decision and has advised that patients who had been receiving services from the provider in question when the contract ceased have had their episode of care continued until it was scheduled to finish. These patients have since been referred back to their primary physician for management of any future care needs.</P>
        <P>The HSE is developing the range of services provided by the Community Intervention Teams in the Greater Dublin Area and extending their coverage with a view to meeting the needs of patients previously treated by the &ldquo;Hospital in the Home&rdquo; service.</P>

        <P>My Department is considering the legal, financial and service implications of the recent High Court judgement for the payments made to community pharmacists, as well as its potential wider implications in respect of other self-employed health professionals.  My understanding is the judgement confirmed that I have the power to alter the payments made under the 1996 Community Pharmacy Contract after consultation with the Irish Pharmacy Union.</P><Col N="264"/>
        <P>The report of the Independent Body on Pharmacy Contract Pricing dealt with the pricing of an interim contract which had been offered to community pharmacists following the reduction in the wholesale margin. It was published on my Department&rsquo;s website last July.</P>
        <P>I have had various meetings with the pharmacy sector, including the IPU, but I have not met the IPU since the High Court judgement.  I will be decide how best to proceed having considered the legal and other advice available to me. However, I remain of the view that the costs of pharmacy services under the GMS and community drugs schemes are not sustainable, a view that is reinforced by the current budgetary challenges.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 387 and 398 together.</P>
        <P>Last June I approved National Quality Assurance Standards for Symptomatic Breast Disease Services under the Health Act 2007.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) National Cancer Control Programme decided to centralise breast cancer services in eight designated specialist centres.  The decision to consolidate the symptomatic breast service provided by South Infirmary and Cork University Hospital (CUH) for the Southern region into the designated cancer centre at CUH is consistent with this approach.</P>
        <P>It is important to emphasise that the decision to reorganise services is about achieving optimum outcomes.  This is not in itself a value judgement about the work being carried on in the existing centres, some of which have a relatively large workload, but will not be part of the future designated centres.  In order to achieve the very best outcomes we need to concentrate cancer services in designated cancer centres.  This necessarily means that some centres which are well organised and have a significant case load will nonetheless need to transfer that work to other locations.  I am confident that the consolidated service will meet the national standards for symptomatic breast care as published by the Health Information &amp; Quality Authority (HIQA).</P><Col N="265"/>
        <P>The most recent data available through the Hospital In-Patient Data Enquiry (HIPE) is in relation to 2007. Cork University Hospital had 113 procedures and the South Infirmary had 234 procedures carried out on women with a principal diagnosis of breast cancer in that year.  Information in respect of Cork University Hospital and South Infirmary for 2008 is not yet available from the HIPE system.</P>

	<P>Tackling all Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs), including MRSA continues to be a priority for the Government and the Health Service Executive (HSE).</P>
        <P>The HSE launched a National Infection Control Action Plan in March 2007.  An Infection Control Steering Group is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the plan.  Over the next five years, the HSE aims to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infection by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%.  Achievement of these targets will benefit all patients who are at risk. <Col N="266"/> The Steering Group is supported by eight Local Implementation Teams which will ensure that all local facilities are focused on achieving the national targets.</P>
        <P>A new National Surveillance System has been established by the HSE to collect data and provide information on a quarterly basis on four key areas,  to monitor HCAIs in our health system: 1.Staphylococcus bacteraemia (blood stream infections); 2. Antibiotic consumption; 3.Alcohol gel use; 4. MRSA Surveillance in Intensive Care Units, from 2008 onwards. This data (excluding MRSA in ICUs) has been compiled and published for 2006 and 2007.  The table below is an extract of the relevant hospitals requested by the Deputy, taken from the most recent report of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.</P>

        <P Just="Left">* <Miles com="ix" />In 2007, maternity services at Erinville Hospital and St. Finbarr&rsquo;s Hospital, Cork transferred to Cork University Maternity Hospital, which together with Cork University Hospital (CUH) composed CUH group.  All data for CUH group in 2007 are presented under CUH.</P>
</table>
        <P FLI="0">This table gives the number of MRSA bloodstream isolates by acute public hospital for 2007.  Most of the variation in reported numbers of S. aureus bloodstream infections between hospitals can be explained by differences in hospital size, activity and patient populations.  At present there is no way to adjust the data to allow for these differences and hence direct comparisons between hospitals are not possible.</P>
        <P>Other measures taken to reduce the incidence of HCAIs include the appointment of additional infection control staff, education campaigns for healthcare staff and the general public around the prudent use of antibiotics and the use of designated private beds for isolation purposes where required for patients who contract HCAIs.  In addition, new environmental building guidelines to inform infection control policy in all new builds and refurbishments are expected to be published by the HSE later this month.</P>
        <P>The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) undertook a comprehensive review of hygiene in our acute hospitals in 2007 and published its report last November.  In addition, HIQA is due to publish  Infection Prevention and Control Standards later this year.  When finalised, these standards, along with the National Hygiene Standards, will provide a comprehensive framework to control infection in all healthcare settings.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that if a patient is diagnosed with a bloodstream infection at a given hospital it does not indicate that the infection was acquired at that hospital.  Many bloodstream infections are acquired in the community, but only diagnosed upon admission to hospital.  A patient may either have acquired the infection in one hospital, but the infection may be diagnosed on transfer to another hospital.</P><Col N="267"/>
        <P>While accepting that not all HCAIs are preventable, I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of HCAIs generally and to treat them promptly when they occur.</P>

	<P>In recent years there have been significant improvements to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is assessed.  Since the beginning of 2005, the qualification guidelines have increased by a cumulative 29% (7.5% and 20% in January and October 2005 respectively).  Assessment is now based on a person&rsquo;s and, where relevant, his/her spouse&rsquo;s income after tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, childcare and travel to work.  In June 2006, there was a further increase in the qualification threshold for the GP visit card to 50% above that for a medical card.  Furthermore, under the assessment guidelines, persons whose weekly incomes are derived solely from Department of Social and Family Affairs payments or HSE payments, even if these exceed the stated threshold, qualify for a medical card.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government includes the following: indexing the income thresholds for medical cards to increases in the average industrial wage; doubling of the income limit eligibility <Col N="270"/>of parents of children under 6 years of age, and trebling them for parents of children under 18 years of age with an intellectual disability.</P>
        <P>In conjunction with the development of a new legislative framework to provide for clear statutory provisions on eligibility for health and personal social services, my Department is reviewing the assessment criteria in the context of financial, medical and social need in line with the commitment in Towards 2016.  A Steering Group has been established to report to me on this matter. Upon completion of this report it is my intention to then consider how best to progress the commitments in the Programme for Government in relation to medical card eligibility.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for the medical card and GP visit card benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.  My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The Food Supplements Directive, 2002/46/EC, has been transposed into Irish law by Statutory Instrument No. 506 of 2007.  That legislation is implemented by the Health Service Executive, under a Service Contract Agreement with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).  This ensures that consumers in Ireland are protected by the harmonised EU rules on the sale of food supplements, in particular the labelling of food supplements and chemical form of vitamins and minerals they contain.  </P>
        <P>One of the objectives of the Food Supplements Directive (2002/46/EC) was to make provision for the European Commission to determine maximum and minimum levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements.   This matter remains under consideration at European Commission level.</P>
        <P>The European Commission published a Discussion Paper on determining maximum and minimum levels of vitamins and minerals in June 2006.  The Irish response to this Discussion Paper gave Ireland&rsquo;s view that the Commission should proceed on a cautious basis, setting maximum limits for as many vitamins and minerals as possible.  It was considered vital that the safety of the general population and the needs of particular subgroups such as pregnant women, children, older people and those on various specialist diets be taken into account in formulating the position on this issue.</P>
        <P>Discussions are ongoing at European level on the development of a methodology under which maximum safe levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements will be set.  Those discussions will permit the European Commission and Member States to further develop its thinking on this issue.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 409, 565, 575 and 576 together.</P>
        <P>In July 2005 I issued a policy direction to the Health Service Executive aimed at freeing up additional beds in public hospitals for public patients.  This will be achieved through the development of private hospitals on the sites of public hospitals and the transfer of private activity to those hospitals, thereby releasing substantial capacity for public patients in public hospitals.  The initiative is expected to provide up to 1,000 additional beds for public patients over five years.</P>
        <P>Co-location is the quickest and least expensive means of providing significant additional bed capacity for public patients. No capital outlay is required as the beds in the public hospitals are already in place, having been funded by the Exchequer.  A further very important benefit is that the additional beds made available for public patients in public hospitals will come fully staffed (in contrast to the usual position where direct capital investment is used to fund public hospital capital developments).</P>
        <P>The Board of the Health Service Executive (HSE) has approved preferred bidder status for the development of  co-located hospitals at the following six sites: Beaumont Hospital, Cork University Hospital, Limerick Regional Hospital, St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, Waterford Regional Hospital and Sligo General Hospital.  Connolly Hospital and Tallaght Hospital, which are also participating in the co-location initiative, are at an earlier stage of the procurement process.</P>
        <P>Under the Project Agreements agreed with the HSE, the land on which the Hospitals will be built by the successful bidders, will be under a 65-year lease from the State at full market value.  The intention is that no land will be sold to the successful bidders.  This efficient utilization of public resources means that the State will receive an income for land over the 65 year period.  The commercial value of each site has been determined by independent assessors.</P>
        <P>As under the Health Act 2004 the Health Service Executive has operational responsibility for the implementation of the policy direction which I have issued, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to furnish the Deputy with the specific information requested.</P>

	<P>My Department understands that Release, which was established in Ireland in 2005, is a private, profit making organisation which advertises a holistic approach to communication intervention, incorporating speech and language therapy, early intervention and oral motor therapy to help children combat communication difficulties.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, in Ireland, people with, or parents of children with, speech and language disorder can choose to take a private or public route to attain services.  The Department of Health and Children and the HSE aim to provide access to services that are of high quality, oriented towards optimal outcome and are sustainable in the long term.  It is considered that these objectives can best be met, in many instances, through the use of multi-disciplinary teams working closely and holistically, in a person centred way, under a HSE governance structure.</P>
        <P>The Primary Care Strategy, the Disability Act, 2005 and the HSE Transformation Agenda emphasise the need for team working to achieve maximum outcome.  Furthermore, when a person requires intervention from only one profession, best practice would suggest that, in most instances, those professions will be part of the organisation to ensure proper governance. As the Deputy is aware the HSE has autonomy to decide on the most effective way of delivering services which may include the use of external agencies when deemed appropriate.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question also relates to the management and delivery of health and personal services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.

	<P>The National Audit of Stroke Care, which was published earlier this year by the Irish Heart Foundation with the support of my Department, highlighted a number of areas where clinical care and the organisation of stroke services can be enhanced.  In September last year, I established a Cardiovascular Health Policy Group to advise on how to prevent the occurrence of cardiovascular disease and stroke, and improve services for individuals affected by these conditions.  I am aware that the Policy Group has, in the course of its work, considered the findings of the Audit and is addressing the issues including prevention in the primary care setting, rapid access to diagnostic services, the configuration of stroke services, including stroke units, the provision of thrombolysis as well as models of rehabilitation and discharge planning.  The group is expected to report within the next few months.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 428 and 429 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that under the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme, which is governed by the Health (Nursing Homes) (Amendment) Act 2007, the Health Service Executive (HSE) can make a payment towards the cost of providing nursing care in a registered private nursing home.  In order to qualify for a subvention the individual must be:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />sufficiently dependent to require maintenance in a nursing home, and</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />unable to pay any or part of the cost of maintenance in the home, i.e., they must undergo a means assessment which takes account of income and assets.  However, in an improvement to the scheme in 2007, a person&rsquo;s principal private residence is now excluded from the means assessment after three years.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In 2007 the HSE produced National Guidelines for the Standardised Implementation of the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme to all Local Health Offices.  These Guidelines are available on the HSE&rsquo;s website.  Under the guidelines, the assessment of means is to be carried out using a national standard financial assessment method.</P>

	<P>There is no statutory obligation on the Health Service Executive (HSE) to provide chiropody services to GMS patients. <Col N="279"/> However, in practice, arrangements have been made in several regions to provide these services.  Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of any arrangements for community chiropody services and the level of service provided were a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time.  I understand that priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over.  In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently preparing legislation to clarify and update existing legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services.  The Bill will define specific health and personal services more clearly, define who should be eligible for what services, set out clear criteria for eligibility, establish when and in what circumstances charges may be made and provide for an appeals framework.</P>

	<P>This drug is currently at an early stage of clinical trials in many countries but is not yet licensed in Ireland, any country in Europe or the US. While the initial results are positive later phases of the trials still have to be completed before the efficacy and safety of the product can be fully assessed.</P>
        <P>This assessment will then need to satisfy criteria of the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) and the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) which are responsible for the protection and promotion of public health, through the evaluation and supervision of medicines for human use, before they can be put on the Irish or European markets.</P>
        <P>The Irish Medicines Board is the statutory body responsible for the regulation of human medicines in Ireland.

As with all medicinal products, the Board will continue to assess new information concerning this drug and liaise with EMEA and the regulatory bodies in other European member states where necessary.</P>

	<P>Proposals for Human Tissue legislation are currently being developed by my Department. The purpose of the legislation will be to meet the key recommendation of the Madden Report on Post Mortem Practice and Procedures that no post-mortem examination should be carried out and no tissue retained for any purpose whatsoever without authorisation. The scope of the Bill will include comprehensive provisions on the removal, retention, storage, use and disposal of human tissue from deceased persons, and related matters.</P>
        <P>Consent for retention and use of human tissue once the Coroner&rsquo;s process has been completed will also be provided for, and will complement the provisions in the Coroners Act 1962 and the Coroners Bill 2007 which is awaiting Committee stage in the Seanad.</P>
        <P>The legislation will encompass consent procedures for the use of tissue from deceased donors for research and transplantation. One of the related matters which is being considered for inclusion is a similar provision for living tissue donors. Retention of tissue donated for the purpose of research will be addressed in the context of obtaining informed consent.</P>

The Assistant National Director of the Programme is assisting in this process and recently met with the management of Sligo General Hospital in relation to the transfer of breast cancer services to University Hospital Galway.</P>
        <P>The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while at the same time allowing local access to services, where appropriate. Where diagnosis and treatment planning is directed and managed by multi-disciplinary teams based at the cancer centres, then much of the treatment (other than surgery) can be delivered in local hospitals such as Sligo General.</P>
        <P>Funding of &euro;7 million has been allocated from the Programme across the eight centres for symptomatic breast disease services, to support additional staff, including Consultant, Radiography, Nursing and clerical posts.  Funding has also been allocated for some necessary additional equipment.</P>

	<P>The Department has been advised by the Health Service Executive (HSE) that it is progressing with the task of transferring past interest retained on invested patient private property accounts and a process to undertake this transfer, initially for the period 2005-2006 has been agreed. The HSE has advised that the issue of tax liability for clients in receipt of such payments has now been clarified by the Revenue Commissioners and that the refund will not give rise to any tax implications for either the individual client or the HSE.</P>
        <P>The HSE advises that initial testing of the computer programme to calculate payments to clients is now complete and that the validation of data on details of clients and their patient private property account  balances for the first planned tranche of payments is also complete.</P>
        <P>The HSE also advises that the final proposal on the process and rules around making payments is currently being completed. Proposals on a number of key issues have been considered, including dealing with very small payment amounts, situations where it is not possible to locate the person entitled to receive the payment and situations where complete information is not available.  Final agreement on these processes will then allow completion of the proposal for payment of interest retained pre 2005.</P>

The Report of the Review Group was completed over a year ago and developments in renal services have since been guided by the thinking in the report. The Renal Review Group identified the need for the early introduction of a follow-on implementation plan.  The HSE has decided that such a plan needs to be aligned with its Transformation Programme.  The HSE has further determined that the Report of the Review Group should be externally validated. </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 488, 529 and 530 together.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed not only to ensuring the delivery of the best quality health services possible but to doing so in an effective and efficient way.  Ensuring patient safety is of paramount importance, so that people can have confidence in the services and that the best possible patient outcomes can be achieved. It is essential that we prioritise patient safety and quality and that we organise and manage services accordingly. The priority is to provide safe services as close as possible to where people live.</P>
        <P>In the past, Roscommon County Hospital and Portiuncula Hospital Ballinasloe have operated independently, with two consultant general surgeons in each hospital. The difficulties faced by Roscommon and Portiuncula in maintaining surgical services independently, and the need for closer co-operation between them, were highlighted by the former Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al in March 2006. Advances in clinical care and ever-increasing levels of specialisation mean that the present model of care faces important practical difficulties, which must be addressed.</P>
        <P>In the light of these factors, the best way of retaining and developing services at Roscommon and Portiuncula hospitals is for these hospitals to work closely together.  The Health Service Executive has indicated that it is proceeding with the proposal for a Joint Department of Surgery and Anaesthesia at Roscommon County Hospital and Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to provide the detailed information sought directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive commissioned Horwath Consultants in association with Teamwork Management Services in February 2007  to examine the arrangements for the provision of acute hospital services in the Mid West with a view to identifying the best configuration of such services in the region including arrangements for A&amp;E, critical care, acute medicine and surgery, together with diagnostic services so that the highest quality of care can be delivered to the population of the region. This work encompasses the services provided by St John&rsquo;s Hospital, Limerick.</P>
        <P>The work of the consultants will act as one of the inputs to decisions on how best to reconfigure acute services in the Mid West region. The Government and the Executive are committed to ensuring that the approach to re-organisation of services is carried out in consultation with the key stakeholders and that each element is progressed incrementally.  I believe that it is important to work with health professionals and other interested parties to secure an increasing set of improvements over time. This approach will, I am confident, produce the best outcome for patients.</P>

	<P>My Department has made enquiries with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and has been advised that there are currently 1,879 patients waiting over 3 months for either medical or surgical treatment in <Col N="295"/>Tallaght Hospital. By no means have all of these patients been referred to the NTPF; 637 have been waiting between 3 and 6 months; 1006 between 6 and 12 months; and 236 longer than 12 months.  The total number waiting for surgery is 964.</P>
        <P>The primary remit of the NTPF is to facilitate treatment for those public patients who are waiting longest on waiting lists for elective surgery.  The NTPF has therefore requested Tallaght Hospital to expedite referral to the Fund of the longest waiters.</P>
        <P>At end of 2007, NTPF indicated that, nationally, a total of 4,638 or 26% of surgical patients were waiting for over 12 months for their procedures.  Many of these were day cases.  Over half of adult patients waiting more than 12 months are on the waiting lists of four hospitals.  I asked the NTPF to give urgent attention to the position in these hospitals in 2008 and it is doing so.  I am pleased to say that the position is improving gradually, with 1,837 persons in this category at the end of July 2008, and I look forward to a continuation of this trend.</P>

        <P>Out of hours co-operatives allow general practitioners to put in place arrangements to provide services to their patients, while their surgeries are closed in the evenings, on weekends and bank holidays. The development of GP co-operatives is in line with the overall health service policy of strengthening primary care services and ensuring that to the greatest extent possible, people&rsquo;s care needs are met in the primary care setting.</P>
        <P>Out of hours co-operatives are now in place in all Health Service Executive (HSE) areas, providing coverage in all or in part of all counties.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been considering how best to address the serious issues arising from the recent cases of the late Ms. Anne Moriarty and the late Ms. Edel Kelly following their treatment in Ennis General Hospital. I have met the husband of one of the deceased women and I intend to meet the family of the other woman next week.  I wish to extend my sympathy to both families on their sad loss.</P>
        <P>In relation to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, I am aware that Ms Moriarty was diagnosed with breast cancer there two years previously and continued to attend for follow-up at the Hospital.   Ms Moriarty&rsquo;s most recent follow-up in St James&rsquo;s was in April 2007 in which the mammogram was reported as clear. Subsequently the Hospital has not been able to locate this mammogram to have it reviewed.</P>
        <P>The expert clinical advice available to me is that a clinical review of other patients treated in Ennis would not be warranted. I am also conscious that, in the context of future lessons for cancer services, breast cancer services have now been transferred from the Hospital to a designated specialist cancer centre.</P>
        <P>Since we have now moved breast cancer services from Ennis General Hospital I feel it is important to have a wider examination of the operation of the Hospital, which would look at the approach there to issues relating to diagnosis and treatment of patients, including the governance arrangements for quality and safety, and to communications both within the hospital and with patients.  I believe that there may be lessons to be learned both for Ennis General Hospital itself and for the wider acute hospital system.</P>
        <P>I am very conscious that the Health Service Executive has been working for some time to reconfigure services in the Mid Western region. It has been engaging with clinicians and other health professionals in the region to agree on a practical, patient-centred plan for reorganising services between Limerick Regional, Ennis, Nenagh and St. John&rsquo;s Hospital. The clinicians in the region have been working very positively and have shown strong leadership towards this <Col N="297"/>end.  I am aware that the HSE has placed a particular emphasis on integrating A&amp;E services, with clear roles for all four hospitals as part of a well defined emergency care network.</P>
        <P>I am also aware that HIQA has been reviewing documentation relating to the cases of Ms. Moriarty and Ms. Kelly and that it is formulating its own views on the question of carrying out an appropriate investigation or review.</P>
        <P>With all of these factors in mind I have requested the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), under section 9(2) of the Health Act 2007, to review the arrangements for providing services at Ennis General Hospital with particular reference to the diagnosis and follow-up of patients and the communication systems in place within the Hospital for both patients and staff.  The review, which I have asked HIQA to complete within three months, will include how these arrangements work in the Emergency Department. I think it would be particularly helpful if any of the conclusions or recommendations were applicable to other acute hospitals also.</P>
        <P>Patient safety has always been high on my agenda and on the agenda of the Government.  I have taken a number of initiatives in the area of patient safety including the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority in 2007.  Among the functions of HIQA are to monitor healthcare quality and to investigate issues of patient safety.</P>
        <P>I set up the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance which reported to me in late July of this year. The Commission&rsquo;s Report &lsquo;Building a Culture of Patient Safety&rsquo; was published on 7th August 2008.  This is the first report of its kind and it makes far reaching recommendations which, when implemented, will have a very positive impact on patients and their families. The most significant recommendation of the report is the introduction of a licensing system for all health services whether they are delivered publicly or privately.  The Commission proposed that the licensing scheme will be operated by HIQA.  Compliance with standards set down by HIQA will be a prerequisite to licensing.  Other recommendations from the Commission include the participation of all licensed healthcare facilities in local and national clinical audit, a mandatory adverse event reporting system, enhanced education, training and research and improved governance structures.  I am currently considering these recommendations in detail.  It is my intention to bring the report, together with an implementation strategy, to Government as soon as possible.</P>

        <P>Late last year the Government approved the publication of the draft general scheme of the Bill as part of a public consultation process. This process resulted in a total of 213 submissions being made to the Department of Health and Children.  The General Scheme is now being revised following the response to the consultation process and the revised Heads of the Bill are being prepared for submission to Government for its approval.</P>
        <P>I consider this legislation to be essential to the modernisation of the nursing and midwifery professions and to the protection of the public. I intend to publish the revised Bill as soon as possible after the Government has approved the revised Heads.</P>

	<P>BreastCheck commenced the screening process in the Western Region in May 2007, with the provision of a mobile unit on the grounds of Roscommon County Hospital.  I officially opened the BreastCheck static unit for the Western Region at University Hospital Galway last December.  The National Cancer Screening Service has informed my Department that roll out of the BreastCheck programme to individual counties, including County Clare will be dictated by BreastCheck&rsquo;s management and operational considerations.</P>
        <P>In relation to mammography in the Mid-West region, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has advised my Department that breast imaging services are available at Limerick Regional Hospital through a breast clinic which provides rapid access for all women with breast symptoms.  Urgent referrals to the breast clinic for mammography are usually carried out within two weeks.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to charge women for mammograms provided by the public health service.  The HSE have also advised my Department that consideration is being given to the availability of mammography for women who do not have symptoms, pending the roll-out of BreastCheck.  This consideration will have to ensure that women with actual symptoms are given absolute priority.</P>
        <P>It is important that clear criteria are applied to distinguish between urgent and routine cases.  Significant work has already been undertaken in the area of symptomatic breast disease services, supported by the Irish College of General Practitioners, in relation to referral criteria and the development of appropriate referral forms to allow for appropriate triage of urgent and non-urgent cases.</P>
        <P>The implementation of the National Quality Assurance Standards for Symptomatic Breast Disease will ensure that every woman in Ireland who develops breast cancer has an equal opportunity to be managed in a centre which is capable of delivering the best possible results. <Col N="302"/> Any woman who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has responsibility for administering the health repayment scheme in conjunction with the appointed scheme administrator KPMG/McCann Fitzgerald.  The HSE has informed my Department that it exercised its right under the contract to require the Scheme Administrator to complete the claims and services that were outstanding beyond their contract date.  It is not possible at this stage to estimate exactly the cost of the completion of the work in progress but the contract provides that completion of outstanding claims and services is on the same terms as originally tendered.</P>

	<P>The foster care allowance can only be paid in respect of children who are deemed to be in need of care and protection and who are taken into the care of the Health Service Executive and placed in foster care or relative care in accordance with the Child Care Regulations, 1995.  Under the current legislation, the Health Service Executive must assess the needs of a child placed in care and the suitability of the prospective foster or relative carers, and draw up a care plan.  The implementation of the care plan places significant responsibilities and duties on foster carers, whether relatives or non-relatives.  The Foster Care Allowance is paid in recognition of these additional responsibilities and the additional costs of looking after foster children.  Decisions relating to the payment of social welfare allowances are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive commissioned Horwath Consultants in association with Teamwork Management Services in February 2007  to examine the arrangements for the provision of acute hospital services in the Mid West with a view to identifying the best configuration of such services in the region including arrangements for A&amp;E, critical care, acute medicine and surgery, together with diagnostic services so that the highest quality of care can be delivered to the population of the region.</P>
        <P>The work of the consultants will act as one of the inputs to decisions on how best to reconfigure acute services in the Mid West region. The Government and the Executive are committed to ensuring that the approach to re-organisation of services is carried out in consultation with the key stakeholders and that each element is progressed incrementally. I believe that it is important to work with health professionals and other interested parties to secure an increasing set of improvements over time. This approach will, I am confident, produce the best outcome for patients.</P>

	<P>Regulation (EC) 1408/71 facilitates free movement of workers and others within the EU by providing for coordination between member states&rsquo; health care and social security systems. In relation to health care, its provisions ensure that where people are affiliated with the health care system of one member state (insured with that system or covered by it), but residing or staying in another member state, they can access the public health care system of that member state in certain circumstances. The Regulation provides for the reimbursement of health care costs in one member state to persons affiliated with the health care system of another member state.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of a formal bilateral reimbursement agreement in place since 1973 between Ireland and the UK, arising from the application of Regulation (EC) 1408/71, net liability between the two countries has been calculated on a lump sum basis rather than an individual basis and comprehends such persons as temporary visitors from the UK; UK pensioners and their dependants residing in Ireland; and the dependant families residing in Ireland of persons employed in the UK.  The payment made in any one year is determined based upon an estimate of the number of persons falling within categories eligible for reimbursement and for whom each country is liable and an estimate of the average cost of providing health care treatment.  The estimated number of pensioners for whom each country is liable is based on a survey by both administrations undertaken every three years.  Such a survey has been completed this year and will be applied to determine the liabilities for the years 2007, 2008 and 2009.</P><Col N="315"/>

        <P FLI="0">Payments received in any one year can relate to both final settlements in respect of previous years&rsquo; liabilities and advance payments in respect of the current year.  In relation to the dispersal of the monies received under this agreement, these monies were previously incorporated as income into the Appropriations-in Aid in the Department of Health and Children&rsquo;s Vote.  With the establishment of the Health Service Executive (HSE) this money now is included as an Appropriation-in Aid in the HSE Vote.  The income offsets a portion of the gross funding requirements of the HSE at national level and reduces the net liability to the Exchequer.   In relation to how the money is dispersed, this is the responsibility of the HSE.  However, it is understood that it forms part of the budget allocation system of the HSE in conjunction with Exchequer funding.</P>

	<P>Almost 130,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government&rsquo;s ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future.</P>
        <P>Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement. In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

        <Quest> the action taken to require the Health Service Executive to comply with its statutory obligations and to publish reports for each of the years 2006 and 2007 with regard to the workings of the childcare services as required under Irish children&rsquo;s legislation. </Quest>

	<P>Section 8 of the Childcare Act 2001 required the then Health Boards to review the adequacy of child care and family support services in their area.  This was, and remains, a unique requirement among community based services and serves to highlight the importance placed on these services by Government, and society in general.  </P>
        <P>The establishment of the Health Service Executive in 2005 necessitated the re-orientation of these Section 8 reports to reflect the new unitary structure.  This re-orientation involved, inter alia, the development of a standardised template for compiling the data and producing the reports.  This work has now been completed and the report in respect of 2005 has already been published by the HSE this year.</P>
        <P>At a recent meeting between myself, officials from my Office and senior HSE Child Welfare and Protection managers, I was informed that the 2006 report is now also complete and its publication by the HSE imminent.  Further, the 2007 report is expected to be complete, and published, before the end of this year.  Thereafter, I have been informed by the HSE of the expectation that future reports will be produced in a timely fashion.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Health and Children does not have a role in relation to setting the detailed requirements for registration with the Medical Council.  These are defined by the Council in its own rules.</P>
        <P>The Council has informed me that successful completion of the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) examination, as a demonstration of competence in English, is the first step in the process of applying for registration with the Medical Council for a minority of doctors, mainly those from outside the EU.  Under current legislation and regulations the majority of doctors do not have to sit the IELTS.</P>
        <P>The requirement to provide evidence of competence in English is intended to safeguard the interests of patients as effective communication is at the core of being a good doctor.</P>

	<P>The Teamwork Report, prepared for the Health Service Executive (HSE), clearly indicated that the service configuration in the North East region was unsustainable.   It recommended a reconfiguration of hospital services across the existing five hospital sites in order to ensure the highest level of patient safety.  The Report also identified a significant future role for all five hospital sites in the provision of acute hospital services.</P>
        <P>The Report has helped to inform the approach being adopted by the HSE in implementing its Transformation Programme.  The Programme involves widespread and fundamental change and is designed to build a health system that is in line with the model of care emerging internationally.  The overriding aim, which I fully support, is the need to improve safety and achieve better standards of care for patients in the region.</P>
        <P>As part of the reconfiguration of acute hospital services in the North East the HSE is planning to transfer acute inpatient services from Monaghan to Cavan.   The transfer is scheduled to take place later this year.  The HSE is working to ensure that the necessary capacity is in place prior to or in parallel with the transfer date in order to ensure a smooth transition.</P>
        <P>For example a Medical Assessment Unit is being established at Cavan to help manage the anticipated increase in activity.  The average length of stay for inpatients is to be reduced in line with best practice.  The discharge planning process will also be improved.  Alternatives to acute inpatient care will be required through the planned provision of additional packages of care in the Cavan/Monaghan community care area together with an increase in capacity at Monaghan.  Enhancements in pre-hospital care in the Cavan/Monaghan area will also be required.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government and the Health Service Executive (HSE) remain committed to the development of a comprehensive needs-based service for children at risk.  In this regard, I personally chair regular meetings between officials from my Office (OMCYA) and Senior Child Welfare and Protection managers in the HSE aimed at improving the provision of services to children at risk.  A key component of these discussions has been the provision of out of hours care.</P>
        <P>As a result of these contacts it has now been agreed that rather than proceeding with the development of a stand alone social work out of hours service, the HSE is instead taking the opportunity provided by the proposed integration of hospital and community services at a regional level, to develop alternative proposals based on a more integrated approach which builds on its existing out of hours services including GPs, acute hospital services and mental health services.  The HSE is currently finalising issues around the development of the necessary protocols and assessing the requirement for any further supports which will be necessary.  It is anticipated that significant progress will be made in this regard over the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>The aim is to ensure that persons seeking personal social services outside normal working hours can be triaged and provided with appropriate advice, information, support and, in emergency situations, access to specialist staff, such as staff working in the areas of mental health and suicide prevention.  In this context the HSE is also working towards the provision of a system whereby Garda&iacute; can access appropriate residential care options for children taken into care out of hours under Section 12 of the Child Care Act.  In so doing, the HSE hopes to provide a standardised response across the country.  This approach promises a more effective and integrated model of service provision which acknowledges the linkages between services such as mental health and social work while endeavouring to utilise the overall resources already in place to appropriately address incidents occurring outside usual working hours.</P>

        <P>There were a number of issues contributing to difficulties accessing Speech and Language Therapy services, one of which had been the supply of qualified personnel available to fill vacant posts. A particular priority for my Department and the Department of Education and Science in recent years has been the expansion of the supply of therapy graduates. In this regard, the number of training places for Speech and Language Therapy has been increased from 25 to 105, with the establishment of three new Speech and Language Therapy Schools in National University of Ireland Galway (NUIG), University College Cork (UCC) and University of Limerick (UL), which represents an increase of 320% since 1997.</P>
        <P>The number of speech and language therapists employed in the public service has grown from 282 whole time equivalents in 1997 to 721 in 2008. This is an increase of 439 wholetime equivalents, which represents a growth of 156% in that period. The Government continues to support the development of new Speech and Language Therapy posts, particularly in the areas of Disability and Primary Care. My Department is working closely with the HSE, and representatives of the professions, with a view to ensuring that the optimum number of such posts are filled as expeditiously as possible, having due regard to the requirement on the HSE to operate within its budget.</P>

Although the project referred to was not prioritised for inclusion by the Executive this year 2008, Naas General Hospital has benefited from a completed major capital project in recent years.

        <P Just="Left">The expert advice from BreastCheck and from the National Cancer Forum, as contained in the National Strategy for Cancer Control, is that following the national extension of the programme, the upper age limit should be extended to women aged 69 years.  The priority of BreastCheck is to screen women who have not yet been screened and accordingly it is fully focused at present on the completion of the first round of screening in the West and South.  I will consider extending the age limit as recommended when the national roll-out of the programme is sufficiently developed and it is assured that a quality service is being delivered.  Any woman irrespective of her age who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</P>

	<P>Almost 130,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services. In recent years, the Government&rsquo;s ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services. The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future.</P>
        <P>Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement. In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public. The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy. My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>In January 2008, the Government announced the establishment of the Office for Disability and Mental Health to support the Minister for Disability &amp; Mental Health in exercising his responsibilities across four Government Departments: Health &amp; Children, Education &amp; Science, Enterprise, Trade &amp; Employment and Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform.  </P>
        <P>A core function of the Office is to promote and develop an integrated, systematic approach to the implementation of government policy and initiatives in relation to services for people with disabilities and mental health difficulties.</P>
        <P>One of the key priorities is to develop an appropriate continuum of training and employment support services for people with disabilities by working together with the Dept. of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, F&Aacute;S and the HSE.</P>
        <P>Very substantial progress has been made in recent years in the areas of disability and mental health, but much remains to be done.  To this end the Office is supporting a joint HSE/F&Aacute;S initiative to support people with disabilities while transitioning from rehabilitative training to vocational training and/or employment.</P>
        <P>Likewise, the office is concerned to ensure that services that are provided to people with disabilities are consistent with their need and are delivered in integrated mainstream settings,  where appropriate. To this end the Office is currently working with the HSE to carry out a comprehensive review of all adult day services. A key desired outcome of this is that people with disabilities who participate in, or who are capable of participating in employment, do so in a manner which is consistent with the mainstream policy and legislative provision.</P>

	<P>Tackling all Health Care Associated Infections (HCAIs) continues to be a priority for the Government and the Health Service Executive (HSE).</P>
        <P>The HSE launched a National Infection Control Plan in March 2007.  An Infection Control Steering Group is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the plan.  Over the next 5 years the HSE aims to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infection by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%.  Achievement of these targets will benefit all patients who are at risk.  The Steering Group is supported by eight Local Implementation Teams which will ensure that all local facilities are focused on achieving the national targets.</P>
        <P>There is little risk of transmitting MRSA to healthy people who are at low risk of becoming infected.  The risk of MRSA transmission, to staff or other students in a school is low and can be greatly reduced with careful attention to hand hygiene and basic infection control practices.</P>
        <P>Children in such settings are likely to be colonised/infected with other organisms that pose a greater potential threat to staff and students (e.g. influenza, norovirus, Group A Strep etc), for which routine screening is not required.  Therefore, the availability of hand hygiene facilities (sinks and alcohol gels) and environmental cleaning regimens play an important role.</P>
        <P>The HSE recommends that community institutions such as schools should have a policy to prevent transmission of micro organisms that emphasises the importance of standard precautions and good levels of personal hygiene by all.  However, it goes without saying that if there is any concern about the clinical status of the child/resident, their general practitioner should be consulted for advice.  It is important that children with MRSA are not stigmatised as they pose little risk to those with whom they come in contact.</P>
        <P>The HSE have written to the Department of Education and Science advising it of the above. There is also a general booklet for schools on &ldquo;Schools and Infection&rdquo; which is available via the HSE.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre of the HSE provides a Fact Sheet &ldquo;Recommendations for Care of Patients colonised with MRSA in Schools&rdquo; on its website www.hpsc.ie.</P>
        <P>C. difficile should not be an issue in schools, as schools do not have the antibiotic pressure and other risk factors present in hospitals and long term care facilities. If a school student were <Col N="376"/>to have a C. difficile infection, the same standard advice would apply as for any other type of gastroenteritis (i.e. stay out of school until asymptomatic, and attention to basic hygiene measures such as hand washing).  For someone being cared for at home with a C. difficile infection, there are specific recommendations included in the national C. difficile guidelines on www.hpsc.ie/Publications.</P>

        <P>In addition to the Play Policy, Teenspace National Recreation Policy for Young People was launched in September 2007. The policy provides a strategic framework for the promotion of positive recreational opportunities aimed principally at young people aged 12 to 18.  The policy adopts an evidence-based approach and makes proposals to address issues which emerged from a public consultation process which was undertaken by my Office and was also informed through the findings of independent research commissioned by my Office.</P>
        <P>While the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has an overall role in supporting implementation of the play and recreation policies, actions fall to be implemented by  a wide range of government departments and agencies. The Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Department of Sports, Arts and Tourism and the Department of Community Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs all have schemes and programmes which support the development of appropriate facilities. Other Departments and Agencies have schemes and programmes which also contribute to overall development of recreational opportunities more generally.</P>
        <P>In terms of the planning process for improved play and recreational facilities, the Planning and Development Act 2000 makes a number of provisions aimed at embedding improved planning of social and community and cultural requirements for communities. The Act also expressly supports the provision, or facilitation of the provision, of services for the community including, in particular, schools, cr&egrave;ches and other education and childcare facilities. Community facilities falling within this mandatory objective can include facilities for children&rsquo;s play including playgrounds, skateboard parks and other facilities, libraries and community halls.  Development contributions can also be sought by planning authorities to help pay for facilities servicing new developments such as community and other recreational amenities.  Section 48 allows for open spaces and recreational and community facilities and amenities to be provided under a development contribution scheme.</P>
        <P>Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Development Plans, published in June 2007, emphasise the objectives for the provision of public open space and recreation space, including space and places for children to play, and the preservation, improvement and extension of amenities and recreational amenities.   While is ultimately a matter for the members of the local authority, as planning authority in their area, to determine the level of contribution and the types of development to which the scheme will apply, the emphasis on improved planning and provision is embedded in the development process.</P>
        <P>Under the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. Through the Sports Capital Programme <Col N="378"/>Government has invested considerable sums into important sporting infrastructure with allocations made of over &euro;725 million in more than 7,340 separate sports projects since 1998.  This investment has transformed the Irish sporting landscape with improved facilities in virtually every village, town and community in the country. Some Sports Capital Programme allocations have been made to assist grantees, in particular Local Authorities, in the provision of public play and recreation areas such as multi-use games areas and skate parks.</P>
        <P>It terms of children specific projects, the Department of Community Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the HSE have co-funded the development of new playgrounds or refurbishment of existing playgrounds in RAPID areas since 2004. The 2008 Scheme has made &euro;3m available for the development of playgrounds.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government have also provided Playground Grants and Skateboard Grants Schemes between 2004 and 2006. A Primary School Outdoor Facilities Enhancement Scheme was also funded under CL&Aacute;R programme in 2004/5. Since the publication of the Play Policy, over &euro;28m has been allocated to the provision of play facilities which has resulted in the development of an additional 300 play facilities throughout the country.  In addition to the development of these play facilities, up to &euro;1 million has been allocated, via dormant accounts funding, for a Playbus Scheme.  This measure is intended to provide interventions that support the family unit, by providing play development and parenting development outreach services to children and their parents, experiencing social exclusion in disadvantaged and isolated areas. Applications under this scheme are currently being processed.  My Office is also actively working on the development of a youth caf&eacute; programme as set out in the Programme for Government. The National Children&rsquo;s Advisory Council has reported recently to me on this matter and further work is underway to bring a more strategic approach to existing funding arrangements, clearer standards and criteria  for the development of new caf&eacute;s.</P>
        <P>My Office is continuing to monitor, promote and support the development of play and recreational opportunities for children and young people with this wide range of stakeholders.</P>

	<P>Last June I approved National Quality Assurance Standards for Symptomatic Breast Disease Services under the Health Act 2007. The Standards were subsequently published by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA).  In September 2007, the Authority announced that it would carry out a national quality review of symptomatic breast disease services against the standards. HIQA has informed my Department that the objectives of the national quality review of symptomatic breast disease services are to: Assess current services against the standards with a view to highlighting key issues that need to be addressed in advance of transition to ensure patients are treated appropriately and safely; review the transition process to ensure key risk areas are identified and managed as services change; and identify where services are meeting the standards and highlighting good practice to be built on for the future. </P>
        <P>The review is in two phases with an initial self assessment undertaken by the service providers themselves. Designated cancer centres are then subject to an on-site validation visit.  It is important to note that while non-designated centres undertook self-assessments, the questions under relevant sections differed from those used with designated centres as appropriate.  The self-assessment process does not result in a single, aggregate score.</P>
        <P>Specifically in relation to South Infirmary, no audit has been undertaken.  South Infirmary undertook a self-assessment, the results of which have not been validated. As a matter of course, the Authority does not publish information which has not been validated.</P>
        <P>The process of on-site follow-ups with designated centres has just begun and will continue for the remainder of 2008 and into 2009.  This process is part of a longer-term programme which will help provide assurance that the Standards are being met.</P>

	<P>Health care associated infections (HCAIs) are not new. For centuries they have been a side effect of medical treatment, especially in hospitals. There are a number of types of HCAIs, MRSA and C. difficile are the most widely publicised. The more medical care a person requires, the more likely they are to develop a health care associated infection. These infections are more common among people with serious illnesses or at high risk such as patients with a weakened immune system, patients who have been treated for leukaemia or cancer, or who have had an organ transplant.  Tackling HCAIs continues to be a challenge for all healthcare systems.  Ireland is not unique in this regard and tackling HCAIs continues to be a priority for the Government and the Health Service Executive.</P><Col N="380"/>
        <P>The State Claims Agency (SCA) has indicated a worst case scenario of costs in the region of &euro;300m to &euro;500m spread over a ten to fifteen year period.  There are 102 hospital-acquired infections claims.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Dialysis units seek to facilitate holiday dialysis patients from other jurisdictions where possible.  Priority is given to those travelling for family occasions. </P>
        <P>Under EU regulations people requiring certain specialised treatments, including dialysis, may access such care under EU arrangements while on a temporary stay in another Member State.</P>
        <P>The European Health Insurance Card [EHIC] is issued under the provisions of Regulation (EC) 1408/71 and ensures that a person who is eligible for public healthcare in one EU Member State can access necessary public healthcare in another Member State while on a temporary stay there.  These arrangements also apply in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.</P>
        <P>The service is provided on the basis that prior agreements are entered into with regard to the availability of the particular service. The arrangement is made in advance between the patient&rsquo;s unit and the proposed holiday destination.   It should be noted that the EHIC Card does not cover the cost of treatment in a private setting, nor does it cover individuals travelling from countries outside the EU.  Such patients need to arrange with their health insurer to have the necessary treatment made available and to contract directly with the private sector.</P>

	<P>Discussions have taken place between my Department, the Health Service Executive and the Department of Finance on the HSE&rsquo;s Capital Plan.  The Capital Plan includes provision for the development of the National Paediatric Hospital and the associated Ambulatory and Urgent Care Centre at Tallaght.</P>
        <P>The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was established in May 2007.  Its primary function is to plan, design, furnish and equip the new paediatric hospital.  The HSE is working closely with the Board in progressing the project.</P>
        <P>The project is currently at initiation stage. A detailed Development Brief for the new hospital is being prepared and is due for completion by the end of the 1st Quarter 2009.  The Development Brief will be converted into a detailed design, outlining the exact dimensions and specifications for the new hospital, to allow the project proceed to tender for construction.</P>
        <P>The Development Brief for the National Paediatric Hospital will be informed by the work undertaken last year for the HSE by RKW, a UK-based healthcare planning company. RKW recommended that an Ambulatory and Urgent Care service be established and operated by the new hospital.  They recommended that the first off-site Ambulatory and Urgent Care Centre (A/UCC) be developed as a pilot project at Tallaght Hospital and offer a range of services including urgent care consultations, outpatient services and day surgery.</P>
        <P>RKW advised that a second A/UCC could be developed at Blanchardstown once the initial model has been evaluated and should be timed to introduce additional capacity at the point when it is required to meet projected growth in population demand. They also identified potential for consultant led paediatric outpatient services at Loughlinstown and advised that consideration be given to establishing a nurse led minor injury service. The Loughlinstown service model would be informed by the experience of the earlier centres.</P>

	<P>In February 2007, the Government approved grants under Transport 21 amounting to &euro;86 million, consisting of &euro;39 million under Measure 1 (90% funding), for safety/security projects, and &euro;47 million under Measure 2 (75% funding), for developmental projects at the six regional airports in the period up to the end of 2010.  Total grant payments so far, at just under &euro;6 million, reflect the fact that in most cases, major projects such as terminal, apron and runway works were at the preliminary stages.  The level and phasing of investment in the regional airports is currently being examined by my Department as part of an overall review of Capital Programme.  In the meantime, the regional airports have been informed that Exchequer Capital Funding will be restricted to current contractual commitments in 2008 and 2009.

	<P>Transport 21, the largest investment package ever in Ireland&rsquo;s transport infrastructure, is making a significant contribution to the ongoing development of Ireland&rsquo;s tourism industry. By improving and transforming transport links all around the country it gives visitors to Ireland greater options when it comes to travelling between our cities and accessing rural locations.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is in the process of introducing new Intercity railcars across the network, bringing a new standard of comfort and quality to train travel.  As part of a comprehensive package of investment in the bus network, Transport 21 is funding 239 new vehicles for Bus &Eacute;ireann.</P>

Transport 21 is also investing in the national roads network, with one of the five major inter-urban motorways (the M1) already completed, and the other four on target for completion in 2010.</P>

	<P>It is unclear if the Deputy is referring to any one particular occurrence relating to aircraft noise, or a series of occurrences.  The Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) has advised me that it has a noise and flight track monitoring system in place which allows them to monitor the track flown and noise generated by each and every aircraft arriving at and/or departing the airport.  This tracks deviations from environmental air corridors which were agreed by the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA), Dublin Airport and the airlines based at the Airport, defining the airspace in the runway approaches where most aircraft are required to operate. These corridors were designed to minimise disturbance in neighbouring communities.  Of course there may be occasions when Air Traffic Control may be required to route an aircraft outside these environmental air corridors.  To assist the DAA with deviations from the environmental corridors and general noise complaints a free phone aircraft disturbance line has been in operation for some time now &mdash; 1 800 200 034.   I am advised by the DAA that every complaint regarding aircraft noise is logged, investigated and personally responded to.</P>

	<P>Measures to strengthen enforcement against illegal use of the parking permits were provided in changes to the Road Traffic Acts between 2004 and 2007.  However, I am aware that a number of organisations are of the view that the present permit scheme is being abused or misused in various ways.  A review of the disabled persons&rsquo; parking scheme is underway in my Department, and the outcome will determine if any legislative amendments are required. </P>

	<P>It is a requirement for the registration and entry into service of new motor vehicles in the European Union that they have type-approval in accordance with Directive 70/157/EEC as amended, which sets down the permissible sound levels and exhaust systems for motor vehicles.  Vehicle in-service standards are specified in the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 which require vehicles to be fitted with a silencer or other device to reduce to a reasonable level the noise caused by the escape of exhaust gases from the engine.  Article 85 of these Regulations prohibits the use in a public place of a vehicle which causes excessive noise.  Under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 (Conferral of Functions) Order 2006 (S.I. No 477 of 2006) the Road Safety Authority is responsible for vehicle standards.  </P>

	<P>I recognise that current trends in travel and transport are unsustainable.  The Government&rsquo;s vision is for a sustainable transport system by 2020 and that to achieve this vision, there will need to be a significant modal shift away from the private car towards public transport, cycling and walking.  It is my intention to publish, before the end of the year, a Sustainable Travel and Transport Action Plan to achieve the Government&rsquo;s vision.</P>
        <P>It is important to make progress towards the required modal shift in advance of the publication of the Sustainable Travel and Transport Action Plan.  Accordingly, my Department supports a range of measures in this regard including: Transport 21, which provides for the development of more efficient and integrated transport systems involving, in particular, the enhancement of public transport services by the expansion of the rail and Luas networks and the provision of additional bus capacity; continued subvention of public transport services; a Greenschool&rsquo;s Travel Module aimed at over 260,000 schoolchildren over the next 5 years; the DTO&rsquo;s One Small Step Campaign and as part of that implementation of a workplace travel plan for my Department, and work towards the development of a National Cycling Policy.</P>

	<P>As I have indicated previously I am satisfied that the data on both the driver and vehicle records is accurate and fit for purpose. This is supported by the relatively small number of returned non-deliveries of driving licence and motor tax renewal reminders which are generated from NVDF data and issued each month to drivers and vehicle owners  whose licences are about to expire.</P>
        <P>To further improve data accuracy in relation to motor vehicle ownership, we extended our online services in June last to enable approved motor dealers notify the NVDF system about <Col N="393"/>the purchase and sale of vehicles over the internet. Where this facility is used the new ownership particulars are recorded on the NVDF system within 24 hours of the dealer notifying the change. Returns show that the system is operating very well and at this relatively early stage some 20% of overall change of ownership notices are notified through this channel.  Nearly 250 motor dealers are now using the facility and it is estimated that they account for about 40% of transactions which involve motor dealers. The website www.motortrans.ie provides the facility for dealers to apply to use the facility.</P>
        <P>There are also arrangements in place with the operators of the dedicated website www.newaddress.ie  whereby changes of address for driving licence and motor tax purposes notified to the NVDF through that channel and a significant number of changes are captured in that way.</P>

	<P>The provision and improvement of regional and local roads in their areas is a matter for local authorities to be funded from their own resources supplemented by State grants. </P>
        <P>Road grants for regional and local roads are allocated annually under a number of grant categories.  The level of grants allocated to individual authorities is determined each year having regard to a number of factors including the total funds available in a particular year, eligibility criteria for the different grant schemes, road pavement conditions, length of road network, the need to prioritise projects and competing demands from other local authorities. In determining the annual regional and local road grant allocations, the overall objective is to resource each local authority appropriately in relation to their ongoing and specific needs.</P>
        <P>Road grants for 2009 will be allocated early in the New Year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 689 and 714 together.</P>
        <P>The RPA continues to make good progress in the PPP tender process for Metro North and it has not been stalled.  The initial phase of the PPP public procurement process was conducted in 2007 resulting in the formation of four pre-qualified consortia for the purpose of tendering for the project. Tender documentation was formally issued to the four pre-qualified consortia on 12th May 2008.  Since then the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) has held a number of meetings with the consortia.   Following on from a request from some of the consortia, the RPA recently agreed to extend the closing date for submission of tenders by two months.  Receipt of tenders is now required by 6 February 2009.</P>
        <P>In addition, good progress is being made in the planning process.  The RPA placed copies of the Railway Order application on display on 17 September in accordance with the 6 week statutory public notice requirement pursuant to section 37 of the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001.</P>
        <P>In January 2008, the Government approved the funding structure for the Metro North PPP, including an Exchequer provision for advance works ahead of the main PPP contract and a capital contribution during construction.  In accordance with the requirements of the Government decision on the Transport 21 Investment Framework, Metro North will be submitted to Government for a final decision on the project on the completion of the tender process.  There has been no change in the Government position in this regard.</P>

	<P>The National Development Plan 2007-2013 provides for a comprehensive study of the role of Dublin Port taking into account locational considerations in the context of overall ports policy on the island <Col N="399"/>of Ireland, wider transport policy, urban development policy, the National Spatial Strategy and national economic policy.  My Department is responsible for this study, which is currently underway and is expected to be completed in early 2009.</P>
        <P>The Dublin Bay Task Force was established recently by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government under the chairmanship of the Dublin Regional Authority. It will look at the Bay area as a whole and examine a wide range of issues that may impact on the future potential of the Dublin Bay area. Its main task is to prepare a draft Master Plan for Dublin Bay for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who may be expected subsequently to bring a report to Government on the matter.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s study of Dublin Port will be completed in advance of any final recommendations from the Task Force. It has been agreed that the Task Force will take full account of the Dublin Port Study findings in reaching its own recommendations.</P>

        <P>There are ten remaining regional harbours under my Department&rsquo;s aegis, operating under the provisions of the Harbours Act 1946, while ten commercial port companies operate under the provisions of the Harbours Acts 1996 to 2005.</P>
        <P>Government policy, as outlined in the Ports Policy Statement published in 2005, is that the remaining harbours operating under the Harbours Act 1946, be transferred, by ministerial order under section 88(2) of the Harbours Act 1996, to local control in cases where there is little or no commercial traffic. This is the case in relation to Arklow Harbour, which now has little or no commercial traffic.</P>
        <P>The Policy Statement highlighted that the continued operation of the regional harbours under the outdated provisions of the Harbours Act 1946 is unsustainable on the grounds of good governance and reiterated the view that most of these harbours would best achieve their potential through their transfer to local authority ownership.</P>

My Department approved funding of &euro;10.36 million towards the cost of this project which is due to be completed in 2011. I understand that Dublin Bus, building on the AVLS, is considering the installation of real time passenger information displays at bus stops. The position in relation to Bus &Eacute;ireann is that they have completed the installation of Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) equipment on its fleet and are providing Real Time Passenger Information on their web site, on a limited trial basis, as well as having it available on mobile phones, and that a real time &lsquo;Arrivals Screen&rsquo; has been installed in the main bus depot in Dublin.</P>

	<P>Earlier this year, I mandated the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) to proceed with planning the delivery of Line BX/D, based on the Agency&rsquo;s preferred route for Line BX and the use of the Old Broadstone railway alignment for Line D.</P>
        <P>The RPA is now progressing with detailed planning to implement this decision on the basis that it is its intention to make a single railway order application for the combined Line BX/D to An B&oacute;rd Plean&aacute;la in the latter part of next year.  The detailed planning includes the development of a construction strategy, which takes cognisance of the works in the city centre required for Metro North.  It is not possible to construct Metro North and Luas Line Bx/D simultaneously, in light of the traffic management consequences in the city centre.</P>
        <P>The time scale for the project will be critically dependant on the outcome of the construction strategy being developed between the RPA and Dublin City Council. The RPA and City Council are engaging with key stakeholders, including Dublin Bus, in the development of the construction strategy for Luas Line Bx/D.</P>

	<P>I am informed that the Commission for Taxi Regulation published new National Vehicle Standards &mdash; Requirements for Small Public Service Vehicles in November 2007, which include new accessible vehicle standards for licensing as wheelchair accessible taxis and wheelchair accessible hackneys.  The Commission is proposing that transitional periods will apply to the new standards in the interest of business planning for service providers.  The new vehicle standards will be given a statutory basis through revised regulations to be made by the Commission for Taxi Regulation under the Taxi Regulation Act 2003.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that the new requirements for wheelchair accessible taxis and wheelchair accessible hackneys will apply to existing vehicle licences from 2012.  It is a requirement on the holders of wheelchair accessible small public service vehicle licences to register their contact details with the Commission and to keep records relating to bookings.  New regulations have also been made in relation to the licensing of dispatch operators which will come into operation on 1 September 2009.</P><Col N="409"/>
        <P>Separately, my Department has been in discussion with the Commission in relation to a possible arrangement to assist taxi and hackney operators with the purchase of wheelchair accessible vehicles that will meet the new accessible vehicle specification developed by the Commission.

	<P>The European Transport Safety Council (ETSC) publication highlights just how at risk older road users are as a result of road collisions across Europe as a whole. However, the report from the ETSC is based on the ten years 1997 &mdash; 2006 and does not reflect the significant improvement in Ireland&rsquo;s road safety performance in 2007 and to date in 2008.</P>
        <P>Ireland has now entered the top ten EU best performing countries in terms of road deaths.  Implementation of the Road Safety Strategy 2007-2012 will ensure that Ireland reduces the death and serious injury rates on its roads even further, across all high risk and vulnerable groups.</P>

	<P>Recent developments, especially with regard to fuel prices increases and other world economic changes, present the aviation industry, including Aer Lingus, with significant challenges.</P>
        <P>It is very much in Ireland&rsquo;s interest that Aer Lingus remains a strong competitive provider of air services to and from Ireland.   However, it is an independent company and has to make decisions on a commercial basis taking account of the current operating environment.   The company has publicly indicated that it is undertaking a root-and-branch review of its entire cost base in an effort to further reduce costs and remain competitive.  I await the outcome of the current discussions between Aer Lingus and the Shannon Airport Authority regarding transatlantic services operating from Shannon.</P>
        <P>In January last, in conjunction with the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, I published the Economic and Tourism Development Plan for the Shannon catchment area.  The purpose of the Plan is to assist the region in responding to the challenges and opportunities emerging in the context of full liberalisation of the transatlantic aviation market and the phasing out of the Shannon stop under the Open Skies agreement.  An important element of the Action Plan is a new tourism-marketing initiative for the area, which is being implemented by Tourism Ireland in close consultation with key tourism industry interests in the area, Shannon Development and the F&aacute;ilte Ireland Regions.</P>
        <P>In addition, as I have indicated in response to Question No. 708 from the Deputy, I am currently seeking to finalise an Inter-Governmental Agreement with the USA on the introduction of full pre-clearance facilities at Shannon and Dublin Airports.</P>

Judicial Review proceedings were initiated by the applicant challenging the Deportation Order on 1 March 2005. The matter is therefore sub judice and I do not propose to comment further.</P>
        <P>The person concerned also submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I.

She was informed on 19 October 2006 that her application was invalid as the Deportation Order had been made in respect of her prior to the <Col N="413"/>coming into force of the Regulation on 10 October 2006.  Judicial Review proceedings challenging this decision were instituted on 9 November 2006.</P>
        <P>These Judicial Review proceedings were settled following the judgement of Mr Justice Feeney in the cases of Hila &amp; Djolo, where he determined that under Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I No. 518 of 2006) that I have discretion to accept and consider applications for Subsidiary Protection from persons who do not have an automatic right to apply but who have identified new facts or circumstances which demonstrate a change of position from that which pertained at the time the Deportation Order was made.</P>
        <P>Subsequently the person concerned submitted an application pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I No. 518 of 2006) on 26 November 2007, requesting that I exercise discretion to accept and consider an application for Subsidiary Protection. Following a consideration of the material submitted it was concluded that the applicant had established no grounds which would enable me to exercise discretion under Regulation 4(2). The person was notified of my decision on 18 March 2008. Judicial Review proceedings were issued on 11 April 2008 challenging this decision.

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 24 April 2001.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 22 May 2003, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations were received on his behalf.  Following consideration of his case, under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, a Deportation Order was signed in respect of the person concerned on 12 March 2004.  Notice of this Order was served, by registered letter dated 20 April 2004, requiring the person concerned to present himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on 29 April 2004 in order to make travel arrangements for his deportation from the State.</P>
        <P>The person concerned subsequently lodged a request under Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006) seeking permission to make an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with those Regulations. This request was approved following which the person concerned formally applied for Subsidiary Protection in the State. This application is under consideration at present. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome. While the Deportation Order remains in place, the person concerned may be assured that this Order will not be effected pending the determination of the Subsidiary Protection application.</P>

        <P el="5">2005: &euro;101,970</P>
      <P el="5">2006: &euro;120,250</P>
       <P el="5">2007: &euro;106,126</P>
        <P FLI="0">Costs associated with policing duties performed by Garda&iacute; outside of these events, such as traffic control, beat patrols and other policing duties are paid from public funds.  Details of the overall costs associated with each individual non-public duty event and scheduled costs for individual events in 2008 are not readily available. However I am advised by the Garda authorities that based on previous costings and research undertaken it is estimated that the contribution of the event organiser covers approximately 40% of the overall costs incurred on average.</P>
        <P>I can also inform the Deputy that a detailed analysis and review of the procedures and costs associated with policing non-public duty events is currently being undertaken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a view to introducing a new system of charging for the provision of these services.</P>

	<P>In so far as the question refers to the provisions of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008, the position is that the Garda Commissioner was consulted fully during the preparation of the legislation and was supportive of its contents.

	<P>The trading hours of licensed premises, including nightclubs, are a public policy matter for individual EU Member States to determine and are generally a reflection of unique historical, social and cultural factors. In setting closing times, Member States may, in particular, have regard to factors such as local alcohol consumption patterns and levels of alcohol-related harm as well as public policy objectives such as promoting public health and maintaining public order.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the number of Community Garda&iacute; attached to each Garda Station in the Dublin Metropolitan Region as at 31 December 2003 &mdash; 2007 and as of 31 August 2008, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was as set out in the attached table.</P>
        <P>It is of course the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises.  In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and I agree with the view of the Garda Inspectorate, expressed in its most recent report, that community policing is a fundamental policing philosophy and that there is a strong foundation for it in Ireland.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Long Term Residency is an administrative scheme introduced in May 2004 and is focused on persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions.  Such persons may apply to my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.</P>
        <P>The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.</P>

        <P>While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.</P>
        <P>An application for long term residency from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in October 2007. I understand that applications received in January 2007 are currently being dealt with. As soon as a decision is made on the case, the person concerned will be notified.</P>

	<P>Currently, the Road Traffic Acts provide that a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may, where he or she is of the opinion that a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place is under the influence of a drug or drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of that vehicle, require that person to go to a Garda station and further require that person submit to a blood test or to provide a urine sample. </P>

        <P>Enforcement of the law on drug driving is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When a member of the Garda&iacute; suspects that a motorist is driving under the influence of any intoxicant the Garda may arrest the suspect under Section 49 of the Road Traffic Act 1961.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, section 38 of the Road Traffic Act 1968, as amended by Section 6 of the Road Traffic Act 1994, provides a statutory power to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety for the supply and testing of apparatus for indicating the presence of alcohol in the breath.</P>
        <P>Section 12 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 (as amended) and section 4 of the Road Traffic Act 2006 (as amended) also provide the powers to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to require <Col N="424"/>drivers to provide preliminary breath specimens for the purpose of indicating the presence of alcohol in the breath.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, as provided for in the Guidelines for Prosecutors published by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in October, 2007, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has made a number of commitments to the victims of crime.</P>
        <P>These include ensuring that the victim is kept informed about the progress of the investigation, including whether a suspect is charged or cautioned; to tell the victim whether the accused is in custody or on bail and the conditions attached to the bail; to inform the victim of the time, date and location of the court hearing of the charges against the accused; to explain the prosecution process involved and, if the victim is likely to be called as a witness, to provide information as to the help available for victims attending court; to explain the circumstances where a judge may ask for a Victim Impact Statement and arrange for its completion; to inform the victim of the final outcome of the trial and, in cases involving serious trauma to a victim or family, to inform the victim of the imminent release of the offender, when An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been notified of such a release.</P>
        <P>The Garda Charter for Victims of Crime has been updated, to take into account victim support expectations and developments in victim support services and networks.</P>
        <P>The revised Charter sets out the services and service delivery standards which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to delivering to victims of crime and includes the automatic provision of information available regarding the National Crime Victims&rsquo; helpline and other services available locally for victims of crime.</P>
        <P>In cases where serious criminal incidents have occurred, including incidents of homicide, kidnapping / false imprisonment, hostage / siege situations, incidents involving violence or immediate threat of violence to the person, suicide, or fatal road traffic collisions, the District Officer appoints a Family Liaison Officer to liaise with the victim and the family and to keep them informed of progress in the ongoing investigation and to ensure that they are afforded appropriate and practical support.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that senior Garda management is satisfied that adequate provisions are in place to ensure that victims of crime are advised of developments in ongoing investigations.</P>

An intoxicant includes alcohol or drugs or any combination of drugs or of drugs and alcohol.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 14 of the Road Traffic Act 1995 also provides that, where a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is of the opinion that a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle is under the influence of a drug or drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle, he may require the person to accompany him to the station to provide a blood/urine specimen.

The length of such investigation will vary from case to case, depending on the particular circumstances of the case, including the nature of the injuries and the number of witnesses.  Following the taking of a decision to institute criminal proceedings in a particular case, factors such as whether the case is proceeding by way of charge or summons and whether the case is being tried summarily or on indictment will impact on the timeframe for the commencement of the trial.</P>

	<P>In the current economic climate, it is incumbent on the State to ensure that the citizen is provided with services that give value for money and that are effective and efficient. This is particularly the case in relation to the large number of non-commercial State agencies now in existence.</P>
        <P>In the context of the ongoing expenditure reviews and the 2009 estimates process, all Departments are looking at the possibility to rationalise their non-commercial agencies in order to deliver savings in 2009.</P>
        <P>It is equally important to ensure that agency functions do not overlap, that there is effective and ongoing communication between these bodies and that the opportunity for synergies, including the sharing of corporate service functions, are availed of to the fullest degree possible.  Moreover the Government is anxious to ensure that in delivering public services, state agencies avoid the risk of confusing customers by overlap of functions or roles.</P>
        <P>The bodies mentioned by the Deputy are included in that analysis and will be subject to critical evaluation based on these principles. However, I can assure the Deputy that any solution arrived at will  in no way dilute the level of services provided to the public in the areas of human rights, equality and data protection.</P>

In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.   </P>

	<P>I assume the information sought by the Deputy refers to cases before the Courts under section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.</P>
        <P>According to figures made available to me from the Courts Service, returns for the Circuit Court for 2007 and 2006 show the following in relation to Section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.</P>
        <P>In 2006 there were 83 convictions and in 9 cases a sentence of 10 years or more was imposed and in 2007 there were 99 convictions and in 22 cases a sentence of 10 years or more was imposed.</P><Col N="430"/>
        <P>Section 27 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 (as amended by the Criminal Justice Acts 1999 and 2006), provides for mandatory minimum sentence of not less than 10 years imprisonment for individuals convicted of a first offence under section 15A (possession of drugs with a value of at least &euro;13,000 for sale or supply) or 15B (importation of drugs with a value of at least &euro;13,000) of that Act.</P>
        <P>The mandatory minimum sentence, or to give it its more correct name, presumptive minimum sentence, is to be imposed in all cases save for those with very specific and exceptional mitigating factors.</P>
        <P>Where an individual is convicted of a second or subsequent office under sections 15A and/or 15B a court has no discretion and must always impose a sentence of not less than the mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years.  The maximum sentence available for section 15A and 15B offences is life imprisonment.</P>
        <P>Having regard to concern about the degree to which the presumptive minimum sentence was being imposed, notwithstanding the amendments introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2006, section 33 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 further amended section 27 of the 1977 Act  in order to insert an interpretation clause.</P>
        <P>The provision emphasises that a decision to depart from the presumptive minimum sentence must be based on the presence of individual and extraordinary reasons as to why the interest of justice would not be served by imposition of a sentence of not less than 10 years.</P>
        <P>Referring to the damaging effects of drug related crime on Irish society the provision states that a court must, as a general principle, always impose the mandatory minimum sentence on persons convicted of an offence under sections 15A and 15B.</P>
        <P>It is too early at this stage to come to any conclusions as to the impact of the provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Acts 2006 and 2007 which deal with this matter.</P>

The significant successes that the Bureau continues to achieve by its operations demonstrates the effectiveness of its approach in pursuing illegally gotten gains. </P>
        <P>The manner in which the Bureau operates has, in the eleven-year period of its existence, come to be viewed, both domestically and internationally, as a very successful model for targeting persons seeking to derive profits from criminal activities.</P>
        <P>Details of the activities of the Criminal Assets Bureau since its establishment in 1996 are contained in the Annual Reports of the Bureau which are submitted to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The most recently published report is for the year 2006.</P>
        <P>These reports are quite comprehensive and include details of the number of cases commenced, assets frozen and monies returned to the Exchequer under the Proceeds of Crime Acts, 1996 and 2005, and monies collected under the Revenue and Social Welfare Acts. Copies of the reports are available in the Oireachtas library.</P>
        <P>All funds collected by the Criminal Assets Bureau are forwarded, either directly or through the Revenue Commissioners/Department of Social and Family Affairs, to the Central Exchequer Fund under the remit of the Department of Finance and are allocated accordingly as approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann through the normal Estimates process.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following table identifies the value of assets secured/restrained/frozen under Section 2 Interim Orders, Section 3 Interlocutory Orders and Section 16(b) Corrupt Enrichment Orders of the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996 and 2005 (as <Col N="433"/>amended) unti 31 December, 2007.  Figures in relation to 2008 will be included in the CAB Annual Report for that year.</P>

        <P>As regards structural separation, I indicated when introducing the Bill that I would be prepared to postpone implementation of section 9 if agreement could be reached with the mixed trading sector on a voluntary Code of Practice which would achieve the objectives of structural separation and on condition that compliance would be subject to independent audit and verification.  Consultations between my Department and the sector are at an advanced stage and I am hopeful that agreement can be reached on the content of the Code in the near future.</P>
        <P>As regards test purchasing, the position is that section 14 provides for guidelines in respect of necessary procedures to be drawn up following consultation with the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Health and Children.  A Working Group involving my Department and representatives of the Department of Health and Children and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are developing these guidelines.</P>

I would advise that the person concerned should apply for a transfer via her Prison Governor in the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>The Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons requires extensive documentation to be exchanged between both jurisdictions in order to allow an application to be fully considered.  A three way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place, i.e., from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned.  On receipt of those consents (assuming they will be forthcoming), an application must then be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and their continued detention here.</P>

She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of deportation orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she and her child should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I.

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 18 June 2003 on foot of a Work Permit, valid from 12 May 2003 to 11 May 2004.  This Work Permit was not subsequently renewed.  The person concerned then applied for asylum, on 6 April 2005.  Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 12 February 2008, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European <Col N="440"/>Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).  The person concerned did not submit an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State. Neither did she submit representations in support of an application to be allowed to remain temporarily in the State at that time.  Following consideration of her case, under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, a Deportation Order was signed in respect of the person concerned on 9 July 2008.  Notice of this Order was served by registered letter dated 24 July 2008 requiring the person concerned to present herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on 12 August 2008 in order to make travel arrangements for her deportation from the State.</P>
        <P>On 1 August 2008 the legal representative of the person concerned advised my Department that they had, on their client&rsquo;s behalf, lodged an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State and had also lodged representations in support of an application for leave to remain in the State. They contended that these applications did not appear to have been considered by the Minister when making his decision to sign the Deportation Order.  Arising from this claim, they were seeking an undertaking that the Deportation Order not be enforced pending the consideration of such documentation. In response, my Department advised the legal representative of the person concerned that there was no record of an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State having been received or of representations having been submitted in support of an application for leave to remain in the State. However, as an exceptional measure, my Department agreed to allow a further period of ten working days within which such documentation could be lodged. This position was made known by my Department&rsquo;s letter dated  5 August 2008.</P>
        <P>An application for Subsidiary Protection in the State and representations in support of an application for leave to remain in the State have since been submitted on behalf of the person concerned. Given that the person concerned is the subject of a Deportation Order, the application for Subsidiary Protection in the State is deemed to be an application under Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 i.e. a formal request that the Minister exercise his discretion to facilitate the consideration of an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State. This request is under consideration at present. When a decision on this request has been made, this will be notified in writing to the person concerned and her legal representative. In the event that the Regulation 4 (2) request is approved, my Department will then proceed to consider the substantive application for Subsidiary Protection in the State.</P>
        <P>Additionally, in light of the status of the person concerned as a person subject to a Deportation Order, the representations lodged in support of an application for leave to remain in the State will be treated as an application to have the Deportation Order revoked, pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended).  This application will be considered after the Subsidiary Protection issues referred to earlier have been dealt with.</P>
        <P>Pending the consideration of the Subsidiary Protection issues and the Section 3 (11) application, the existing Deportation Order will not be enforced.</P>

	<P>The first named person applied for asylum on 11 April 2006. His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 30 November 2007, that the Minister proposed <Col N="444"/>to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).  The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and, following consideration of this application, it was determined that the person concerned was not eligible for Subsidiary Protection in the State.  The person concerned was notified of this decision by letter dated 3 June 2008.</P>
        <P>Representations in support of an application for leave to remain in the State have been submitted on behalf of the first named person and these will be fully considered before the file is passed to me for decision.</P>
        <P>The second named person concerned has been granted permission to remain in the State under the IBC/05 Scheme. This permission was for an initial two year period and was later extended for a further three years, to 6 July 2010.  She is the mother of the third named person concerned who is an Irish citizen.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Question No. 829 of Thursday 10 July 2008 and the written Reply to that Question.</P>
        <P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 23 December 2006 and applied for asylum on 6 June 2007.  Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 12 March 2008, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).  The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and, following consideration of this application, it was determined that the person concerned was not eligible for Subsidiary Protection in the State.  The person concerned was notified of this decision by letter dated 1 July 2008.</P>
        <P>Her case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations submitted on her behalf for permission to remain in the State. On 14 August 2008 I refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and accordingly signed a Deportation Order in respect of her. Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to present herself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on 12 November 2008 in order to make travel arrangements for her deportation from the State. However, in consultation with my officials, I have decided to allow the person concerned to remain in the State until her Leaving Certificate examinations have concluded in 2009.  My officials have informed the GNIB of my decision in this matter and the Bureau has agreed to postpone the enforcement of the Deportation Order will be postponed for the period specified.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Question No. 217 of Thursday, 3 July 2008 and the written Reply to that Question.</P>
        <P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 14 June 2007 and applied for asylum.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner. The determination of the Refugee Applications Commissioner was conveyed in writing to the person concerned by letter dated 23 January 2008. This communication advised the person concerned of his entitlement, within a stated timeframe, to appeal this determination to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal but the person concerned chose not to do so.</P>
        <P>On 12 March 2008, the person concerned formally withdrew from the asylum process and indicated a wish to return voluntarily to his country of origin, following which contact was <Col N="455"/>established with the Office of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) with a view to the necessary voluntary return arrangements being made. However, despite my Department and the IOM approving the voluntary return request of the person concerned, the IOM advised my Department, by a communication dated 23 June 2008, that it had lost contact with the person concerned and, as such, it could not proceed with his voluntary return arrangement. The person concerned should note that this option remains open to him should he decide to pursue same.</P>
        <P>Based on the recommendation of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the voluntary withdrawal of the person concerned from the asylum process, and in accordance with the appropriate provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) and the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 28 March 2008, that the Minister was refusing him a declaration of refugee status and also proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him. In line with legal and procedural requirements, the person concerned was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006). On 7 April 2007, an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State was received from the person concerned as was an application for leave to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
        <P>The Subsidiary Protection application will be considered first. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>
        <P>In the event that the Subsidiary Protection application is refused, the case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, is passed to me for decision.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 19 July 2003 and applied for asylum on 21 July 2003.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 11 November 2004, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
        <P>His case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement.  Consideration was given to representations submitted on his behalf for permission to remain in the State. On 11 March 2005, one of my predecessors refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of him. Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to present himself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on 14 April 2005 in order to make travel arrangements for his deportation from the State. The person concerned failed to present himself as required and was classified as evading his deportation.</P>
        <P>On 19 April 2005, the person concerned applied for asylum in the U.K. Following a finger prints check it was established that Ireland was the appropriate State to process the application as the person concerned had previously lodged an asylum claim here on 21 July 2003. Following receipt of a request from the U.K. Authorities, Ireland agreed to the return of the person <Col N="457"/>concerned.  Arrangements were then made by the U.K. Authorities to return the person concerned to the State on 27 June 2005. On arrival in the State he was detained by the GNIB and lodged in Cloverhill Prison.</P>
        <P>By letter dated 19 February 2007, the legal representative of the person concerned lodged:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="is0p4" />(i) <Miles com="ix" />a request for revocation of the Deportation Order pursuant to Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and</P>
       <P el="5">(ii) <Miles com="ix" />an application for Subsidiary Protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 &mdash; Statutory Instrument No. 518 of 2006.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Following consideration of the revocation request, a decision was taken by the then Minister to affirm the Deportation Order. In respect of the application for Subsidiary Protection, the legal representative of the person concerned was invited to make an application under Regulation 4(2) of the aforesaid Regulations setting out any new facts or circumstances relevant to the person concerned or his country of origin which had arisen since the original decision to deport was made and which related to a possible entitlement to Subsidiary Protection. By letter dated 7 December 2007, the legal representative of the person concerned lodged an application under Regulation 4(2) as described above. Said application was considered and refused. The person concerned and his legal representative were, advised of this decision by letter dated 13 March 2008. He was also required to present himself to the GNIB on 27 March 2008 in order to make arrangements for his removal from the State. He presented as required as was given further presentation dates which he kept. He is due to present again shortly.</P>
        <P>The effect of the Deportation Order is that person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.</P>
        <P>The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</P>

        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 16 May 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned and will be fully considered before the file is passed to me for decision.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 21 June 2002. His application was refused following consideration <Col N="462"/>of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 14 April 2003, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him. He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. Representations were submitted on behalf of the person concerned.</P>
        <P>His case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement and all representations received were considered in arriving at a decision in his case. On 28 June 2004 a Deportation Order was signed in respect of the person concerned. Notice of this Order was served by registered post dated 11 January 2005. This communication advised the person concerned of the legal requirement that he present himself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on 20 January 2005 in order to make travel arrangements for his deportation from the State. The person concerned failed to &lsquo;present&rsquo; on this occasion and, as such, was classified as evading his deportation.</P>
        <P>On 19 August 2008, an application for revocation of the Deportation Order, under Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), was submitted on behalf of the person concerned and this application is currently under consideration in my Department. The person concerned will be notified in writing when a decision has been made on this application. The Deputy might wish to note that the documentation he refers to in his Question was submitted as part of the Section 3(11) application I referred to.</P>

The Deputy can be assured that there will be no unnecessary delay in having the case of the person concerned processed to finality.</P>

Representations were submitted by the person concerned at that time.  The person concerned has also submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006) and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>
        <P>In the event that the Subsidiary Protection application is refused, the case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will then be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as <Col N="468"/>amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.

	<P>One of the options open to persons faced with the prospect of having a Deportation Order issued in respect of them is that they can seek to return voluntarily to their country of origin.  Asylum seekers and irregular migrants from non-EU countries who agree to return voluntarily to their countries of <Col N="471"/>origin but do not have the financial means or in some instances the necessary documentation to do so, can obtain assistance through the Voluntary Assisted Return and Reintegration Programme (VARRP).

	<P>The formulation of proposals in relation to the opening and closing of Garda stations is a matter, in the first instance, for the Garda Commissioner in the context of the annual policing plan, as provided for in Section 22 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  The Garda accommodation programme is based on agreed priorities and it is brought forward in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works (OPW), which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are currently no plans to establish a Garda Station in the Castletroy area.  I am further informed that the Commissioner has established a Garda Accommodation Programme Board, under the chairmanship of the Chief Administrative Officer, to prepare a long-term accommodation strategy for the Force.  As part of this strategy, discussions are taking place with the Limerick Regeneration Board regarding the location of Garda Stations in Limerick City.  The policing accommodation needs of Castletroy will be considered in the context of this strategy.</P>

	<P>Joint Policing Committees are provided for in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  As  a Committee will be established in each local authority area in the State &mdash; of which there are 114 &mdash; it was considered desirable to run a time-limited pilot to gain experience in their operation before countrywide roll-out.  Twenty nine Committees are currently operating in the pilot phase.  As part of the evaluation of the pilot phase, my predecessor as Minister and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government hosted a consultation seminar last November, at which participants in the pilot Committees considered the lessons from the operation of the Committees to date.  A very useful seminar, organised by Co-operation Ireland, was also held in Monaghan in May, at which participants in the Committees and in the nearest equivalent bodies in Northern Ireland, the District Policing Partnerships, discussed their experiences.</P>
        <P>Amended Guidelines to allow full roll-out of the Committees have been drafted in consultation with the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, as provided for in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, and with the assistance of interested parties, including an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and representatives of local authority members and management.  I have today launched these new Guidelines.  As a result, a Committee will be established in each local authority area in the country where a Committee is not already established.  I believe that, over time, the Committees will make an enormous contribution to keeping our communities safe.  Fundamentally, they represent a partnership between the people, through their representatives, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day, personnel strengths of individual stations may fluctuate due, for example, to promotions, retirements and transfers.

        <P FLI="0">I am also informed that as of 31 August 2008 there were 697 members of the Force attached to Community Policing and of these, 4 members are attached to the Carlow/Kildare Division based in Naas Garda Station.  It is of course the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises.  In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and I agree with the view of the Garda Inspectorate, expressed in its most recent report, that community policing is a fundamental policing philosophy and that there is a strong foundation for it in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the 2008 Garda Annual Policing Plan sets out the Commissioner&rsquo;s proposals to realign the boundaries of Garda Divisions around the country to make them coterminous with local authority boundaries.  Included in this is a plan to establish a new Garda Division in Kildare.  The planned changes will bring about greater efficiencies and effectiveness in facilitating the establishment and functioning of Joint Policing Committees.  A detailed programme of work is currently being developed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to implement these planned changes for various Garda Divisions.  This programme of work will also examine the geographical areas of district and sub-district stations arising from the regional and divisional boundary realignments set out in the plan and will set out a timetable for the establishment of the new divisions.</P>

	<P>Following the submission in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, it was determined by the Government that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 consequently made provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime <Col N="478"/>statistics since the third quarter of 2006.  Accordingly, I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.</P>

        <Quest> the number of arrests in respect of card skimming in County Kildare in each of the past two years; the number of successful prosecutions arising from these arrests; the plans he has to introduce laws to combat this crime; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The practice of &lsquo;card-skimming&rsquo; involves the unauthorised copying of information from a customer&rsquo;s ATM card which facilitates the criminal stealing of cash by using the illegally obtained data.  I am informed that it is not possible, without a disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources, to indicate the number of arrests made or convictions recorded in respect of such offences as requested by the Deputy.  I am assured by the Garda authorities that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in constant liaison with financial institutions with a view to tackling ATM fraud which is being targeted through various fora including bi-monthly meetings of the ATM Fraud Forum, which is comprised of representatives of the various financial institutions and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is chaired by the Irish Payment Card Services Organisation (IPSO).</P>
        <P>This type of criminal activity is also addressed through the Hi-Tech Crime Forum which comprises representatives of the banking institutions, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the Internet Service providers, IPSO and other stakeholders as deemed appropriate.  This forum meets every two months.  Any perceived weaknesses or new attack methods identified are discussed at these meetings in order to identify counter-measures to prevent further occurrences.  The provisions of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001 cover a wide-range of offences including theft, deception, forgery, using a false instrument, and are deemed to adequately provide for the offences disclosed by this form of criminal activity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>At 31 August 2008, there were 254 attested Reserve Garda&iacute; and 121 Reserve trainees nationally.  There are three attested Reserve Garda&iacute; in Kildare allocated to Newbridge (1) and Naas (2) respectively. Eight trainees who are completing Phase IV training will be assigned to Naas.  The Agreed Programme for Government has set a target strength for the Reserve at 10% of the full-time strength of the force. In the Annual Policing Plan for 2008 the Garda Commissioner has set a target of recruiting 270 Reserve members this year.  As the Garda Reserve depends on volunteers who undertake their training and other duties during their free time, it is difficult to predict how many people will commence training in any particular period.  However, I can assure the Deputy that the Garda Commissioner is making every effort to reach the recruitment target.</P>
        <P>The ongoing marketing campaign to recruit members to the Garda Reserve involves local media interviews, radio advertisements, cinema advertisements, public transport advertisements and exhibition stands at events such as the Ploughing Championships, the Young Scientist of the Year Awards and F&Aacute;S Opportunities.  The Garda Reserve featured on the RTE Crime Call programme and  a promotional DVD was commissioned and forwarded to all second <Col N="479"/>level schools in the country.  Promotional material on the Garda Reserve has been forwarded to each District Officer in the country to be disseminated to post offices, libraries, leisure centres, shopping centres, banks and credit unions in their District, as well as to local residents associations, neighbourhood watch groups and community alert groups.</P>

The effect of the Deportation Order is that person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 28 August 2000 and applied for asylum.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  The person concerned was informed by letter dated 22 January 2003 that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him and afforded him three options in accordance with Section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a Deportation Order or to submit, within 15 working days, written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. </P>
        <P>His case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations submitted on his behalf for permission to remain in the State.  On 12 July 2004 one of my predecessors refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of him.  Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to present himself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau, 13-14 Burgh Quay on Tuesday 10 August 2004 in order to make travel arrangements for his removal from the State.  He failed to comply with his reporting requirements and was classified as evading his deportation.</P>
        <P>By letter dated 26 August 2008, the legal representative of the person concerned lodged an application for Subsidiary Protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 &mdash; Statutory Instrument No. 518 of 2006.  By letter dated 10 September 2008 the legal representative of the person concerned was invited to make an appli<Col N="483"/>cation under Regulation 4(2) of the aforesaid Regulations setting out any new facts or circumstances relevant to the person concerned or his country of origin which had arisen since the original decision to deport was made and which related to a possible entitlement to Subsidiary Protection.  My officials are currently awaiting a response in this regard.  The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the GNIB.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum in the State on 16 November 2006.  Following investigation by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, it was established that the person concerned had previously made an asylum application in the United Kingdom and, as such, a determination was made that the person concerned should be transferred to the United Kingdom for the purposes of having her asylum application examined there.  This determination was upheld following an appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Consequently, a Transfer Order was signed in respect of the person concerned on 10 January 2007.  This Order was subsequently served on the person concerned which placed a legal obligation on her to present herself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), on Thursday 18 January 2007, to make arrangements for her formal transfer to the United Kingdom.  The person concerned failed to &lsquo;present&rsquo; on this occasion and was therefore classified as having &lsquo;evaded&rsquo; her transfer.  The person concerned became illegally resident in the State at that time.</P>
        <P>The person concerned continued to evade her transfer with the consequence that the Transfer Order expired leaving Ireland responsible for processing the asylum application of the person concerned.  At this point the case of the person concerned was referred back to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner for the purposes of having her asylum claims investigated. As part of this process, the person concerned was invited to attend for interview at that Office at a designated date and time but she failed to attend. Neither did she offer any explanation for her non-attendance.  As a result, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner made a recommendation that the person concerned be refused a declaration of refugee status.  This recommendation was conveyed in writing to the person concerned by letter dated 30 June 2008. This communication also notified the person concerned that, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13(2)(c) of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), there was no appeal against this recommendation.</P>
        <P>Arising from the recommendation of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was <Col N="484"/>informed, by letter dated 14 July 2008, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).  The person concerned has not responded to my Department&rsquo;s letter dated 14 July 2008.  The case of the person concerned now falls to be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended). This process will involve an examination of the case of the person concerned having regard to Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  When this consideration has been completed, the case file of the person concerned is passed to me for decision.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 31 December 2001.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 19 February 2003, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned and will be fully considered, under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 on the prohibition of refoulement, before the file is passed to me for decision.</P>

	<P>It is not the practice to comment in detail on individual asylum applications. As the Deputy will be aware, applications for refugee status in the State are determined by an independent process comprising the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted.  A final decision on each application is made following receipt of the recommendation of the Refugee Applications Commissioner or the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, as appropriate.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my Reply to Parliamentary Question No. 1199 of 30 January 2008.  The position in relation to granting long term residency is as follows: persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension.  In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.  The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency.  This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.  Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.  While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.  An application for long term residency from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in June 2007.  I understand that applications received in January 2007 are currently being dealt with.  As soon as a decision is made on the case, the person concerned will be notified. </P>

	<P>The two visa applications referred to by the Deputy were received in the Visa Office, New Delhi on 24 June 2008.  Both were refused by the Visa Officer on 25 June 2008. The first mentioned application was refused for the following reasons:</P>
<P el="5">1. <Miles com="ix" />There were no obligations to return to the home country shown;</P>
<P el="5">2. <Miles com="ix" />It was the opinion of the Visa Officer that the applicant may not observe the conditions of the visa if granted.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">The second mentioned application was refused for the following reasons:</P>
<P el="5">1. <Miles com="ix" />There was insufficient documentation submitted in support of the application;</P>
<P el="5">2. <Miles com="ix" />The obligations to return to the home country were not deemed sufficient;</P>
<P el="5">3. <Miles com="ix" />It was the opinion of the Visa Officer that the applicant may not observe the conditions of the visa if granted.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">The applicants lodged appeals.  Both decisions of the Visa Officer were upheld by the Appeals Officer on 17 July 2008. The only option available to the applicants now is to make a fresh application. Comprehensive information when making a visa application is available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service &mdash; www.inis.gov.ie</P>

	<P>I would refer the Deputy to my Reply to Parliamentary Question No. 1242 on 30 January 2008.  Persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.</P>
        <P>The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.</P>
        <P>Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency. While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.</P>
        <P>An application for long term residence from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in October 2006. A letter was sent to the applicant on 09/07/2008 requesting further documents in order to progress his application.

        <P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 10 January 2003.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 28 February 2007, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006). The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration <Col N="489"/>at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>
        <P>In the event that the Subsidiary Protection application is refused, the case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will then be considered under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  When this latter consideration has been completed, the case file of the person concerned is passed to me for decision.</P>

<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />have made either before a Judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>

        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 16 April 2003, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.

        <P>His case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations submitted on his behalf for permission to remain in the <Col N="491"/>State.

Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to present himself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on 6 January 2005 in order to make travel arrangements for his removal from the State. The person concerned presented as required. He was given further presentation dates which he kept. He is due to present again shortly.</P>

The Closing Date for the submission of applications under this Scheme was 31 March 2005.

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I published the Report <i>Regulating Gaming</i> in Ireland on 10 July last.  The Report makes some 32 recommendations that have significant public policy implications regarding the future architecture of many aspects of gaming and betting in Ireland, including the subject matter of the Deputy&rsquo;s Question.</P>
        <P>As I said on the publication of the Report, we need to get things right in relation to our gaming and betting codes. In particular I want to ensure that betting and gaming activities are carried out within a responsible framework that recognises the reality of these activities, but which ensures they are properly managed, particularly as regards problem gamblers.  In that context, technological advances associated with the online and remote betting and gaming <Col N="493"/>environments, as well as other significant developments such as the changing nature of gaming through the convergence of technologies, and the proliferation of private members&rsquo; clubs offering a casino-style experience require further detailed analysis before Government is asked to make a formal decision on introducing any significant changes to the regulatory regime in the gaming and betting area.  I published the Report in advance of setting up the informal Cross-Party Committee which is to be asked to examine all aspects of gaming in Ireland and I allowed the Summer Recess for all parties to familiarise themselves with the contents of the Report.</P>
        <P>Among the areas to be addressed by the Committee will be to:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />reflect on and review the Report &ldquo;Regulating Gaming in Ireland&rdquo;;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />undertake public consultation in relation to the issues raised in the Report;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />consider in particular, the recommendations made on the nature of the regulatory and licensing system proposed;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />take into account the wider implications of the public policy concerns, both in terms of the negative aspect of gaming/gambling and the issue of choice by adults to engage in such activity;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />examine existing law regulating gaming and lotteries in the jurisdiction;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />take account of international developments and examine, in particular, the experience of the United Kingdom which has recently enacted the Gambling Act 2005 and established a national regulator &mdash; the Gambling Commission;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />take account of developments in relation to internet and remote gambling (e.g. via mobile phones);</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />conduct sectoral consultation in arriving at any conclusions;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />evaluate the public policy concerns around gaming and gambling giving the diversity of opinion and the desirability of introducing policy proposals which would attract broad agreement,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />provide an interim report on measures that could assist in supporting the horse racing and greyhound industries and any other matter that the Committee considers to be of pressing public importance; and, </P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />provide a final report to the Minister with recommendations on the future architecture for gaming in Ireland as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As the Deputy can see, the informal Cross-party Committee is being asked specifically to take account of the specific developments addressed by the Deputy in his question.  The Committee will have wide latitude to address the many complex and even emotive issues surrounding gaming and gambling, and I would think that participation in the work of the Committee affords an opportunity to Members of the House to contribute, at the important policy formulation stage, to the future architecture of gaming in Ireland.  It is an approach that offers the best guarantee that the interests of all elements in our society are taken into account from the beginning in an area of important public policy.  I look forward to completing the establishment of the Committee now that the House has resumed and look forward to receiving the advice of the Committee in due course.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the location referred to is in Clontarf Garda Sub-District and is patrolled by foot and mobile patrols from that Garda station, including the Community Policing Unit.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that local Garda management is aware of anti-social behaviour in the area concerned. The local Community Garda recently attended a meeting where a number of issues, including traffic, speeding and anti-social behaviour, were discussed. These matters are receiving attention and local Garda management is liaising with relevant authorities, including the appropriate board of management and the local authority, concerning measures necessary to address these issues.</P>
        <P>The area is regularly patrolled by uniform and plain-clothes units, including the Community Policing Unit. Patrols are supplemented by the District Garda Mountain Bike Unit, Detective and Drugs Units, the Divisional Crime Task Force and the Traffic Corps.</P>
        <P>Current policing policy in the area is predicated on the prevention of crime, including crimes of violence against persons and property, the prevention of public order offences and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life of the residents. This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of the policing service in this area.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 27 December 2004 and applied for asylum on 21 April 2005. His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 29 December 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him. He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a <Col N="498"/>Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
        <P>His case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Action Act, 1999 (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations submitted on his behalf for Permission to remain in the State. On 23 July 2007 the legal representatives of the person concerned were invited to submit an application for Subsidiary Protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 &mdash; Statutory Instrument No. 518 of 2006.</P>
        <P>Following consideration of the application the legal representatives of the person concerned were informed by letter dated 14 May 2008 that the application had been considered and refused. On 14 August 2008, I refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of the person concerned. Notice of this order was served by registered post dated 26 August 2008 requiring the person concerned to present himself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on 16 September 2008 in order to make travel arrangements for his removal from the State. The person concerned presented as required. He is due to present again shortly.</P>
        <P>The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the GNIB.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Questions No. 222 of Thursday 15 May 2008 and No.193 of Thursday 10 April 2008 and the written Replies to those Questions.</P>
        <P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 14 December 2001. As part of the process of having his asylum claims investigated, the person concerned was requested to attend for interview at the Offices of the Refugee Applications Commissioner on two separate occasions but he failed to do so. Neither did he provide any reason for his non-attendance. As a result, the Refugee Applications Commissioner made a recommendation to the Minister that the person concerned should not be declared to be a refugee.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 5 June 2002, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him and he was made aware of the options open to him at that point in time namely; to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to deportation or to submit, within 15 working days, written representations setting out the reasons as to why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  No such representations were submitted by, or on behalf of, the person concerned at that time.  Following consideration of the case file of the person concerned under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition on refoulement, a Deportation Order was signed in respect of the person concerned on 4 July 2003.</P>
        <P>The person concerned subsequently submitted a request to be re-admitted to the asylum process, in accordance with the provisions of Section 17(7) of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as <Col N="499"/>amended) and this request was granted. As a result, the Deportation Order in respect of the person concerned was revoked and the consideration of his asylum application commenced anew.</P>
        <P>The asylum application of the person concerned was refused following consideration of his case by the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 7 July 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to deportation or of submitting, within 15 working days, written representations setting out the reasons as to why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned and will be fully considered, before the file is passed to me for decision.</P>

        <P>The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.</P>

	<P>The position in relation to granting long term residency is as follows: persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.  </P>
        <P>The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.</P>
        <P>Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.</P><Col N="500"/>

        <P>The person referred to by the Deputy is currently in the State under stamp 3 (dependent spouse) conditions. As stated above, she may apply for long term residency under these conditions once her spouse has been granted stamp 4.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 14 September, 2000 and applied for asylum. Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner. </P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of Immigration Act 1999, as amended, the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 29 January, 2002 that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her. She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
        <P>Her case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, on the Prohibition of Refoulement. On 19 April 2002, one of my predecessors refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of her. Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to present herself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on 24 May 2002 in order to make travel arrangements for her removal from the State. She failed to present as required and was classified as evading her deportation.</P>
        <P>Late representations have been received from legal representatives of the person concerned. These representations are currently being considered by officials in my Department.</P>
        <P>The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the GNIB.</P>

        <P>Judicial Review Proceedings were subsequently initiated on behalf of the person concerned challenging the Deportation Orders.  These proceedings were settled on 27 November 2006.

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 9 December 2003 and applied for asylum. His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. </P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 24 November 2004, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him. He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
        <P>His case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations submitted on his behalf for permission to remain in the State. On 11 May 2005, one of my predecessors refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of him. Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to present himself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on 16 June 2005 in order to make travel arrangements for his removal from the State. The person initially presented as required and was given further presentation dates which he kept.  He subsequently failed to present as required on 12 December 2006 and was classified as evading his deportation. He should, therefore, present himself to the GNIB without any further delay. The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the GNIB.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Question No. 857 of Thursday, 10 July 2008, and the written Reply to that Question.</P>
        <P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 3 February 2003.  As part of the investigation of her asylum claim, the person concerned was invited to attend for interview at the Offices of the Refugee Applications Commissioner but failed to do so. As a result the Refugee Applications Commissioner made a recommendation to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the person concerned be refused a declaration of refugee status.</P>
        <P>Based on the recommendation of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 12 September 2003, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
        <P>On 8 October 2003, in accordance with the provisions of the Dublin Convention, a formal transfer request was received from the United Kingdom (UK) for the transfer of the person concerned from the UK to this State. The person concerned had come to the attention of the UK authorities when she lodged an application for asylum in that State on 28 July 2003.  Ireland agreed to the transfer request and also agreed, in accordance with Article 4(3) of Council Regulation (EC) 343 of 2003, to accept the son of the person concerned who was born in the <Col N="508"/>United Kingdom during her time there. The person concerned and her son transferred from the UK to Ireland on 22 February 2005.</P>
        <P>On 21 April 2005 a take back request was received from the United Kingdom in accordance with Article 16(1)(c) of the Dublin II Regulation on the basis that the person concerned was in the United Kingdom without permission and her asylum application was being examined in this State.  This request was acceded to and the person concerned and her son were again transferred from the UK to Ireland on 16 May 2005.</P>
        <P>The case of the person concerned, and that of her son, now fall to be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). Representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned and these representations will be fully considered, under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, before the file is passed to me for decision.</P>

        <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. These condition are that the applicant must:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />be of full age</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />be of good character</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years</P>

<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />have made either before a Judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>
<P el="5" FLI="0">In the context of naturalisation, certain periods of residence in the State are excluded. These include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the State</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />periods granted for the purposes of study periods granted for the purposes of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act, 1996.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">It is open to the person in question to lodge an application for a certificate of naturalisation if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory criteria outlined.</P>

The person in question was also advised to report to the Garda National Immigration Bureau, 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 to have the appropriate permission endorsed on his passport and to have a Certificate of Registration issued in respect of him.</P>
        <P>Enquiries made by the Immigration Division of my Department in January 2008  indicated that the person concerned had contacted the Garda National Immigration Bureau and had renewed his permission to remain until the 26th July 2008.

        <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that this type of crime is best addressed and targeted by Divisional and District management teams, as local crime trends can be monitored and appropriate crime prevention and detection initiatives can be put in place.</P>
        <P>I am further advised that the Garda authorities have in place a number of measures to target this type of criminality.  Patrols by uniform and plain-clothes members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including Community Policing and Garda Mountain Bike Units are briefed on trends and the need to be vigilant of such crimes at the start of each tour of duty while plain clothes Garda&iacute; are also placed on covert surveillance at times when this crime is most prevalent.  Mountain <Col N="510"/>Bike patrols are utilised in the vicinity of schools and other vulnerable areas.  Information bulletins containing profiles of suspects and trends for such crimes are also circulated by Criminal Intelligence Officers.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities offer  crime prevention advice to members of the public and focussed presentations are made to students through the Garda Schools Programme and Campus Watch and to security personnel at shopping centres and similar vulnerable sites, such as park and ride facilities. The Garda  National Crime Prevention Office has also produced an advice leaflet titled, &lsquo;Cycle Theft Prevention&rsquo; which has been circulated widely at similarly vulnerable locations.</P>

	<P>Legislative, administrative and operational/enforcement/monitoring measures have been put in place to provide a comprehensive, holistic and effective response to the heinous crime of trafficking in human beings. Legislative Developments The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 has been fully operational since 7th June, 2008.  The Act creates offences of trafficking in children and adults for the purpose of sexual or labour exploitation or the removal of their organs.  It also makes it an offence to sell or offer for sale or to purchase or offer to purchase any person for any purpose.  Penalties of up to life imprisonment apply in respect of these offences.</P>
        <P>Enactment of this legislation brings Ireland into compliance with the criminal law/law enforcement elements of the:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="is0p4" />(i) <Miles com="ix" />EU Framework Decision on Combating Trafficking in Human Beings</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="is0p2" />(ii) <Miles com="ix" />Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings and</P>
<P el="5">(iii) <Miles com="ix" />UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons especially Women and Children.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill at Section 124 provides for a period of recovery and reflection of 45 days in the State for alleged victims of trafficking.  Furthermore where the person trafficked wishes to assist the Garda&iacute; in any investigation or prosecution in relation to the alleged trafficking, the Section provides a further six months period of residence, renewable, to enable him or her to do so.  An administrative framework, reflecting the provisions in the Bill, was introduced on 7th June, 2008 to provide for the period of recovery, reflection and residency in the State during the period between the enactment of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act, 2008 and the full enactment of the provisions in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Administrative Developments</i></P>
<P el="0">An Interdepartmental High Level Group has been established to recommend to me the most appropriate and effective responses to trafficking in human beings.  Furthermore, an Anti-Human Trafficking Unit has been established in my Department under the Stewardship of an Executive Director.  The role of the Unit is to ensure that the State&rsquo;s response to trafficking in human beings is coordinated, comprehensive and holistic.  A National Action Plan to Prevent and Tackle Trafficking in Human Beings will be approved by the High Level Group for submission to me, with a view to publication by the end of the year.  Roundtable discussions chaired by the Executive Director of the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit are being held with Government and non-governmental organisations on a quarterly basis.</P>
        <P>In addition, 5 interdisciplinary Working Groups have been established to progress matters and, in turn, report to the High Level Group.  The Working Groups will deal with:</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">Ireland participates in a European initiative known as the G6 Human trafficking Initiative, which includes the UK, Poland, Italy, France, Spain and the Netherlands along with Interpol, Europol and Eurojust.  The most recent meeting of the G6 took place on the 20th June, 2008.  Ireland has recommended a particular focus on the trafficking of children in the course of the G6 initiative.  As part of this initiative the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has commenced an operation designed to prevent the trafficking of minors in to, out of, and within the State, to ensure the welfare of suspected victims of such criminal activity is adequately provided for, and to commence prosecutions where criminal activity of the nature concerned has been detected.  An awareness-raising campaign throughout the participating countries &mdash; led by Ireland &mdash; is also planned under this initiative.  The campaign in Ireland will commence in October and run for a period of three weeks.  Its focus will be the General Public and Law Enforcement.  Training on the legislation and the indicators of trafficking has been given to Labour Inspectors of the National Employment Rights Authority and staff of the Health Service Executive.  Further training is planned for a number of professionals who have been identified as benefiting from such training in the course of their work.</P>
        <P>Ireland is participating in an operation, &ldquo;Pentameter 2&rdquo;, launched by the UK.  One of the main objectives of the operation is to raise awareness of the scale of the problem of trafficking of human beings for the purposes of sexual exploitation, particularly among those who avail of sexual services.  The operation assists awareness raising in showing Ireland and the UK as locations which are hostile to human trafficking.  As part of Operation Pentameter a poster-campaign was launched in both Ireland and the UK to encourage victims of human trafficking to report their plight to State authorities.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are taking a pro-active approach in Operation Pentameter to address the need for a coordinated approach to human trafficking with the Common Travel Area which operates between the UK and Ireland.  This cooperation is taking place in a number of ways, including intelligence sharing, joint training exercises and operational cooperation where investigations have a cross-border, UK/Ireland, dimension.</P>
        <P>Immigration border controls are maintained by the Garda National Immigration Bureau and a number of traffickers and victims of traffickers have been identified through the rigorous enforcement of immigration legislation.  Joint operations, in association with the UK Immigration Service, continue to be part of immigration policy to prevent and detect possible abuses of the Common Travel Areas (CTA), by means of illegal immigration and associated criminality.</P>
        <P>Liaison at an international level between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the international law enforcement community forms part of the approach taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to human trafficking.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regularly attend international meetings including those organised by Europol, Interpol and Frontex, to facilitate the exchange of information and best practice between EU Member States in particular, and on a global basis with countries of origin of suspected victims of human trafficking.</P>
        <P>A training programme, titled &lsquo;Tackling Human Trafficking &mdash; Prevention, Protection, Prosecution&rsquo; to assist those tasked with investigating incidents of human trafficking, was developed at the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Training College, Templemore in 2006 in consultation with the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) and the International Organisation for Migration <Col N="513"/>(IOM).  Members from the GNIB, the IOM and other Government and non-Governmental Agencies, including Ruhama and the Migrants Rights Centre of Ireland (MRCI), make presentations to participants on these courses, which are regularly held at the Garda College.  Regular presentations are also made by the Head of the UK Human Trafficking Centre and by officials from the Health Services Executive (HSE) who have responsibility for dealing with unaccompanied minors who arrive in the State, some of whom are suspected of having been trafficked into the State.  Garda Personnel involved in the delivery of training to Student and Probationer Gardai and in the delivery of in-service training at District and Divisional levels have attended the Training Courses and presentations now form part of the Student/Probationer and Continuous Development Programmes at the Garda College and nationwide.  Members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland have also participated, as students, on training courses at the Garda College.</P>
        <P>As the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act, 2008 only came into operation on 7th June, 2008 no convictions have been recorded to date for offences contrary to that Act.  However, prior to the enactment of the Act of 2008 the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na utilised the provisions of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000 in cases where human trafficking was suspected.  Since September, 2000 over one hundred persons have been arrested and detained in respect of alleged breaches of the provisions of Section 2 of the Act of 2000.  Four persons have been convicted in respect of twenty two alleged breaches of the provisions of Section 2 of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000 and one person is currently awaiting trial while investigation files are being prepared for submission to the Law Officers.</P>

        <P FLI="0">It needs to be understood that the above figures represent a &lsquo;snapshot&rsquo; of each centre at a given date each year.  While capacity figures remain constant, occupancy figures can vary throughout the year because of the interaction of residents leaving (either through normal means or because of special schemes such as the Irish Born Child 2005 Scheme), residents arriving, temporary closures (such as Balseskin in July, 2006) medical restrictions on arrivals arising from outbreaks of chickenpox, and so on.</P>

        <Quest> if he will provide details in tabular form of the number of independent and internal inspections in respect of each of the 61 accommodation centres which have been carried out annually in each of the past five years; the locations at which follow up inspections were required; the main reasons for downfalls in standards at accommodation centres; the centres that have received the Excellence Ireland Quality Association mark and the centres which have been closed, temporarily or otherwise, at any point for breaches in standards. </Quest>

	<P>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision and dispersal. In this regard, the RIA is currently providing accommodation to over 6,800 asylum seekers in 62 centres located across 22 counties.</P>
        <P>All accommodation providers are required under contract  to ensure that accommodation centres comply and operate in accordance with all statutory requirements of local authorities and state agencies in relation to bedroom capacity, food, food-hygiene, water supply, fire safety and general safety.</P>
        <P>The Agency engages independent external assessors to conduct comprehensive inspections of all centres on at least an annual basis.  These inspections are always unannounced and the inspectors look at all aspects of the accommodation centres in relation to the proprietors&rsquo; obligations under the contract. These inspections cover such areas as reception, staff cover, menus, facilities being provided, maintenance of the property and fire and safety issues.  In addition, RIA has an internal Inspections Unit which aims to conduct inspections of each of the properties used to accommodate asylum seekers at least on a twice yearly basis.  Further unannounced visits are made to accommodation centres throughout the State on a regular basis by senior management to ensure that standards are being maintained.  Staff from RIA hold information clinics on a regular basis in accommodation centres: these afford asylum seekers an opportunity to comment on accommodation and operating standards and to discuss other general issues.</P>
        <P>Any report of a diminution in standards which comes to the attention of the RIA is immediately followed up and proprietors are instructed to make any changes and improvements deemed necessary. Follow-up inspections are also arranged as appropriate.  In cases where standards stipulated in the contract have not been met and the proprietor has not made sufficient efforts to remedy the situation, there is provision for the contract to be terminated.</P>
        <P>The primary reasons for follow-up inspections usually occur in relation to health and safety issues. This can involve asylum seeker residents failing to observe restrictions on smoking, sometimes involving the deliberate covering of internal smoke alarms.  Another issue may involve overloaded electrical sockets.  Other lapses may include some staff not recording all Fire Safety checks in the register or maintenance and cleaning issues in bedrooms and bathrooms.  In all such cases, the RIA will not deem the issue as being resolved until it or the independent inspectors are entirely satisfied that remedial procedures are in place.  RIA has found that all inspection issues to date have been remedied using this procedure.  As a consequence, no <Col N="518"/>contracts have been terminated as a result of such inspections issues. List of internal and external (independent) inspections carried out in the last five years:</P>

	<P>In accordance with the provisions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Acts 2005 to 2007, proposals to alter the boundaries of a divisional geographical area are a matter in the first instance for the Garda Commissioner in the context of the Annual Policing Plan. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s 2008 Policing Plan, which was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, contains the Commissioner&rsquo;s proposals to realign Garda Divisional boundaries to make them coterminous with local authority boundaries.  The planned changes will bring about greater efficiencies and effectiveness in facilitating the establishment and functioning of Joint Policing Committees.  </P>
        <P>I have been advised by the Garda authorities that the Limerick Division is being primarily affected by the boundary realignment of the Tipperary Division. The realignment of the Tipperary Boundaries has resulted in the following changes to the Limerick Division:</P><Col N="522"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The sub-districts of Oola, Doon and Galbally will be transferred from the district of Tipperary and will be incorporated into the Bruff district. These changes will take place on the 1st January 2009.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Funding of approximately &euro;19 million is being provided in 2008.  As the Deputy will appreciate, funding of this order must be subject to stringent value for money criteria.  In this context, a new funding agreement structure was introduced in 2007 whereby groups seeking funding must commit to a range of outputs in line with the strategy and the work plans of the Probation Service.  The project detailed by the Deputy has been in receipt of funding from my Department, through the Probation Service, since its establishment in 1997.  In keeping with the need to make best use of State resources, the Probation Service has worked in partnership with the project in that period to ensure that the funding provided was used to the direct benefit of the probation client group, thus ensuring value for money from this distinct stream of funding.  Despite the best efforts of probation management and the project, Probation Service referrals remained low with limited added value to the core work of the Service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department was the main funder of the project in 2008, committing almost &euro;300,000.  It seems that other funding commitments did not materialise.  Combined with staff changes and other issues, this left the viability of the project in question.  Following a meeting between <Col N="523"/>representatives of the Probation Service and the Board of Management in September 2008, the Board confirmed to my Department in September 2008 that it has put plans for the orderly closure of the project in place.  In coming to the decision to cease funding, my Department took account of the level of referrals to the project from the Service, compared with the level of funding; the other local support services available in the Blanchardstown area to the client group of the Probation Service; and the view of the management of the Probation Service that it was satisfied that sufficient supports are available to the probation team in the area.  I refer the Deputy to a value for money and policy review report on projects funded by the Probation Service, which was published by my Department in September 2008.  The report sets out a strategy that will inform funding in the future, providing for better governance, better management information and a more effective and efficient delivery to the client group of the community based projects in receipt of State funding.  I am a strong advocate of developing partnerships with local communities to add value to the core work of the Probation Service.  The funding we have provided in recent years is a measure of that commitment.  I want community projects to continue to work with the Probation Service to deliver a focused and measurable set of outcomes to the client group of the Service.</P>

The development of the new hospital is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  The Executive, therefore, is the appropriate body to consider the particular matters raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.  The cost of acquiring the site for the new prison and hospital was &euro;29,900,000.  An additional 8.7 acres, at a cost of &euro;1,305,000, was later acquired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to provide a dedicated access road to the prison construction site.</P>

	<P>I have had no meetings with the Minister for Health and Children or the Health Service Executive about the location of the Central Mental Hospital on the Thornton site.  My Department did not have any meetings with the Department of Health and Children or the HSE about the location of the Central Mental Hospital on the Thornton site prior to its acquisition.  However, memoranda for Government relating to the acquisition of a greenfield site to replace Mountjoy and the development of a Central Mental Hospital were circulated between the Departments in the normal way.  Officials from my Department wrote to the Department of Health and Children in December 2005 in the context of a visit by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, CPT, which was planned for 2006.  The letter referred to an earlier Government decision that, in principle and subject to further study, the Central Mental Hospital should be transferred to the same site as that chosen for the prison to replace Mountjoy.  The letter set out the progress being made on the prison project and confirmed that a portion of the site had been reserved as a possible location for the Central Mental Hospital.  It went on to suggest that it would soon be in position to give a concrete indication to the CPT of future plans for a new Central Mental Hospital on the site.  There were contacts between the Irish Prison Service and the Department of Health and Children on the area of the Thornton site which would be reserved for the Central Mental Hospital.  Since the acquisition, there have been meetings between my Department and the Department of Health and Children about the service being provided for mentally ill prisoners and other matters.  In that context, the location of a new Central Mental Hospital on the Thornton site has arisen.</P>

	<P>Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January 2007.  Part 13 of the Act, relating to anti-social behaviour by children, was commenced on 1 March 2007.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and to the making of a behaviour order by the Children&rsquo;s Court.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that from 1 January 2007 to 31 July 2008, 30 behaviour warnings were issued to adults and nine to children in the Kerry Garda Division, which includes Listowel, Tralee and Abbeyfeale.  Figures are provisional, operational and liable to change.  In setting up the regime under the Criminal Justice Act 2006, the intention was that these warnings or good behaviour contracts would address the problem behaviour.  It is only if they fail that a court order will be applied for.  In any case, it inevitably takes time to reach the stage where a court order might be sought.  No significance should be attached to the fact that the stage has not yet been reached in the process where a court order has been issued.  If warnings or good behaviour contracts do not succeed in altering a person&rsquo;s behaviour, however, they will culminate in a court order being sought by the Garda authorities from the courts.</P>

	<P>The visa application referred to by the Deputy was received in the Visa Office in Dublin on 14 August 2008.  It was refused by the Visa Officer on 15 September 2008 for a number of reasons.  There was insufficient documentation submitted in support of the application.  The evidence of finances was deemed insufficient or incomplete.  There was no evidence shown of a relationship being in existence prior to the visa application.  It is open to the applicant to submit an appeal within two months of the date of decision, in this case before 15 November 2008.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 994 to 997, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>As of 19 September 2008, 279 prisoners are in custody under sentence for offences of a sexual nature.  Ninety of the prisoners in question are in custody in Arbour Hill, 19 are in custody in Castlerea Prison, seven are in custody in Cork Prison, three are in custody in Limerick Prison, 80 are in custody in Midlands Prison, four are in custody in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution and 76 are in custody in Wheatfield Prison.  While offenders can be supported and encouraged in their efforts to change and to address their offending behaviour, successful completion of any intervention programme ultimately depends on the willing participation and commitment of appropriately motivated individuals.  The challenge for the Irish Prison Service is to use a range of channels to motivate as many offenders as possible to undertake change and to address their offending behaviour.  Every effort is made to assist sex offenders in custody who are willing to participate at any level in rehabilitation and relapse prevention.</P>
        <P>Three main forms of direct therapeutic intervention for sex offenders are currently operating within the Irish prison system.  An intensive sex offender programme has been in operation since 1994.  Individual counselling is offered by the Irish Prison Service&rsquo;s Psychology Service and the Probation Service.  One-to-one interventions are made by visiting psychiatrists who provide support to prisoners.  The intensive programme is a group programme managed and delivered by the Irish Prison Service&rsquo;s Psychology Service in partnership with the Probation Service.  It caters for eight offenders at a time, taking 11 months to complete.  Although delivered in Arbour Hill Prison, it is available to sex offenders in other prisons.  The programme is a structured, offence-focused programme, employing a cognitive behavioural approach with a relapse prevention component.  The programme places considerable emphasis on the therapeutic process within the group and on supporting each participant in gaining the knowledge, skills, attitudes and self-confidence necessary to live life differently and more constructively in the future.  The programme seeks to address the behaviour that leads to offending.</P>
        <P>A total of 136 sex offenders have completed the sex offender programme to date.  The most recent group completed the programme in July 2008.  The programme is delivered by a team comprising a Senior Clinical Psychologist, a Counselling Psychologist and a Probation Officer.  The Psychology Service staff involved in the Programme have internationally recognised qualifications in psychology, such as a Doctorate in Clinical Psychology or a Masters in Counselling Psychology.  The programme also involves one full-time Probation Officer with accompanying <Col N="528"/>managerial input.  This Probation officer is a professionally qualified social worker.  A number of offenders undergo one-to-one counselling in relation to their sexual offending with the Irish Prison Service&rsquo;s Psychology Service.  Some individuals engage with the therapeutic services initially to seek assistance in adjusting to imprisonment and to address their mental health needs.  Following such interventions, offenders are often more open to looking at their sexual offending and a concentrated period of motivational work is conducted to help them address their offending behaviour and related issues.  In response to such counselling many offenders, who initially might deny responsibility for their crime or deny any need for treatment, are motivated towards some process of change.  For some offenders this results in them undertaking the Sex Offender Programme, for others it results in sustained individual therapy around their offending or engagement in some other programme available in the prison system.</P>
        <P>In recent years, additional psychologists have been appointed to the Irish Prison Service.  The Service&rsquo;s staffing level is at an all-time high.  The psychologists play an important role in working with offenders to address their offending behaviour, including work with sex offenders aimed at enhancing their preparedness for possible participation on the Sex Offender Programme.  There are 17 psychologists appointed to the Irish Prison Service.  A total of 11 psychologists are based in the establishments holding sex offenders.  Another two vacant psychology posts are expected to be filled later this year, both in Arbour Hill Prison.  They provide psychological services, on request, to prisoners, including sex offenders, held in these establishments.  The work undertaken with sex offenders covers mental health and/or offence-related issues.  In 2008 to date, 61 sex offenders have engaged in one-to-one counselling and other interventions with the Psychology Service.  The Probation Service also engages with prisoners on a one-to-one basis.  The Sex Offender Programme is under review.  Recommendations from the review will be incorporated in the new Sex Offender Management Policy that is being finalised.  I await the findings of this review.</P>
        <P>Some 115 of the sex offenders in custody under sentence will complete their sentences within the next 18 months.  Ten of them have completed the intensive Sex Offender Programme.  Prisoners do not &ldquo;apply&rdquo; to the Parole Board for release.  Eligible prisoners, including sex offenders are invited by the board to take part in a process which may ultimately result in the board making a recommendation to the Minister concerning their release.  In the course of this process, the board must be satisfied that the prisoner has made the required efforts and reforms to warrant such a recommendation being made.  There are 12 sex offenders engaging in the process.  Of the 578 sex offenders released in the last five years, 42 have completed the highly intensive Sex Offender Programme.  In addition, a number of other sex offenders would have availed of a range of other rehabilitative interventions available in prison.</P>

	<P>The treatment for sex offenders in custody is not straightforward and cannot be viewed in isolation.  Supports within the community on release can be equally vital to ensuring sex offenders do not reoffend.  While the weight of opinion is that cognitive behavioural approaches to the treatment of sexual offenders show the most promise, not all offenders are amenable to such treatment and unless properly motivated the chances of success with an offender are limited.  Even if it were legally <Col N="529"/>possible, there is no gain in forcing offenders to attend such treatment against their will.  A Group involving my Department, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service has been established to review the existing arrangements for the management of sex offenders.  That review will include the question of treatment and supervision.  In the meantime, every effort continues to be made to assist sex offenders in custody who are willing to participate at any level in rehabilitation and relapse prevention.  The challenge for the Irish Prison Service, therefore, is to use a range of channels to motivate as many offenders as possible to undertake change and to address their offending behaviour.</P>
        <P>Three main forms of direct therapeutic intervention for sex offenders are currently operating within the Irish prison system.  An intensive sex offender programme has been in operation since 1994.  Individual counselling is offered by the Irish Prison Service&rsquo;s Psychology Service and the Probation Service.  One-to-one interventions are made by visiting psychiatrists who provide support to prisoners.  The intensive programme is a group programme managed and delivered by the Irish Prison Service&rsquo;s Psychology Service in partnership with the Probation Service.  The programme seeks to address the behaviour that leads to offending.  Although delivered in Arbour Hill Prison, it is available to sex offenders in all prisons.  A total of 136 sex offenders have completed the sex offender programme to date.  The most recent group completed the programme in July 2008. A number of offenders undergo one-to-one counselling in relation to their sexual offending with the Irish Prison Service&rsquo;s Psychology Service.  The Probation Service also engages with prisoners on a one-to-one basis.</P>
        <P>While it is not possible to quantify with absolute accuracy participation in all forms of rehabilitation, many of those in custody for sex offences have availed of one or more of the forms of intervention referred to.  The Sex Offender Programme is under review and the recommendations from this will be incorporated in the new Sex Offender Management Policy, which is being finalised.  I await the outcome of this review.  Working in conjunction with the Psychology Service of the Irish Prison Service, the Probation Service engages with sex offenders in custody to reduce their risk of reoffending and in preparation for their release.  The Department of Justice, through the Probation Service, funds and delivers two community-based sex offender treatment programmes in partnership with the Granada Institute.  A third programme, known as &ldquo;Lighthouse&rdquo;, which is based in Cork, is due to commence in October of this year.  The Probation Service is in the process of introducing an all-island risk assessment tool for sex offenders which will assist with pre-release and post-release assessment and management of sex offenders.  Initial joint training to this effect has taken place with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the 2001 Act provides for a range of actions in relation to the management of this group of offenders.  The Sex Offender Act 2001 (Part 5) provides for the post-release supervision of a convicted sex offender by the Probation Service.  The period of supervision is set by the court and is based on considerations of the offender&rsquo;s rehabilitative needs and the need to protect the public from serious harm.  Under the Act, the combination of the term of imprisonment and the period of supervision cannot exceed the maximum penalty provided by statute for the offence committed (section 29).  The period of post-release supervision can be subject to additional conditions of counselling or treatment (section 30).  Under Part 5, offenders who are subject to a post release supervision Order are managed on a one-to-one basis by a Probation Officer.  If a sex offender fails to comply with supervision obligations, as directed by the Court in accordance with the Act, the offender is guilty of an offence and may be subject on conviction to a fine and-or imprisonment.  It is a matter for the court in its deliberations at the time of sentencing to decide whether to impose a post-release supervision order.</P><Col N="530"/>
        <P>There is a system in place whereby child care managers in the Health Service Executive are informed by the senior probation officer of the impending release of sex offenders from prisons regardless of whether the offence is against a child or adult.  The child care manager is provided with the date of release, details of the offence committed and the address of the offender following release.  Section 9 of the Sex Offenders Act places an obligation on prison governors to inform the Garda of the impending release of a sex offender, at least 10 days in advance, and to remind the offender of his or her obligations under the legislation prior to release.  In addition to offenders approaching release, offenders who are going to court where there is a possibility of early release, such as a review of sentence or an appeal of length of sentence, must be informed of their obligations before they attend court.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, a convicted sex offender must notify his/her name(s), date of birth and current home address to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na within seven days of the conviction for the sexual offence concerned or, where the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, from the date of full release from prison.  The offender must also notify the Garda of any change of name or address within seven days of that change.  Notification of any address where the offender spends either as much as seven days or two or more periods amounting to seven days in any 12-month period must also be given to the Garda.  If the offender intends to leave the State for a period of seven days or more s/he must inform the Garda of this fact and the address at which s/he intends to stay and also notify the Garda of his/her return.</P>
        <P>The provisions of the Act extend to any sex offenders entering this jurisdiction from abroad who have an obligation to register in their own countries or who have been convicted abroad of an offence comparable to one covered by the Act.  It is an offence (Part 4) for convicted sex offenders to apply for, or to accept, work or to offer services, a necessary and regular part of which consists mainly of unsupervised access to, or contact with, children or mentally impaired persons, without informing the employer or organisation of his/her conviction for a qualifying sexual offence.  It is an offence to fail to comply with the notification requirements.  The Garda has a system in place to monitor people subject to the aforementioned requirements.</P>
        <P>A registered sex offender advisory group, comprising representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Northern Ireland Office, has been established.  As part of its work, the group evaluates the potential for sharing information, examines the registration criteria in both jurisdictions for sex offenders and identifies areas for further co-operation.  A protocol for the sharing of information on the management of sex offenders between the Probation Service and the Probation Board for Northern Ireland was signed by the heads of both organisations in March 2006.  The protocol established mutual arrangements for the management of sex offenders, subject to supervision by the respective services.  The protocol facilitates best practice and effective case management of sex offenders between jurisdictions by enabling the exchange of relevant information on a structured and agreed basis.  A Memorandum of Understanding on information sharing arrangements between Ireland and the UK relating to sex offenders was signed on 27 November 2006.  The rationale for the memorandum is that such information will be shared between police forces for the purposes of protecting the public from the risks presented by sex offenders &mdash; whether paedophile or otherwise &mdash; and investigating serious sexual offences.  The transmission of any information necessary to achieve these purposes is covered.</P>
        <P>In Northern Ireland and Scotland, a static assessment instrument is used to assess risk factors for reoffending which do not change through intervention, such as age, sex, number of previous convictions, gender and age of victim.  The system is known as MASRAM &mdash; Multi Agency Sex Offenders Risk Assessment and Management &mdash; in Northern Ireland and MAPPA &mdash; <Col N="531"/>Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements &mdash; in Scotland.  Static assessments are useful predictors for estimating the long-term recidivism potential of an offender.  The two jurisdictions have decided to supplement this assessment instrument (Risk Matrix 2000) with an additional instrument &mdash; Stable and Acute 2007 &mdash; which has been developed by Hanson and Harris.  This assessment tool allows for a dynamic and ongoing assessment of changes in an offender&rsquo;s situation that may increase his or her chances of reoffending.  These dynamic factors can be further broken down into &ldquo;stable&rdquo; factors, which reflect relatively enduring traits such as intimacy deficits, and &ldquo;acute&rdquo; factors, which can change rapidly, such as intense anger.  The combination of static assessment &mdash; Risk Matrix 2000 &mdash; and Stable and Acute assessment has been identified as the most comprehensive available for the effective management of sex offenders in the community in both Northern Ireland and Scotland.</P>
        <P>The Probation Service has committed to the introduction of the above assessment system in this jurisdiction in the coming year.  An implementation team is developing a plan for its introduction nationally.  Officers are receiving the necessary training and are already piloting its use.  Close liaison has been developed with both the Probation Board for Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Sex Offender Strategic Management Committee in relation to the 12-month pilot introduction of this system under MASRAM in Northern Ireland.  Contact with the Scottish Executive is also being established.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service continually review their processes to determine what measures may be taken to increase the number of offenders participating on the Sex Offenders programme.  In recent years, additional psychologists have been appointed to the Irish Prison Service.  The Service&rsquo;s staffing level is at an all-time high, as is the staffing level of the Probation Service.  These new psychologists play an important role in working with offenders to address their offending behaviour, including work with sex offenders aimed at enhancing their preparedness for possible participation on the Sex Offender Programme.  In addition, the Irish Prison Service is actively exploring the possibility of enhancing service provision to sex offenders in all institutions in the prison estate, in partnership with community based organisations which have expertise in this area.  Likewise, the Probation Service continues to monitor developments and best practice internationally in the management of sex offenders in the community, as evidenced by the introduction of the assessment tool that has been mentioned.  Probation Service staff continue to be actively involved in the delivery of community based programmes which specifically cater for the sex offender client group to address offending behaviour with a view to reducing recidivism.</P>

	<P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister, in his absolute discretion, may grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled.  These conditions are that the applicant must have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years.  In the context of naturalisation, certain periods of residence in the State are excluded.  These include periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the State, periods granted for the purposes of study and periods granted for the purposes of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act, 1996.  An application from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received in the Citizenship Section of my Department in November 2007.  On examination of the application it was determined that the person in question did not meet the above mentioned residency requirement.  A letter informing her of this was issued on 16 April 2008.  It is open to the person in question to lodge a new application if and when she is in a position to meet the statutory requirements applicable at that time.</P>

	<P>The person concerned and her infant daughter arrived in the State on 23 February 2006 and applied for asylum.  Their application was refused following consideration of their case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the people concerned were informed, by letter dated 24 November 2006, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of them.  They were given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  I should also mention that a person who has been refused refugee status and has been served with a notice of intention to deport is, since 10 October 2006, afforded a fourth option, viz. to apply for Subsidiary Protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 &mdash; Statutory Instrument No. 518 of 2006.</P>
        <P>Their case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement.  Consideration was given to representations submitted on their behalf for permission to remain in the State.  A Subsidiary Protection application lodged in respect of the mother was refused and this decision was communicated by letter dated 16 January 2008.  On 26 February 2008, my predecessor refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed Deportation Orders in respect of the people concerned.  Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring them to present themselves at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), <Col N="533"/>13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Thursday 27 March 2008 in order to make travel arrangements for their deportation from the State.  The people concerned failed to present themselves as required and were classified as evading their deportation.</P>
        <P>A request was made by a close relative of the people concerned directly to my immediate predecessor to review the case files with a view to revoking the Deportation Orders in respect of the people concerned.  On 9 May 2008, my predecessor decided against this course of action and instead directed that the Deportation Orders should remain in full force and effect.  The people concerned were advised of this decision by letter dated 14 May 2008 and, in addition, were advised to present themselves at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Tuesday, 27 May 2008 in order to make travel arrangements for their deportation from the State.  They presented as required and were given further presentation dates which they kept.  They are due to present again in October 2008.  The effect of the Deportation Orders is that the people concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Orders is an operational matter for the Bureau.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, applications for refugee status in the State are determined by an independent process comprising the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted.  While it is not the practice to comment in detail on individual asylum applications, I point out to the Deputy that delays in finalising cases can occur for a variety of reasons, including giving applicants and appellants the fullest opportunity possible to present their cases and the determination of Judicial Review proceedings, where appellants pursue such a course of action.  Where the latter is relevant, the time taken to discharge any proceedings is a matter for the Courts and is not something that I, as Minister, can comment on.  It is, of course, open to the applicant or the appellant to withdraw any Judicial Review proceedings which they may have instigated and this would allow for their appeal to be processed in the normal manner.</P>

Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), he was informed, by letter dated 16 June 2007, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006). The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.  In the event that the Subsidiary Protection application is refused, the case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will then be considered under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  When this latter consideration has been completed, the case file of the person concerned is passed to me for decision.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my many previous and comprehensive Replies in this matter.  As previously stated, the people concerned arrived in the State on 7 March 2005 and 1 July 2005 and applied for asylum.  Their applications were refused following the consideration of their cases by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  The people concerned, following refusal recommendations by the ORAC and the appeals tribunal on their asylum applications, were informed, by letters dated 27 September 2005 and 16 January 2006, that the Minister proposed to make deportation orders in respect of them and afforded them three options under Section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of deportation orders or to submit, within 15 working days, written representations setting out the reasons they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why they should not be deported.</P>
        <P>Their cases were examined having regard for the 11 factors specified in Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), including consideration of representations for temporary leave to remain in the State lodged on their behalf by their legal representatives.  Their cases were also considered having regard for the provisions of section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement.  Refoulement, in essence, relates to the safety of returning a person to their country of origin.  After their cases had been comprehensively assessed under all the relevant headings, on 27 February 2006, one of my predecessors signed Deportation Orders in respect of the people concerned. Notice of the Deportation Orders was served by registered post requiring the people concerned to present themselves to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on Thursday 9 March 2006 to make arrangements for their deportation from the State.  They failed to present themselves on that occasion, as required, and were thus classified as evading their deportation.  They should, therefore, present themselves to the GNIB without further delay.  The effect of the Deportation Orders is that the people concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter outside the State.  The current <Col N="537"/>position in respect of the husband and wife, the subject of this Question, is that an undertaking was given to the legal representatives acting on behalf of the wife by letter dated 26 April 2007 to the effect that her Deportation Order will not be enforced until such time as the asylum application of her infant son has been considered.  At present, Judicial Review proceedings have been instituted challenging the negative recommendation of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 18 December 2001. His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 8 January 2003, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.

Representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned and will be fully considered before the file is passed to me for decision.  The Deputy might wish to note that the person concerned also made an application for permission to remain in the State in accordance with the revised arrangements applicable to the non-EEA national parents of Irish born children, born in the State before 1 January 2005. The revised arrangements in question, commonly referred to as the IBC/05 scheme, were announced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 15 January 2005 and the closing date for receipt of applications was 31 March 2005.  The application of the person concerned was received on 13 February 2006 and, as such, was received much too late for consideration.  The person concerned was made aware of the non-acceptance of his IBC/05 application by letter dated 16 February 2006.</P>

Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by <Col N="538"/>letter dated 24 November 2006, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  I should also mention that a person who has been refused refugee status and has been served with a notice of intention to deport is, since 10 October 2006, afforded a fourth option, viz. to apply for Subsidiary Protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 &mdash; Statutory Instrument No. 518 of 2006.</P>
        <P>Her case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement.  Consideration was given to representations submitted on her behalf for permission to remain in the State.  A Subsidiary Protection application lodged in respect of the person concerned was refused and this decision was communicated by letter dated 10 January 2008.  On 6 May 2008, my immediate predecessor refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of the person concerned. Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring her to present herself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Tuesday, 3 June 2008 in order to make travel arrangements for her deportation from the State.  The person concerned presented as required and was given further presentation dates which she kept.  She is due to present again shortly.  The current position in respect of the person concerned is that an undertaking was given to the legal representatives acting on her behalf by letter dated 16 June 2008 to the effect that her deportation order will not be enforced until such time as the asylum application of her infant son has been considered.  The effect of the Deportation Order is that person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the GNIB.</P>

Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 30 June 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 19 December 2003.  Following investigation by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, it was established that the person concerned had previously made an asylum application in the United Kingdom and, as such, a determination was made that the person concerned should be transferred to the UK to have his asylum application examined there.  This determination was upheld following an appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Consequently, a transfer order was signed in respect of the person concerned on 1 March 2004.  This order was subsequently served on the person concerned, by letter dated 2 July 2004, which placed a legal obligation on him to present himself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), on Monday, 12 July 2004, to make arrangements for his formal transfer to the United Kingdom.  The person concerned failed to present on this occasion and was therefore classified as having evaded his transfer. The person concerned became illegally resident in this State at that time.</P>
        <P>The person concerned continued to evade his transfer with the consequence that the Transfer Order expired leaving Ireland responsible for processing the asylum application of the person concerned.  At this point the case of the person concerned was referred back to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner to have his asylum claims investigated.   Subsequently, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner made a recommendation that the person concerned be refused a declaration of refugee status.  This recommendation was, on appeal, upheld by the Refugee Appeal Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 23 June 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1033 and 1034 together.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, to which Ireland is a party, all ships enjoy the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea.  All ships, therefore, are entitled to enter the territorial sea without prior notification or consent, provided <Col N="544"/>that their passage is not prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal state.  The right applies to submarines on the condition that they must navigate on the surface and show their flag.  Accordingly, the issue of permission, conditions or assurances does not arise in such circumstances.  With regard to the deployment of the <i>LE Orla</i> to Broadhaven Bay, which is a matter for the Department of Defence, I have been informed by that Department that the vessel was deployed to the area on foot of an Aid to the Civil Power request from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Moreover, the Department of Defence has no knowledge of any British Navy manoeuvres in the area in question.</P>

	<P>While my Department has an overall co-ordinating role in European Union matters, responsibility for incorporating EU legislation into Irish law rests with individual Departments in their respective areas of responsibility.  In Ireland&rsquo;s years of our EU membership, a large proportion of primary and secondary legislation has originated from agreements reached at EU level.  It is not possible to put a precise percentage on this.  EU measures emerge from negotiations in which Ireland plays a full part and in which Irish interests are satisfactorily accommodated.  When agreement has been reached at EU level, it is vital that the agreed measures be properly transposed into national law.  Over the last 35 years, EU measures have inspired much beneficial legislation in Ireland.  For example, the ending of discrimination against married women in the public service came about from the Equal Pay and Equal Treatment Directives which were adopted soon after Ireland&rsquo;s entry into the then EEC.  In addition, agreements made at EU level have shaped the development and evolution of Irish environmental law in areas such as water and air quality, improving waste management and protecting our countryside.  Furthermore, Irish legislation designed to give effect to the European Single Market has facilitated the free movement of people, services, goods and capital which has served to enhance our national prosperity.</P>

	<P>In the Programme for Government, the Government makes a commitment to expanding Ireland&rsquo;s Overseas Aid Programme.  It has set a target of spending 0.7% of GNP on Official Development Assistance, ODA, by 2012.  In 2008, the Government has allocated approximately &euro;900 million to ODA.  The majority of this funding &mdash; &euro;769 million &mdash; comes under Vote 29, International Co-operation, which is managed by my Department, through Irish Aid.  A further estimated &euro;130 million will be spent by other Departments and through Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the EU Development Co-operation Budget.  Expenditure on ODA in 2008 will be the highest in the history of the programme, which we estimate will be approximately 0.54 % of GNP.  This level of spending will ensure that Ireland remains one of the most generous donors in the world on a <i>per capita</i> basis, demonstrates our firm commitment to the developing world and is a clear indication that we are on track to meet the UN target.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1037 and 1067 together.</P>
        <P>I have in principle welcomed the agreement signed on 15 September by Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s Zanu-PF party and the two factions of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), as have my EU colleagues.  Ireland will reserve full judgment on this agreement until we have a clear picture of the allocation of Ministerial portfolios; and until we see evidence that the commitment and goodwill shown in brokering this agreement transfer into implementation.  We will need to see how the proposed arrangements, especially the duplicate cabinet / Council of Ministers structures, will work out in practice.  We will wish to be assured that violence and intimidation against opposition supporters and activists has ceased, and that the political and economic recovery of Zimbabwe can begin.  I hope the administration which has emerged will reflect the mandate of 27 March last from the Zimbabwean people and fully respect their democratic will.  It is on this basis that we will judge the value of the agreement, though we very much hope that it will turn out to be a most positive development for this long-suffering country, marking the beginning of a new era for it.  EU Foreign Ministers will return to the situation in Zimbabwe in October, to discuss what progress has been made by that time.  In the meantime, the EU has neither imposed new restrictive measures; nor has it lifted those already in place.</P>
        <P>The investment of Government funds by State agencies is a matter for Ministers whose Departments have responsibility for those agencies, such as my colleague the Minister for Finance in respect of the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  With regard to the National Pensions Reserve Fund, the issues raised relate to investments in a number of multinational companies which have operations across the globe, including Zimbabwe and indeed, in most cases, Ireland.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission is raising with these companies the concerns which have been expressed about their operations in Zimbabwe, taking into account of course the new and developing situation in this country.  The National Pension Reserve Fund Commission&rsquo;s investment mandate, as set out in section 19 of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000, provides that the fund shall be invested to secure the optimal financial return provided the level of risk to the moneys invested is acceptable to the Commission.  I understand that the Fund has gone as far as possible in accordance with its statutory investment mandate to adopt and implement a responsible investment policy and is actively pursuing a policy of engaging with companies on environmental, social and governance issues.  In July 2007 it appointed Hermes Equity Ownership Services to execute proxy votes and engage with companies on its behalf across its global equity portfolio.</P>

	<P>Vehicles for use by Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic missions, including the Irish Aid programme, are purchased in line with State procurement guidelines, with particular regard to the overriding principles of safety and security.  Vehicles purchased by Irish Aid for use in the developing countries in which they operate, are of necessity mostly all-terrain, 4-wheel drive vehicles, such as the Toyota Landcruiser.  Vehicles purchased for head of mission use elsewhere tend to be mid-range, standard, executive saloon cars with a strong preference for diesel models, where appropriate to local conditions and circumstances. In addition, there are also three vans in use by my Department in Dublin.  The following table details the numbers and costs of official vehicles purchased by my Department in 2006, 2007 and 2008 to date:</P>

        <P FLI="0">Since the beginning of 2006, carbon emissions have been taken into account in vehicle purchases made by the Department.  In the time available, it has not been possible to compile a complete list of the carbon dioxide emissions of the Department&rsquo;s official vehicles abroad.  In June of this year, to take account of the wider availability of new technologies, my Department issued an updated policy on the purchase of official vehicles worldwide.  This will ensure that environmental considerations are taken fully into account as existing vehicles are replaced, which is normally done at four year intervals.  This revised policy will enable us to record the carbon dioxide emissions of all official vehicle purchases in the future.  One vehicle purchase has been made since the introduction of the new policy: a BMW 525IA with carbon dioxide emissions of 174g\km, for the official use of our embassy in Singapore.  Our vehicle procurement policy is kept under regular review and will be refined as needed, to ensure we keep pace with technological developments and best practice in the area of vehicle emissions.</P>

	<P>No State agencies are operating under the responsibility of my Department.  I can inform the Deputy that three advisory committees and one educational commission come under the aegis of the Department.  The Development Education Advisory Committee was set up in 2003 following a recommendation made by the Ireland Aid Review Committee.  Its purpose is to advise the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development and Irish Aid on policy regarding development education.  The Government Emigrant Services Advisory Committee, previously known as D&iacute;on, was set up in 1984 to advise the Government on the welfare of the Irish community in Britain.  The committee&rsquo;s primary role is to advise on the distribution of Government financial support to voluntary agencies providing front line services and community care to Irish people in Britain.  The advisory board for Irish Aid was established in August 2002 to provide general oversight and advice to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State for Overseas Development on the strategic direction of the Government&rsquo;s programme of assistance to developing countries.  The Fulbright Commission, also known as the board of the <Col N="547"/>Ireland &mdash; United States Commission for Educational Exchange, finances study, research, teaching and other educational activities between Ireland and the United States of America.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1042, 1045, 1046, 1053 and 1058 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a long tradition, dating back 17 years, of hosting children from Belarus for holiday periods with the agreement of the Belarussian authorities.  Ireland can be proud of this generous response to those affected by the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl.  I warmly commend the various charities and host families for their tireless work on behalf of the children from the affected area.  As the mark of the Government&rsquo;s support for the work of the Chernobyl Children&rsquo;s Project International, Irish Aid committed &euro;600,000 over three years in March 2008 for the development of day care centres in Belarus.  More recently, on my instructions, the Irish ambassador to Moscow, who is also accredited to Minsk, travelled to the Belarussian capital on 9 September to register with the Belarussian authorities the Government&rsquo;s concern about the suspension of the visits by children from Belarus to Ireland.  In addition, at my invitation, the charg&eacute; d&rsquo;affaires of the embassy of the Republic of Belarus travelled to Dublin on 11 September to discuss with me ways of overcoming the suspension.  The charg&eacute; d&rsquo;affaires also met officials from my Department and the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</P><Col N="567"/>
        <P>Following contact with my colleagues, the Attorney General and the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, I instructed officials in my Department to start immediate negotiations with the Belarussian authorities on an international agreement on the recuperation of Belarussian children in Ireland.  I am confident that it will be possible to conclude negotiations on this agreement quickly despite differences in the legal and administrative systems in Ireland and Belarus.  In the meantime, I have conveyed to the Government of Belarus our strong hope that, while negotiations are continuing, it can agree to allow the visits by the children from Chernobyl to go ahead next Christmas.</P>

	<P>I am very concerned about the case of Bishop Jia Zhiguo, who was rearrested on 24th August in Zhengding. Though he was allowed to return home on 18th September, he is currently under house arrest.  Bishop Jia Zhiguo has been the subject of repeated arrests over a great many years.</P>
        <P>His case has been raised on a number of occasions with the Chinese authorities through the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, including at the most recent round of the dialogue which was held in Brdo, Slovenia on 15th May last. This Dialogue is the agreed formal framework through which the EU raises human rights issues, as well as individual cases of concern. My Department will seek to ensure that his case is raised again at the next Dialogue meeting, which is expected to take place at the end of November. We will also raise the case bilaterally with the Chinese authorities.</P>
        <P>Human rights are a constant and important subject of dialogue with the Chinese Government at bilateral as well as at EU level. In our contacts with the authorities we continually stress the importance the Government attaches to issues such as freedom of expression and freedom of religion.  My Department will continue to monitor the situation of Bishop Jia Zhiguo. It is particularly disappointing that he should have been rearrested so soon after the end of the Olympic Games. His age and state of health give grounds for particular concern.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Advertising undertaken by my Department in Ireland typically includes advisory notices on public opening hours over holiday periods, changes in passport application procedures and fees, recruitment notices and public information notices relating to Ireland&rsquo;s official aid programme. My Department&rsquo;s policy is to keep advertising costs to a minimum and much of this material is now placed on the Department&rsquo;s Website. However, a certain amount of advertising continues to be necessary, in order to reach all of our customers, particularly in relation to important passport and consular services. Since 2003, all advertisements are either bilingual or run simultaneously in the Irish Language media, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>Advertising is charged on a per cm/column basis and the cost of the Irish language element of advertisements is not specifically identified or recorded when making payment. As a result, it is not possible to disaggregate the Irish language element of such costs. However, the following table shows my Department&rsquo;s overall expenditure on advertising, for each year since 2003 and, given the usual bilingual nature of the advertisements placed, approximately 50% of these costs would relate to the Irish language element. In addition, my Department has incurred some expenditure in specific Irish Language media. These are also shown in the table, in respect of the two votes for which my Department is responsible: Vote 28 (Foreign Affairs) and Vote 29 (International Cooperation), which funds the Irish Aid Programme.</P>

        <P>As has been made repeatedly clear, the Government is completely opposed to the practice of the extraordinary rendition of prisoners. The Government has received specific assurances from the US authorities that such prisoners have not been transferred through Irish territory, nor would they be, without our permission. These assurances have been confirmed at the highest level, including by Secretary of State Rice to my predecessor as Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Dermot Ahern T.D., and by President Bush to the former Taoiseach. The assurances are of a clear and categoric nature, relating to facts and circumstances within the full knowledge and control of the US Government. I am satisfied that it is appropriate for the Government to rely fully on these assurances.</P>

	<P>There are four bodies operating under the aegis of my Department. Details on these four bodies are set out below: Development Education Advisory Committee was established in 2003 following the recommendations of the Ireland Aid Review Committee. Its purpose is to advise the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister of State for Overseas Development and Irish Aid on policy regarding development education; Government Emigrant Services Advisory Committee (previously known as D&iacute;on) was set up in 1984 to advise the Government on the welfare of the Irish community in Britain.  The Committee&rsquo;s primary role is to advise on the distribution of Government financial support to voluntary agencies providing front line services and community care to Irish people in Britain; the Advisory Board for Irish Aid was established in August 2002 to provide general oversight and advice to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State for Overseas Development on the strategic direction of the Government&rsquo;s programme of assistance to developing countries; and the Fulbright Commission (The Board of the Ireland &mdash; United <Col N="571"/>States Commission for Educational Exchange) finances study, research, teaching and other educational activities between Ireland and the United States of America.</P>
        <P>Three of these bodies are Advisory Committees, serviced by the staff of my Department and, therefore, have no Chief Executive. The management of the Fulbright Commission, to which my Department provides an annual grant in aid, enjoys full autonomy of management and administration in accordance with the Educational Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Act, 1991.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government continues to attach a very high priority to finding a solution for our undocumented citizens in the United States.  At the same time, we have also argued that the long term strength of our bilateral relationship with the United States would benefit greatly by the establishment of new immigration arrangements which would facilitate greater legal migration between the two countries, an approach which was endorsed in the all-party motion passed in November 2007.</P>
        <P>On a visit to Washington DC and New York this week, I will be meeting with senior US political leaders and the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform to push for early progress following the US Presidential and Congressional elections.  In particular I will be advocating a three pronged approach involving: a solution for our undocumented; new bilateral arrangements to provide reciprocal long term working visas (known as E3s) and a new Working Holiday Agreement which will enable at least 20,000 Irish citizens in, or recently graduated from, post secondary education to work and travel in the US for up to 12 months. Intensive discussions are continuing in relation to the latter.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to avail of every possible opportunity to highlight the importance of this issue in our contacts with US Administration and political figures.</P>

	<P>Consular assistance was provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs, to the person mentioned by the Deputy, when her father <Col N="573"/>died in Mostar, through the Irish Embassy in Slovenia, which is also accredited to Bosnia-Herzegovina.</P>
        <P>On 26 May, the Irish Embassy Ljubljana was informed that the death had occurred of an Irish national in Mostar. The Consular Section of my Department offered consular assistance to the nominated family member here in Ireland of the deceased person, and our Embassy in Ljubljana immediately liaised with the undertakers and assisted in the translation of relevant medical reports to ensure the speedy repatriation of the remains to Ireland. The remains of the person were repatriated to Ireland on 30 May.</P>
        <P>On becoming aware of the concerns expressed by the family of the deceased in relation to the medical treatment he received while in the hospital in Mostar, our Ambassador made further urgent enquiries about the case with the medical authorities there. The subsequent statements received from the hospital were forwarded, with an unofficial translation by the Embassy, to the family. The family have also been informed of the offer from the Head of Neurological Clinic in Mostar, through our Embassy, of her willingness to discuss on a professional basis with an Irish doctor, of their choosing, the case. I believe that this may be helpful in responding to the family&rsquo;s concerns and worries, and again I would like, through the Deputy, to offer my sincerest sympathy to the family.</P>

	<P>The total cost of copy writing, designing and printing the Irish Aid Annual Report for 2007 was &euro;39,846. The cost of the Report is met from the public information budget of the Irish Aid programme under Vote 29 of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
        <P>The Annual Report plays a key role in informing the public about the programmes, activities and partner organisations funded through our official overseas development assistance and the impact of this spending in tackling global poverty. The importance of providing public information on the aid programme has been highlighted on many occasions.</P>
        <P>The Annual Report is mainly distributed via the Irish Aid website. Printed copies are also forwarded to members of the Oireachtas, non-governmental organisations, Embassies and on request to members of the public. Copies of the Report are also available at the Irish Aid Volunteering and Information Centre.</P>

	<P>The establishment of the Irish Abroad Unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs in 2004 has greatly enhanced our capacity to develop and implement policies to support the Irish community overseas, in particular elderly people and those at risk of social exclusion.</P>
        <P>My Department remains very supportive of the excellent work of the Safe Home programme. The award of a &euro;249,900 grant in April of this year brought the Department&rsquo;s total funding for the Safe Home programme since 2005 to over &euro;900,000. In 2007, additional Government funding, totalling &euro;72,000, was also awarded to the Safe Home Programme by the Department of Environment and Local Government and the Department of Social and Family Affairs. This substantial funding is testament to the high value which the Government places on the work performed by the Safe Home programme in enabling elderly Irish emigrants to return to live in Ireland.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has progressively increased the level of funding available for emigrant services in recent years, from &euro;3 million in 2003 to a record &euro;15.183 million this year. These significant increases have enabled the Emigrant Support Programme, administered by the Irish Abroad Unit, to provide far greater financial support to the most vulnerable members of our overseas communities.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, all grant applications for Emigrant Support funding are reviewed on their respective merits each year. However, I can assure the Deputy that my Department will maintain the current very significant level of funding to frontline welfare organisations in the period ahead.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I am very conscious of the need to achieve value for money on consultancy expenditure. The Department commissions consultancies only where specialised knowledge and/or skills are not available within the Department and, particularly in the case of Irish Aid (Ireland&rsquo;s official development assistance programme), where an independent evaluation of programmes and projects is required. Given the overall scale of the Irish Aid Programme, this level of monitoring, review and evaluation is both prudent and proportionate.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1068 and 1069 together.</P>
        <P>The Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund was established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 for the purpose of giving support to both racing industries. Under the provisions of the Act, the Fund receives a guaranteed level of finance based on excise duty on off-course betting in the preceding year, subject to a minimum level based on the year 2000 amount adjusted for inflation. Any shortfall in the amount generated by the excise duty is made up by direct Exchequer subvention.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, 80% and 20% of the moneys paid into the Fund each year are distributed between Horse Racing Ireland (HRI) and Bord na gCon respectively.</P>
        <P>The funding allocated to HRI and Bord na gCon from the Fund is not earmarked for specific purposes.  Since 2001, income from the Fund has been used by both bodies towards increasing prize money levels, meeting administration and integrity costs alongside a programme of capital investment which has underpinned a growth in both sectors.  Details of the projects which have been funded by HRI and Bord na gCon from the proceeds of the fund would be available from the agencies.</P>
        <P>The rationale of the Fund was that horse and greyhound racing needed certainty in relation to its funding support on a multi-annual basis and that such funding to develop the industries should be derived from the duty generated from off-course betting. Prior to 2001 the Horse <Col N="578"/>and Greyhound Racing Bodies were funded with annual grant-in-aid allocations as well as a fixed fee from off-course betting and 0.3% of turnover from off-course betting.</P>
        <P>In 2004, the Government put in place regulations to increase the limit of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund from &euro;254m to &euro;550m to continue the Fund for a further four years to 2008.  The current round of the Fund is due to expire at the end of 2008. A review of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund is currently underway. Any extension of the Fund will require the approval of the Government and the Oireachtas (the level of the Fund is increased by Regulations made by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance).  The details of the Fund allocations from 2001 to date are as set out in the following tabular form. </P>

	<P>The organisation referred to by the Deputy receives funding from the Arts Council in respect of its activities.  As Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism I am committed to securing the best possible funding for the Arts Council and the arts sector generally. The Arts Council&rsquo;s funding requirement for the year ahead will be addressed in the context of the 2009 Estimates. In doing so, the Government must balance competing demands from all other sectors of our economy and society.  Funding for the Arts Council has increased from &euro;47.67m in 2002 to &euro;81.6m this year &mdash; an increase of over 71%. These are significant amounts of money in any context. This funding has transformed the arts, increasing access to and participation in the arts, and has provided an excellent platform for future development.  My policy on the arts is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, increase access to and participation in the arts and make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life.</P>

	<P>The club in question was provisionally allocated &euro;140,000 under the Sports Capital Programme in 2006.  The guidelines, terms and conditions for the programme specify that the Department will pay grants in stages as an approved project proceeds by reimbursing the applicant&rsquo;s costs when they submit original, paid, valid invoices or certificates of payment. The Department typically pays 70% of the value of the valid paid invoices submitted. In addition, the Department reserves 5% of the grant <Col N="579"/>pending confirmation from a consultant or architect that the facility has been satisfactorily completed in all respects.</P>
        <P>In the case of the club in question, the Department authorised the payment of &euro;133,000, or 95% of the grant, on 29 July 2008.  At the time of payment the club did not have sufficient invoices to draw down the entire amount and permission was given to apply the outstanding balance of the grant to the cost of additional field works.  In order for the balance of the funding to be drawn down, it is necessary that  valid, paid invoices for the additional work carried out now be submitted and a letter from the grantee&rsquo;s technical supervisor confirming that the all works have been completed in full.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1072 to 1090, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I am setting out a schedule which lists each of the relevant tourism commitments and the progress thereon pertaining to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and the bodies under its aegis.</P>
<P el="10"> <i>Provide &euro;300 million to assist the industry, tourism agencies and local authorities in delivering the ambitious world-class product outlined in F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s Tourism Product Development Strategy 2007-2013.</i></P>
        <P el="0"> <i>Progress to date:</i></P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />An allocation of &euro;137 million has been provided under the National Development Plan, 2007-2013, to support, by way of grants through F&aacute;ilte Ireland, investment in tourism infrastructure, attractions and activity products over the Plan period.  An additional allocation of &euro;180 million has been provided under the NDP for the construction and operation of the National Conference Centre in Spencer Dock in Dublin.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />To date, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has mostly targeted infrastructure provision (e.g., walking and cycling routes, beach management works, access to angling waters etc) by local authorities.  Up to early September 2008, grants totalling over &euro;25 million were announced for expenditure on projects around the country.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Separately, grants totalling almost &euro;2.2 million were approved in September 2008 under F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s Historic Towns Initiative, for the further development of historic walking trails in 35 towns around the country.</P><Col N="582"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />As the Plan continues, the focus of the investment will move towards investment in Visitor Attractions and the expansion of various commercial Visitor Activities.  This programme is known as the Tourism Capital Investment Programme (TCIP), and applications for funding were invited before the end of April 2008.  This Programme will provide support for the development of major visitor attractions and visitor activities.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&aacute;ilte Ireland received almost 150 applications under the TCIP, which were evenly split between Attractions and Activities.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s priority is to firstly evaluate the attractions seeking upgrading, and to assess activity projects put forward by the private sector subsequently.</P>
        <P el="10"> <i>Place much greater emphasis on the protection, conservation, interpretation and access to Ireland&rsquo;s natural and built heritage.</i></P>
        <P el="5"> <i>Progress to date:</i></P>
        <P el="0"><Miles com="bull66" />F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s Tourism Product Development Strategy 2007&ndash;2013 was subject to an environmental assessment. Issues around protection, conservation, interpretation and access to Ireland&rsquo;s natural and built heritage are a key part of the Strategy with specific actions scheduled to be rolled out as appropriate.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&aacute;ilte Ireland has also adopted an Environmental Action Plan which provides a framework for its work in sustainable tourism development over the period 2007-2009.</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Under the TCIP, investment in Visitor Attractions will concentrate on bringing alive and increasing visitor access to our natural and built heritage.</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Environmental conservation and sustainable design provisions have been incorporated into the guidelines for the assessment of projects under the mid-Shannon Corridor Tourism Infrastructure Scheme which was launched by An Taoiseach in June 2008.</P>
        <P el="10"> <i>Deepen North/South cooperation in tourism, building in particular on the success of Tourism Ireland as a dynamic and innovative cross-border body leading the way on mutually advantageous all-island economic co-operation.</i></P>
        <P el="5"> <i>Progress to date:</i></P>
        <P el="0"><Miles com="bull66" />North South Ministerial Council Tourism Sectoral Meetings were held on 8th November 2007 in Dublin Castle and 29th May 2008 in Enniskillen. At the November 2007 meeting agreement was reached on Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s Business Plan for 2008 and a Corporate Plan for the period 2008-2010.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board have produced an agreed paper on tourism priorities, under PEACE/INTERREG funding. Advertisements inviting applications for funding for suitable projects were published earlier this year and applications are currently being examined.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Tourism Ireland markets the island of Ireland as a holiday destination in over 20 markets across the world. Northern Ireland is presented prominently in all of Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s global destination marketing campaigns which reach a potential audience worldwide of 200 million each year.</P><Col N="583"/>
        <P el="10"> <i>Establish, through F&aacute;ilte Ireland, an innovation fund to promote and support the development of tourism products that are new to the Irish market and to promote best practice, particularly in terms of environmental sustainability and accessibility for tourists with disabilities.</i></P>
        <P el="5"> <i>Progress to date:</i></P>
        <P el="0"><Miles com="bull66" />F&aacute;ilte Ireland have launched an innovation fund which offers assistance in respect of feasibility studies for innovative tourism products.  This fund complements a range of other product development schemes which have been launched over the past year to support tourism infrastructure, attractions and activity projects, with an emphasis on innovation and environmental sustainability.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&aacute;ilte Ireland has brought tourism suppliers together on a pilot basis in the South East region to innovate a &ldquo;Family Fun&rdquo; product, and will be rolling out further initiatives elsewhere for product offerings based on Adventure and Celtic Culture.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />In line with its Environmental Action Plan 2007-2009, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has published a Review of Good Environmental Policy and Practice in the Tourism Sector.</P>
        <P el="10"> <i>Develop with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, rural-based package-style holidays through which B &amp; B owners and Farm Holiday operators can offer activities such as walking, angling, golfing and cycling in addition to the provision of accommodation and quality home-cooked meals.</i></P>
        <P el="5"> <i>Progress to date:</i></P>
        <P el="0"><Miles com="bull66" />A partnership of the Town and County Homes Association (TCHA) and Irish Farm Holidays (IFH) has come together, with the encouragement of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, to develop a number of theme-based holiday packages. Over 30 B&amp;B owners in 14 counties have been selected and have agreed their specialist areas. The owners participated in a series of workshops between November 2007 and March 2008. F&aacute;ilte Ireland has continued to build on the initiatives and supports developed and tested in 2007 and the early months of 2008.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Irish Home Operators are being encouraged to become members of regional activity hubs. To date an adventure hub has been established in Cork/Kerry, a family-friendly hub in the South East, a rural activity hub in the Glen of Aherlow, a salmon centre of excellence in Ballina and a cultural hub in the Western islands of Inishturk, Inishbofin and Clare Island. A further heritage initiative in the Boyne Valley area is at the early stages of development.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Over the last year, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has financed a &euro;0.5 million programme of marketing and support for the small accommodation sector which has focused on the development and enhancement of e-Business capability and providing operators with supports to target and develop new business. This has resulted in significant investment in websites, booking systems, search engine marketing campaigns and targeted promotions in key trade and consumer events.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&aacute;ilte Ireland has established the Irish Homes Bed and Breakfast Working Group with an independent Chair to develop recommendations on the strategic development of the sector. The group includes representatives of the B&amp;B sector as well as officials from both F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Northern Irish Tourist Board.  This group has met a number of times since May 2008 and is in the process of developing and recommending an action <Col N="584"/>plan to drive the growth of the sector in the context of the competitive tourism market and the evolving needs of consumers. It is expected that the Group&rsquo;s final report will be available by the end of 2008.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />It is anticipated that the report will include recommendations for further development and promotion of themed based holiday experiences and packages. The &ldquo;Report on Standards and Quality Options for the B&amp;B Sector in Ireland&rdquo;, published by the B&amp;B Associations in August will be a useful contribution to this work.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The marketing and communications plan for 2009 and beyond will be informed by this report in addition to further consumer research commissioned by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The training and development programme for the end of 2008 and 2009 will include additional eBusiness programmes for operators and more specialist workshops to encourage operators to add value to the guest experience in areas such as food, outdoor activity and special interest groups.</P>
        <P el="10"> <i>Develop a rolling programme of national culture, musical and literary festivals to enhance the Irish tourism product, in particular through the establishment of a new fund of &euro;28 million for the creation of a small number of major annual events over the period to 2013.</i></P>
        <P el="5"> <i>Progress to date:</i></P>
        <P el="0"><Miles com="bull66" />F&aacute;ilte Ireland is committed to continued support for a number of key festivals in 2008 and subsequent years under the Festivals and Cultural Events Initiative, the primary aim of which is to encourage the spatial spread of visitors throughout the country by strategically investing in attractive and sustainable festivals and cultural events that enhance the local tourism product and in turn expand regional tourism.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Initiative operates by supporting existing and new festivals and cultural events throughout the regions which can best assist in achieving F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s objective of providing new and enhanced attractions for visitors both from overseas and from within Ireland.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Under the Festivals and Events programme, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has introduced a tiered investment model that enables it to offer multi-annual funding to key festivals across many regions of the country.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Over &euro;3 million has been committed to level 1 and level 2 festivals for 2008 with a further &euro;0.8 million allocated to smaller festivals by the regional tourism offices. This figure includes funds awarded to 16 festivals under the regularly funded scheme which will end in 2009. These 16 festivals were identified as major national festivals that can add significant benefit to the economy in their area and include festivals from a broad spectrum of arts disciplines.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />After the acclaimed success of the re-Joyce and Beckett Festivals, in 2007 the Department supported the 50th anniversary of the Dublin Theatre Festival.  This year it is supporting the centenary of the Hugh Lane Gallery, the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Gate Theatre, the Quadcentenary of the Flight of the Earls, and the Bicentenary of Thomas Moores&rsquo; Melodies.</P><Col N="585"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />In light of their value to cultural tourism it is proposed to continue funding appropriate and commemorative cultural initiatives in the future.  For example, the Department is currently providing seed funding for a major visual arts festival in Dublin in 2010 under the broad aegis of the Irish Museum of Modern Art.</P>
        <P el="10"> <i>Work with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland to capitalise on the beauty of the Irish countryside and promote Ireland as a healthy activity holiday destination for walking, cycling, angling, golfing, sailing, equestrian and marine holidays.</i></P>
        <P el="5"> <i>Progress to date:</i></P>
       <P el="0"><Miles com="bull66" />A fund of approximately  &euro;28 million has been earmarked under the Tourism Development Programme of the NDP for F&aacute;ilte Ireland to support investment in a set of outdoor and other activity pursuits.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&aacute;ilte Ireland issued a call earlier this year for applications for investment support under the Tourism Capital Investment Programme for new activity pursuits for tourists.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Failte Ireland, in consultation with industry partners, has reviewed marketing strategies for activity and special interest holidays. Activities such as walking, cycling and angling provide excellent opportunities for tourists to visit and stay in rural areas. Looped walking routes, cycle hubs and improved angling infrastructure developed with NDP funding is being marketed internationally in partnership with Tourism Ireland and the tourism industry.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Building on the impetus generated by the hosting of the Ryder Cup in Ireland and the potential offered by the forthcoming Solheim Cup, growth in golfing holidays is being targeted through co-ordinated marketing campaigns designed to promote bundled value offers, &ldquo;hidden gems&rdquo; golf courses and &lsquo;trophy&rsquo; themed tours.</P>
        <P el="10"> <i>Invest &euro;335 million under the National Development Plan in marketing Irish Tourism.</i></P>
        <P el="5"> <i>Progress to date:</i></P>
       <P el="0"><Miles com="bull66" />Tourism Ireland implements an extensive marketing programme each year for the island of Ireland in Great Britain, Mainland Europe, North America and in New and Developing Markets. In 2007, overseas visitor numbers and revenue earnings increased by 4% and 4.5% respectively in the South. In the first half of 2008 CSO Statistics show an increase of 2.5%in overseas visitor numbers.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />In the context of Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s 2008-2010 corporate plan, the objective is to continue to seek to win market share from our competitors. The plan sets the target of generating &euro;16 billion for the island of Ireland in overseas revenue over the three-year period.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Tourism Services budget of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism for 2008 is &euro;170 million, including &euro;50 million specifically for overseas marketing &mdash; the largest ever tourism marketing budget.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Tourism Ireland has completed a fundamental review of Tourism Brand Ireland in 2007 to ensure that the brand proposition will continue to resonate with visitors into the future having regard to the changes that have taken place in Ireland and the world marketplace <Col N="586"/>in the interim. New advertising and promotional materials will be produced in 2008 for rollout in 2009.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland have worked closely in developing a regional marketing strategy to help support a wider spread of overseas visitors across the island. This strategy highlights ease of access and the variety of things to do and see, particularly in the regions.</P>
        <P el="10"> <i>Seize the opportunities presented by the Open Skies arrangement with the US to substantially increase the number of US visitors. To this end, we will provide significant infrastructural development in the Mid West area, as well as marketing support to the Shannon region for a transitional period to help consolidate existing markets and develop new sources of business.</i></P>
        <P el="5"> <i>Progress to date:</i></P>

       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A special  &euro;3 million overseas marketing programme, designed to address the challenges to the Shannon Airport catchment area post Open Skies, was launched in February 2008.  The marketing programme is the result of close collaboration between Tourism Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and a Tourism Working Group which has been specifically formed for this purpose. The new campaign &mdash; &ldquo;Discover Ireland&rsquo;s Wonderful West&rdquo; &mdash; highlights the many attractions of the Western regions from Kerry to Donegal, including ease of direct access from many gateway cities, the good value fares and inclusive packages available, as well as showcasing a range of compelling offers from local industry.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Mid-Shannon Corridor Tourism Infrastructure Investment Scheme was launched by An Taoiseach in June 2008.  Since then, the Board, which will approve and certify projects submitted under the Scheme, has commenced its work, supported by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Shannon Development, and the agencies have also organised several information seminars with tax practitioners and tourism operators to outline operational details of the Scheme.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s strategy, &ldquo;North America; Land of Opportunity&rdquo; was launched by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism in 2006 and seeks to attract a significant increase in visitor numbers to the island by the year 2009.</P>

       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Co-operative campaigns were implemented with a range of carriers in 2007, including Aer Lingus, Ryanair, Aer Arann and Easyjet, and are being continued in 2008. In addition cooperative campaigns have been implemented with sea carriers such as Stena, Irish Ferries and P&amp;O.</P><Col N="587"/>

       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />An eBusiness programme for small and medium accommodation providers has been designed to help operators promote their business online and sell more rooms through this channel. The programme is offered at two levels, Introductory, for those with little or no knowledge of the internet or email and at intermediate level, which will encourage operators to use the tools of the internet to grow and develop their business. Over 30 programmes, catering for over 350 operators took place between May and the end of June 2008. It is planned to deliver over 40 additional programmes, targeting over 500 businesses from October 2008 to June 2009.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&aacute;ilte Ireland recently launched a new Web support initiative aimed at assisting tourism SMEs in the area of e-business and web development.  This initiative is part of a broader e-business strategy designed to support SMEs in developing their web capability.  Last year over a half of tourists who came to Ireland used the internet to plan their holiday and this is projected to increase to 75% by 2010.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The first phase of the F&aacute;ilte Ireland Web Support Initiative &ldquo;WEB-CHECK&rdquo; is well under way with 200 SMEs currently taking part in the programme. The businesses involved reflect the broad spectrum of the tourism industry with B&amp;Bs, self catering, equestrian, activity, golf, hotels and attractions all actively engaged in the initiative.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />WEB-CHECK essentially involves an SME being partnered with an e-business specialist who works onsite for one full day with the individual business in identifying e-business/web needs while providing guidance towards the appropriate solutions. Participating businesses gain practical, one to one advice from an expert who helps the individual SME through the process in order to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />WEB-BUILD, the second phase of the initiative which will be launched later in 2008 will allow for the implementation of the agreed improvement measures as identified in WEB-CHECK. It is anticipated that approximately 80 SMEs will participate at this stage. Areas of focus within WEB-BUILD will involve delivering improvements to web-site functionality, on-line sales and e-marketing campaigns. The final phase, WEB-SKILLS, will provide additional training support through a series of regionally run workshops to continue strengthening the SMEs web presence.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&aacute;ilte Ireland North West have undertaken a pilot project with 19 Hotels in Donegal, looking at the &ldquo;On Line Marketing&rdquo; techniques available to the industry.

       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Discover Ireland website www.discoverireland.ie is the main tourism website for the Irish domestic holiday market and is powered by the National Tourism database known as the Tourism Contents System or TCS which is a comprehensive database of all activities, attractions, accommodation, events and businesses in the tourism industry.</P><Col N="590"/>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Hosted within discoveireland.ie, each region has its own website, thereby achieving significant economies of scale for hardware and software e.g. www.discoverireland.ie/west or www.discoverireland.ie/southwest. Within these sites the Tourism Contents System provides all the data relevant to tourism in that area. The TCS is updated on a daily basis within each region e.g. with details of upcoming festivals and events.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />As a subset of the regional sites, a number of sub-regional sites have been created to focus on particular areas of tourism interest e.g. www.discoverireland.ie/connemara or www.discoverieland.ie/lakelands. As a subset of the regional site, each county is also represented under discoverireland.ie. For example, www.discoverireland.ie/cork or www.discoveireland.ie/offaly. This presents the data from the Tourism Contents System relevant to that county.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A comprehensive programme of activity of upgrading and optimising the information in the TCS and the websites is ongoing and is an essential focus for F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</P>

        <P el="10"> <i>Implement in full the F&aacute;ilte Ireland &ldquo;Competing through People&rdquo; programme, which looks to people working in the Industry as a principal source of competitive advantage, and their skills as a key variable in delivering strong business results.</i></P>
        <P el="5"> <i>Progress to date:</i> </P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The National Development Plan, 2007-2013, includes a Training and Human Resources sub-programme of &euro;149 million.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />In 2007 over 13,000 tourism personnel participated in training and education programmes aimed at developing practical skills and building capability in key areas of customer service and enterprise management. A similar number are expected to participate in these programmes in 2008.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&aacute;ilte Ireland is broadening the range of skills development opportunities available to both existing tourism staff as well as those developing entry-level skills in preparation for joining the industry. This involves a continuing emphasis on training design and innovative delivery methods, as well as a strong focus on practical work experience.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />An innovative programme of training for front-line staff was conducted over three months from April through to June 2008. Reflecting demand in the industry for training for staff that interact with customers on a daily basis, F&aacute;ilte Ireland created a short customer service module designed to be delivered on-site, primarily in the hotel sector. Over the three months in question, some 3,000 staff in 200 hotels participated in the training &mdash; all of which took place at a time convenient to the group itself and on-site at <Col N="591"/>their place of work, so minimising time lost and operational disruption. The initiative was well received, and will be repeated in 2009.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A new tour guide programme has been developed to train multi-lingual tour guides to work in the coach tourism sector. The programme reflects the increasing demand for tour guides to have language skills that match the nationality of the tour group. The innovative element of the new programme is the creation of a strong on-line learning resource which allows students to access content during their training, and also serves as a readily available reference during their preparations for each new tour group. Research into the skills needs in the tour sector (specifically guides and drivers) was also funded.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A new training and support programme got underway in April 2008, and was formally launched in July. The WEB CHECK programme &mdash; details of which have been set out earlier &mdash; is designed to support owners/managers in tourism SMEs who wish to improve their capability to trade on-line.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The &ldquo;Competing Through People&rdquo; Strategy made sixteen specific recommendations which were to be actioned by F&aacute;ilte Ireland in the period to 2010. To date thirteen of these have been fully implemented and a fourteenth is currently underway and will be completed by the end of 2008.  The remaining two (which relate principally to research programmes in the labour market) will be actioned in 2009.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />An independent mid-term evaluation of progress against the targets set in &ldquo;Competing Through People&rdquo; was completed at the end of 2007. The review is being used by F&aacute;ilte Ireland to identify areas of best practice and areas where significant progress has been made in the implementation of the strategy together with areas where further progress is required.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1091 to 1113, inclusive, together.</P><Col N="594"/>
        <P>The five-year programme for Government includes a series of commitments, in respect of sport, for achievement in the period to 2012. I am pleased to say that action is being taken in a progressive and gradual manner in these areas to ensure these targets are met in the lifetime of the Government. A comprehensive statement is set out below as a schedule to this reply outlining the position on the issues raised by the Deputy.</P>
       <P el="10"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>Roll out the Local Sports Partnership programme on a nationwide basis to promote the development of sport at community level. [29337/08]</i></P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />The Local Sports Partnerships network is now fully established in 33 different areas throughout the country. These will now act as a conduit to allow for the delivery of programmes and training to local communities.</P>
        <P el="10"><i><Miles com="bull66" />Complete, in conjunction with the Local Sports Partnerships, a national audit of local sports facilities. [29338/08]</i></P>
        <P el="10"><i><Miles com="bull66" /> Put in place a long-term strategic plan to ensure the development of necessary local facilities throughout the country, followed by a year on year monitoring of improvements delivered. [29339/08]</i></P>
        <P el="10"><i><Miles com="bull66" />Ensure accessibility as a key component in the provision of sports and recreational facilities. [29347/08]</i></P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />The nationwide audit of sports facilities is ongoing and is being carried out in stages to help speed up the availability of information.  Phase one, which focuses on national and regional sports facilities, has now been completed within my Department.  Phase two of the audit, which is a more complex undertaking to establish a record of existing sports facilities at local level and identifying the need for future provision, is being undertaken during 2008 with the assistance of Local Authorities.  Guidelines have been issued to Local Authorities to assist them in carrying out the audit.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />The audit is part of a wider exercise to put in place a more strategic approach to the provision of sports facilities in Ireland.  Work on the National Sports Facilities Strategy is at an advanced stage in my Department.  The aim of the strategy is to provide high-level policy direction for future investment/grant assistance at national, regional and local level.  It is intended to identify the facilities requirement for sport so that participation at reasonable cost is feasible for those who wish to engage in sport at either amateur or elite level.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />The issue of strengthening the requirements of accessibility in the provision of sports and recreational facilities will be addressed in the context of the National Sports Facilities Strategy and in future rounds of the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by my Department.</P>
        <P el="10"><i><Miles com="bull66" />Prioritise Sports Capital Programme Grants towards those areas identified as most in need of funding/facilities. [29340/08]</i></P>
        <P el="10"><i><Miles com="bull66" />Change the application criteria of the Sports Capital Programme grants to require only 10% of own funding / contribution where applicants are located in a recognised area of urban disadvantage such as RAPID and a Local Drugs Task Force area. [29346/08]</i></P><Col N="595"/>
        <P el="10"><i><Miles com="bull66" />Promote greater sharing of school and community sports facilities and make it a condition of the Sports Capital Programme that facilities be made available to schools where appropriate. [29356/08]</i></P>
        <P el="10"><i><Miles com="bull66" />Encourage more schools to apply for funding under the Sports Capital Programme by collaborating with their local sports clubs, and/or community groups. [29357/08]</i></P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />Through the Sports Capital Programme, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  The 2008 Programme was advertised in January and 1,453 applications were received before the deadline.  Allocations were made to 685 projects at the end of July 2008.  The details of which are available on the Department&rsquo;s website dast.gov.ie.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />For the 2008 Sports Capital Programme the Department introduced a number of changes to implement key commitments contained in the Agreed Programme for Government.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />The level of own funding required from applicants in urban disadvantaged areas has been reduced from 20% to 10%.  This covers applicants from RAPID and Local Drugs Task Force areas.  This change is in keeping with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas.  When completed, the National Sports Facility Strategy and the National Sports Facility Audit which is currently underway will further help to direct the provision of facilities to areas most in need of funding and facilities.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />The Programme for Government also contains important commitments to promote greater sharing of sports facilities between schools and local sports clubs.  Under the 2008 Sports Capital Programme, schools making joint applications with local sports clubs are required to provide evidence of formal agreements with local clubs that guarantees the clubs access to school facilities for at least 30 hours per week throughout the year.  In assessing applications, extra marks are also awarded to sports clubs that can show that they are allowing local schools to use their facilities.  I intend to discuss with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, how his programme for the provision of sports halls in schools and the Sports Capital Programme might be dovetailed to provide greater value for money and enhanced facilities both for schools and the local community users.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />The inter-agency steering group, established to oversee the development of a National Sports Facilities Strategy,  includes representation from the Department of Education &amp; Science.  The work of this group has included discussions with the Department of Education &amp; Science on how its policy on the provision of sports hall facilities and my Department&rsquo;s policy for the provision of sports facilities might be complementary.</P>
        <P el="10"><i><Miles com="bull66" />Fund Special Olympics clubs. [29341/08]</i></P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />In 2008 Special Olympics Ireland received &euro;2,849,188 to support the organisation. This is the largest allocation outside of the allocations to the GAA, the IRFU and the FAI.</P>
        <P el="10"><i><Miles com="bull66" /> Support a new Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, prioritising need and disadvantage. [29342/08]</i></P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />A sum of &euro;184m has been provided in the National Development Plan 2007-2013 to support existing projects in the current round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme and for new projects to be selected following the launch of a new round of the Programme.  The current round of the Programme, which closed in July 2000, has made noteworthy pro<Col N="596"/>gress over the last 8 years when consideration is given to the lead in time in the development of pool projects.  Under the round, 36 projects have been completed and opened to the public, 9 other pools, which have been allocated funding, are under construction throughout the country and another 12 are at various stages of development.  A total of &euro;123.9m has been spent over the last 8 years under the Programme and a total of &euro;20 million is provided for this year.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />A Value for Money and Policy Review Report of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme was carried out by the Department to examine, among other things, how the Programme has worked to date, and what changes, are required to ensure its effective and efficient delivery.  Arrangements are being finalised for the publication of the report.  Given the current economic climate, it is not intended to launch a new Programme at this time.  However, the recommendations in the Value for Money &amp; Policy Review Report will be considered in the context of any new round of the Programme.</P>
        <P el="10"><i><Miles com="bull66" /> Continue to support the Irish Sports Council as the statutory agency for the promotion, development and co-ordination of sport. [29343/08]</i></P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />The Irish Sports Council, which was established on a statutory basis in 1999, has witnessed a major increase in the levels of funding from the Department from &euro;13.5m in 2000 to over &euro;57m in 2008. Further support will be dependant on the levels of resources available in the annual Estimates for Public Services.</P>
        <P el="10"><i><Miles com="bull66" />Promote a national advertising campaign highlighting the health benefits of sport and exercise. [29345/08]</i></P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />This is being considered by the Irish Sports Council as part of the development of a Participation Strategy. Discussions have also taken place with the HSE in relation to possible co-operation in this area.</P>
        <P el="10"><i><Miles com="bull66" />Further develop the Sports Campus Ireland development at Abbotstown &mdash; incorporating the Irish Institute of Sport &mdash; and including the development of a new 25,000 seater stadium to accommodate athletics and field sports. [29348/08]</i></P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />Following the completion of the move by the FAI to the former State Laboratory building at Abbotstown last year, work has been advanced on providing a headquarters for the Irish Institute of Sport. This involves refurbishing an existing building on the Abbotstown site. Construction is expected to commence shortly and the Irish Institute of Sport is expected to move into its new HQ in early 2009.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />Following the appointment by the NSCDA in April last of Project Management and Design Teams, detailed plans for Phase 1 of the Campus are being prepared and it is estimated that an application for Planning Permission will be lodged with Fingal County Council before the end of 2008.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />The facilities planned for the first phase of the project include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A National Field Sports Training Centre catering for rugby, soccer, Gaelic games and hockey;</P><Col N="597"/>
      <P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />A multi-sport National Indoor Training Centre which will provide world class training facilities for over 20 sports;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Sports science and medical facilities;</P>
       <P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Accommodation for sports men and women; and</P>
     <P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />All-weather synthetic pitches for community recreational access.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />The facilities being provided in Phase 1 do not include a 25,000-seater stadium. Any proposal to include such a facility will be considered in the context of later phases of the Campus project and will be subject to economic conditions and the prevailing public finances.</P>
        <P el="10"><i><Miles com="bull66" />Provide a National Stadium at Lansdowne Road so that our National Rugby and Soccer teams have a first-rate facility in which to play their games. [29349/08]</i></P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />The development of the new stadium at Lansdowne Road is proceeding satisfactorily and is on schedule for completion during 2010.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />I visited the site recently and was most impressed by the rate of progress being made on the construction. I look forward to the opening of what will be a superb sports facility during 2010.</P>
        <P el="10"><i><Miles com="bull66" />Support elite athletes in preparation for the 2008 and 2012 Olympics and develop proposals for Ireland to be used as a base for other national teams in advance of the London Games. [29350/08]</i></P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />The amount of funding available for spending on sport in 2008 is &euro;336 million, which demonstrates a clear and substantial commitment to investment in sport by this Government.   The Irish Sports Council, which is funded by my Department, has statutory responsibility for encouraging the promotion, development and co-ordination of competitive sport and the achievement of excellence in competitive sport.  In 2008 my Department has allocated &euro;57 million to the ISC, an increase since the last Olympic/Paralympic year of &euro;26 million.  This allowed the ISC to provide high performance support for elite athletes of over &euro;9 million in 2008 and over &euro;30 million in this Olympic and Paralympic cycle. 	</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />The ISC works in partnership with the Irish Institute of Sport, the Olympic Council of Ireland, the Paralympic Council of Ireland and the relevant governing bodies of sport in the preparation of Irish athletes for the Olympic and Paralympic Games.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />The planning for the Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Games was comprehensive and well funded with plans implemented by top quality professionals at every step.  The performances of the Irish Olympic and Paralympic teams in Beijing exceeded the targets set by the ISC prior to the Games.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />I intend to meet with the key stakeholders involved in the support of our elite athletes to discuss how we can best build on the success we had in Beijing and the supports required in terms of coaching, programmes, facilities and funding to ensure the optimum performance of Irish athletes at the London 2012 Olympic Games.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />The London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics Task Force was established in August 2006 to ensure Ireland can identify and maximise the complete range of opportunities arising from our proximity to the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London 2012.  The Task Force <Col N="598"/>included experts from the sport, tourism, cultural and business sectors and was supported by staff within my Department.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />The Task Force report makes a number of recommendations arising from an audit carried out of high quality sports facilities in Ireland and the findings of a report by Indecon International Economic Consultants on the economic evaluation of the benefit to the island of Ireland of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />The report highlights the opportunities for Ireland from the London 2012 Games in the sport, tourism, cultural and business sectors.  On the sporting side the report puts forward proposals for investment in sports facilities, which would increase our attractiveness as a training destination for Olympic teams in the lead up and during the games. In this context, I consider that the completion of Phase One of the National Sports Campus at Abbotstown will be of tremendous benefit in the short term to our athletes as they prepare for the London Games and as a venue for other countries to train. I understand that enquiries have already been made about the availability of sports facilities here for some Olympic teams.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />During my recent attendance at the Beijing Olympics I had informal discussions with Sebastian Coe, Chairman of the London 2012 Olympic Games Organising Committee to discuss what role Ireland can play in the games. I will shortly be meeting with him in London to continue with our discussions.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />I will consider the implementation of the recommendations of the London 2012 Task Force Report in the context of the annual Estimates cycle and taking account of the current economic situation.</P>
        <P el="10"><i><Miles com="bull66" />Continue with the implementation of our effective and modern anti-doping programmes, which have earned well-deserved recognition internationally. [29351/08]</i></P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />Ireland&rsquo;s national anti-doping programme is administered by the Irish Sports Council.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />My Department funds the ISC on an annual basis and has allocated over &euro;57 million to the Council in 2008.  This includes funding to enable the ISC to meet its statutory function to combat doping in sport.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />In supporting sport the Government insists that it must be based on fair and ethical principles. The ISC has put in place a comprehensive and effective Anti-Doping Programme, one that the Government strongly endorses and which is recognised internationally as an outstanding model of its type.  Ireland also contributes to the international efforts against drugs in sport through our support for the Copenhagen Declaration on Anti-Doping, the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention, WADA &mdash; the World Anti-Doping Agency and the UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport.</P>
        <P el="10"><i><Miles com="bull66" />Produce a Green Paper on Animal Welfare in Sport and Recreation. [29352/08]</i></P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />The most effective process for giving effect to this commitment will be considered in consultation with the relevant stakeholders.</P>
        <P el="10"><i><Miles com="bull66" />Initiate a financial support package aimed at introducing primary school children to swimming. [29358/08]</i></P><Col N="599"/>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />The commitment in the Programme for Government aims to initiate a financial support package directed at introducing primary school children to swimming.  Such a support package would be focused primarily on the costs of transport to and from pools.</P>
        <P>The Department has initiated discussions with the Department of Education and Science on how best to progress this commitment.</P>
        <P el="10"><i><Miles com="bull66" />Ensure that Local Sports Partnerships have an official dedicated to the promotion of girls and women&rsquo;s involvement in sport. [29359/08]</i></P>
        <P el="10"><i><Miles com="bull66" />Appoint a member of the Irish Sports Council to deal with all aspects of women in sport, including the gender proofing of all Sports Council decisions. [29360/08]</i></P>
        <P el="10"><i><Miles com="bull66" />Establish a Forum on Female Participation in Sport in conjunction with the Irish Sports Council to make recommendations on all issues. [29361/08]</i></P>
        <P el="10"><i><Miles com="bull66" />Create an Annual Women&rsquo;s Sports Award Scheme. [29362/08]</i></P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />The Women in Sport Programme has received significant Government funding since it was launched in 2005.  Through the Women in Sport programme, the Government supports the work of the Irish Sports Council in encouraging women &mdash; young and old alike &mdash; to become involved in sport as participants, players, officials and administrators.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />All LSP staff are fully aware of the need to involve more women and girls in sport and dedicated funding has been made available to operate innovative projects at LSP level to encourage more females into becoming active. In light of the level of funding made available to LSPs it would not be possible to appoint Women in Sport officers in all 33 sites. However LSPs do work closely with the Women in Sport officers that have been appointed by NGBs such as Special Olympics, Badminton, FAI and IRFU.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />An officer of the ISC is assigned to looking after all aspects of the Women in Sport Programme. This is not the sole responsibility of this person but all areas of the WIS Programme are under their remit.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />Representatives of the ISC have attended international conferences on Women in Sport where examples of best practice were discussed.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />From this year the ISC will sponsor the Irish Times Sportswoman of the Year awards.</P>
        <P el="10"><i><Miles com="bull66" />Recognise the importance of volunteerism in the promotion of sport through the expansion of our Volunteer Awards scheme for persons in sport. [29363/08]</i></P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />The first programme of National Awards to Volunteers in Sport was successfully held in 2007. The Awards recognises and encourages the work of volunteers and reaches out to potential new volunteers.  I hope to commence a second programme shortly subject to available resources.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1114 to 1139, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The five-year programme for Government includes a series of commitments which relate to the responsibilities of my Department and its Agencies for achievement in the period up to 2012. I am pleased to say that action is being taken in a progressive and gradual manner in these areas to ensure these targets are met in the lifetime of the Government. A comprehensive statement is set out below as a schedule to this reply outlining the position on the issues raised by the Deputy. </P>
<P><i>The Arts</i></P>
        <P>This Government is committed to implementing a range of steps for the Arts which will see participation broaden and deepen in the next five years.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Arts and Education</i></P>
        <P el="0">We will:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" /><i>Support training and professional development for the performing arts by creating, enhancing and extending modules of in-service training.</i></P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>Support measures that are child centred in arts and cultural programmes and develop and enhance child centred policies that impact throughout the country.</i></P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>Increase funding to the Arts Council for education initiatives.</i></P><Col N="603"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>Promote an appreciation of and engagement in arts and culture from early education through to all education levels through the implementation of a national comprehensive strategy.</i></P>
        <P el="10"><i>Progress to date:</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Department of Education and Science is the lead Department for developing the arts in education.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism is actively considering the recommendations of the report of the Special Committee on Arts and Education, in consultation with the Department of Education and Science and the Arts Council in the context of the Estimates allocations for 2009 and beyond.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Arts and Participation</i></P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">We will:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>Encourage and support the strategic development of the arts in local communities, both geographic and communities of interest, for the disadvantaged and for minority groups.</i></P>
        <P el="10"><i>Progress to date:</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Department supports the provision of new arts facilities around the country through the Arts and Culture Capital Enhancement Support Scheme (ACCESS). The ACCESS scheme is a key element in the Government&rsquo;s regional arts strategy and has greatly improved participation in the arts for large numbers of people, of all ages, nationwide.  The scheme has been widely acknowledged as a significant intervention in the provision of quality cultural spaces.  Under the scheme, funding is provided towards integrated community art centres, theatres and galleries as well as art studios and other arts production, creative and performance spaces.</P>
        <P el="5">A total of 120 projects across the country have been supported under the scheme, many of which were community based arts groups.</P>
        <P el="5">In addition, the Department provided the Arts Council with additional funding to set up a music instrument purchase scheme for community groups.  The Arts Council has commissioned Music Network to undertake an action pilot project on support to community organisations in the acquisition of instruments. &euro;500,000 is available under this scheme in 2008.</P>
        <P el="5">Introduced in 2002 the Arts Council&rsquo;s Programme &ldquo;Artist in the Community&rdquo; matched artists with community groups and building on this success, an enhanced and extended &ldquo;New Communities Residencies&rdquo; Programme is to be introduced in 2009 and 2010. The Department has committed financial support for a new series of books (The Bridges Book Series) aimed at today&rsquo;s multi-cultural society in Ireland. Funding for the Arts Council has also facilitated a new pilot touring initiative, increased funding programmes for arts organisations and, through its Regularly Funded Organisations initiative, provided greater stability for a wider range of organisations.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Arts activity and infrastructure has increased dramatically in recent years, and substantial local energy for the arts now allows for greater scope and vision than ever before. Geography is no longer a barrier to accessing the arts: every county has at least one dedicated arts building and local authorities and others are making it easier for all to engage with artists and the arts as part of everyday life.</P><Col N="604"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>Encourage, promote and foster volunteerism in the arts, drawing on our successful development of volunteerism in sports.</i></P>
        <P el="10"><i>Progress to date:</i></P>
        <P el="0">Responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is devolved primarily to the Arts Council, and the Council is the principal agency through which State funding is channelled to the arts.  Under the Arts Act, 2003, the general functions of the Council include the following:</P>
          <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to stimulate public interest in the arts;</P>
          <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to promote knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to assist in improving standards in the arts.</P>
        <P el="5">Volunteerism is critical to the success of many of the arts organisations supported by the Arts Council and they place great value on the role and contribution of their volunteers.  This is particularly the case in areas such as Arts Participation, YPCE (young people, children and education) and Festivals, which involve people of all ages, abilities and ethnicities and make a distinctive contribution to the life and identity of communities throughout Ireland.  All arts organisations funded by the Arts Council are managed by voluntary boards, which bring expertise and leadership that are highly valued by the arts community. The total budget for Arts Participation, YPCE and Small Festivals in 2008 was over &euro;7 million.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>Ensure that arts venues are adequately funded to facilitate activities and to maximise community use and accessibility for all.</i></P>
        <P el="10"><i>Progress to date:</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism provides the bulk of capital funding for building and refurbishing arts facilities, mainly in the not for profit sector, while the Arts Council provides the ongoing revenue funding for many of the facilities.  To date this capital funding has been delivered through the ACCESS scheme (Arts and Culture Capital Enhancement Support Scheme) and facilities that have been funded include integrated arts centres, theatres and galleries, as well as arts studios and creative and performance spaces.  The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, working with local authorities, is currently supporting the development of an audit of arts facilities throughout the country.</P>
        <P el="5">The ACCESS I &amp; II and other capital programmes provided for in the National Development Plan continue to provide capital funding for arts venues throughout the country, with the aim of creating a top class arts infrastructure nationwide for the benefit of all citizens.  These facilities conform to spatial and artistic strategies, while guaranteeing optimal access to the arts for all.   A total of almost &euro;86m has been granted to 120 projects across the country under the ACCESS schemes. Eighty projects were allocated funding of &euro;42.5m under the ACCESS II scheme and many of these projects are under construction, while the great majority of the 40 projects grant aided under ACCESS I are now fully operational.</P>
        <P el="5">In addition to the ACCESS schemes over &euro;66m has been invested in Other Capital Projects many of which have now been completed or are nearing completion, such as Wexford Opera House &euro;26m, Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann &euro;17m, the Gaiety Theatre &euro;7.8m, the Irish Chamber <Col N="605"/>Orchestra &euro;2.6m and many other smaller projects throughout the country that are ongoing at present.</P>
        <P el="5">Revenue support for arts venues is provided through the Arts Council.  Every county now has at least 1 arts centre. Subvention from the Arts Council to 62 venues in 2008 was at a level of &euro;8,385,000. These venues range from the largest capacity, Cork Opera House &mdash; 1100 seats, to the New Theatre in Dublin &mdash; 75 seats.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Arts and Investment</i></P>
        <P FLI="0" el="0">We will:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>Encourage partnerships between local authorities, central government, relevant local community groups and the Arts Council with a view to funding arts locally.</i></P>
        <P el="10"><i>Progress to date:</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Arts Council has worked well to develop the arts at a local level. It has worked strategically with local authorities for 23 years in developing the arts at local level and the focus was on embedding arts expertise at the heart of the local authority service.  Each of the 34 local authorities in Ireland employs a full-time Arts Officer.  In many instances local authorities lead in providing a broader Arts Service, employing several specialist arts staff in addition to the Arts Officer.</P>
        <P el="5">In 2007 local authorities spent in excess of &euro;36m on the arts, demonstrating the huge commitment that is being made at local level to arts development. Under a provision of the Arts Act 2003, local authorities are required to prepare and implement plans for the development of the arts within their functional areas, and in so doing to take account of government policies on the arts. Many local authorities had already established a track record in planning for the arts and, in several cases, are now on their third such strategy. Local authorities now offer leadership in areas such as youth arts, inter-generational arts, traditional arts, festivals, arts in health and arts in education and new multi-agency partnerships are emerging at local level. In most cases, guided by Strategic Policy Committees with a Cultural remit, local authorities now plan in a strategic and considered fashion for the development of the arts at local level, aided importantly,  as the result of extensive public consultation and are consequently firmly rooted in local strengths and needs.</P>
        <P el="5">Culture Ireland is increasing international opportunities for Irish artists and arts organisations, enabling more than 1,000 Irish arts events to take place in 60 countries across five continents since its creation in 2005 as a strategic vehicle to promote Ireland as a world leader in arts and culture.  Priority locations for these events include global centres of culture and business (e.g. more than 80 projects in New York), developing centres of culture and business (e.g. over 50 projects in China), centres of the global Irish diaspora (more than 500 projects in the US, Britain, Canada and Australia) and key international showcases (e.g. Edinburgh Festival, Venice Biennale).   These priorities enable Culture Ireland to add maximum value to the Government&rsquo;s international political and economic objectives.  CI-promoted Irish arts events also regularly gain high-profile coverage in key global print and broadcast media, reaching audiences of tens of millions and creating new international opportunities for Irish artists.</P>
        <P el="5">Ireland&rsquo;s position as a world leader in theatre is borne out by the award-winning success of Irish productions in Culture Ireland&rsquo;s annual showcase at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the largest and most competitive arts festival in the world.  2008 has been the most successful yet, with double Fringe Firsts for the Abbey&rsquo;s <i>Terminus</i> by Mark O&rsquo;Rowe and Druid&rsquo;s <i>New Electric <Col N="606"/>Ballroom</i> by Enda Walsh, and a Herald Angel award for Enda Walsh.  The New York Times acclaimed the <i>New Electric Ballroom</i> as the outstanding show of the Festival.  The career-changing impact is also demonstrated by last year&rsquo;s Fringe First winner, Druid&rsquo;s <i>The Walworth Farce,</i>whose Edinburgh success has since led to major tours to top venues in New York and London.</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>Develop a new policy to create and sustain employment in the arts, particularly arts employment that can market, operate and develop our local arts infrastructure</i></P>
        <P el="10"><i>Progress to date:</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism supports the provision of new arts facilities and maintenance of existing facilities around the country, through the Arts and Culture Capital Enhancement Support Scheme (ACCESS) and other capital projects.  Some &euro;152m has been provided in capital funding for this purpose nationwide and much employment has been created as a result.  In addition the Arts Council provides revenue funding for arts venues around the country and this includes funds to employ arts managers, curators etc.  Funding to the Arts Council has increased significantly in recent years increasing by 71% since 2002 from &euro;47.67m to &euro;81.62m in 2008.</P>

        <P el="10"><i>Progress to date:</i></P>

        <P el="10"><i>Progress to date:</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Arts Council introduced a new policy for the traditional arts in May 2005. In line with this policy, the Arts Council is implementing a three year Traditional Arts Initiative from 2005-2008. The initiative is intended to prioritise the traditional arts for a fixed period, in order to realise the ambition of fully mainstreaming the traditional arts within the Council&rsquo;s activities. It is designed to stabilise existing key players and consolidate a basic infrastructure for the traditional arts while allowing scope for new ideas, projects and partnerships to emerge.  The Arts Council recently announced the extension of its DEIS funding scheme for the traditional arts.  The Department has provided almost &euro;17m in funding in recent years towards the capital development plan of Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; Eireann.</P>

Indecon&rsquo;s terms of reference were to identify a structured, and innovative way forward to develop and consolidate the Irish film industry, taking account of the serious international competition issues now apparent and to feed into the preparation for the Finance Bill 2008. Indecon completed their report in September 2007 and their recommendations were included in the 2008 Finance Act &mdash; Section 481 was extended until the end of 2012 and the absolute maximum that can be raised in respect of any one film was raised from &euro;35m to &euro;50m.</P>

        <P el="0">The funding of the Arts Council, as with all Government Departments and State agencies, is a matter for consideration under the annual budget and Estimates process. In doing so, the Government must balance competing demands from every part of our economy and society.</P>
        <P el="5">By any standards however, the Arts Council has seen dramatic increases in its funding allocation in recent years, increasing by over 72% from &euro;47.67 million in 2002 to &euro;81.62 million this year.  These are significant amounts of taxpayers&rsquo; money in any context and have effectively transformed the arts, by facilitating increased access to and participation in the full spectrum of art forms throughout the country.  The Government&rsquo;s sustained commitment to the arts is evidenced by these substantial increases in funding.</P><Col N="608"/>

        <P el="10"><i>Progress to date:</i></P>
        <P el="0">Government Policy on the Arts is set out in the Programme for Government and is elaborated further in the Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy 2008 &mdash; 2010 and the arts plan 2008.  The Government&rsquo;s objective is to support national economic and societal progress by enriching the quality of life of the people of Ireland, by facilitating the promotion and sustainable development of the arts and culture.  To accomplish this the Government seeks to create an environment that enables arts and culture, including the Cultural Institutions, to flourish, through the provision of an appropriate legislative, policy and resource framework.  The Government is committed to implementing a range of initiatives for the Arts, which will see participation, broaden and deepen in the next five years.  This will be achieved through encouraging and supporting increased participation in the arts, investment in the arts sector, focussing on arts and education and ensuring that the Arts Council, the Film Board, Culture Ireland and all the national cultural institutions are appropriately resourced.</P>
        <P el="5">It is the Government&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that the arts and culture are well funded and placed at the centre of policy making in Ireland.  To this end funding for the Arts and Culture sector has increased significantly in recent years.  For example funding to the Arts Council has increased by 71% since 2002 from &euro;47.67m to &euro;81.62m in 2008.  Funding for the Arts and Culture, which includes the Arts Council, the Film Board, Culture Ireland, the National Cultural Institutions and the capital arts infrastructure programme ACCESS (Arts and Culture Capital Enhancement Support Scheme) and the National Gallery is over &euro;220m in 2008.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>National Cultural Institutions</i></P>
        <P el="0">We will ensure that our cultural institutions are developed to their highest potential by capital investment in storage, presentation, and digitisation of our national treasures.</P>

An extended programme of digitisation of the collections of the National Cultural Institutions, to come on stream in 2010 is provided for in the National Development Plan. A Best Practice Model for Digitisation in Ireland, will be prepared and should allow a rational and cohesive approach to all new digitisation projects.</P>

	<P>The Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations and, in certain circumstances to schools and colleges, throughout the country.  It is the main vehicle for development of sports facilities at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  Under the Programme priority is given to the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of sports facilities.</P>
        <P>Primary and post-primary schools wishing to be considered for funding under the Programme may apply for funding jointly with local sports clubs or community groups and must meet other conditions including a requirement that the local community will have significant access to the proposed facility, at least 30 hours a week throughout the year, when it is not being used by the school itself.  Any sports facility proposed for funding by a sporting organisation and which would be located within school grounds would have to meet these same conditions.</P>
        <P>Applications from primary and post-primary schools and colleges on their own are not considered under the Programme. Responsibility for the provision of sports facilities in schools and colleges is a matter in the first instance for my colleague the Minister for Education and Science.</P>

	<P>Under the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by the Department, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The aim of the Programme is to maximise participation in sport through the provision of modern high quality, safe, well-designed and sustainable facilities and sports equipment.  The provision of such facilities allows for increased numbers to participate in sport.</P>
        <P>A grant of &euro;227,500, including a top-up of &euro;52,500 from RAPID, was provisionally allocated to the club in question under the 2006 Sports Capital Programme. The letter notifying the club of the provisional allocation issued on 16 June 2006.  The grant allocation was subject to the terms and conditions of the Programme, which included the execution of a deed of covenant and charge.</P>
        <P>A deed of covenant and charge provides, inter alia, for a refund of the grant in the event of the facility not continuing to be used for the purpose for which the grant was allocated. The Department&rsquo;s legal adviser, the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office &mdash; CSSO &mdash; deals with the gran<Col N="615"/>tee&rsquo;s solicitor in executing this deed. I understand that the CSSO recently received documentation regarding the case from the solicitors representing the organisation dated 10 September. The documentation submitted has been examined by the CSSO, who last week wrote to the grantee&rsquo;s solicitor requesting further documentation to execute the deed.  As soon as the Deed of Covenant and charge is in place payment of the grant will be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the programme.</P>

	<P>Since the enactment of the Official Languages Act 2003, the Department, excluding The National Archives which forms part of  the Department but is designated as a separate public body under the 2003 Act,  has <Col N="616"/>expended approximately &euro;163,000 on advertising in the Irish language.  The National Archives has expended approximately &euro;52,400 on advertising in the Irish language in the same period.</P>
        <P>These figure sums are an approximation only, as, inter alia, advertising is frequently commissioned on a bilingual basis rather than in the Irish language only, so the constituent cost of advertising in Irish must necessarily be an approximation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1153, 1167 and 1168 together.</P>
        <P>A sum of &euro;184m has been provided in the National Development Plan 2007-2013 for supporting existing projects in the current round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme and for new projects to be selected following the launch of a new round of the Programme.  The current round of the Programme, which closed in July 2000, has made noteworthy progress over the last 8 years when consideration is given to the lead in time in the development of pool projects.  Under the round, 36 projects have been completed and opened to the public, 9 other pools, which have been allocated funding, are under construction throughout the country and another 12 are at various stages of development.  A total of &euro;123.9m has been spent over the last 8 years under the Programme and a total of &euro;20 million is provided for this year.</P>
        <P>A Value for Money and Policy Review Report of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme was carried out by the Department to examine, among other things, how the Programme has worked to date, and what changes, are required to ensure its effective and efficient delivery.  Arrangements are currently being made to publish the report.  Given the current budgetary constraints, it is not intended to launch a new Programme at this time. However, the recommendations in the Value for Money &amp; Policy Review Report will be considered in any new round of the Programme.  When a new round of the Programme is launched it will be open to all Local Authorities, including Monaghan County Council on behalf of Carrickmacross, to submit an application under the terms that will apply.</P>

	<P>The Department allocates grants under a number of headings.  Details of grants allocated to all counties under the sports capital programme are available on the Department&rsquo;s website at http://www.arts-sport-tourism.gov.ie/.  Apart from the regular allocations announced under the formal sports capital programme, in December 2005 a further series of allocations to noteworthy projects on a regional scale were announced which included an additional &euro;200,000 to the Ennis Town Council Lees Road Project.  Details of arts grants to organisations in Clare in the years in question are set out in a table below.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to disaggregate the cost of administering grant programmes to the level requested.  Not all of the grants provisionally allocated to organisations in County Clare in those years have been drawn down.  All grants are allocated subject to terms and conditions including a provision whereby the Department can fully or partially withdraw grants in the absence of satisfactory progress being made by the grantee, for any reason, in drawing down the grant.</P>

	<P>My Department has no direct role in the provision of land for local sports facilities.  Under the sports capital programme, which is administered by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, funding is allocated to assist voluntary and community organisations, national governing bodies (NGBs) of sport, VECs and local authorities to develop high quality, safe, well-designed and sustainable facilities in appropriate locations and to provide appropriate equipment to help maximise participation in sport and physical recreation.</P>
        <P>The programme does not provide grants towards the purchase of land, sites or premises.  Many of the organisations and sports clubs in the Dublin area that have made application under the programme are based on lands made available by local authorities and the organisation in question should in the first instance raise the issue of the availability of pitches in its local area with the appropriate county council.</P>

In this regard I should say that my Department has provided annual funding from 2005 to the Irish Royal Academy to enable the project to continue. I understand from the Academy that this is a long-term research project and that it is not possible at this stage to identify a definitive completion date. However a number of milestones have been achieved to date including the publication in 2004 of &ldquo;Corpas na Gaeilge, 1600-1882, the Irish language Corpus&rdquo; in CD-ROM format, which contains an archive of the 705 extant printed texts for that period.  Work has been proceeding since then on the production of a similar archive &mdash; of necessity, much larger &mdash; for the period 1882-2000.</P>

        <P>The accounting system used by my Department does not record the language of advertisements and accordingly it is not possible to give a breakdown of the amount spent on departmental advertising in the Irish language.  I might make the point to the Deputy that no Regulations in relation to advertising in the two official languages have been made to date under the Official Languages Act.   Such advertising in Irish as has been placed by my Department and other Departments and public bodies has been undertaken as a matter of good customer service and good practice, rather than on foot of a new statutory obligation since enactment of the Official Languages Act in 2003.</P>
        <P>Brindley Advertising holds the Government contract for advertising in the print media (mainly for statutory and official notifications).  The Department has made the following payments to Brindley Advertising:</P>

	<P>In accordance with the LEADER bottom-up approach to rural development, applications for funding under Axes 3 &amp; 4 (LEADER elements) of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 are not processed by my Department, but rather by the individual Local Action Groups contracted to deliver the LEADER elements of the Programme on the Department&rsquo;s behalf.  Each Local Action Group is the decision-making authority in relation to approving and funding actions falling within its business plan, though funding may only be awarded in accordance with EU regulatory requirements and within detailed operating rules governing the implementation of the Programme.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be aware that the process for selecting Local Action Groups to deliver the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 is now at an advanced stage and I expect to announce the award of contracts and the allocation of funding in October. In this context, I anticipate that the Programme will be open to applications to the Local Action Groups for funding shortly thereafter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>This Government has shown an unparalleled commitment to improving the State pension.  The rate of contributory pension has increased from &euro;147.30 per week in 2002 to more than &euro;223 per week in 2008 and the non-contributory pension has increased from &euro;134 per week in 2002 to &euro;212 per week this year.  Together with improvements in other schemes, these increases have helped to reduce the number of older people experiencing consistent poverty to 2%. </P>
        <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs is responsive to fuel poverty issues by supplementing households through basic social welfare payments and a number of social welfare programmes to assist with heating costs, specifically the national fuel allowance scheme and electricity and gas allowances under the household benefits package.  These schemes have been improved significantly in recent years.</P>
        <P>For example, the fuel allowance of &euro;18 per week (&euro;21.90 in designated smokeless areas) is now payable for 30 weeks and benefits over 290,000 people at an aggregate cost of &euro;170 million this year.  Electricity and gas allowances under the household benefits package, are payable throughout the year to over 350,000 pensioners, people with disabilities, and carer households towards their heating, light and cooking costs.  There is also a special heating needs facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances with specific heating needs due to infirmity or a particular medical condition.  Any changes to State pension rates or the living alone allowance have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1273 and 1356 together. </P>
        <P>The development of a National Carers&rsquo; Strategy is a key Government commitment in both the national partnership agreement, Towards 2016, and the Agreed Programme for Government.  A working group, chaired by the Department of An Taoiseach, is working on developing the strategy. My Department provides the secretariat to the working group which also includes representatives of the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Enterprise, Trade and Employment as well as F&Aacute;S and the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>Developing the strategy involves consultation with other government departments and bodies not represented on the working group.  The Department has met with a wide range of organisations including the Equality Authority, Combat Poverty Agency, Citizen&rsquo;s Information Board, the National Council on Ageing and Older People, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the National Disability Authority.  A request for submissions from the public was published in regional newspapers in early March.  The closing date for submissions was Friday 18 April 2008. There was a good response from individuals and organisations and the submissions received are being examined.</P>
        <P>Towards 2016 commits the Department to hosting an annual consultation meeting of carer representative groups and relevant departments and agencies.  Such a meeting was held on 23 January 2008.  Representatives of 12 groups and 9 government departments and bodies attended.  The theme was the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy and groups were given an opportunity to comment on the draft terms of reference and to raise other issues considered relevant in the context of the strategy.</P>
        <P>I was very pleased to launch the report Listening to Carers: Report on a Nationwide Carer Consultation, produced by the Carers Association in partnership with Caring for Carers Ireland and Care Alliance on 30th of June this year.  The issues raised in this report are currently being considered as part of the development of the strategy. In addition to the correspondence I have received from the Carers Association direct.  The issues raised in this report are currently being considered as part of the development of the strategy.  In addition to the correspondence I have received from the Carers Association directly, I have also received representations from a number of colleagues on behalf of the organisation.</P>
        <P>The commitment to the development of a National Carers&rsquo; Strategy also includes a commitment to appropriate consultation with the social partners.  An update in relation to the strategy was provided to the social partners plenary session in February.  The first of two consultation meetings with the social partners was held on 8 May 2008. Key issues raised were recognition for carers and their work, access to suitable health services, income support, training, gender issues and balancing employment and care.  It is intended to publish the strategy later this year.</P>

	<P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, an exceptional needs payment (ENP) may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which the applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources.  There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is determined by the Executive based on the particular circumstances of the case. </P>
        <P>The Midlands  area of the HSE has advised that the person concerned made an application for an exceptional needs payment which was refused as the executive did not consider it an &lsquo;exceptional need&rsquo; in her particular circumstances.  It is open to the person concerned to contact the Community Welfare Officer in the local health centre if she wishes to have her case reviewed.</P>

	<P>This question relates to whether or not the National Social Security Systems of the EU have been unified and/or harmonised.  The social security rights of people living and working in the EU are co-ordinated by EU Regulations 1408/71 and 574/72.  The Regulations co-ordinate social security systems and are designed to ensure that people are not disadvantaged by moving within the EU to take up work.  This is achieved primarily by setting out rules as to which State&rsquo;s social security system a person will pay contributions when, for example, s/he moves from one Member State to another to take up work, or where s/he lives in one State and works in another.  In addition, the Regulations also set out rules as to which State will pay benefit in the event of the usual contingencies arising, e.g. sickness, unemployment, old-age etc. </P>
        <P>The general rule is that a person is insured in the State in which s/he works. Equally, the state of employment has, in general, responsibility for paying benefits when, for example, a person becomes injured or ill.  The Regulations also provide that when entitlement to benefit is being examined account must be taken of insurance paid in any other Member State where the person worked.</P>
        <P>These Regulations do not harmonise but co-ordinate the social security schemes of EU Member States, i.e. they do not replace the different national social security systems by a single European scheme. Therefore Member States are free to determine the details of their own social security systems, including which benefits shall be provided, the conditions of eligibility and the value of these benefits, as long as they adhere to the basic principle of equality of treatment and non-discrimination.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In order to qualify for a state pension contributory a person must satisfy a number of qualifying conditions which include commencing insurable employment at least 10 years before pension age, payment of a minimum of 260 qualifying contributions and achieving a yearly average of at least 10 qualifying contributions, paid or credited, over their working life.  To determine the yearly average a person&rsquo;s contribution record is averaged from 1953, or from the year of starting insurable employment, if later, to the end of the tax year before reaching pension age.  The person concerned achieved a yearly average of just 6 on her record and, accordingly, her claim was rejected. </P>
        <P>Self-employed people become compulsorily insured for social welfare benefits in April 1988. A concession was made to those who commenced paying insurance at that time which allowed any previous social insurance record they may have had to be disregarded when eligibility for pension was being assessed.  Self-employed people who commenced paying contributions after April 1988 are treated the same as other contributors.  It is accepted that the average contributions test can have an impact on pension entitlements, particularly where a person has a significant gap in their overall record.  The issue is discussed in the Green Paper on pensions and the possibility of making reforms to the system will be considered in the development of the framework for future pensions policy which the Government has indicated will be finalised and announced by the end of the year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1282, 1294, 1299 and 1338 together. </P><Col N="649"/>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s role is to assist social welfare recipients with heating costs, both through their basic payments and through the household benefits package with fuel, electricity and gas allowances.  These schemes have been improved significantly in recent years.</P>
        <P>The national fuel allowance scheme assists householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive (HSE) payments with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season.  The allowance represents a contribution towards a person&rsquo;s normal heating expenses. It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Fuel allowance is now payable for 30 weeks and benefits over 290,000 people at an aggregate cost of &euro;170 million this year.  The payment rate is now &euro;18 per week or &euro;21.90 for recipients living in designated smokeless areas.  This represents a doubling of the standard rate of payment since 2005.  Fuel allowance is payable at the same rate across all welfare schemes and I have no plans to introduce different fuel allowance payment rates to differentiate between people based on their primary payment type.</P>
        <P>Electricity and gas allowances under the household benefits package, are payable throughout the year to over 355,000 pensioners, people with disabilities, and carer households towards their heating, light and cooking costs at an estimated overall scheme cost of &euro;159m in 2008.  The electricity allowance covers standing charges plus VAT and up to 2,400 units of electricity in each billing period, increased from 1,800 units in January 2007.  The gas allowance covers an equivalent amount.</P>
        <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme can also be used to assist people in certain circumstances with specific heating needs due to infirmity or a particular medical condition.  Anyone seeking a special heating supplement, or a person such as a public health nurse acting on their behalf, should contact the local Community Welfare Officer to have their situation assessed.</P>
        <P>Fuel allowance is incorporated into a person&rsquo;s weekly social welfare payment.  Government policy in recent years has focused on significantly increasing primary social welfare rates to ensure that people on social welfare can meet their basic living costs, including heating, throughout the year and achieve an improvement in quality of life.  This is a more costly approach than increasing fuel allowance as the increase is paid for the full year and not just for the 30 weeks of the winter heating season.  Social welfare rates have increased at a significantly greater rate than price inflation in recent years.  Since December 2001, overall inflation has increased by over 27% while energy product prices have increased by almost 74%.  However, increases in social welfare payments (including fuel allowance) have been between 71% and 88% in the same period.</P>
        <P>Improvements to the fuel allowance scheme, such as an increase in the rate of payment or an extension of the duration of the fuel season, would have considerable cost implications.  Paying fuel allowance for a full 52 weeks of the year at current payment rates would cost an additional &euro;123m, bringing total annual expenditure to some &euro;300m..  Any changes to the scheme will be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of resources available for improvements in social welfare payments generally</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1283 and 1355 together. </P>
        <P>This Department provides an office in Ois&iacute;n House, Pearse Street, Dublin 2 for exclusive use by officials of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  On 12 April 2007, an officer of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG) reported, to the Department&rsquo;s Facilities Management Unit, that a laptop computer had gone missing from the room.  A search of the building and a review of CCTV footage did not provide any further information.  The loss of the laptop was reported to the C&amp;AG Head Office and the Garda.</P>
        <P>On 1 August, 2008, some 16 months after the laptop went missing, the Office of the C&amp;AG informed the Department that the missing laptop contained a number of files used in connection with the audit of the Social Insurance Fund for 2004 and 2005.  These files contained some 380,000 individual personal customer records.</P>
        <P>The information had been provided by the Department to the Office of the C&amp;AG on foot of authorised requests from that Office in line with established protocols.  These officials were provided with access to the file on the Department&rsquo;s internal ICT network where the data was stored in an encoded format.  They subsequently transferred the data to the laptop in question.  While the laptop was password-protected, the data was not encrypted.  The Department has been engaged in a programme of continuous development and deployment of measures to enhance data security. Since this incident came to light, the Department has further reviewed and enhanced its protocols in relation to the transfer of data to third parties, including the Office of the C&amp;AG.  All bulk data is now transferred in an encrypted format, in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;External Party Electronic Data Transfer Policy&rsquo;.</P>

        <P>A copy of the complete terms of reference is set out below.  The review was overseen by a Steering Committee chaired by Mr. Niall Callan, former Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and comprised senior officials from the department, other relevant departments and the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
        <P>The review was recently completed and the report is now under consideration by officials of the department. It is my intention to bring forward proposals to the Government on the future of the Agency in the near future.</P>
      
        <P el="10"><i>TERMS OF REFERENCE</i></P>
        <P el="5"><i>Introduction and background</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Government has decided that a review of the future of the Combat Poverty Agency will be undertaken by the Department of Social and Family Affairs in association with other relevant departments (Government Decision; of 6 June 2007).</P>
        <P>The Review of the Combat Poverty Agency will be undertaken as part of the Value for Money and Policy Review Initiative 2006-2008 of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The context for the review relates to the structures established in recent years to progress the achievement of the Government&rsquo;s social inclusion strategies viz. the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007 -2016, the social partnership agreement Towards 2016 and the social inclusion chapter in the National Development Plan Transforming Ireland 2007-13.</P>
        <P>In this regard, the monitoring, research and evaluation, consultation and advisory roles of a number of national structures and offices, including the NESDO and its constituent agencies, the NESC and the NESF, are relevant to the review.  A key question for the review relates to the extent to which there are overlaps or duplication in the remits of these bodies and the Agency and the consequences this poses for coherence in the implementation of Government policy and for cost to the Exchequer.  The review of the Irish Public Service by the OECD is also relevant. The context for that review specifically refers to the effectiveness of Government structures for tackling horizontal issues such as &lsquo;poverty reduction, as well as the structures for addressing broader issues, the systems for policy development, implementation evaluation and feedback and the connectivity between them and the Government.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference proposed for the review of the Combat Poverty Agency are: to examine the role of the Combat Poverty Agency (CPA) as set out in the Combat Poverty Agency Act, 1986; to examine the work programmes and operations of the CPA in the context of efficiency and effectiveness and overall value for money; to have regard to the social and economic developments that have taken place in recent years and the resultant changes that have come about in the institutional structures for the formulation of Government policy; including the development of social inclusion responsibilities within and across Government departments and state agencies, organisations and expert bodies with remits in research, information and advice to Government and new mechanisms for consultation, monitoring and participation in the development and implementation of social inclusion strategies.  These include social partnership structures, Government programmes with corporate (social partnership) arrangements, and the provision made for regular consultation with groups established to represent people experiencing poverty and social exclusion and identify where services, programmes or functions duplicate, overlap or complement the Agency&rsquo;s role, and where pertinent, <Col N="652"/>any gaps in institutional arrangements for advancing the Government&rsquo;s social inclusion strategies.  The review will report on the ongoing validity of the remit which is exercised by the Agency in these areas and bring forward proposals for enhancing the delivery of services/functions, including rationalisation as appropriate that will include recommendations as to the body or organisational arrangement most suitable for their delivery.  It will identify and bring forward proposals which would contribute to the progression of Government social inclusion strategies and make recommendations to the Minister for the future of the Combat Poverty Agency and its functions.</P>

	<P>The Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs administers some fifty schemes and makes payments to one million people each week.  There is also a considerable level of interaction between its staff and the public and with their representatives.  In any given year, these interactions include: 1.9 million applications processed; 6.5 million telephone calls; 68 million payments; 360,000 assignments conducted by our investigators. </P>
        <P>Because of the nature, scale and diversity of its work, the Department is heavily reliant on ICT and holds detailed information about its customers.  The Department takes its responsibilities to safeguard this data extremely seriously.  A dedicated unit oversees business information protection across the Department and it has developed and communicated policies and procedures covering the use of systems and data.  This unit also investigates any alleged breaches that arise.</P>
        <P>The Department maintains a central repository of client information.  This information is stored on the Department&rsquo;s Central Records system that holds a record, or data set, in respect of each customer.  The information maintained can be broadly categorised into customer identity, PRSI contribution history and summary claim activity information.  There are some 6.8 million data sets on this database in respect of current and previous customers.  More detailed data relating to particular transactions in relation to these customers are held separately on scheme payment system.</P>
        <P>The data is generated by Departmental staff or agents entering information onto its internal computer systems and also by receipt of data from external agencies (e.g. the General Register Office for births).  Staff and agents who need access to this data to carry out their duties are granted access in accordance with departmental policies and procedures, including the use of password protection.  The data is made available over a secure network through bespoke application interfaces.  These interfaces control the level and type of access an approved member of staff can have to the data.  Authorisation to use an application is subject to a business case approved by local management.  All changes made to a client data set are logged and subject to on-going audit.  All electronic data is stored in the Department&rsquo;s primary computer site.  The site itself has rigorous control procedures and site perimeter protection.  There are arrangements in place for inter-site back-up of data. Security arrangements, including encryption, are in place to cover the necessary transfer of data to other agencies for service delivery purposes.</P>
        <P>Our systems are subject to standard physical security measures.  Industry standard security protocols, such as password protection and security software, are deployed to protect all departmentally-supplied devices and preserve the confidentiality of data.  Every effort is made by the Department to ensure that personal customer data is used solely for business purposes and that it is not compromised in any way.  Over the last number of years, the Department has continuously strengthened security and data protection protocols.  Policies and procedures governing the use of systems and data have been developed and communicated to the staff.  These policies and procedures are under constant review, and are updated as appropriate.  Staff  are regularly reminded of their obligations under data protection and security policies and of the penalties applicable in respect of any breach of these policies.</P>

	<P>The following data devices, issued by the Department, were reported stolen or lost in the years in question: 2007 &mdash; One laptop (house break-in); 2008 &mdash; Two Laptops (1 house break-in, 1 office break-in). </P><Col N="655"/>
        <P>In addition, a laptop belonging to the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General was reported missing from the Department&rsquo;s office in Ois&iacute;n House in April 2007.  Laptops can be used to access centrally stored client information through a secure remote log-in.  No client data is retained on the laptops after the remote session ceases.  Similarly, the Department&rsquo;s e-mail system retains its data in a central location although it can be accessed through a secure remote log-in.</P>
<?oasys _cl13.5- ?>
        <P>It is now Departmental policy to password protect all laptops.  All new laptops issued are encrypted and existing laptops are being recalled for encryption.  The Department is also engaged in implementing a policy to restrict usage of USB memory devices.  Members of staff who need such devices will be issued with encrypted devices and future usage will be restricted to these.</P>

        <Quest> if target time limits for the processing of applications in respect of a refund of social insurance payments have been set in which a person is not liable to payment; and if problems have arisen with lengthy turnaround times in issuing such payments. </Quest>
        <QRef>[30155/08] </QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Refunds of Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) are made to employers and employees where contributions have been paid in error.  Most refunds arise as a result of people paying at the incorrect rate and relate mainly to the following: persons whose class of insurance changes, following an insurability decision; persons earning either over or under the statutory earnings threshold or ceiling; employees over 66 years who continue to pay the full PRSI rate, separated persons who make enforceable maintenance payments; employees paying Class A contributions who are in receipt of Maternity Benefit and/or Illness Benefit payments, Medical cardholders, recipients of Widow&rsquo;s Pension, Deserted Wife&rsquo;s Benefit, One Parent Family Payments, and those with EU equivalents who are not liable to pay the Health Contribution; persons who enter insurable employment after the age of 56 and who have no entitlement to a State Pension (Contributory). </P>
        <P>The volume of applications for refunds of PRSI has increased dramatically in recent years.  In the last four years the number of applications has increased by almost 400% and this has inevitably given rise to a backlog of up to 6 months in processing refund applications.  Last year refunds totalling &euro;16.5 million were paid to more than 10,500 applicants.</P>
        <P>The Department endeavours to process applications for refunds of PRSI as efficiently as possible.  In order to ensure that applications are dealt with in a fair and equitable manner, they are processed in chronological order.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is anxious to ensure that as many people as possible can be accommodated within the social welfare pensions system, with due regard being paid to the contributory principle underlying entitlement to contributory payments and, in the case of non-contributory payments, the need to <Col N="656"/>ensure that resources are directed to those who are most in need.  Over the last 10 years, means tests have been improved and qualifying conditions for contributory payments made easier.</P>
        <P>Many women in both the private and the public sector left employment on marriage because they were required to or because that was the societal norm at the time.  Civil servants who left the workforce through the operation of the marriage bar were not insured for social welfare pension purposes.  Accordingly, the loss of pension rights in their case relates more to their occupational position rather than social welfare pension entitlements.</P>
        <P>That said, the Green Paper on Pensions, includes a full discussion on the social welfare pension position of women who had to resign due to the marriage bar. Decisions in relation to those who are not at present receiving support through the social welfare system, including those who had to leave employment on marriage, will be considered in that context.  It is expected that the policy framework will be finalised by the end of the year.</P>

	<P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over.  All carers in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative&rsquo;s allowance, regardless of their age, receive a free travel pass.  It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person&rsquo;s pension.</P>
        <P>The scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme.  These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 90 private transport operators.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the difficulties that some free travel pass holders have in accessing public transport and my officials have discussed this issue with the Commission for Taxi Regulation.  Various alternatives to the existing system, including the use of vouchers, have been examined.  A study, A Review of the Free Schemes, published in 2000 by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin, concluded that a voucher type system, which would be open to a wide range of transport providers including taxis and hackneys, would be extremely difficult to administer, open to abuse and unlikely to be sufficient to afford an acceptable amount of travel.  This position remains unchanged.</P>
        <P>The issue of access to public transport in rural areas is being addressed at present through the Rural Transport Programme, which is being managed by Pobal, on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Transport.  My Department is contributing &euro;1.5 million to the initiative this year to ensure that free travel pass holders continue to have access to community based transport services.</P>

	<P>A person suffering from thyroid disorder/disease may qualify for disability allowance depending on the circumstances of their particular case.  Disability allowance is a social assistance payment made to people whose employment capacity is substantially restricted because of a disability and whose income falls below certain limits.  Entitlement to the allowance is subject to the person satisfying both a means test and the medical eligibility criteria that apply and these are prescribed in legislation.</P>
        <P>The medical criteria which must be satisfied in order to qualify for Disability Allowance are the person must be suffering from an injury, disease, congenital deformity or physical or mental illness or defect which has continued or may reasonably be expected to continue for a period of at least a year, and as a result of the condition the person is substantially handicapped in undertaking work which would otherwise be suitable having regard to the person&rsquo;s age, experience and qualifications.  When a person makes a claim for disability allowance an opinion regarding their medical condition is firstly provided by the person&rsquo;s own general practitioner.  Where required, a second opinion is provided by a medical assessor employed by the Department.  In certain instances medical examinations will be undertaken.  The medical assessor will have available to him or her the initial medical diagnosis supplemented, where appropriate, by relevant specialist and other reports.  Any information provided by the claimant is also taken into account.</P>
        <P>Medical Assessors carry out medical assessments of clients in order to provide an independent medical opinion with regard to eligibility on medical grounds to various illness and disability-related benefits/allowances for the guidance of Deciding Officers.  Under the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts, questions concerning claims for benefit are decided by Deciding Officers.  However in relation to whether the medical criteria are satisfied they obtain the opinion of a medical assessor.</P>

	<P>Under the programme of decentralisation, 85 posts in the Department are due to be relocated to Carrickmacross and in excess of 90 applications have been received to date to move there.  As you are aware, the Government decided on 8th July last that further expenditure on the acquisition of accommodation for decentralisation would be paused pending the detailed consideration by Government of reports from the Decentralisation Implementation Group and the Implementation Group of Secretaries General.  I expect that such consideration by the Government will take place in the near future.</P>

	<P>According to the Department&rsquo;s records, there were 1,600 people in receipt of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit and 1,380 approximately in receipt of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance in the four Social Welfare Local Offices in County Monaghan at 19th September 2008.  Corresponding figures are not available for the same week in 2007 but on 28th September 2007, there were 784 on Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit and 946 on Job<Col N="659"/>seeker&rsquo;s Allowance.  This represents an increase of 816 in the number receiving Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit and 435 in the number in receipt of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance.  </P>
        <P>The figures reflect the substantial rise in the national Live Register during the past 12 months.  The Department, through its Employment Support Services and in conjunction with other agencies, continues to assist persons on the Live Register to make the transition to work, education or relevant training.  Under the National Employment Plan, people who are approaching 3 months on the Live Register are identified by the Department and referred to F&Aacute;S for interview with a view to job placement or offer of training.  A significant measure available to unemployed people is the Department&rsquo;s Back to Work Allowance scheme which allows them to retain part of their social welfare payment for a period when they take up employment or self-employment.</P>
        <P>Other measures include the Back to Education Allowance scheme, the Technical Assistance and Training grants and the PRSI Exemption Scheme.  In addition, the Activation and Family Support Programme and the Second Chance Education Opportunities Scheme offer supports to social welfare customers and other disadvantaged persons to assist them in improving their employability and personal and family situations.</P>

        <P>Supporting and recognising carers in our society is, and has been, a priority of the Government since 1997.  Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.</P>
        <P>The carer&rsquo;s benefit scheme is specifically intended to support people who must leave the workforce temporarily to care for someone who is in need of full-time care and attention.  In Budget 2006 the duration of carer&rsquo;s benefit was extended from 15 to 24 months in respect of each person being cared for.  The duration for which people can avail of the associated carer&rsquo;s leave scheme was similarly extended in 2006.  It is considered that employers would experience difficulties in preserving employee&rsquo;s rights for a longer period.</P>
        <P>If the need for income support still exists after carer&rsquo;s benefit has expired, it is of course, open to the carer to apply for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Payment of carer&rsquo;s allowance continues for as long as the person continues to satisfy all of the qualifying conditions. In addition, a respite care grant will be paid each year, even after payment of carer&rsquo;s benefit has ceased, for as long as the person satisfies the full-time care and other qualifying conditions.</P>

	<P>The laptop belonging to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG) was reported missing in April, 2007.  On 1st of August, 2008, some 16 months after the laptop went missing, the Office of the C&amp;AG informed the Department that the missing laptop contained a number of files used in connection with the audit of the Social Insurance Fund for 2004 and 2005.</P>
        <P>Since being notified of the contents of the laptop on 1 August, 2008, the Department has taken all reasonable steps to minimise any anxiety which may have been caused to its customers.  The Department contacted the Garda&iacute;, various other Government Departments and agencies and payment institutions.  To date there is no indication of any systematic misuse of the information contained on the laptop in the seventeen months since the theft occurred.  Information notices were placed in the press and all of the customers concerned were contacted in writing.  In addition, a &lsquo;freephone&rsquo; help desk was established in order to deal with customer enquiries, offer advice and allay concerns.</P>
        <P>While the Department deeply regrets the loss of this information, there is no evidence of any injury, loss or damage having been suffered by any of our customers arising from the theft of the laptop which might give rise to consideration of compensation.</P>

	<P>The person concerned is receiving disability allowance since July 1995.  The weekly rate of disability allowance payment depends on the amount of weekly means assessed.  Under the legislative provisions that apply to disability allowance all income which the claimant has, subject to certain exceptions, is assessable as means. Income derived from private pensions is not included in these exceptions, and is accordingly assessed in full as means for the purposes of disability allowance.</P>
        <P>The means of the person concerned were reviewed in June 2008 in order to establish her current entitlement to disability allowance.  She was assessed with weekly means of &euro;131.00 based on her private pension and consequently her rate of disability allowance was reduced to &euro;67.80 from 2 July 2008.  A letter issued to her on 24 June 2008 notifying her of this decision and of her right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  She lodged an appeal with the SWAO on 17 September 2008.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, which is administered by the Community Welfare Division of the Health Service Executive (HSE),  is designed to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. </P>
        <P>Under the legislation governing the scheme, the HSE may make a single payment to meet an exceptional need to people on social welfare or health board payments.  This is a once-off payment to meet an unforeseen or special need that cannot be met from a person&rsquo;s basic income.  Assistance in the form of an Urgent Needs Payment (UNP) can be also made to persons who would not normally be entitled to SWA, to assist, for example in cases of flood damage with immediate needs, such as food, clothing, fuel, household goods and shelter. Assistance can be provided to people affected in cash or in kind.</P>
        <P>Over the past few months, flooding has been experienced in a number of areas of the country.  The Department&rsquo;s role in response to the recent flooding primarily involves supporting the community welfare service in the provision of ENP and UNP funding in the short term and other supports where applicable to cater for the long term effects of the flooding.  Any support given relates to damage to a person&rsquo;s home or loss of essential items.  It does not extend to business or commercial losses.</P>
        <P>Local community welfare officers are available to provide assistance on an individual basis where that is warranted.  If any person is experiencing hardship as a result of the recent flooding, they should contact their local community welfare officer in the first instance.</P>

	<P>Spouses working for self-employed contributors are specifically excepted from social insurance contributions.  However, spouses who are actively engaged in a commercial partnership, including the operation of a farm, as opposed to simply being the joint owners of a property, are treated as individual self-employed contributors and are thus liable to social insurance contributions. </P>
        <P>On foot of a Programme for Government commitment an information leaflet, &lsquo;Working with your spouse: how it affects your social welfare contributions and entitlements&rsquo;, has been developed between the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to set out the social welfare and tax implications of families co-working in a shared business.  It was published on the 25 th of June, 2008.</P>
        <P>The leaflet clarifies that spouses who operate in a commercial partnership may be brought into the social insurance system, subject to certain criteria.  In this way, both spouses incur a liability to pay self-employed PRSI and build up entitlement towards a contributory state pension and other Social Welfare benefits.  Retrospective liability to pay self-employed PRSI can, depending on the circumstances of each case, be incurred from 1988, when self-employed PRSI was introduced.  Application for benefits would take place in the usual way, following any <Col N="663"/>approval of an application for commercial partnership status and the payment of any resulting PRSI liabilities.</P>
        <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners use the following factors to decide if a partnership normally exist there is a written partnership agreement (a written agreement is not required by law, however); each partner writes cheques on the business accounts in their own right; there is a joint business account; it is apparent to those doing business with the partnership that a partnership exists; business accounts and activities are in joint names of the partners; each partner makes a significant contribution to the running of the business; the business is owned jointly by the partnership; the profits and losses of the partnership are shared by each partner; the business stationery reflects the existence of a partnership.</P>
        <P>An applicant should meet some of these general criteria if they are claiming to be in a partnership with their spouse.  If they cannot do this, they will be deemed not to be in a business partnership.  It is not possible to estimate the number of people, and resulting costs, who may apply for commercial partnership status as a result of this publication. However, the leaflet will be of interest to significant numbers of couples operating farms and other small business enterprises.  Persons interested in applying for partnership status should firstly study a copy of the leaflet, available from the Information Section of the Department or at www.welfare.ie , which sets out the application procedure in detail.</P>

	<P>Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE), as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Rent supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution, currently &euro;13, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  Many recipients pay more than &euro;13 because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their accommodation costs.  The rent supplement recipient was in receipt of disability allowance while her spouse was originally in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance (SWA).  Their total income at that time was equivalent to the SWA rate appropriate to their family size and they were required to pay &euro;13 towards their rent.  However, when her spouse was awarded jobseekers allowance the couples combined income exceeded the rate of SWA appropriate to their family size, by &euro;66.50. They were then required to pay &euro;79.50 towards their rent and their entitlement to rent supplement was reduced accordingly.  However, their overall income, after their rent is paid remains the same.</P>
        <P>In cases where additional income is derived from part-time employment or training allowances, the first &euro;75 per week is disregarded in full and 25% of any further additional income above &euro;75 per week is also disregarded.  These arrangements also apply to people who take up full-time employment provided they are eligible for the rental accommodation scheme.  This ensures that people who take up a training course offer, for example with F&Aacute;S where an additional training allowance may be payable, are financially better off for having done so.  If <Col N="664"/>the person concerned is not satisfied with the decision of the HSE, it is open to her to lodge an appeal against the decision.</P>

        <Quest> if her attention has been drawn to the fact that there is no social welfare or foster care payment available to the guardian of children who are left in their care by a sole surviving parent who has been incarcerated; if this was the intended effect of the change in the legislation in 2005; and if she will ensure that contact is made with the Department of Health and Children to address this anomaly. </Quest>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1316 and 1317 together. </P>
        <P>The Guardian&rsquo;s payment schemes allow for the provision of a weekly allowance to a guardian of a child who has either been orphaned or whose parents have abandoned and failed to provide for the child.</P>
        <P>Section 2 (1) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005 defines an orphan as a qualified child both of whose parents are dead, or one of whose parents is dead or unknown or has abandoned and failed to provide for the child, as the case may be, and whose other parent is unknown, or has abandoned and failed to provide for the child, where that child is not residing with a parent, adoptive parent or step-parent.</P>
        <P>All claims for Guardian&rsquo;s payment are decided by a Deciding Officer appointed by the Minister under Section 299 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005. Prior to decision, claims are referred to a Social Welfare Inspector in order to establish if the conditions of entitlement are fulfilled. The Social Welfare Inspector completes a report on all relevant issues and this report is then referred to the Deciding Officer to make a decision on the claim.</P>
        <P>A parent&rsquo;s committal to prison alone is not considered sufficient qualifying criteria to satisfy the legislative definition of orphan. However, the incarceration of a parent is one of the factors which is considered in determining if the legislative provision relating to abandonment and failure to provide is satisfied. Where a child whose parent/s have been incarcerated is cared for by another person for the period of that incarceration and their carer is in receipt of a social welfare payment, an increase for a qualified child may be payable for each child.</P>
        <P>A Foster Care Allowance is paid by the HSE in respect of a child who is in the care of the State. The legislative change in 2005 was solely to ensure that two state payments, Foster Care and Guardians Payment, were not being made in respect of the same child.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the views of the ILO Committee of Experts, which examines annual national reports on compliance <Col N="665"/>with the European Code of Social Security on behalf of the Council of Europe, were sought on the conclusions of the IHRC report, and in particular whether the provisions of the Code require the payment of a pension in the circumstances of the case in question, regardless of how few contributions have been paid by the person involved.</P>
        <P>The ILO Committee completed its report on compliance with the Code earlier this year and submitted its conclusions for consideration to the Committee of Ministers. The Committee of Ministers accepted the recommendations in the ILO report and confirmed that Ireland was in conformity with the Code on this issue. The Committee published its decision on the 21st May 2008 and the Department notified the IHRC of the result.</P>

	<P>Disability Allowance is a weekly Allowance paid to people with a specified disability who are aged over 16 and under 66.  The disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to both medical assessment and a means test.  The person concerned made an application for Disability Allowance on 31st July 2008.  The application was referred to a Social Welfare Inspector to determine his means. The Inspector interviewed him on 8 September 2008 and subsequently wrote to him requesting details from him in relation to farm expenses.</P>

        <P>The person concerned has provided medical evidence in support of his application. This will be reviewed by one of the Department&rsquo;s Medical Assessors shortly.  A final decision will be given on his entitlement to disability allowance upon receipt of the Social Welfare Inspector and Medical Assessor&rsquo;s reports. He will be notified directly of the outcome.</P>

	<P>Disability Allowance is a weekly payment made to persons with a disability whose employment capacity is substantially restricted by reason of their disability and whose means are insufficient to meet their own needs and those of their dependents. My Department has implemented a considerable number of changes to the Disability Allowance scheme since it was introduced in 1996, notably in relation to the progressive easing of the means test.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Disability Allowance means test is to ensure that people who have insufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for benefit, receive an assistance-based payment while ensuring that resources are targeted at those most in need. Thus social protection of the population in general is provided through a combination of insurance-based payments and payments targeted at need.</P>
        <P>Recipients of Disability Allowance may avail of opportunities to take up vocational training and qualify for a training allowance from F&Aacute;S in lieu of Disability Allowance. Where relevant, they will continue to qualify for secondary benefits such as the Household Benefits Package, Free Travel and Rent or Mortgage Interest Supplement. In the event that are unable to continue attending the training course, they revert automatically to receipt of Disability Allowance.</P>
        <P>More generally, the conditions governing access to F&Aacute;S training courses are a matter for F&Aacute;S itself and for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I understand, however, that access to F&Aacute;S training courses for people with disabilities are not confined to people in receipt of a social welfare payment.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. Mortgage interest supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence. The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only. Attached is a table showing the expenditure on mortgage interest supplements by month for the past 12 months. The total number of recipients of mortgage interest supplement has increased from 3,424 at the end of 2006 to 4,111 at the end of 2007. There has been a further increase in 2008 to 6,191 at the 12 September 2008. </P>
        <P>Overall, I am satisfied that the mortgage interest supplement schemes provide an adequate short-term &ldquo;safety net&rdquo; within the overall social welfare system to ensure that people do not suffer hardship due to loss of employment. Nonetheless I intend to keep the scheme under review to ensure that it meets the objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis. Developments in relation to current year expenditure are being closely monitored in the context of the Government&rsquo;s framework for reporting on public expenditure.Expenditure on Mortgage Interest Supplement by month for the last 12 months</P>

        <P>The State Agencies currently operating under the aegis of my Department are the Pensions Board, the Citizens Information Board, the Family Support Agency and the Combat Poverty Agency. In addition the Pensions Ombudsman also comes under the remit of my Department. The Chief Executive of the Pensions Board is on an annual salary of &euro; 150,712 and is a member of the Board&rsquo;s Superannuation Scheme. The salary range for the Chief Executive of the Citizens Information Board is &euro;110,889 to &euro;133,654. The salary of the new Chief Executive is being finalised and he is a member of the Board&rsquo;s Superannuation Scheme. The Chief Executive of the Family Support Agency is on an annual salary of &euro;120,190. He is currently on secondment from the Health Service Executive (HSE) and he remains a member of the HSE Superannuation Scheme.</P>
        <P>The salary for the post of Director in the Combat Poverty Agency is linked to the Principal Officer Higher Scale in the civil service and would normally include membership of the Agency&rsquo;s Superannuation Scheme. The position is currently being filled on an acting basis. The Actin g Director is on a salary of &euro;73,800 per annum, which takes account of public service pensions already in payment. The Acting Director is not a member of the Agency&rsquo;s Superannuation Scheme.</P>
        <P>Schemes of performance-related pay can apply to the Chief Executive Officers of non-commercial State sponsored bodies. All of the above post holders are eligible to be considered for a performance related bonus payment of up to a maximum of 20% of basic salary. Decisions regarding the level of payments to be awarded in individual cases is the responsibility of the Board of the body concerned.  The Pensions Ombudsman is on an annual salary of &euro;136,581. He is a member of the Model Pension Scheme for State Sponsored Bodies.   All are entitled to standard travel and subsistence allowances and recoupment of other vouched expenses incurred wholly, properly and exclusively in the performance of their duties. Such expenses are administered by the Agencies.</P>
<P>Details of the level of fees payable to the Board of the Agencies under the aegis of the Department are set out in the tabular statement. Fees payable to Board members of the Agencies under the aegis of the Department of Social and Family Affairs for the period 2005 &mdash; 2008 are as shown below:</P>

        <P>The Deputies may be interested to know that, as detailed below, there were near ly three times as many Ministerial staff in this Department in 1996. At that time, there were 17 staff in the Minister De Rossa&rsquo;s office, 3 of whom were non-civil servants. Minister De Rossa also had a policy unit with 6 staff, 5 of whom were non-civil servants. No such unit has been put in place by any Minister since 1997. The Department also had a Minister of State in 1996, Bernard Durkan TD, who had 13 staff. The total staffing, therefore, was 36 in 1996, compared with 14 now. The total number of non-civil servants was 12 at that time, compared with 2 at present.</P>

	<P>Jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is an insurance based scheme. There are two main contribution conditions that have to be satisfied in order to qualify for payment.  A person must have at least 52 reckonable contributions paid between the date of entry into insurable employment and the date the claim is made. Only contributions payable at Classes A, H and P (or the equivalent rates before April 1979) are reckonable for this purpose.</P>
        <P>In addition to having the 52 reckonable contributions paid, a person must also have at least 39 reckonable contributions paid or credited in the Governing Contribution Year, or have at least 26 reckonable contributions paid in both the Governing Contribution Year (GCY) and the year immediately preceding the GCY.  The Governing Contribution Year (GCY) is the second last complete contribution year before the benefit year in which the claim is made. The current Governing Contribution Year is 2006 for jobseekers benefit claims made in 2008.</P>

A mortgage interest supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence. </P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has advised that the position remains unchanged from that advised in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 567 on 17th June 2008. One of the conditions for receipt of mortgage interest supplement is that the claimant must have been in a position to meet the mortgage repayments when the loan agreement was entered into. The Executive has advised that the person concerned was refused mortgage interest supplement as his current financial circumstances are the same as when the loan agreement was entered into.</P>
        <P>The Executive has further advised that the person concerned appealed the decision to the HSE Appeals Office and the refusal was upheld. It is open to him to lodge an appeal against the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>

	<P>Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE), as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Rent supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution, currently &euro;13, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Many recipients pay more than &euro;13 because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their accommodation costs. </P>
        <P>The first &euro;75 of additional income, that is, income above the standard rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to a person&rsquo;s circumstances, is disregarded for rent supplement purposes, with any additional income above &euro;75 assessed at 75%. This measure ensures that people have a financial incentive to take up education or training opportunities.  The person concerned is in receipt of one-parent family payment (OFP) and a F&Aacute;S training allowance. Prior to participation in F&Aacute;S training course she contributed &euro;13 towards her rent. Her income has increased by &euro;177.80 and &euro;100.70 of that income was disregarded when reviewing her entitlement to rent supplement. Consequently she now contributes an additional &euro;77.10 towards her rent but she is still &euro;100.70 better off, per week, as a result of participating in the F&Aacute;S training course.  If she is not satisfied with the decision of the Executive, it is open to her to lodge an appeal against the decision.</P>

	<P>An  tArd Chlar&aacute;itheoir (Registrar General) is the person with statutory responsibility for the administration of the civil registration system in Ireland, including civil marriages.  I have made enquiries with an tArd Chlar&aacute;itheoir and the position is as follows.  There are two provisions that allow for the removal of the particulars of a man named as father of a child in an entry in the register of births and, if appropriate, the amendment of the entry by the addition of the biological father&rsquo;s particulars.</P>
        <P>Section 65 of the Civil Registration Act, 2004 allows the Registrar General to hold an enquiry in order to examine any entry and to determine whether the entry is correct and complete and, if it is not, to cause the correction or completion of the entry.  The Registrar General will consider all submissions and evidence put before him in the course of an enquiry under section 65 as to the parentage of a child.  In order to remove or amend the father&rsquo;s particulars, proofs of the paternity of the child to whom the entry relates are required, such as DNA or other paternity analysis from a reliable laboratory.  It is important that the samples sent for analysis should be taken by a registered medical practitioner or other qualified person who can certify that the samples were taken from the named individuals concerned: Tests where the chain of control of the samples cannot be independently verified cannot be accepted as conclusive evidence.</P>
        <P>In addition, statutory declarations from the mother, the man named as father in the entry and (if applicable), the biological father are required.</P>
        <P>Under section 35 of the Status of Children Act, 1987, it is open to a person (or, if the person is a minor, to a person acting as the child&rsquo;s next friend) to apply for a declaration of parentage. <Col N="674"/>Such declarations may be granted by a judge of the Circuit Family Law Court and are binding upon the State.  A Superintendent Registrar, if furnished with a certified copy of a declaration of parentage and a statutory declaration from a qualified informant, may correct an error of fact relating to the parentage of a child in an entry in the register of births under the provisions of section 63 of the Civil Registration Act 2004.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1339 and 1340 together. </P>
        <P>Supporting and recognising carers in our society is, and has been, a priority of the Government since 1997.  Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.</P>
        <P>From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full-time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income. A carer who is caring for two or more people is entitled to a full grant for each of the care recipients. The rate of the grant increased to &euro;1,700 per year from June 2008.</P>
        <P>In order to qualify for the respite care grant, the applicant must be providing, or likely to provide, full-time care and attention to a person who needs such care for a period of six months and be providing that care on the specified date in June of the relevant year. There are no provisions to allow for payment of a partial grant where a person provides care for part of the year, excluding the June date. Unfortunately, the person concerned did not satisfy the condition regarding the payment date and, therefore, no respite care grant is payable in this case. While, all payments to carers will continue to be kept under review there are no plans at present to introduce a pro rata respite care grant.</P>

	<P>The pre-retirement allowance (PRETA) was discontinued for new applicants from 4th July, 2007, while people who had already been receiving this allowance can continue to receive it as long as they satisfy the conditions for payment. People who would have been eligible for PRETA can continue to receive the jobseekers allowance, which is paid at the same rate as PRETA.</P>
        <P>Given the need to ensure the sustainability of the social welfare system in the light of the demographic challenges that lie ahead, the system is being reformed to encourage and facilitate people to continue to work up to pension age, and if they so choose beyond that age. These reforms are in line with the process of modernising social protection systems taking place internationally. In the circumstances, I have no plans to re-introduce this allowance.</P>

	<P>The organisation concerned applied for a grant under the 2008 Scheme of Grants for Marriage, Child and Bereavement Counselling Services administered by the Family Support Agency. The remit of the grant scheme is very specific and provides only for the payment of grants to voluntary organisations providing one or more of the following: Marriage Preparation Courses,Marriage Counselling,Child Counselling in relation to parental separation, Bereavement Counselling/Support on the death of a family member.  The application was rejected as the services the group wished to provide i.e. an in-house counselling service for unmarried and separated fathers did not come within the remit of the scheme. The group was informed of the decision and the reason on 7 th August 2008.  The Department does not have any other funding streams from which monies could be made available.</P>

	<P>The Department is committed to providing a quality customer service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply.  These conditions vary between the two jobseeker schemes and involve, among other things, the need to establish the person&rsquo;s social insurance record, establish the person&rsquo;s identity or their place of habitual residence and to assess means where appropriate.  In some cases delays arise where the person fails to supply all pertinent information in support of their application.  The average processing time for applications processed in August was 3 weeks for jobseekers benefit claims and 5 weeks for jobseekers allowance claims.</P>
        <P>The overall performance in any individual office in processing claims can be adversely affected by a wide variety of factors; including increased inflow of claims,staff vacancies and the duration of such vacancies and the turnover of staff in the office. Since the beginning of <Col N="677"/>year there has been a significant increase in the number of claims for a jobseeker payment and the Department has taken a number of measures to deal with the increased workload.  These measures include the allocation of additional posts to local offices, extending the contracts of some temporary staff and sanctioning overtime.  At a local level work is prioritised to deal with claim processing.   These measures will be kept under review.</P>

	<P>The average time for deciding a claim for carer&rsquo;s allowance is currently 15.6 weeks.  Entitlement to carer&rsquo;s allowance is based on an applicant satisfying medical, means and residency conditions.  In determining entitlement to the allowance there are, in certain cases, unavoidable time lags involved in making the necessary investigations and enquiries to enable accurate decisions to be made.  Delays can also arise if people applying for the allowance are not in a position to supply all the necessary information in support of their claim.  Many applicants for carer&rsquo;s allowance are already in receipt of another social welfare payment while their claim is being processed.   The number of claims for carers allowance submitted in 2007 was 18,000 compared to 10,700 in 2006, an increase of 68%.   A total of 13,900 new applications for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance have been received this year to date (week end 12 September 2008).  The large increase in applications received is mainly due to the introduction of the half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance payment which came into effect from 27 September 2007. Entitlement to carer&rsquo;s benefit is based on an applicant satisfying medical, employment and PRSI contribution conditions.</P>
        <P>The average time for deciding an application for carer&rsquo;s benefit is currently 8 weeks.  During 2007 the average time to decide a claim was 12 weeks. The number of claims for Carer&rsquo;s Benefit submitted in 2007 was 2,403 compared to 2,221 in 2006.  A total of 1,728 new applications have been received this year to date (week end 12th September 2008).</P>

	<P>The Government discussion paper, Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents, put forward proposals to tackle obstacles to employment for lone parents and other low income families. Under the proposals the lone parenthood category of payment would no longer exist. Instead, a new payment would be made to all parents (living alone or with a partner), with young children, on low income.</P>
        <P>The non-income recommendations contained in the discussion paper were examined in two areas: Coolock and Kilkenny.  These studies, which took place between November 2007 and February 2008, were carried out to facilitate the development of the policy and operational details of the new scheme. They have highlighted how lone parents are not a homogenous group, are of different ages, have experienced different routes into lone parenthood and have different needs.</P>
        <P>The experience of this engagement process is feeding into the development of our approach to working with lone parents and qualified adults to support them into education, training and employment. Work is also ongoing in addressing possible poverty traps in the new income support scheme.</P>

        <Quest> the maximum income the spouse of a person receiving jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit may earn for the jobseeker to retain entitlement to the maximum and the minimum amount of assistance possible under the private mortgage interest supplement scheme; and if she will provide a sliding scale of entitlement by income level. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of Mortgage Interest Supplement is to provide short term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only. </P>
        <P>Under standard SWA rules, Mortgage Interest Supplements are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution, currently &euro;13, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  Many recipients pay more than &euro;13 because they are required also, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their accommodation costs.</P>
        <P>Since June 2007, where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes.</P>
        <P>In determining entitlement to mortgage interest supplement, the Executive must be satisfied that the amount of the mortgage interest payable by the claimant does not exceed such amount as it considers reasonable to meet his or her residential and other needs.  In exceptional circumstances, the Health Service Executive may award a supplement where the amount of mortgage interest payable by a person exceeds such amount as the Health Service Executive considers reasonable to meet his or her residential and other needs in general such supplement is paid for a maximum of 12 months from the date of the claim.</P>
        <P>Subject to a person meeting the qualifying conditions of the scheme, there are a number of factors that would affect the amount of mortgage interest supplement payable in any case including: the size of the mortgage and the amount of mortgage interest payable; the earnings of the spouse and its impact on the amount of jobseekers benefit payable in respect of a qualified adult; the number of hours per week worked: mortgage interest supplement is not payable where a member of the household works for 30 or more hours per week; whether the Executive considers the amount of mortgage interest to be reasonable.</P>
        <P>It is therefore not possible to provide a meaningful maximum or minimum amount of mortgage interest supplement that could be payable.  However, an example is set out in the attached tabular statement, based on a person paying &euro;200 per week in mortgage interest. The tabular statement sets out the amount of mortgage interest supplement that would be payable where a spouse of a person receiving jobseekers benefit engages in employment at the minimum wage at up to 29 hours per week.  This shows that as household income increases, the amount of mortgage interest supplement payable is reduced, but at a slower rate so that the household is financially better off as the income from employment increases.</P><Col N="679"/>

        <Quest> the general criteria applying to those applying to their local community welfare officer for humanitarian aid following the August 2008 floods; if income thresholds are applied; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, which is administered by the Community Welfare Division of the Health Service Executive (HSE), is designed to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. </P>
        <P>Under the legislation governing the scheme, the HSE may make a single payment to meet an exceptional need to people on social welfare or health service executive payments.  This is a once-off payment to meet an unforeseen or special need that cannot be met from a person&rsquo;s basic income. Assistance in the form of an Urgent Needs Payment (UNP) can be also made to <Col N="680"/>persons who would not normally be entitled to SWA, to assist, for example in cases of flood damage with immediate needs, such as food, clothing, fuel, household goods and shelter. Assistance can be provided to people affected in cash or in kind.</P>
        <P>There is no automatic entitlement to these payments.  Each application is determined on the particular circumstances of the case. In assessing income, consideration is given as to whether a person is in receipt of a social welfare or health service executive payment or to the gross household income with allowance made as appropriate under normal SWA means assessments.</P>
        <P>Over the past few months, flooding has been experienced in a number of areas of the country. The Department&rsquo;s role in response to the recent flooding primarily involves supporting the community welfare service in the provision of ENP and UNP funding in the short term and other supports where applicable to cater for the long term effects of the flooding.  Any support given relates to damage to a person&rsquo;s home or loss of essential items.  It does not extend to business or commercial losses.</P>
        <P>Local community welfare officers are available to provide assistance on an individual basis where that is warranted. Any person experiencing hardship as a result of the recent flooding should contact their local Community Welfare Officer in the first instance.</P>

	<P>People receiving Child Benefit are required, from time to time to complete a residency certification letter to confirm their on-going entitlement to the payment.  A certification letter issued to the customer on 08/07/08 and as no reply was received within the specified time limit of 21 days, payment was suspended.  A response was received from the customer on 15/09/08 and payment was restored for all her children, on 19/09/08.  This payment will be available for collection at her nominated post office on Tuesday 30th September.</P>

        <Quest> if she will amend the regulations governing the fuel allowance scheme to allow for discretion to be exercised by himself to allow for back dating of payment of fuel allowance in circumstances where the householder would have normally qualified for the fuel allowance scheme but where the household had not made an application on time; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The Department&rsquo;s role is to assist social welfare recipients with heating costs, both through their basic payments and through the household benefits package with fuel, electricity and gas allowances. These schemes have been improved significantly in recent years.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Fuel Allowance is ordinarily paid to eligible people from the date of application.  The majority of people applying for Fuel Allowance do so at the same time as their application for a primary social welfare payment.  If eligible, a person&rsquo;s primary payment and fuel allowance are put into payment at the same time.  Backdating may occur where there are extenuating circumstances <Col N="681"/>and applies to individual cases only.If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, perhaps he could provide details to the Department so that the issue can be reviewed.	</P>

        <P>The Centenary commemoration of the Easter Rising and the other events of the independence period, including the Great War and the Battle of the Somme, will be addressed through a comprehensive programme to be implemented across several years.  I will be arranging for a meeting soon of the re-constituted Oireachtas All Party Consultation Group on these commemorative issues.  With a view to a developing programme, I will inform the Group of progress on current projects and the consideration towards future plans.  I expect that the framework for the commemorative programme will be launched sufficiently in advance of the Centenary anniversaries to ensure that commemorative initiatives by interested parties may be informed of opportunities for support or association with the national programme.</P>
        <P>The Government have not yet received the report of the Office of Public Works on their preliminary consideration of the potential for development at the GPO complex in Dublin.  This report will be completed in coming weeks.  A phased multi-annual programme of works is underway at Glasnevin cemetery, scheduled for completion in 2016.  The preparation of the personal files and records in the Military Archives for public access has started.  A dedicated project team has been assigned to this work.  The scoping exercise has been completed and a workplan developed.</P>

A state-owned site in the Curragh has been chosen for a new building to accommodate DFHQ.  The outline design of the building has been developed in conjunction with the Office of Public Works (OPW) and the planning process has been completed.  The project will proceed to the next stage, invitation of tenders for construction of the new building, subject to completion of tender documentation by OPW and approval of the necessary funding.  The total cost and timescale for completion of the project will be determined by the outcome of the tender competition.  Expenditure on the project will be borne on the Vote for the OPW.   </P>

	<P>I am advised that the procurement of the Dauphin helicopters in the 1980s followed from competitive tendering competitions at that time based on specifications drawn up by the Air Corps.  In 2005, the General Officer Commanding Air Corps recommended the sale of four Dauphin helicopters. The Dauphins at that stage needed significant maintenance and the investment required was considered to be excessive for the potential return and was not proceeded with in favour of a re-equipment programme. This programme has seen the acquisition of 2 EC135 helicopters and 6 AW 139 helicopters for the Air Corps, with the final AW 139 helicopter due for acceptance next month.</P><Col N="691"/>
        <P>The four Dauphins, special tools and spare parts were sold following an open tender competition to Rotor Leasing Incorporated in the USA for &euro;311,000 in October 2006.</P>

	<P>In order to facilitate the continued independent occupancy of their own homes by older people and people with a disability, my Department undertook a review of the operation of a number of grant schemes, including the Essential Repairs Grant.  Given the overlapping nature of the schemes, it was also necessary to review the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme (SHAE) operated by the Health Service Executive.  Following this, the Government decided in February 2006 to transfer the SHAE to my Department.</P>
        <P>On 1 November 2007, a new Housing Aid for Older People Scheme was introduced by my Department and is being administered by the local authorities. This scheme replaced the Essential Repairs Grant Scheme and the SHAE.  Following a period of overlap with the new scheme, the SHAE was discontinued from 1 August 2008.

	<P>Section 25 of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act, 1997, as amended, provides for the preparation of planning schemes by the Authority for the Custom House Docks Area or any part thereof, and any other area specified for that purpose by Ministerial Order.

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Planning and Development Act 2000 sets out clearly the roles of local and central Government in the development plan process.</P>
        <P>Under sections 9 and 10 of the Act, development plans are required to set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area and be consistent <Col N="696"/>with national plans, policies or strategies deemed by the Minister to relate to proper planning and sustainable development.  In accordance with Section 12 of the Act, as a statutory consultee on draft development plans, the Minister should assess the policies contained therein and outline to the relevant planning authority what changes, if any, are required to achieve these objectives.  In practice, as part of this process, my Department seeks to give a clear indication to planning authorities of the areas where the draft plan might need to be strengthened.  Ultimately, Section 31 of the Act provides that the Minister may direct a planning authority to amend its draft or adopted plan where these requirements are not adequately met.</P>
        <P>My Department issued Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Development Plans in June 2007 which sets out best practice in relation to the making, amendment and variation of development plans.  These guidelines were issued under section 28 of the Act which requires planning authorities to have regard to them in the performance of their functions.</P>
        <P>The Mayo County Development Plan 2008-2014 was adopted by the Council on 6 May 2008, following public consultation at draft and material amendment stages.  At both stages, my Department expressed serious concerns that the draft county settlement strategy did not accord adequate priority to the development of residentially zoned lands in the National Spatial Strategy linked hub of Castlebar-Ballina and that the rural settlement policy framework as proposed in the amended draft plan did not set out a proper strategy for the management of housing proposals in rural areas as recommended in the 2005 Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines for Planning Authorities.</P>
        <P>The Council did not address these concerns and in order to ensure the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, I issued a Direction to the Council on 11 July 2008 under section 31 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 requiring the Council to vary their Plan.</P>

	<P>Housing authorities conduct their triennial housing needs assessment in accordance with Section 9 of the Housing Act 1988.  Prior to any assessment being carried out the Department issues guidance to housing authorities to ensure a consistent assessment system.  It is a matter for individual authorities, in accordance with legislation and having regard to guidance issued by my Department, to undertake the assessment of need.  </P>
        <P>The assessment requires local authorities, taking all reasonable measures, to contact existing applicants on their waiting list to determine if they are still in need of housing.  This is usually done by writing directly to existing applicants and advertising in the locality that an assessment is being carried out.  Authorities are also required to contact the local offices of the HSE and various voluntary organisations whose members may be in need of housing.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s housing policy statement &mdash; Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities &mdash; published in 2007 signalled the intention to introduce a new means for assessing housing need.  The key objectives of the new assessment process are to ensure consistency, efficiency, accuracy and fairness in the assessment process. Following consultation with a wide range of interests a new system for assessing need has been developed and will be underpinned by provisions in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008, published in July 2008.</P>

	<P>Hare coursing in the State is administered by the Irish Coursing Club which is a body set up under the Greyhound Industry Act 1958.  Statutory responsibility for the Act is a matter for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.  My responsibilities under the Wildlife Acts relate to the conservation of populations of certain protected species.</P>
        <P>In any case where a hunting licence under the Wildlife Act, 1976, is required, each licence application is dealt with individually and any conservation impact on the particular species is taken into account in line with the provisions of the Act.  My Department recently issued a licence under the Wildlife Acts to the Irish Coursing Club allowing its affiliated clubs to net hares for the purpose of hare coursing for the 2008/2009 season, subject to certain conditions. Clubs will be strictly monitored for adherence to these conditions.</P>
        <P>There is no current evidence that coursing has a significant effect on hare populations and the decision to issue this licence took into consideration the report of the Status of Hares in Ireland &mdash; Hare Survey of Ireland 2006/07.</P>
        <P>Animal welfare and legal protection of animals from cruelty are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  The Programme for Government includes a commitment that a comprehensive Animal Welfare Bill will be introduced, which will update existing legislation to ensure that the welfare of animals is properly protected and that the penalties for offenders are increased significantly.</P>

	<P>Housing Authorities are responsible for the operation of the tenant purchase scheme and, in assessing loan applications, they have due regard to family circumstances and the ability to service a mortgage.

A number of the authorities faced with particularly significant levels of demand under the schemes so far this year received notification recently of supplementary allocations. While Westmeath County Council was not among those authorities, the issue of an additional allocation to the Council will be considered in the event of further funding becoming available.</P>

	<P>Since the announcement in May 2008 that a number of housing regeneration Public-Private Partnership projects would not be proceeding as planned, my Department has worked closely with Dublin City Council to ensure that all possible avenues for moving these projects forward are examined, particularly those estates which still have residents in situ.  In relation to those specific estates, discussions are ongoing between the City Council and the second bidders for the St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate and Dominick Street projects, and a multidisciplinary team has been established within the Council to identify the next steps for the regeneration of O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens.  My Department will continue to engage closely with the City Council in relation to these projects.</P>
        <P>Regarding the existing tenants of the estates in question, I have asked Dublin City Council to prioritise the securing of alternative accommodation for those families who wish to move.  To date, the City Council has identified and offered alternative accommodation to the remaining residents of St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate, while those households at O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens and Dominick Street continue to be prioritised under the authority&rsquo;s normal allocations procedure.</P>
        <P>Public Private Partnerships continue to represent an important means for securing the involvement of the private sector in the development of major regeneration projects. Apart from delivering value for money solutions, the housing-related PPP model also represents an effective way of delivering on our objective of building sustainable communities, as it makes provision for social, income, and tenure-mix through the inclusion of both public and private housing, community facilities and commercial development.</P>
        <P>Therefore, the involvement of private finance will continue to be a feature in the development of mixed, sustainable communities.  However, in light of the experience with certain projects in Dublin, a review of the housing-related PPP process has been initiated.  My Department <Col N="704"/>has established an inter-agency group to examine the matters involved and it is expected that this group will report later in the Autumn.</P>

It was agreed that the Housing Association would submit a report to Wicklow County Council setting out, inter alia, the cost of repairing fire damage to the building, the amount to be recouped from their insurers in respect of the fire damage and the funding required to complete the outstanding works.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s housing policy statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities and the National Development Plan 2007-2013 (NDP) reflect the strong commitment to expand the provision of social and affordable housing contained in the social partnership agreement Towards 2016. The impact of the record levels of investment this Government is committing to these housing programmes is already evident. </P><Col N="705"/>
        <P>Last year, over 13,000 social and affordable housing units were delivered and, overall, the needs of almost 18,300 households were met through the broad range of social and affordable housing programmes. That represents a very significant increase of 24% on the level of needs met in 2006.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>The funding provided for housing programmes has been increased again in 2008, with some &euro;2.5 billion available to local authorities and the voluntary and co-operative sectors for their activities.  This will allow for the commencement of a significant number of new social housing units, further progress under regeneration programmes, and the completion of a large number of units under both the local authority and voluntary housing programmes.  The supply of affordable housing has consistently increased over the past few years.  From about 2,000 units in 2004, delivery reached almost 3,600 units last year and further expansion is envisaged under the National Development Plan 2007-2013.</P>
        <P>The Government believes that home ownership should be available to as many people as possible, where this is their preferred option.  Building on the general policy framework set out in Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, the Affordable Homes Partnership was requested to examine ways of enhancing the delivery of affordable housing.  The report, prepared on foot of their study, was published in April 2008 for public consultation and my Department has also consulted with the social partners in relation to the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  The report recommends some improvements in aspects of programme delivery and also recommends a new product to replace the existing range of schemes. I am giving careful consideration to the report and the results of the consultation process, in addressing future directions in relation to affordable housing.</P>

	<P>The Government has undertaken a broad range of actions as part of a strategic response to enhance the range of housing supports and services available to the disadvantaged and vulnerable in society, including older people and people with a disability.  These actions range from the introduction of better-targeted financial supports to the development of inter-agency protocols to ensure coordinated service delivery at local level where there is a care dimension in association with meeting housing need.</P>
        <P>The specific accommodation needs of older people can be met through a wide range of available supports.  These include local authority housing, voluntary and cooperative housing and the Housing Aid for Older People Scheme, introduced in November 2007, which provides targeted support to assist older people in carrying out necessary repairs and improvements to their homes.</P>
        <P>In addition, a cross-departmental team on sheltered housing for older people, chaired by my Department, was established in 2007 to develop and oversee policy and to agree, as a priority, local structures and protocols for integrated management and delivery of housing and related care services for older people.  The work of this group will ultimately feed into the Government&rsquo;s new National Positive Aging Strategy.</P>

	<P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 679 of 19 February, 2008 in which I set out the position in regard to wastewater treatment systems under the national Building Regulations.</P>
        <P>Clear and comprehensive best practice guidance in regard to Groundwater Protection and the Planning System was issued to all planning authorities by my Department in its Circular letter SP 5-03 of 31 July 2003.  As set out, it is the responsibility of planning authorities to monitor the degree to which those carrying out approved development meet their obligations to comply with the terms of planning permissions granted, and to enforce such terms where necessary.</P><Col N="707"/>
        <P>Planning authorities should ensure that the process of enforcing the terms of planning permissions for all developments involving on-site wastewater treatment and disposal, including septic tanks, is co-ordinated through a local authority-held database which would provide information such as the location and types of such systems relative to vulnerable areas, as well as details such as maintenance contracts.  Such a database can be used by the planning authority to structure an annual programme of testing and monitoring the performance of individual wastewater treatment and disposal systems, and is also of value in recording outputs from site assessments and providing inputs into new site assessments in terms of general drainage trends in an area.  It is a matter for planning authorities to ensure that adequate arrangements are put in place in these regards and to manage such monitoring systems.</P>
        <P>Moreover, my Department&rsquo;s Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines for Planning Authorities, which issued in April 2005, emphasised the need for adherence to best practice in order to protect water quality.  These guidelines were issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which requires planning authorities to have regard to such guidelines in the performance of their functions.</P>
        <P>The Water Services Act 2007 contains a number of significant provisions in relation to the operation of septic tanks.  It places a duty of care on the occupier or owner of a premises in relation to the maintenance of septic tanks and it also requires the occupier or owner to notify the water services authority where any leak, accident or other incident occurs relating to discharges of sewage from a septic tank, where it is likely to cause a risk to human health or safety or the environment.  In addition, it is open to local authorities to make and adopt bye-laws to require periodic inspections of septic tanks and other on-site proprietary treatment systems under the general powers available to them under the Local Government Act 2001.</P>
        <P>It is a standard feature of legislation generally that the owner/occupier of any property carries primary responsibility for compliance with all statutory requirements in relation to the property.  Accordingly, it is entirely appropriate that legislation should assign primary responsibility to a householder for ensuring that the activities of the household do not give rise to water pollution (or any other form of environmental pollution), under the broad &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle.  The European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations, 2006 (&ldquo;the Nitrates Regulations&rdquo;), therefore, assign primary responsibility to each farmer for ensuring compliance with the Regulations in relation to his/her farm.</P>
        <P>The relationship between a property owner and the supplier of any goods or services to the property is a matter of contract and law between them, including consumer law.  In this regard, it is to be assumed that a property owner would have a well-founded right of claim against any supplier who supplied products or services which did not perform to specification.</P>
        <P>A new European Standard (EN 12566-3) for small wastewater treatment plants has been introduced and is now in the transitional phase of implementation.  The need for new systems to comply with this standard has been brought to the attention of Local Authorities by my Department&rsquo;s Circular Letters BC16/2006 and BC 2/2008, dated 8 November 2006 and 28 January 2008 respectively.</P>
        <P>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is currently finalising a revised edition of their 2000 Manual on Wastewater Treatment Systems serving Single Houses in consultation with all interested parties.  The intention is that the revised document will take the form of a Code of Practice under Section 76 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.  It is understood that the EPA Code will refer to relevant European Standards and that the National Standards Authority of Ireland propose to withdraw an earlier one &mdash; SR6: 1991 &mdash; in favour of the <Col N="708"/>proposed new edition, when available.  My Department plans to call up the EPA Code in the relevant Technical Guidance Document to Part H of the Building Regulations, dealing with Drainage and Waste Water Disposal, and to consider any related issues at that time.  My Department has been in recent contact with the EPA with a view to securing early completion of the Code of Practice.</P>
        <P>My Department and the EPA made a presentation to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on domestic wastewater treatment services at their meeting on 15 July 2008 addressing, inter alia, certain of the matters to which I have referred.  A record of the discussion is available on www.oireachtas.ie.</P>
        <P>Addressing septic tank pollution is a high priority for me and my Department and I will be keeping the situation and existing and proposed measures under review to ensure protection of groundwater and surface water.</P>

	<P>The vehicles listed below have been purchased by my Department since September 2005.  No vehicles have been leased by the Department since that time.</P>
        <P>I have included CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions for motor vehicles acquired in 2008.  Given that CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions have not been a determinant for motor tax prior to January 2008, details of emissions for vehicles acquired in previous years are not readily available.  These will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), for whom the majority of vehicles are purchased, is moving, where possible, to introduce vehicles to its fleet which are biofuel compatible.  Approximately 17.5% of the fleet is currently run on biofuel and further use will be made of alternative transport fuels as older vehicles (including both road and work vehicles, such as tractors and quads) are replaced with newer models that can utilise biofuel.</P>

	<P>Under the decentralisation programme, all Dublin based operations of my Department are being decentralised, with the exception of Met &Eacute;ireann, ENFO, the Private Residential Tenancies Board and a co-ordination unit which it is proposed to retain in Dublin to assist with the Department&rsquo;s D&aacute;il and other business.  A total of 682 Dublin based posts will be transferred to four locations in the South East: Wexford (270 posts); Waterford (225 posts); New Ross (125 posts) and Kilkenny (62 posts).</P>
        <P>The first move will be the transfer of 270 posts to Wexford during 2009.  An advance office was established in Wexford in June, 2007 and 46 staff are assigned to it.  The Department&rsquo;s new building in Wexford is under construction and is expected to be completed by end December, 2008.  The accommodation will be ready for occupation from February, 2009 and the Department will then transfer the staff complement into these offices on a phased basis from Q1, 2009.</P>
        <P>232 staff are available for the 270 posts being decentralised (86% of the numbers required) and 175 of these staff are now in situ in the Department.  The Department expects that the full staff complement will be achieved in the period ahead.</P>

	<P>I have recently provided all housing authorities, including Town Councils with an indication of the general level of Exchequer funding that will be available over the next three years for the main housing investment programmes.  My Department will meet with each housing authority to discuss their plans as part of the Housing Action Plan review process, which is due to commence in early October.</P>
        <P>It is recognised that over time the management and integration of operational programmes has become more complex and some pooling of resources at a county level is required to ensure the efficient and effective delivery of the programmes.  Against this background and in the context of developing further the multi-annual financial framework for the housing investment programmes, I am considering how to provide greater flexibility for housing authorities in the management of their programmes.  The successful delivery of housing investment programmes depends on all housing authorities, including Town and Borough Councils.  In this context, the aim is to strengthen the capabilities of all housing authorities to enable them better to deliver housing services at local level in an integrated and effective manner.</P>
        <P>Currently, only one local authority manages its housing programme on a county at large basis.  For the remaining authorities, allocations continue to be made directly to individual City, County, Borough and Town Councils.</P>

	<P>Section 261 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 introduced a once-off system of registration for all quarries, except those for which planning permission was granted in the 5 years prior to the commencement of the section on 28 April 2004.

	<P>Significant progress has been made to address homelessness since the adoption of the Integrated Government Strategy on Homelessness in 2000 and the Homeless Preventative Strategy in 2002, as demonstrated in the Independent Review of the Implementation of Homeless Strategies carried out by Fitzpatrick Associates in 2006.  The progress achieved has included an improvement in both the quality and range of services for homeless persons, including new services for emergency, transitional and long-term accommodation and settlement and tenancy sustainment services designed to assist people out of homelessness.  Homeless fora have been established throughout the country and local action plans on homelessness have been adopted.</P>
        <P>Very significant resources have been committed to the development of homeless services since the publication of the first strategy in 2000.  Over the five years to end 2008, over &euro;272 million will have been provided through my Department and local authorities for ongoing <Col N="714"/>homeless accommodation and related costs.  Further substantial funding has been provided for capital investment in facilities, and by the HSE for the care-related costs of homeless services.  As evidenced in the triennial housing needs assessment, the number of homeless households reduced from 2,468 to 2,399 between 2002 and 2005, while the number of homeless individuals fell from 5,581 to 3,031. Details from the 2008 assessment are currently being finalised.</P>
        <P>A new Government strategy on homelessness, The Way Home: A Strategy to Address Adult Homelessness in Ireland 2008-2013, was published in August 2008.  The strategy builds on the strong progress made under the previous strategies and sets out a vision to address adult homelessness over the next five years.  In particular, key objectives will be the elimination of long-term occupancy of emergency homeless facilities, the prevention of homelessness as far as possible and the elimination of the need to sleep rough.  The new strategy sets out key performance indicators and these will be used to monitor progress of the implementation of the strategy and its impact nationally.</P>

	<P>Skip bags have become increasingly popular with the public as an alternative to the more traditional skip and particularly in circumstances where there is not enough waste to justify hiring a full-sized skip but too much for the regular household collection.

        <P>The Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations 2007 (as amended) came into operation on 1 June 2008 and replaced the Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations, 2001.

        <P>The regulations provide for nominated authorities to attach such conditions as it considers necessary relating to the use of skips or other such receptacles such as skip bags, including in respect of the care and disposal of the contents of such receptacles.

	<P>The EU Waste Shipments Regulation sets out the controls applicable to shipments of waste within, into, and out of the European Union.  It is directly applicable in the Member States.  All shipments of waste must follow various procedures and control regimes, which are determined by the type of waste shipped and the type of treatment that will be applied to the waste at its destination.  Thus, different levels of control regime apply depending on the risk posed by the waste and its treatment in terms of recovery or disposal.</P>
        <P>In addition, exports to third countries of waste intended for disposal are prohibited, except to EFTA countries which are party to the Basel Convention.  Exports of hazardous waste intended for recovery are prohibited, except those directed to countries to which an OECD decision applies, and to third countries which are party to the Basel Convention or countries which have concluded a bilateral agreement with the EU.</P>

        <Quest> the steps that have been taken to comply with the water framework directive, 2000/60/EC, and the bathing water directive, 2006/7/EC, which provide for the protection of rivers, lakes, coastal waters and ground-waters, including an obligation to achieve and maintain good water quality; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Significant steps have been taken to date in relation to the implementation of the Water Framework and Bathing Water Directives.  In the case of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) these include the publication in March 2003, of a joint North/South consultation paper &mdash; &ldquo;Managing Our Shared Waters&rdquo;.  This paper outlined the arrangements for coordination of implementation in respect of cross border River Basin Districts.  Eight River Basin District (RBDs) have been established on the island of Ireland. Of these four are entirely in Ireland, three are cross-border and one is entirely in Northern Ireland.  Project offices were established in each district to support implementation of the Directive.  These have been funded to the amount of &euro;63 million by my Department.</P>
        <P>In December 2004, a &ldquo;Characterisation Report&rdquo; was issued in relation to each RBD.  These reports identified and classified the water bodies, set out baseline data, identified waters at risk of not achieving good status, and provided an economic analysis of water use.  A comprehensive monitoring programme under the management of the EPA became operational in December 2006.  In June 2007, a report on Significant Water Management Issues for each RBD was published for public consultation.  The next major milestone in implementation of the WFD will be the publication by 22 December 2008 of Draft River Basin Management Plans.  These will be subject to public consultation for a period of 6 months, with a view to adoption by December 2009.</P>
        <P>With regard to implementation of the new EU Bathing Water Directive (2006/7/EC), I made regulations in March 2008 which transpose this Directive into national law.  The Bathing Water Quality Regulations 2008 establish more stringent water quality standards for protection of the <Col N="719"/>health of bathers.  The timetable for compliance with the Bathing Water Directive extends to 2015, and is in line with the WFD.  My Department is currently working with the EPA to develop guidance to assist local authorities in meeting their obligations under this Directive.</P>

        <Quest> the reason the means test for the housing adaption grant for people with a disability is based on the family income of the previous tax year in view of the fact that the application for such grants often accompanies a fundamental cut in the family income due to the illness of a family member; the plans he has to have these applications based on the current family income; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability, the Mobility Aids Scheme, and the Housing Aid for Older People schemes were introduced following my Department&rsquo;s review of the Disabled Persons, Essential Repairs and Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Grant Schemes.  One of the primary aims of the review was to ensure that the available resources are targeted to those in most need of assistance.</P>
        <P>Under the previous schemes, some local authorities applied a means test, while others did not.  The standardised means test introduced under the new schemes, including the income <Col N="720"/>thresholds and bands provided for, were designed to ensure that a fair and uniform approach applies across all local authority areas, and that those households in greatest need benefit from the available funding.</P>
        <P>As part of the means-testing provisions, local authorities have been instructed to apply various income disregards in the calculation of household means, including disregards for children and students, and in respect of a range of welfare payments such as Carer&rsquo;s Benefit/Allowance.  In addition, the income thresholds and bands will be adjusted annually in line with inflation.  The means-test is applied to the income of the applicant in the previous tax year in order to facilitate the assessment of applicants on the same basis, including those who are not assessed under the PAYE scheme.</P>
        <P>A review of the operation of the new schemes will be undertaken following their first year of full implementation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1454 to 1458, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The administration of the Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability, which were introduced in November 2007 in place of the Essential Repairs and Disabled Person&rsquo;s Grant Schemes, is a matter for individual local authorities.</P>
        <P>The revised schemes &mdash; the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability, the Mobility Aids Grant Scheme and the Housing Aid for Older People Scheme &mdash; are funded by 80% recoupment available from my Department together with 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority.  This compares with a 66% contribution from my Department <Col N="721"/>towards the operation of the previous Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grant schemes, and a 33% contribution from the resources of the local authority.  It is a matter for local authorities to decide on the specific level of funding to be directed towards each of the schemes, from within the combined allocation notified to them by my Department, and to manage the operation of the schemes in their areas from within this allocation.</P>
        <P>The details of the grants and funding made available to Kildare County Council towards the operation of these grant schemes are set out in the following table:</P>

        <Quest> the finance received by each local authority in respect of landfill levies for each <Col N="722"/>of the years from 2002 to 2007; the charge levied in each case; the amount estimated in respect of 2008; the plans he has to increase the levy in 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The finance received by each local authority in respect of the landfill levy for the year 2007 is listed in the table below.  This details the landfill levy amount collected by each local authority, the amount retained by the local authority for the purpose of defraying expenses incurred in the enforcement and collection of the levy within its functional area, and the amount paid into the Environment Fund by the local authority.  This information has not yet been audited by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The information for the years 2002 to 2006 is being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

        <P>Local authorities receive finance from the Environment Fund for a range of measures such as:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />capital grants towards the provision of waste recycling and waste recovery facilities;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />subventions towards the operational costs associated with recycling and recovery facilities;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />funding towards enforcement initiatives in the area of waste; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />funding towards anti-litter and anti-graffiti awareness projects.</P>
<P FLI="0">However, as funds from both the plastic bag and the landfill levy are paid into the Environment Fund, it is not possible to give a breakdown of the total finance received by local authorities from the landfill levy alone.</P>
        <P>The levies were collected at the rate of &euro;15 per tonne for waste disposed of at landfill facilities between 1 June 2002 and 30 June 2008, thereafter rising to &euro;20 per tonne of waste.  It is estimated that 2008 receipts from the landfill levy will be in the order of &euro;32 million.</P>
        <P>The Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s National Waste Report for 2006 identified the important role that economic instruments such as the landfill levy can play in achieving the challenging diversion targets which Ireland has to meet under the Landfill Directive and recommended that the landfill levy be increased in support of the National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste.  However, under existing legislation the maximum permissible increase in the levy in any financial year is &euro;5 per tonne.  This renders the landfill levy relatively ineffective in driving the extent of change in waste management now necessary to fulfil Ireland&rsquo;s landfill diversion targets.</P>
        <P>I am therefore proposing a progressive increase in the levy over a period of years.  I will be bringing forward legislation to allow a significant increase in the existing levy and provide sufficient flexibility for future increases without frequent amendment of primary legislation.  In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government not to alter the landfill levy in such a way as to give a competitive advantage to incineration, I am also proposing to broaden the scope of the levy to include incineration.  These changes will be introduced in a balanced way so as not to give rise to market disruption, allowing the sector sufficient lead-in time to develop the necessary alternative infrastructure/treatment capacities, and to avoid negative environmental impacts such as increased levels of illegal dumping.  A regulatory impact assessment (RIA) is under way in regard to these proposed changes and any increase in the levy in 2009 will take its conclusions into consideration.</P>

	<P>Protection of conservation sites of European importance is required under the EU Habitats Directive 1992, which was transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997, as well as the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000.  In accordance with the Directive, Ireland has nominated certain raised and blanket bogs, which are priority natural habitats under the Directive, as candidate Special Areas of Conservation (cSACs).</P>
        <P>In order to protect the designated bogs, the ending of all peat extraction was originally proposed under these regulations.  However, a derogation period of up to 10 years was allowed from 1999, in respect of domestic turf cutting from 32 raised bogs designated before 1999.  This includes Carrownagappul Bog SAC (site code: 001242).</P>
        <P>I am conscious of the recent increases in energy costs.  However, the reason for the derogation was to allow domestic cutters a reasonable time to find an alternative source of fuel.  Peat is a non-renewable resource as well as a valuable habitat which we are required to protect.  The derogation expires at the end of this year.  In the meantime, cutting for domestic purposes may continue &mdash; and the use of the &ldquo;Hopper&rdquo; is permitted &mdash; although the use of &ldquo;sausage cutting&rdquo; machines is not allowed.  Large-scale peat extraction works may require planning permission, with an associated environmental impact assessment, under the planning code.</P>
        <P>My Department operates a compensation scheme for persons who agree to stop turf cutting in designated raised bogs.  This covers both cSACs and Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs).</P>

While regulations in relation to advertising under the Official Languages Act have yet to be finalised, staff are encouraged to advertise, where practical, in both official languages, particularly where the issue concerned is of general public interest.</P>
        <P>Our records do not generally distinguish between the cost of advertising in Irish, English or bilingually.  The detailed information sought in the question is therefore not readily available in its entirety and its compilation would involve a disproportionate amount of time and work.

        <P>A combined allocation of &euro;1,242,150 was made to Mayo County Council earlier this year for purposes of the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability, Mobility Aids Grant Scheme, and Housing Aid for Older People Scheme.

Allocations for 2009 can only be finalised after the publication of the 2009 Estimates.</P>

	<P>My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and I are implementing new grazing initiatives in the North Connemara area from 1 November 2008.   These measures are necessary and are designed to address ongoing overgrazing in two specific Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), namely the Twelve Bens/Garraun Complex and Maumturk Mountains SACs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Following scientific assessment of the condition of these SACs, it was deemed necessary to introduce grazing regimes that go beyond the destocking requirements set out in the original Commonage Framework Plan.  These measures were discussed in detail with farming representatives over several months and an agreement was reached on a scheme to address the overgrazing problem.   These areas will be monitored with a view to preventing further overgrazing or undergrazing in the future.</P>

	<P>The clawback provision, attached to a house purchased under the various affordable housing schemes at a discount from market value, is activated where the house is resold before the expiration of 20 years from the date of purchase.  In such an event, the person selling the property must pay to the housing authority a percentage of the proceeds of the sale.  The clawback is necessary to ensure that there is no short-term profit taking on the resale of houses provided under the various affordable housing schemes at a discount from market value.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding that, I asked the Affordable Homes Partnership to consider how the range of existing affordable housing mechanisms might be enhanced.  A resultant report Increasing Affordable Housing Supply has now been published.  The report&rsquo;s recommendations are based on optimising the output from the existing mechanisms and include a proposal to introduce a new affordable housing product based on an equity loan arrangement to be used in conjunction with the existing schemes.  The report further recommended the removal of the time limit on the clawback and recycling the repayment of the subsidy provided as an investment in new affordable housing.</P>
        <P>A public consultation on the report has been completed and I am considering the outcome of this process in the context of the further development of policy on paths to home ownership, including through affordable housing.</P>

	<P>The Liffey Valley is one of hundreds of &lsquo;proposed NHAs&rsquo; that are under consideration for designation as Natural Heritage Areas throughout the country.  The area of the site is 165 hectares and it is located along the River Liffey, running from Leixlip in County Kildare to Chapelizod in Dublin.  It is currently protected by its inclusion in the Local Authority Development Plans covering the area &mdash; in this case, the Local Authorities of Dublin City,  Fingal, South Dublin, and Kildare.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s priority in recent years has been the designation of European sites as Special Areas of Conservation (SAC&rsquo;s) under the Habitats Directive and Special Protection Areas (SPA&rsquo;s) under the Birds Directive.  However, when that process is complete further consideration will be given to the formal designation of Natural Heritage Areas, including the proposed NHA at Liffey Valley.

	<P>There is no provision at present in the voluntary housing schemes for the purchase of individual houses by tenants.   However, the Government&rsquo;s housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, indicated that consideration would be given, in consultation with the voluntary and co-operative sector, to piloting a tenant purchase scheme for some new voluntary homes based on the incremental purchase model.</P>
        <P>The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which was published recently, includes provisions to give effect to the incremental purchase scheme.  In parallel with this, arrangements for the introduction of a pilot scheme for the voluntary housing sector are being considered in consultation with the Irish Council for Social Housing.  Decisions in relation to the selection of an approved housing body or specific location for the purpose of implementing the pilot project would be premature, at this stage.	</P>

	<P>My Department re-engaged consultants, White Young Green, to carry out an independent and rigorous assessment of site conditions following extensive unauthorised works by sub-contractors of Hammond Lane Metal Company Ltd.</P>
        <P>This assessment comprises three distinct modules, and the consultants have available the advice of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Marine Institute and the Health and Safety Authority in their development:</P>
        <P el="5">1. <Miles com="ix" />assessing quality of surface water, marine sediment and mussel bivalves in the vicinity;</P>

        <P FLI="0">White Young Green previously carried out an extensive intrusive site investigation in 2005 which indicated no evidence of any immediate threat to human health or the environment. Testing results will be assessed against baseline data from the previous survey. It is anticipated that the latest report from White Young Green will be completed by the end of September.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, at the request of the local residents and public representatives, I have arranged for the current ongoing site assessment works, and the 2005 White Young Green report, to be reviewed by independent experts in order to offer reassurance to the local communities that the scope of works, tests and analysis employed conform to best international practice in determining whether there exists any immediate health or environmental threat posed by the site.  Professor Phillip Morgan (Sirius Geotechnical &amp; Environmental Ltd) and Dr. Marcus Trett (Physalia Limited, Consultant &amp; Forensic Ecologists) have been appointed to carry out the peer review.</P>
        <P>Both the White Young Green and the Peer Review reports will be made publicly available once I have had an opportunity to examine them. Any recommendations arising out of these reports will inform my proposals to Government in respect of the future use of the site.</P>

If they do not follow the recommendations of the Inspector, the Board must be satisfied that the facts of the case support their decision. Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, the Board must also give the reasons for their decisions and must specify the various reasons for not accepting the Inspector&rsquo;s recommendations.</P><Col N="736"/>

        <P>This study, the scope of which also includes issues such as how best to promote alternative technologies such as mechanical biological treatment processes, will underpin the overall review as provided for in the Programme for Government.

        <P FLI="0" el="5">Member States which consigned more than 80% of collected municipal waste to landfill are allowed to postpone the attainment of these targets by a period not exceeding four years.

        <Quest> if fibreglass batts used to insulate attics meet the highest environmental standards and his views on concerns about degrading of the product, emission of formaldehyde and potential loss of its R-value in certain circumstances; and if other technologies are considered preferable by Sustainable Energy Ireland and Government architectural advisers. </Quest>

	<P>The residential Building Regulations focus on thermal performance requirements, rather than being prescriptive in relation to particular materials.  Fibrous materials have been commonly used for insulation of attic spaces over many years.</P>
        <P>The Building Regulations Part L were substantially revised in 2007 and Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) advise that the stringent thermal insulation standards now required of new homes are likely to see the industry increasingly using materials with the lowest thermal conductivities, for reasons of practicality in relation to construction dimensions.  These materials tend to be of rigid foam type structure, rather than fibrous.  The use of glass fibre insulation may be expected to diminish over time, but I am not aware of any proposals to exclude it from the list of choices available to the industry.</P>
        <P>Insulation materials are not generally designed for direct exposure to an inhabited space.  An attic space is generally designed as a ventilated and unoccupied space.  I am further advised by SEI that any trace levels of gaseous emissions arising from the installation of insulation materials in such an attic space would be expected to dissipate quickly and would be ventilated out in any case.  However, in the case of a converted or occupied attic space, insulation materials should normally be sealed behind a suitable barrier such as plasterboard.</P>

        <Quest> the progress there has been in transferring all transmission assets to EirGrid by the end of 2008; if this target will be met; if not, the reason therefore; the date the transfer will be complete; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would refer the Deputy to my statement of 13th March on the future of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity sector.  In that statement I affirmed the Government&rsquo;s decision in the Energy Policy White Paper and the Programme for Government, to transfer the ownership of the electricity transmission assets from ESB to EirGrid.  It is also a fundamental tenet of Government policy that we retain the electricity and gas networks as strategic national assets in State ownership.</P>
        <P>The unbundling of the transmission assets involves the resolution of complex technical, financial and operational issues as well as the introduction of legislation.  The process will take us beyond the original target date of the end of 2008, as all the parties concerned are aware.</P>
        <P>In the context, not least, of wide-ranging challenging priorities for ESB and EirGrid, I have proposed that we commission an independent analysis of the transmission transfer, including costs, benefits and regulatory impact assessment, set in the context also of EU developments and the all island single electricity market.</P>
        <P>Statements by myself and my predecessor, have consistently underlined the need for transparent and inclusive engagement with all relevant stakeholders in the process of implementing Government policy in relation to the electricity transmission assets.</P>
        <P>Input to the process of independent analysis will accordingly be invited from the direct key stakeholders.  These are the management and unions of ESB and EirGrid, the ESB Employee Share Ownership Trust, as well as the Commission for Energy Regulation and the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>I intend shortly to appoint the senior independent figure to chair this process including the commissioning of independent consultants to carry out the technical and economic analysis.</P>
        <P>All the direct stakeholders have pivotal roles to play in the process of engagement and analysis and in achieving outcomes that are good for EirGrid and ESB, which are satisfactory for all parties concerned, and which are in the best interests of the economy and consumers.  I look forward to getting this collective process under way following my appointment of the senior independent chair, and to completing it during 2009.</P>
        <P>Government policy is clear in relation to ensuring the strategic future of both EirGrid and ESB as strong viable Semi State bodies with vital roles to play in delivering our national targets for emissions reduction, renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as security of supply and energy competitiveness.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year, I welcomed ESB&rsquo;s announcement of its new Strategic Framework to 2020, which will see an unprecedented capital investment programme by the company at home and abroad in support of our goals for renewable energy, energy efficiency, emissions reduction and energy security.</P>
        <P>I look forward equally to EirGrid&rsquo;s forthcoming Grid Development Strategy 2025 which will be published shortly.  This will set out an ambitious national strategy for critical investment in the transmission system over the next two decades in support of economic, social and regional development and the integration of renewable energy generation.</P>

	<P>I am advised by Sustainable Energy Ireland that an application was submitted by the applicants in question to the Greener Homes Scheme in January 2008 (received January 29th).  The system was fully installed at this point and is therefore ineligible for support.  A letter was issued outlining this position on February 7th having been considered by the Appeals Committee.</P>

        <P>This letter was not received by the applicants and a further application was received on May 8th 2008.  The position was fully outlined at this time by telephone and a copy of the previous letter reissued.</P>
        <P>Given that one of the key eligibility criteria of the scheme, which must be applied equitably in all cases, is that grant approval is received ahead of any purchase or work the application is ineligible and payment cannot be effected.</P>

	<P>The National Postcode Project Board made a recommendation last year to Government to introduce an alpha-numeric postal sector postcode model.  This model was deemed the most suitable as it does not require individuals to change their address structure, with elements such as county names being accommodated within the postcode itself.  In the case of Gaeltacht areas, there is nothing in the recommendation that would prevent this postcode being based on the official version of the place name in Irish.</P>
        <P>Government decided last year that prior to the introduction of postcodes, further analysis to quantify the wider economic implications should be carried out.  A report was recently furnished to my Department in this regard, which I am currently examining.  A full assessment of the report will help me decide on how best to take the proposal forward.  In this regard I fully accept that a postcode system can convey economic and social benefits, assist future competition in the postal sector and assist delivery of certain public services.</P>

	<P>The matter of VAT rates is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance.  The VAT treatment of goods and services is governed by EU law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  While we can retain the zero rating provisions which were in existence on 1 January 1991, we cannot introduce any new ones.  Therefore, it is not possible to apply a zero rate to the supply of wind turbine equipment.</P>
        <P>The supply of certain environmental products, such as wind turbine equipment, wood pellet boilers and solar panels, are chargeable at the standard VAT rate of 21%.  However, the reduced VAT rate of 13.5% may be applied to such products where they are provided under a single supply and install contract where the VAT exclusive cost of the goods does not exceed two-thirds of the total VAT exclusive charge to the customer.</P>
        <P>Grant support measures are available in the heat market for micro scale products through the Greener Homes scheme for domestic level and ReHeat and CHP programmes for the small business and non commercial sectors.  These schemes are run by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI).</P>
        <P>In April this year, I announced a micro scale programme that is being developed by SEI for the electricity market.  This programme, which will resolve outstanding technical issues in this area around qualifying technologies and defining arrangements for qualification, certification and training of installers in connecting these technologies to the electricity network.  These measures need to be addressed to ensure system stability including the safety of network staff and consumers using the micro scale technologies.  The field trial element of this programme will be launched by SEI within the next few weeks.  I have also asked my Department to engage with the Commission for Energy Regulation and all relevant parties in relation to determining appropriate options for the purchase of surplus energy.</P>

These include an Integrated Fisheries Information System, a Foreshore Coastal Zone Management System, a Marine Vessel Registration System, a Mineral Exploration Licensing System, and a Petroleum Exploration System.  Although the functions supported by most of these applications have been transferred to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and to the Minister for Transport, my Department continues to manage and maintain them at this time.</P><Col N="744"/>
        <P>My Department employs layered network defences including intrusion detection systems, multiple firewalls, web content filtering, anti-virus, anti-spyware and anti-spam devices to block dangerous traffic and protect the network.  The portfolio of measures that operates to protect the network of the Department would be considered best practice in the State or private sectors.</P>
        <P>My Department carries out a full independent security audit of all computer systems each year and one is due shortly.  Any recommendations that are made to further secure the computers and data held by my Department will be implemented.</P>

	<P>The development of domestic renewable energy is a key priority and is being supported by a range of actions and programmes ranging from Research and Development, investment incentives and mandatory requirements.</P>
        <P>The recently announced Smart Meters pilot programme will also facilitate the introduction of microgeneration devices. I have launched a microgeneration pilot scheme being undertaken by Sustainable Energy Ireland, which will conduct research and field trials, including support for between 50 and 60 installations on a pilot basis.</P><Col N="745"/>
        <P>The field trials are addressing technical and institutional issues relating to such matters as: grid connection, technical standards to ensure power security, safety and quality, export tariffs and other key issues. I have also asked my Department to engage with the Commission for Energy Regulation and other relevant parties in relation to appropriate options for the purchase of surplus energy from micro generation installations.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s Greener Homes Scheme, administered by SEI, provides support to individuals wishing to install renewable energy heating technologies in their homes.  This scheme, now in operation since early 2006, has already helped establish a very strong supply industry for renewable energy products, services and fuels while the application of strict product standards and installer training and quality schemes has ensured that consumers are informed in relation to their choices.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A call for expression of interest is currently open for the Low Carbon Housing Programme launched during the summer and administered by SEI.  This programme is targeted at housing developments of between 5 and 15 homes.  In addition to having a minimum requirement of a Building Energy Rating of A2 or higher the targets also include provision for onsite generation.</P>
        <P>The Revised Building Regulations brought into force in July of this year now include a compulsory renewable energy component for all new houses.  This will not only ensure that renewables are integrated into the housing stock but will also encourage individuals to consider a range of renewable options when purchasing a new home.  This is further underpinned by the introduction of the Building Energy Rating which provides information to house purchasers on energy performance and to which renewables will contribute.</P>

	<P>Based on estimated recoverable reserves between 800-900 billion cubic feet, applying the recent market price for gas and allowing for an increase in line with CPI it is estimated that the total value of the Corrib Gas Field will be in the order of &euro;9.5 billion.</P>
        <P>The value of the Corrib Gas Field will depend on a combination of factors including, the volume of gas in place, the cost of developing the infrastructure to produce that gas together with the ongoing cost of operating that infrastructure and the price of gas over the life of the field. It will be appreciated that each of these parameters is subject to significant variation and that the timing and profile of production would also have an impact.  This calculation is also based on an historically high gas price.</P>
        <P>In relation to the tax revenue to be generated from the Corrib Gas Field, profits from the field will be subject to Corporation Tax at a rate of 25%.  Based on an assumption that the combined development and production costs will be close to &euro;3 billion then the tax revenue from the Corrib field would be in the order of &euro;1.7 billion.</P>
        <P>The Corrib Gas Field will strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s security of energy supply and at peak production will provide over 50% of Ireland&rsquo;s gas needs. By providing an additional gas supply source for the market in Ireland, the Corrib Gas Field could also help bring down gas prices for consumers in Ireland.</P>
        <P>During its development phase the Corrib Project has contributed significantly to creating employment, both in the Erris region and nationally, with up to 700 people working on the construction of the terminal at Bellanaboy.</P>

	<P>Certain spat falls overlap with or occur in close proximity to Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Protected Areas (SPAs). It is the environmental issues associated with the Natura 2000 sites that have caused the delayed opening of the mussel seed fishery in Cromane. </P>
        <P>In order to comply with the requirements of the Habitats and Birds Directive baseline data for the area must first be collected and then an appropriate assessment carried out on the area based on this data.  This process will obviously take some time but, as one of the areas prioritised for this exercise, work has already begun in collecting this data for Cromane.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, to facilitate the opening of the affected areas, the Department with BIM and the Marine Institute are working with NPWS of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on arrangements to manage fishing including mussel seed harvesting within Natura 2000 sites on an interim basis.  Any re-opening of the Mussel seed fisheries in 2008 will be dependent on the EU Commission agreeing to the management/interim approach proposed.  I am very aware that the timing of the mussel seed fishery in Cromane requires that it be opened in early October to allow fishermen access to the seed this year.  I have asked my officials to use every effort to secure the support of NPWS and DG Environment for an early opening on the basis of assessment work carried out by Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Marine Institute.</P>

	<P>An application under the 2008 Single Payment Scheme was received from the person named on 13 May 2008. While payments under that scheme are scheduled to commence on 1 December 2008, in light of the severe weather conditions which prevailed here over the summer months, I recently sought the approval of the EU Commissioner to my proposal that advance payments of the 2008 Scheme be allowed as and from 16 October 2008, with balancing payments to begin issuing on 1 December 2008. I raised the matter again with the EU Agriculture Committee this week. While I am optimistic that the necessary approval will be forthcoming, a formal decision has to await approval of the Direct Payments Management Committee in Brussels. In the meantime, I have had the necessary arrangements made to allow the advance payments begin issuing on 16 October subject to receiving a positive Commission response. This date is the earliest date the payments may be made, as it is the beginning of the new EU financial year.</P>
        <P>The holding of the person concerned was restricted following the disclosure of TB in his herd on 22 May 2008. My Department implements a number of compensation schemes to compensate farmers for animals removed for disease reasons.

        <P>The person concerned has been paid &euro;1,527.97 under the On-Farm Market Valuation Scheme in respect of one reactor animal valued and removed in May 2008. A further 23 animals were valued under the scheme and removed as reactors on 3 September. The documentation, which is required to be submitted in order for valuation payments to be processed for those animals, has not yet been received from the person concerned. Since the animals removed exceeded 10% of the herd, the person concerned is now eligible for consideration for payment under the Income Supplement Scheme, which provides for payments for loss of income for animals removed. The conditions governing this scheme provide for payments to be made on a monthly basis, following receipt of appropriate documentation. The person concerned may also be eligible for the Hardship Grant Scheme, if the herd continues to be restricted on or after 1 November 2008. The eligibility period for this scheme, which is aimed at assisting eligible owners/keepers with a restricted holding where animals are retained and fed over the Winter months, is from 1 November 2008 to 30 April 2009. Application forms in respect of this scheme will issue to those herd-owners who are potentially eligible in mid October.</P>

	<P>The decision to introduce the 20% requirement to this year&rsquo;s Temporary Leasing Scheme was informed, as always, by my stated objective of ensuring that as much milk quota as possible is made available on a permanent basis to active, committed milk producers.  Unfortunately, in recent years many quota holders have repeatedly supplied nominal or token amounts of milk to their Co-ops and temporarily leased the balance of their quotas. While this may have kept their own options open, the practice has effectively slowed down the permanent transfer of quota to active producers who needed to acquire it.  Producers must, therefore, now demonstrate their bona fides by supplying at least 20% of their quotas before they can avail of temporary leasing. However, provision continues to be made for producers affected by force majeure or other duly justified circumstances to seek an exemption from the 20% requirement. </P>
        <P>It should be noted also that this change to the regulations was made following full consultation with the Milk Quota Review Group, which is comprised of the farming organisations and ICOS, and advises me on all matters relating to the milk quota regime.</P>

The herdnumber was transferred into the sole name of the person named from the sole name of his father on 11 May 2007.  In October 2006, the father of the person named executed a Deed of Transfer in which he transferred land &lsquo;together with all stock, entitlements, single payment&rsquo;, etc into the joint names of the person named and his father.  A copy of this Deed was included with the above Transfer of Entitlements application form.  At the time of the father&rsquo;s death therefore, the person named was automatically entitled to half of the entitlements in question, namely 9.86 standard entitlements. The remaining 9.86 entitlements form part of the father&rsquo;s estate and are governed by normal testamentary procedures. </P>
        <P>On 23 July 2008, a letter issued from the Transfer of Entitlements section to the person named requesting a copy of the Will and Probate of his late father,or in their absence, other relevant documentation.  A further copy of the Deed of Transfer was received from the person named on 10 August 2008 along with a completed Indemnity Form.  A copy of the Will of his late father was again requested on 25 August 2008.  To date, the person named has not forwarded a copy of the Will or other testamentary documentation to my Department.</P>
        <P>If instructed to do so, my Department can proceed with the transfer of 9.86 entitlements to the person named.  The remaining 9.86 entitlements can only be transferred upon receipt of the requested documentation i.e. copy of late father&rsquo;s will.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1555, 1556 and 1582 together.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland&rsquo;s share of the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) is fixed on the principle of relative stability, although minor variations may occur from year to year.  The following table sets out the Irish quota for 2008 and the corresponding EU TAC in all the fisheries where Ireland has a quota and historical involvement.  The TACs are set for stocks for  International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) areas, sub-areas and divisions which are defined in Regulation (EEC) No. 3880/91 of 17 December 1991 and do not have regard for Member States national fisheries zones.  Therefore, a calculation of the catches taken from Irish waters by non Irish fleets can only be estimated as there are no EU catch statistics that determine catches in a given area on the basis of national Exclusive Fisheries Zones.  The Cawley Strategy &mdash; Steering A New Course estimated that in 2004 the total catch by all fleets within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone was 700,000 of fish valued at &euro;500,000.  There are of course EU quotas in seas and indeed oceans throughout the world (such as in the Baltic) where the Irish fleet has had no historic involvement and has no quotas.</P>

Agriculture and forestry have the potential to produce a wide range of feedstocks for use in the bioenergy market including purpose grown energy crops, wood energy and utilising farm and food wastes for energy.</P>
        <P>Many farmers have diversified into energy crop cultivation following the introduction of new incentives by my Department in 2007 to stimulate production.  The measures include a National Energy Crop Premium of &euro;80 per hectare and a Bioenergy Scheme providing establishment <Col N="759"/>grants of &euro;1,450 per hectare to grow willow and miscanthus.  An additional premium of &euro;45 per hectare is also available under the EU Energy Crops Scheme.</P>
        <P>There is also potential to supply energy through the use of grass or farm wastes as feedstock. In 2007, my Department awarded grants of &euro;4m to ten anaerobic digestion projects under the &lsquo;Scheme of Investment Aid for Demonstration On Farm Waste Processing Facilities&rsquo;.  The table below details the number of farmers who were awarded grants for anaerobic digestion facilities in 2007 and who have applied for energy crops grants in 2008:</P>

	<P>The Government decision on the decentralisation of my Department is that some 600 headquarters staff will move to Portlaoise, the local offices in Cork city will move to Fermoy, involving some 100 staff; and the laboratories in Cork and Limerick will move to Macroom, involving up to 100 staff.  The move of the Fisheries function of my Department to Clonakilty, involving over 80 staff, is now substantially complete.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s original Decentralisation Implementation Plan allowed for a phased movement to Portlaoise.  The 2005, 2006 and 2007 advance phases of decentralisation to Portlaoise were completed on schedule.  There has been an increase of some 300 full-time posts to bring the total posts in Portlaoise to almost 500 since the programme began.  To date, the Department has met its targets as set out in its original plan.  The initial estimate for completion of the plan was 2008, to coincide with the availability of the permanent accommodation.  The Office of Public Works (OPW) announced last December that a consortium, the Macquarie Partnership, has won the tender for the project to build the permanent offices in Portlaoise (as part of a public private partnership including offices in Mullingar and Carlow) and planning permission for the new building has now been granted.  A revision to the Department&rsquo;s Decentralisation Implementation Plan is now being considered, to reflect the changes to the timetable and the progress so far, as well as the evolving operating environment.  An additional advance phase has been agreed and planning and preparations for this phase are currently underway.</P>
        <P>Separate implementation plans for Fermoy and Macroom are in place.  The plans allow for a phasing of the recruitment of staff but no physical move until the permanent accommodation is in place.  The acquisition of property is primarily a matter for OPW and they have supplied the following details of the site acquisition at the four locations.</P>

        <P>I can tell the Deputy that I have already expressed major concerns with regard to the introduction of EID for a sheep sector that is clearly under pressure.  In this regard, I wrote to Commissioner Vassiliou last May stating that proceeding with compulsory EID cannot be justified until it can be demonstrated clearly that the costs involved for the majority of producers are clearly outweighed by the benefits to be derived in terms of more efficient flock management, traceability and disease control.  I also requested that the Commission undertake an impact assessment and review the introduction of the compulsory electronic identification system for sheep in the light of that. Furthermore, when I met the Commissioner in Dublin in July 2008 I again reiterated our difficulty with the proposal.  I must inform the Deputy, however, that the Commission for its part continues to be firmly attached to the mandatory introduction of EID, as are the majority of Member States.</P>

        <P>The ultimate beneficiaries of these schemes were pig farmers throughout the EU as evidenced by the above figures.  The schemes had the effect of stemming the severe losses arising from exceptionally high feed costs and restoring profitability to the industry.  Feed prices have now eased somewhat.

        <P Just="Left">However, under the recently amended TSE regulation, there is provision for a possible revision of Member States' monitoring programmes (including changes to the age at which healthy slaughtered animals for human consumption must be tested for BSE) following evaluation of applications by Member States in response to their improved BSE situation.</P>
        <P>I have warmly welcomed the very recent agreement of the EU Commissioner for Public Health to a proposed increase in the minimum age for BSE testing of both animals slaughtered for human consumption as well as emergency slaughtered and fallen animals to 48 months.  This decision will deliver very significant savings to farmers who currently pay to have healthy slaughtered animals over 30 months tested for BSE.</P>
        <P>This has been a particular priority of mine since my appointment and I have consistently pressed for a significant increase in the age limit.  I am very pleased at this recent development and I am confident that Ireland&rsquo;s application to apply testing at the higher age will be approved and that the new testing regime will be in place from early 2009.</P>

	<P>The position is that my Department, in the context of delivering the Single Payment Scheme and the Disadvantaged  Areas Compensatory Allowance Scheme, is required to carry out on-the-spot inspections on a number of farms covering such issues as eligibility under the Schemes, and compliance with the cross-compliance regime. </P>
        <P>Each year a minimum of 5% of Scheme applicants must be inspected for eligibility. These checks are carried out to verify that the actual area claimed in the application form corresponds to the area held by the farmer and to ensure there are no overlapping, or duplicate claims.  Up to two-thirds of these inspections are carried out without a farm visit and using the technique of remote sensing via satellite.</P>
        <P>The rate of on-farm inspection required for cross-compliance is 1% of those farmers to whom the Statutory Management Requirements or Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition apply. However at least 5% of farmers must be inspected under the Bovine Animal Identification and Registration requirements as this level is prescribed under the relevant Regulations while 3% of sheep farmers must be inspected</P><Col N="767"/>
        <P>For the 2007 Schemes there were a total of 7098 farm inspections. 4087 of these involved establishing eligibility for the schemes by remote sensing while 2677 farms were visited on the ground to establish eligibility. 4456 inspections concerned the Identification and Registration of Animals with a further 1406 farm inspections covering the full range of Cross Compliance Statutory Management Requirements.  The on-the-spot inspections for eligibility and cross-compliance are integrated to the greatest extent possible with a view to ensuring that there is only one visit to the farm.</P>

	<P>Mayo County Council applied for a licence under the Foreshore Acts to construct a temporary bridge at Achill Sound in March 2006.  A licence to facilitate the construction of the temporary bridge was granted to the Council in October 2006.  The licence included specific conditions relating to the methodology to be employed in the construction of the bridge.  My Department has received complaints in relation to the construction of the bridge and these complaints have been referred to our Engineering Division for investigation.  The complaints have also been referred to the County Council.  </P>
        <P>A foreshore lease to facilitate construction of the permanent bridge is also being processed by my Department.   This lease will also contain specific conditions regarding construction methodology and environmental protection</P>

My Department would regard with utmost seriousness any breaches of the conditions of the foreshore licence issued.  My Department&rsquo;s engineers are continuing to remain actively engaged with this matter.</P>

	<P>Agreement was reached between the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the farm bodies on additional measures to reduce the grazing pressure on the Twelve Bens/Garraun Complex and Maumturk Mountains Special Areas of Conservation (SACs).  The objective of this agreement, for which NPWS are making additional payments to farmers, is to establish a sustainable grazing regime to allow for regeneration of overgrazed areas which, in turn,  will satisfy the European Commission that a judgement of the European Court of Justice against Ireland is being fully respected.  The success of this new agreement is essential to safeguard sheep production in the area into the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>In the new Forestry Bill, which will replace the 1946 Forestry Act, it is proposed to take a more flexible approach regarding the question of replanting after harvesting. However, the general principle of replanting after felling will remain in order to ensure that the national forest estate is maintained.</P>
        <P>Under the Forestry Act 1946, it is illegal to fell a tree of any age or uproot trees under 10 years of age without a felling licence. Felling of large scale afforestation is covered under a General Felling Licence which, under the Act, carries a compulsory requirement to replant the cleared area. Felling of small scale forestry or individual trees is covered by a Limited Felling Licence under which a replanting condition may, at the discretion of the Minister, be attached to the licence. The replanting condition contained in a Limited Felling Licence can apply to any suitable land owned by the licensee on the date the licence is granted; it does not have to apply specifically to the land where the trees are felled.</P>
        <P>The current policy is to apply a replanting condition in all but the most exceptional cases in order to ensure that the national forest estate is maintained, and that the many economic and environmental benefits that our forests provide are sustained for future generations.</P>

	<P>In order to import fish or fishery products into Ireland from a non EU country the importer is required to register with the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA). Fish or fishery products coming from a non EU country must go through an approved Border Inspection Post (BIP). There are three approved BIPs in Ireland, namely Dublin Port, Dublin Airport and Shannon Airport.</P>
        <P>The relevant BIP must be notified 24 hours in advance of the arrival of the fishery products. Pre-notification must be in the form of a completed Part I of a document known as the Common Veterinary Entry Document (CVED), which gives necessary information on the product being imported. This form is available from my Department. A signed original health certificate issued by the Competent Authority of the third country must also accompany the consignment.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the SFPA that the fish or fishery products must come from an EU-authorised exporting country and an EU approved fishery product establishment within that country. Both the United States and Canada are approved to export fish/fishery products to the EU.</P>
        <P>In the specific case of lobsters a licence is not required for commercial imports of lobsters into Ireland from the United States and Canada. The importer would, as outlined above, require to be registered with the SFPA.  A health certificate would need to accompany the lobsters and a completed (part I) of CVED forwarded to relevant BIP 24 hours in advance of arrival of consignment. On arrival at the BIP the consignment would be subject to identity, documentary and physical checks.</P>

	<P>There is a large number of AHCS forms and it is not clear which forms the Deputy has in mind. In any event, <Col N="772"/>such forms can be rejected for a variety of reasons unrelated to fraud and my Department does not maintain records of the number of forms rejected in the 28 District Veterinary Offices throughout the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no evidence of widescale corruption by farmers in relation to TB testing. My Department has a firm policy of prosecuting any illegal activity and payment of compensation in respect of a disease outbreak is withheld from, or paid at a reduced rate to, farmers who are in breach of relevant legislation or who attempt to defraud the Department.</P>
        <P>My Department has always been aware of the risk of fraud in the context of the TB test and has strong and effective quality control measures in place to minimise this risk, These include Veterinary Inspectors from the local DVO carrying out yearly unannounced field inspections of tests being carried out by each private veterinary practitioner, post test evaluation of reactor animals on farms and follow-up supplementary testing and evaluation of herds selected on a risk basis.  Breaches of the tuberculin testing procedures, where identified, trigger a range of remedial actions and/or sanctions, up to and including the initiation of proceedings in respect of fraudulent behaviour or professional misconduct.</P>

	<P>The position is that an application under the Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Area Compensatory Allowance Scheme was received from the person named on the 1st May 2008.

        <P>The inspection was carried out on the 3rd September and the details of the inspection are currently being examined by my Department officials. Once the inspection details have been entered on the system the application will be cleared for payment.</P>
        <P>Under the provisions of Council Regulation 1782/2003 governing the implementation of the Single Payment Scheme, it is laid down that payments shall be made once a year between 1st December and 30th June of the following year. In exceptional circumstances, where farmers face severe financial difficulties, the Commission may, taking account of the budgetary situation, authorize advance payments of up to 50% prior to 1 December. Due to circumstances experienced by Irish farmers this year I have asked  the Commission  to  approve an advance payment of 50% in Ireland to be paid after 15 October and I am optimistic of a favourable response.  In the meantime payments of some &euro;250m to over 100,000 farmers under the Disadvantaged Areas&rsquo; Compensatory Allowance Scheme are commencing this week.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1600 and 1601 together.  </P>
        <P>Under the terms and conditions of the Non-Food Set-aside Scheme, farmers are entitled to grow energy crops on lands otherwise required to be set-aside. However, given that the requirement for set-aside land was reduced to 0% under the 2008 Single Payment Scheme, those farmers concerned are now participating under the 2008 Energy Crops Scheme.</P>
        <P>Willow has considerable potential to produce renewable energy and can also contribute to climate change abatement. Production of willow is relatively undeveloped in Ireland mainly due to high initial establishment costs. My Department launched a new Bio-energy Scheme in 2007 to grant aid growers interested in growing willow and miscanthus. The Scheme provides establishment grants to farmers for up to 50% of the costs of establishment, subject to a maximum establishment grant of &euro;1,450 per hectare. The aid is payable on set aside land and on areas declared under the EU Energy Crops Scheme.</P>
        <P>Willow is also eligible for the National Energy Crop Premium of &euro;80 per hectare and the EU premium of &euro;45 per hectare. In addition, farmers can receive adjusted payments under REPS and the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme for growing willow subject to some restrictions on the areas planted.</P><Col N="775"/>
        <P>A total of 488 farmers are participating under the 2008 Energy Crops Scheme; the following is a county breakdown:</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The main challenge facing the indigenous Irish poultry industry is competition from imports of fresh poultry from other EU countries. Under single market rules unrestricted volumes can be traded between Member States and, for various reasons, they are very competitively priced.  The primary outlet for Irish-produced poultry is the fresh retail trade where Irish product is still dominant.  The Bord Bia Poultry Quality Assurance Scheme is a recognised quality mark in that market and the Bord has been very active in growing  and enhancing the Scheme over the years. In addition to the Quality Assurance Scheme, assistance is available from Enterprise Ireland for certain types of activities undertaken by poultry processors. </P>
        <P>In 2004 the poultrymeat labelling regulations were extended to cover meat sold loose in retail outlets. These were the maximum measures allowable under harmonised EU labelling legislation. Last year my Department decided to extend these by drafting new national regulations that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultry and sheepmeat and on processed foods containing at least 70% of these meats. In December 2007 these were notified to the European Commission as required by legislation. The Commission adopted a negative opinion in March on the grounds that the proposed legislation was not in compliance with EU food labelling regulations.  It did, however, afford us the opportunity to provide further information in support of our case and to this end there has been an exchange of correspondence and a meeting between Department and Commission officials to advance the subject. The Commission&rsquo;s definitive position on our proposed regulations is expected by the end of this month.</P>

        <P>The total number of entitlements available for transfer was 6.17 valued at &euro;195.28 each.  An official from my Department wrote to the first person named and the Representatives of the deceased in 2006, 2007 and again in 2008 outlining the number of entitlements available for transfer and requesting written confirmation in respect of the number of entitlements to be transferred.</P>
        <P>The requested confirmation was received on the 15th May 2008 and the application was fully processed.  EU Regulations governing the transfer of Single Payment entitlements provide that the Member State may apply a claw-back in respect of entitlements sold with or without land in order to replenish the National Reserve.</P>
        <P>This transfer application was subject to a claw-back rate of 5%, which resulted in the transfer of entitlements being reduced by 0.31 entitlements.  The number of entitlements subsequently transferred to the first person named was 5.86 valued at  &euro;195.28 each giving a total value of &euro;1,144.34.

	<P>The Government decided on 2 October 2007 that responsibility for foreshore licensing functions under the Foreshore Act 1933 in respect of port companies and harbour authorities governed by the Harbours Acts 1946, 1996 and 2000 and any other harbour or harbour related developments intended for commercial trade, and for all energy developments (including oil, gas, wave, wind and tidal energy) and aggregate and mineral extraction developments on the foreshore would transfer to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  In addition the Government also decided that the Department would assume responsibility for coastal protection and coastal flooding and all other aspects of coastal zone management.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently putting in place the necessary arrangements to ensure the efficient and effective transfer of the appropriate legislation and associated functions.  In the interim, all foreshore functions under the Foreshore Acts 1933 to 2005 rest with my Department.</P>
        <P>My Department will carry forward responsibility for all other foreshore licensing functions under the Foreshore Act 1933, including in respect of all aquaculture developments and piers and harbours, other than in respect of port companies and harbour authorities governed by the Harbours Acts 1946, 1996 and 2000 and any other harbour or harbour related developments intended for commercial trade.</P>
        <P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and my Department will continue to work closely together to provide a modern, effective and integrated legal <Col N="780"/>framework for the management of the State&rsquo;s foreshore estate in the future including having regard to the principles of integrated coastal zone management.</P>

	<P>The need for a level playing field across the EU on fisheries control has been recognised as a national priority both by industry and by Government.  We have consistently pushed at EU level for a level playing field on controls.  Following the Review of the CFP in 2002, a new EU Control Agency to promote co-ordination and co-operation on control at EU level was established which is working to promote a level playing field at operational level.  Following pressure from Ireland, new rules for the electronic reporting of fish catches were agreed which include a requirement that the Coastal Member State has real time access to such records.  One of the key benefits of electronic reporting of catches, which will apply to all large vessels from 1 January 2010, is that it will allow the Control Authorities of a Coastal State to have access to the logbook information of any fishing vessel operating in its waters.  This allows the Control Authorities to make informed decisions on the activities of vessels and on how best to deploy and focus their resources.</P>
        <P>Irish Ministers have consistently argued that our objective must be to raise control levels across the EU if we are to protect the future of stocks in the Irish zone and fishing communities in Ireland who are wholly dependent on those stocks.  A Court of Auditors report earlier this year identified substantial control failures across Member States.  As Ireland is completely dependent on fish stocks around our coast, we must be at the forefront in having measures in place that are effective and not rewarding illegal fishing if we are to protect these stocks and give a long term future to our fishing communities.  On foot of the Court of Auditor findings, the Commission has prioritised control and has stated that it intends to review the regulatory regime and to bring forward specific proposals for a new regulatory regime this autumn.  It is <Col N="781"/>clearly in the interests of the Irish fishing industry and fishing communities that there is strong and effective implementation of the quotas and other conservation measures on all fishing vessels fishing on stocks in our zone.  I am committed to this in the interest of our fishermen.</P>

        <P>The 2008 Finance Act contains a number of measures specifically designed to reduce the tax burden on fishermen taking up the decommissioning scheme, which was announced in February, including qualifying for capital gains tax exemption (retirement relief) for proceeds up to &euro;750,000 with marginal relief applying above this limit.  There is also a reduction in the qualifying age requirement for an individual making such a disposal from 55 years of age to 45 years of age, and the required period of ownership and usage of the asset is reduced from 10 years to 6.  Also, if balancing charges arise (in relation to income tax) these can now be spread over 5 years commencing in the year in which the payment is received.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The position in regard to Ireland&rsquo;s quota allocations is that Ireland&rsquo;s share of the main fish stocks were set in the early 1980&rsquo;s when fish stocks were being shared out between Member States.  The share allocations were based on catch records and reflected the fishing levels by the Irish fleet at that time.  Ireland did not have any record of fishing activity in ICES divisions IV, VIII and IX.  The percentage shares held by each Member State have generally remained the same for over 20 years under the principle of relative stability.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since then it has been a priority of successive Irish Ministers to try to have these shares improved.  Ireland has repeatedly put forward the case for an increase in quota share but have received no support from other Member States for changes in the allocation keys for the share out of stocks.  The practical reality is that to achieve an increase in Ireland&rsquo;s share of catches, other Member States would have to take a cut in their shares.</P>
        <P>I will continue to use every opportunity to improve the arrangements for Irish fishermen under the Common Fisheries Policy.</P>

	<P>The primary outlet for Irish-produced poultry is the fresh retail trade where Irish product is still dominant.  A very important instrument in that market is the Bord Bia Poultry Quality Assurance Scheme (PQAS).  The Quality Assurance mark is recognised by consumers as a guarantee of traceability and reliability and is sought after by Irish retailers.  Bord Bia has been very active in growing and enhancing the Scheme over the years.  Both the processor and producer standards of the PQAS have been accredited under EN45011 by the Irish National Accreditation board.

        <P>I believe better labelling of poultry meat to indicate its origin would assist the marketing of Irish produced poultry.  To this end my Department drafted new national regulations that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultry and sheep meat and on processed foods containing at least 70% of these meats.  In December 2007 these were notified to the European Commission as required by legislation.  The Commission adopted a negative opinion in March on the grounds that the proposed legislation was not in compliance with EU food labelling regulations.  It did, however, afford us the opportunity to provide further information in support of our case and to this end there has been an exchange of correspondence and a meeting between Department and Commission officials to advance the subject.  The Commission&rsquo;s definitive position on our proposed regulations is expected by the end of this month.</P>
        <P>An area of importance for the future of the poultry sector is compliance with legislation on the protection of the environment which will have cost implications and give rise to operational complexities.  The Intensive Livestock Group was established in my Department to assist poultry and pig producers in finding viable solutions to manure disposal problems.  Producers, processors and Teagasc are represented on the Group, whose work is continuing.</P>
        <P>There is good demand for poultry produced under free range systems and my officials are active in supporting producers who wish to engage in this activity.</P>
        <P>Assistance is available from Enterprise Ireland for certain types of activities undertaken by poultry processors.  The rules of the EU single market, however, prohibit the provision of operating aid for the producer sector.</P>

        <Quest> when he will end or at least increase the 30 month age limit for BSE testing; his views on whether this age limit is very disruptive to the market place and leads to unnecessary losses to farmers as well as the cost of the testing; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The existing requirement that all cattle over 30 months of age slaughtered for human consumption must be tested for BSE is provided for under Regulation (EC) No. 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council, laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (The TSE Regulation).  Accordingly I do not have the discretion to raise this age threshold.</P>
        <P>However, under the recently amended TSE regulation, there is provision for a possible revision of Member States&rsquo; monitoring programmes (including changes to the age at which healthy slaughtered animals for human consumption must be tested for BSE) following evaluation of applications by Member States in response to their improved BSE situation.</P>
        <P>Having a significant increase in the age threshold for BSE testing has been a priority of mine since my appointment and I am, therefore, particularly pleased that the EU Commissioner for Public Health has now accepted the argument and agreed to a proposed increase in the minimum age for BSE testing of both animals slaughtered for human consumption as well as emergency slaughtered and fallen animals to 48 months.  This decision will deliver very significant savings to farmers who currently pay to have healthy slaughtered animals over 30 months tested for BSE.</P><Col N="786"/>
        <P>I am confident that Ireland&rsquo;s application to apply testing at this higher age will be approved and that the new testing regime will be in place from early 2009.</P>

	<P>The Single Payment Scheme, which was introduced in 2005, replaced the various coupled schemes, each of which had different application periods and eligibility requirements.  The main benefit for farmers of the introduction of the Single Payment Scheme was, therefore, that it allowed farmers greater freedom-to-farm, with individual farmers free to choose which farming enterprise best suited their own circumstances.  The introduction of the Single Payment Scheme also radically changed the application process for farmers, in that under the new scheme farmers only have to submit one application form, in lieu of the variety of forms previously required when there were a number of different schemes in operation.</P>
        <P>During 2007, the EU Commission engaged consultants to conduct a review in five Member States, one of which was Ireland, to measure the administrative burden of the CAP &mdash; specifically the Single Payment Scheme &mdash; on farmers.  The consultants conducted a series of workshops with farmers from a variety of farming backgrounds.  The study itself found that Irish farmers have the lowest per hectare administrative cost for participation in the Scheme of the five Member States involved.  The consultants found farmers&rsquo; attitudes towards the Single Payment Scheme itself to be quite positive and similarly so in relation to the administration of the scheme by my Department.  Farmers did, however, have many worthwhile suggestions regarding improvements to the running of the scheme, many of which have since been implemented, for example: longer application periods, in order to avoid bottlenecks &mdash; the application period in 2008 opened in Ireland in February, with the closing date set at the latest allowable under Regulation, 15 May; earlier payments &mdash; while this issue is being pursued as part of the Health Check, agreement of the EU Commissioner is being sought for an advance payment for 2008, in line with the earlier advance payment date agreed for 2007.</P>

	<P>In accordance with the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools, all second-level schools should provide Physical Education as part of the curriculum.  The programme that each school plans and delivers should be based on my Department&rsquo;s approved syllabuses and the teaching hours should be registered in the school timetable.  The syllabuses have been developed on the basis of a time allocation of two hours per week. </P>
        <P>A revised syllabus in Physical Education as a non-examinable subject at Junior Cycle was introduced in post-primary schools in September 2003 and implemented on a phased basis over the period to 2005.  No implementation dates have been set as yet for further reforms in this area.</P>
        <P>This Government has worked hard to improve the opportunities for young people to get physical exercise both in school and in their local communities.  In a new school building or refurbishment/extension, PE facilities are included as part of the design, and new PE equipment such as balancing benches and gym mats are funded as part of any major building programme.</P>
        <P>A special PE funding package of &euro;3 million issued to post-primary schools in 2007, providing a grant of &euro;4,000 per school towards the cost of replacing and upgrading PE equipment.  This grant was issued, as a once-off measure, to enable schools to replace older equipment such as goalposts, PE mats, benches etc.</P>
        <P>So, through an increased focus on exercise in school and in the community, we are working to encourage more children and young people to get active.  Indeed, the &lsquo;State of the Nation&rsquo;s Children&rsquo; report published by the Minister for Children recently, found that children in Ireland are doing well on physical activity, ranking second across the 32 WHO countries in being physically active for at least 4 hours per week.</P>

	<P>The Junior Certificate School Programme (JCSP) was introduced in September 1996 as an intervention within the Junior Certificate specifically aimed at students who are potential early school leavers.  It is designed to assist schools and individual teachers in adopting a student-centred approach to education and to provide students with a programme to meet their individual needs.  There are currently 225 schools/centres offering the Programme.</P>
        <P>The DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) Action Plan for Educational Inclusion provides for extended access to the JCSP for second-level schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.  My Department decided to extend the Programme, on a phased basis over three school years, to those schools which are participating in DEIS.  The first phase commenced in September 2007 with an additional 30 schools selected to offer the Programme.  A further 24 schools were selected to join in 2008. It is intended that all DEIS schools will be approved to offer JCSP by 2010.</P>
        <P>Participation in the programme is supported by an enhanced pupil:teacher ratio and a once-off per capita grant.  In addition, professional development support to schools and teachers offering the Programme is provided through the Second Level Support Service (SLSS) by the JCSP Support Service which is located in the Curriculum Development Unit of the City of Dublin VEC.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1649 and 1835 together.</P>
        <P>There have been substantial improvements in the funding of higher education in recent years.  Overall provision to the third level sector (capital, recurrent, student grants etc) amounted to some &euro;1.5 billion in 2004, &euro;1.9 billion in 2007 and some &euro;2 billion in 2008.  This is an increase of some 33% since 2004 and an increase of some 135% since 1997 levels (&euro;850m).  Substantial <Col N="793"/>funding continues to be provided for research and development.  In 2007 the recurrent funding allocated under the research programmes amounted to some &euro;83.7million.</P>
        <P>In recent years, recurrent funding allocated to the University sector (including funding to meet the cost of free undergraduate tuition fees) has increased from &euro;631m in 2004 to some &euro;831m in 2008.  This excludes separately provided programmes of funding for capital, for research and development and from the Strategic Innovation Fund.  It represents an increase of some 32% since 2004 and an increase of some 150% since 1997 levels.  In the circumstances, it is a matter for the universities to manage their resources and where necessary to effect economies in order to keep expenditure within the approved budget.</P>
        <P>Support for reform and development at third level and the creation of world class excellence at fourth level are central Government priorities.  The National Development Plan 2007-2013, recognises the critical role of higher education in the national innovation system that will be the basis of Ireland&rsquo;s economic and social development.  The Plan identifies the full funding of the sector &mdash; over &euro;13 billion through the period &mdash; as a key strategic investment under the Plan.  In contributing to the achievement of national policy goals for social and economic development, it can be anticipated that there will be continuing significant resource needs for the sector.</P>
        <P>As you will be aware, I have indicated my intention to launch a process to develop a new strategy for higher education that will provide a vision and strategic direction for the future development of the sector in contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s economic and social development.  In developing that strategy, it is appropriate that we examine how well our higher education system is performing currently and how the system can be best supported to meet the challenges that lie ahead.</P>
        <P>When I met with the Heads of the Universities I emphasised the need to ensure effective use of existing resources in the context of the future development of the sector.</P>

        <Quest> the percentage of students within the primary education system that obtain extra support or remedial support, either in a mainstream class or away from the mainstream class, to deal with specific issues that may arise regarding language, learning difficulties and so on; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware of my Department&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that all children including those with special needs can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary school network.  This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curricu<Col N="794"/>lum with the option, in line with each child&rsquo;s ability, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that my Department implemented a new scheme for allocating learning support / resource teachers to schools to cater for the needs of children with high-incidence special educational needs in all primary schools in September 2005.  The general allocation model was designed to ensure that each school has learning support/resource teaching support available to meet the needs of children with high incidence special needs.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for school authorities to determine how these hours are utilised to support eligible pupils.  My Department does therefore not hold details of the percentage of students being supported through this mechanism.  However, it can be assumed generally that pupils who perform at or below the 10th percentile on a standardised test of reading and/or mathematics would qualify for such support.  Pupils with more significant needs may qualify for additional teaching and special needs assistant support through the National Council for Special Education.</P>
        <P>All schools in Ireland with migrant children for whom English is a second language are entitled to specific resources, irrespective of geographic location.  Schools with high numbers of immigrant children for whom English is not their first language are given special supports by way of additional teaching staff and teaching materials.  Since summer 2007, the level of additional teacher support allocated to primary and post-primary schools is determined by the number of pupils enrolled for whom English is a second language and the associated assessed levels of pupils&rsquo; language proficiency.  Schools with less than 14 pupils will have their needs addressed through the provision of financial resources, again based on the number of pupils.  The resources available are set out in circular 53/2007 and can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website www.education.ie.</P>
        <P>There are now over 1,500 language support teachers at primary level providing support to approximately 21,000 pupils.</P>

	<P>The Dublin 7 Schools&rsquo; Cultural Mediation Project was financed under the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform/ Pobal Integration Initiative. It was provided with funding for one year only.  Funding has been sought for a further two years.</P>
        <P>I regret, however, that resources for this project are not available to me at this time.  In the deployment of resources to cater for migrant pupils, I have prioritised support for schools and <Col N="797"/>teachers in relation to the teaching of English as an Additional Language (EAL).  In 2008, there were almost 2,000 English-Language Support Teachers in primary and post-primary schools at a cost of some &euro;120m. per annum, compared to 997 in 2006 and 262 in 2001/2.</P>
        <P>This autumn the Primary Professional Development Service has brought together a team to provide training and support to the English-Language Support Teachers in primary schools.  In addition, a Primary School Assessment Kit was circulated by the Department to all primary schools last June.  This kit will enable teachers to carry out initial and on-going assessments of the language proficiency of newcomer children.  It is proposed to have an assessment kit for post-primary schools available later in the year.</P>

Such children have to make their own way to the nearest pick up point within that catchment area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that there are two means by which former residents of institutions which were subject to State regulation or inspection can apply for and be awarded compensation &mdash; The Residential Institutions Redress Board and the Court system.</P>
        <P>The Residential Institutions Redress Board was established to make fair and reasonable payments to persons who, as children, were abused whilst resident in industrial schools, reformatories and other institutions which were subject to State inspection or regulation.  Awards made by the Redress Board are payable in full to the applicant with no deductions for costs. The Board is entirely independent in the performance of its functions and its operation is governed by the terms of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002.</P>
        <P>Section 27 of the aforementioned Act provides that all reasonable legal costs and other costs associated with the preparation and presentation of an application to the Board will be met by the Board.  In the event that agreement cannot be reached between the Board and the applicant&rsquo;s legal representative, the matter is referred to the Taxing Master of the High Court for determination.</P>
        <P>The Redress Board&rsquo;s published guidelines and other publicity material on the redress scheme specifically highlight the fact that all reasonable legal costs incurred in respect of applications for redress are payable by the Board.  Furthermore, as solicitors are required by law to fully inform their clients, in writing, of the legal costs payable in their case, it is incumbent on the individual solicitors to inform applicants to the Board that all reasonable legal costs will be met by the Board and that the applicant should not have to pay any legal costs.  The Law Society of Ireland is the body responsible for the regulation of the profession and, as such, it is a matter for the Society to investigate complaints about the conduct of a solicitor.</P><Col N="801"/>
        <P>Aside from the Redress Board, victims of abuse also have recourse to the Court system.  Claims taken by victims of institutional abuse against the State are handled by the State Claims Agency.  Where cases are processed through the Court system, it is the presiding Judge who will decide on liability for payment of costs in the normal course.  The issue of legal fees being charged by a Solicitor is a matter between the solicitor and client.  However, I understand that there are clear guidelines set down by the Law Society in relation to the charging of fees and, where a client has any cause for concern, s/he can have the matter referred to the Law Society.  A document entitled &ldquo;Information in Relation to Legal Charges&rdquo; is available to download from the Law Society&rsquo;s website and sets out all relevant information.</P>
        <P>In relation to the issue of deduction of stamp duty or other forms of taxation from the awards, I wish to advise the Deputy that, under Section 22 of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002, income consisting of an award under the terms of the Act shall be disregarded for the purposes of income tax assessment.  In relation to the deduction of taxes from awards made by the Courts, this is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

	<P>The compulsory school starting age in a National School is 6 years of age.  Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters.  My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.  This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. </P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act.  In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.  In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful.  In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000.</P>
        <P>Where a Board of Management refuses to enrol a student in a school, the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student himself or herself, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science.

	<P>I jointly issued a press statement on this topic with the Minister for Education and Science, Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, T.D. yesterday.  We have agreed recommendations on school uniform policy.  These recommendations are based on extensive consultations I made this summer.  The report containing the recommendations will be published on the Department of Education and Science website in the near future.The agreed recommendations are as follows:</P>
<P el="5">1. <Miles com="ix" />The current system, whereby schools decide their uniform policy at a local level, is reasonable, works and should be maintained.</P>
<P el="5">2. <Miles com="ix" />In this context, no school uniform policy should act in such a way that it, in effect, excludes students of a particular religious background from seeking enrolment or continuing their enrolment in a school.  However, this statement does not recommend the wearing of clothing in the classroom which obscures a facial view and creates an artificial barrier between pupil and teacher.  Such clothing hinders proper communication.</P>
<P el="5">3. <Miles com="ix" />Schools, when drawing up uniform policy, should consult widely within the school community.</P>
<P el="5">4. <Miles com="ix" />Schools should take note of the obligations placed on them by the Equal Status Acts before setting down a school uniform policy. They should also be mindful of the Education Act, 1998.  As previously mentioned, this obliges boards of management to take account of &ldquo;the principles and requirements of a democratic society and have respect and promote respect for the diversity of values, beliefs, traditions, languages and ways of life in society&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These recommendations will be formally conveyed to schools shortly.</P>

Following a recent competition, the Special Education Support Service (SESS) is working to recruit a number of candidates.  While this process is ongoing the person that will lead this team is working with the SESS in an advisory capacity and in addition to providing in-school support has also provided access to programmes of Continuing Professional Development covering the area of  Applied Behaviour Analysis.  The following courses have been provided on two occasions and will be provided again in the current academic year:</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1682, 1773 and 1855 together.</P><Col N="805"/>
        <P>The School Completion Programme encompasses both primary and post-primary levels and focuses on young people between the ages of 4 and 18 years and is designed to deal with issues of both concentrated and regionally dispersed disadvantage.  SCP is a key component of DEIS ( Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion, which discriminates positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving.</P>
        <P>At present there are 124 projects, comprising 692 schools participating in the School Completion Programme.</P>
        <P>As you are aware the Government announced on 8th July 2008 a series of public spending measures in response to the deterioration in the public finances.</P>
        <P>In common with other Departments, my Department is required to reduce its payroll bill and that of its agencies by 3% by the end of 2009, through all appropriate measures identified by local management in the light of local circumstances.  The exceptions to this requirement is certain frontline teaching staff and Special Needs Assistants.</P>
        <P>In the Department&rsquo;s letter of 21st August, all SCP projects were advised that they have the authority to manage how the savings are to be achieved.  This is to facilitate projects in their efforts to ensure that these necessary steps will be applied in such a manner as to minimise their effect on young people targeted and to prioritise those activities which are found to be of most value in supporting the young people concerned.</P>
        <P>In implementing this decision local Managers will have an opportunity to consider measures which might include the control of premium pay, the management of existing or future vacancies, the organisation of work processes and the levels at which work is carried out, as well as control of numbers through recruitment and other measures.  This requirement will not have a universal effect on all 124 projects, as projects vary in size, number of schools involved and the number and status of personnel employed and the types of interventions in place.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the Government decision, the allocation for the pay element of the School Completion Programme in 2009 will be framed on the basis that a saving of 3% will be achieved when the pay bill is adjusted to include the full-year cost of Towards 2016 increases payable in 2008.  In line with the above, the 2008/09 allocation for SCP projects will be adjusted to reflect increases due under Towards 2016 in 2008 and a saving of 3% in payroll costs for 2009.  As this process is ongoing, there has been no effect to date on the services provided by any of the participating projects.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that the savings requested, will lead to rationalisation, with more efficient and cost effective measures being implemented.  In this way, it is not expected that there will be any significant diminution of front-lines services.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of the Free Fees Initiative the Exchequer meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are pursuing full-time undergraduate courses of study.  The main conditions are that students must be first-time undergraduates and hold E.U. nationality and have been ordinarily resident in an E.U. Member State for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course.</P><Col N="806"/>
        <P>The residency requirement applies to all E.U. nationals, including Irish nationals in accordance with the judgement of the European Court of Justice that access to vocational training must apply equally to all E.U. nationals.</P>
        <P>On the date of entry to the course, the person referred to by the Deputy did not hold E.U. nationality and had not been ordinarily resident in an E.U.

        <P>Section 473A, of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in E.U.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1684 and 1697 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network.  This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.  Funding is also provided for assistive technology and specialist equipment as required and special school transport arrangements may also be put in place.</P>
        <P>Some students with autism require further support in school.  The establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for these children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years.  In excess of 330 classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, including many in special schools.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will continue to establish more classes as required.</P>
        <P>Children in these classes benefit from having a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1; fully-qualified teachers who have access to training in a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA), the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) and there is a minimum of 2 special needs assistants in each class.  Other special needs assistant posts may be allocated in line with the needs of the enrolled children.  These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is aware that the home tuition scheme provides a grant to parents to facilitate the provision of education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school.  The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting an educational placement and provide early education intervention for pre-school children with autism.</P><Col N="807"/>

	<P>Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second-level, mainly in the case of language subjects, decisions on which textbooks to use in first and second-level schools are taken at school level.  My Department does not have a role in recommending, endorsing or approving textbooks.</P>

School authorities have been advised that books should be changed only to the extent that is absolutely necessary.  However, textbooks have to be changed periodically to enable teachers to keep their own and their students&rsquo; work educationally stimulating and to ensure that content and methodology are kept up to date.</P>

	<P>Among the recommendations contained in the Music Network report was that a series of Music Education Partnerships would be developed between the County/City Development Boards and the Vocational Education Committees on a phased basis. </P>
        <P>In 2004, my Department began funding a pilot programme in both Dublin City and in Donegal VECs to test approaches to delivery of the proposed model.  Resources are not available at present to expand this programme to other areas.  However, the matter will be kept under review.</P>
        <P>I believe that the arts have an important role to play in the education of the individual. Music, the visual arts and drama provide for sensory, emotional, intellectual and creative enrichment and contribute to the young person&rsquo;s holistic development and self esteem.  Arts education (visual arts, music and drama) is one of the seven curriculum areas that comprise the primary curriculum, which was revised in 1999.  At second level there are approved syllabuses for Junior Certificate in Music and Art, Craft and Design. In the senior cycle there are syllabuses in Music and Art. Modules in the Arts are also available as part of the Leaving Certificate Applied and in the Transition Year programme.  In the delivery of these programmes, schools are encouraged to interact with practising artists in their own classrooms and in out of school settings.</P><Col N="809"/>
        <P>In addition to supporting Music in the curriculum an additional allocation of the equivalent of 93 whole time teaching posts are allocated to a range of VECs to support Music education.  This takes the form of individual tuition in instrumental and vocal music education, and provision of supports for choirs, orchestras and ensembles.  Through this some 68,000 hours of music tuition are provided annually.</P>

	<P>My Department provides an extensive range of supports to schools to enable them meet the needs of pupils with special educational needs, including those with a physical disability.  Depending on the needs of the pupil(s), these supports may include additional resource teaching and/or care support; specialist equipment; assistive technology and special school transport arrangements.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special needs, including pupils with a physical disability.  Applications for SNAs may be considered by the NCSE where a pupil has a significant medical need for such assistance, a significant impairment of physical or sensory function or where their behaviour is such that they are a danger to themselves or to other pupils.  A pupil&rsquo;s level of care may diminish over time as the child matures.  Pupils may move to a different school or on to post-primary school.  In such situations, the NCSE will review and adjust the SNA support required in the school.  The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support.</P>
        <P>My officials have been in contact with the NCSE and have been advised that the school in question has requested a review of its allocation of resources.  I understand that the local SENO will be in contact with the school regarding this matter shortly.</P>

	<P>The protection of personal data is a fundamental and ongoing aspect of the work of my Department.  My Department is committed to protecting personal data and takes all reasonable steps to ensure that the data it holds is protected. </P>
        <P>Data protection compliance is part of induction training for all new staff.  In addition, 256 members of staff have completed records management training, which includes training in data protection.</P><Col N="812"/>
        <P>A Data Protection Policy, which was approved by the Office of the Data Protection Commission is in place, this has been circulated to all staff and is available to staff for download from our intranet.  In June this year, my Department published a Policy for Protection of Data while using Laptops and other Mobile Data Devices and this was circulated to all staff and is available to staff for download from our intranet.  My Department is about to commence deploying encryption software for use on laptops and portable storage devices, this will ensure that any data which may be stored on such devices will have a reduced risk of compromise in the event of loss or theft.</P>
        <P>Access to offices is restricted to staff working in the area and swipe cards are required to gain access to Department buildings.  Access to sections holding sensitive information is further restricted through the use of swipe cards and digital locks.  Access to paper files is restricted to staff in the business area, segregation of duties controls are in place along with differing levels of authorisation.  Files with particularly sensitive information are stored in a strong room with a digital lock.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s technical network architecture is regularly reviewed in order to seek to ensure continued compliance with changing standards of best practice.  Dual firewalls are in place to protect my Department&rsquo;s systems from unauthorised access by outside organisations/individuals.  A global &ldquo;strong password&rdquo; policy is in place for the network.  Access to systems is controlled, in that staff are given access rights to systems based on their job role rather than having access to all systems holding personal data. PCs and servers are securely disposed of in accordance with the Data Protection Acts and the ISO 9001:2000 standard.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently participating on a working group which will develop guidelines (including a template code of practice) governing the treatment of sensitive and personal data by public sector organisations, including procedures for the storage, transmission, transportation, exchange and appropriate use and access of personal data (in the areas of paper records, remote access, laptops, mobile storage devices, email, data transfers).

	<P>As part of the multi-annual school building programme, the Government has invested heavily in the modernisation of school facilities throughout the country including science facilities in post-primary schools.  Provision of science facilities is an intrinsic part of all major projects at post-primary level.  Typically this investment involves the provision of modern science facilities in new post-primary schools or the upgrading of science facilities in existing schools either as part of a school building project or as a dedicated investment to facilitate the teaching of science.  Under the current NDP, &euro;4.5 billion will be spent on school infrastructure between 2007 and 2013.</P>
        <P>Schools have also received funding under the Summer Works Schemes 2004 -2007 to refurbish science laboratories. In the 2006 application form for the Summer Works Scheme, post-primary schools were asked to identify specifically, and provide details of, any science and technology upgrade or refurbishment projects separate from any other projects being applied for, so that consideration could be given to approving these projects for 2006.  Over 60 schools were approved for funding in 2006 and 2007 under my Department&rsquo;s Summer Works Scheme to enable them to get science laboratories refurbished on a devolved basis.</P>
        <P>Additionally, my Department has funded the provision of class materials, basic general equipment and chemicals for practical work for the Sciences.  My Department also spent in excess of &euro;13m in 2004 to facilitate the introduction of a revised Junior Science syllabus. Schools received a basic grant of &euro;3,500 per science laboratory to enable them to provide the new curriculum.  Additional funding was made available to schools where other specified equipment was required. In addition, certain schools identified as needing new or refurbished science laboratories as a result of a 1998 national survey received funding.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The mainstream staffing schedule allocates teachers within enrolment bands and the current bands are based on an average of 27 pupils. While the schedule allocates on the basis of an average each individual school decides how to arrange its classes.  This means for example that two different schools that have the same enrolment and as a result are allocated the same number of teachers may choose to configure their classes differently.  Depending on a school&rsquo;s own circumstances one school may aim for a very even distribution across all class groups while another school may chose to have lower numbers in a particular class group or groups with consequently larger numbers in other classes.  With over 20,000 individual classes spread across all schools throughout the country there will always be differences in individual class sizes.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that an even distribution and splitting classes may not always be an option for a particular school, because for example there might be a large group in junior infants and a small group in sixth class and so on.  But where it is possible, I believe that principals should consider the benefits of having smaller multi-grade classes as against having particularly large differences in class sizes at different levels in the school.</P>
        <P>Multi-grade classes are the norm in the majority of our primary schools given the number of relatively small schools that have 4 teachers or less and there is no evidence whatsoever that being taught in a multi-grade setting is to the detriment of the child.  I think more principals should consider multi-grade classes where they are in the best interests of pupils who might otherwise find themselves in a single grade large class.</P>

	<P>I recently published the ICT Strategy Group Report, Investing Effectively in ICT in Schools 2008-2013, together with the evaluation report undertaken by my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate, ICT in Schools, which represents the first major study of the impact that ICT is having on teaching and learning in our schools.  While acknowledging the progress made since the ICT in Schools Programme was first launched some ten years ago, these Reports set out a substantial agenda to be pursued to fully integrate ICT into teaching and learning in our classrooms.     </P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to pursuing the integration of ICT in teaching and learning is set out in the Programme for Government. The National Development Plan envisages investment of some &euro;252m in this area over the period of the Plan.  While we face significant challenges in implementing some of the recommendations made in these Reports having regard to the current public finance position, I am committed to investing in this area as resources permit and I am anxious that we progress a number of key deliverables as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The role of the individual school ICT co-ordinator will be prioritised along with support for school principals.  Nationwide seminars on e-Learning for these personnel will be held and handbooks on planning and implementing e-Learning in Schools are in preparation. A pro<Col N="820"/>fessional development course for ICT co-ordinating teachers on the development of e-Learning Plans will also be available.  The National Centre for Technology in Education will collaborate with the various school support agencies to integrate ICT into the delivery of all support services.  New on-line and blended ICT professional courses will be offered and ICT will be integrated into all curriculum development activities.  My Department will shortly issue a tender for the next round of the Schools&rsquo; Broadband Programme and the range of services available to schools will be expanded.  A free website hosting service will be provided to schools, which will provide a unique &lsquo;.scoilnet.ie&rsquo; website address to schools.</P>
        <P>The specific information sought by the Deputy in relation to schools in Kildare is not readily available.  Since its introduction, some &euro;200m has been invested in the ICT in Schools Programme and schools have received specific ICT equipment grants and networking grants under the various initiatives of the ICT in Schools Programme.</P>
        <P>Outside of the specific ICT in Schools Programme, new post-primary school buildings projects include ICT equipment budgets and since 2004, all new school building projects must comply with the Department&rsquo;s ICT Infrastructure Guidelines.  The Grant Scheme for Minor Works to National School Properties includes ICT equipment within the range of approved school expenditure.  Disadvantaged schools are also benefiting from the &euro;3.4m ICT Grant scheme for DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) Schools from the Dormant Accounts (Educational Disadvantage) Fund.  A further &euro;1m Fund is being supported from the Dormant Account Fund to assist up to 100 DEIS schools achieve digital schools status.  The arrangements for the initiative are being finalised with the NCTE.  Grants have also been issued to some 500 post-primary schools to enable them to upgrade their facilities to enable them to provide the new Technology syllabus and the revised Design and Communication Graphics syllabus with effect from September 2007.</P>

	<P>It is open to the Board of Management of a primary school to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools.  Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, (Circular 0010/2008) which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i> and a hard copy of which has issued to all primary schools.  The criteria are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website. </P>
        <P>The first meeting of the Appeal Board took place on 20th May, 2008.  However I understand that no appeal application was submitted by the school to which the Deputy refers on that occasion.</P>
        <P>The next meeting of the Appeal Board is scheduled to take place on 28th October 2008.  The closing date for receipt of appeals is 10 October 2008.  Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made.  The application form is available from Primary Payments Section or on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The Appeal Board operates independently of my Department and its decision is final.</P>

        <P>My Department has recently completed a full review of the allocation of posts and clustering arrangements under Home School Community Liaison (HSCL).  As a result, posts are allocated to schools on the basis of their levels of disadvantage and enrolment, having regard to geographic proximity or &lsquo;association&rsquo; (where children from the same family attend different schools. ie boys and girls or primary and post primary aged siblings) and to facilitate local HSCL coordinators working with families of disadvantaged children across both primary and second level.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to advise that both schools mentioned by the Deputy have been allocated one full HSCL post following the review.  Schools were advised of this outcome on 21 August 2008.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year.  The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.</P>
        <P>The staffing schedule allocates teachers within enrolment bands and the current bands are based on an average of 27 pupils. While the schedule allocates on the basis of an average each individual school decides how to arrange its classes.</P>
        <P>Posts allocated on the basis of this staffing schedule are specifically for mainstream classes and should be deployed accordingly. School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment).  In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</P>
        <P>Data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy, indicates that the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2006 was 236 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i>, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year was a Principal and 9 mainstream class teachers.</P>
        <P>According to data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school, the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2007 was 227 pupils.  In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0010/2008), which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i> and a hard copy of which has been issued to all primary schools, the mainstream staffing in the school for the current school year is a Principal and 8 mainstream class teachers.</P>

Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule.  The criteria are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The first meeting of the Appeal Board took place on 20th May, 2008.  The next meeting is scheduled to take place on 28th October 2008.  The closing date for receipt of appeals is 10 <Col N="826"/>October 2008.  Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made.

	<P>Section 52 of the Universities Act 1997 prohibits the use of the term &ldquo;University&rdquo; where the organisation is engaged in the provision of education services unless the Minister for Education and Science consents to the use of the term. The existence of organisations of the type referred to by the Deputy is contrary to the interests of Ireland&rsquo;s higher education institutions, which have sought to preserve the high international standing and quality reputation of higher education in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Department has contacted a number of organisations which were using the title &ldquo;university&rdquo; without  consent and in most cases when the legislative requirements were explained, the organisations concerned voluntarily agreed to stop using the title.   Agreement has also been reached with the Companies Registration Office whereby any business name applied for which features the term &lsquo;university&rsquo; will not be accepted without the express approval of the Department of Education and Science.  The Irish Domain Registry has also agreed not to register web addresses using the title &ldquo;university&rdquo;.  The Department&rsquo;s website also contains a list of State-aided third level institutions, and other institutions or colleges where awards have been validated by HETAC.  The Government also intends to take a number of steps to bring greater clarity and focus to the promotion of Irish educational programmes overseas. This will include the development and implementation of a Quality Mark for international education programmes, the award of which will be based on appropriate certification of educational programmes and implementation by institutions of a Code of Practice for the delivery of international education services.  Responsibility for these functions will be assigned by the Government to an appropriate authority.</P>

	<P>In July this year, I published the report Investing Effectively in Information and Communications Technology in Schools 2008-2013, prepared by the Strategy Group appointed to advise on priorities for investment in ICT in Schools having regard to the critical success factors for successful integration of ICT into learning and teaching.  It was published along with the ICT in Schools report on the evaluation of the impact of ICT on teaching and learning carried out by my Departments Inspectorate.</P>
        <P>The report highlights the need for an integrated approach across a range of areas covering teacher professional development, digital content, broadband, technical support and ICT infrastructure in order to further the integration of ICT into teaching and learning in our schools.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to pursuing the integration of ICT in teaching and learning is set out in the Programme for Government. The National Development Plan envisages investment of some &euro;252m in this area over the period of the Plan. While we face significant challenges in implementing some of the recommendations having regard to the current economic situation, I am committed to investing in this area as resources permit.  Specific actions being taken include the planned publication by the National Centre for Technology in Education of a handbook for principals and ICT co-ordinating teachers Planning and Implementing e-Learning in your School.  A professional development course for ICT coordinating teachers on the development of e-Learning Plans will also be available along with nationwide seminars on e-Learning for principals and ICT coordinating teachers to be run in the Autumn.</P>
        <P>The report of the Strategy Group was distributed to school principals and board chairpersons in September; copies were also delivered to management organisations, libraries and other bodies. The report is also available on my department&rsquo;s website.  The outlay in relation to production/printing of the report (including Irish translation) and accompanying CDs has been &euro;50,137.30.  In the interests of cost effectiveness, the report was delivered in conjunction with a number of Inspectorate reports. The boxing, packing, storage and distribution outlay relating to the consolidated distribution operation has amounted to &euro;66,163.10.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that there have been no cutbacks in the provision of special needs assistants to support children with special needs. In fact, there are now 19,000 staff in our schools working solely with children with special needs. This includes over 10,000 SNAs &mdash; compared with just 300 in 1997.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special needs. Applications for SNAs may be considered by the NCSE where a pupil has a significant medical need for such assistance, a significant impairment of physical or sensory function or where their behaviour is such that they are a danger to themselves or to other pupils.</P>
        <P>For some pupils, as they mature, their care needs may diminish over time. In such circumstances, the NCSE will review and adjust the overall level of SNA support in the school concerned. This may mean that some pupils who had previously been supported by a full time SNA may have their needs met through the shared support of an SNA or perhaps they may have no need for SNA support.  The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) is a second chance education initiative for unemployed persons, who are at least 21 years of age or over and in receipt of specified social welfare payments for at least six months. VTOS is operated through 33 VECs nationwide.  VTOS students are paid a training allowance in lieu of their previous qualifying social welfare payment, at a rate equivalent to the maximum rate of jobseeker's benefit. Students retain their social welfare secondary benefits and may also receive a payment for an adult or child dependant if appropriate.  Social welfare rates are determined in the annual Government Budget.</P>
        <P>VTOS students benefit from free tuition, books, materials and the VEC adult guidance service.  The Adult Education childcare service, which is available to students on the VTOS, Youthreach, Senior Traveller Training and  Back to Education Initiative (BTEI) programmes, now caters for 1,700 student-parents and their 2,300 children.  VTOS students in receipt of their social welfare payment for one year prior to course commencement also receive a training bonus of &euro;31.80. Students are entitled to a meal allowance and a travel allowance if they reside more than 3 miles from a centre.  These allowances are equivalent to those paid to participants <Col N="833"/>on F&Aacute;S training courses and are increased periodically in line with increases in F&Aacute;S rates. The current rates have been in operation since 2002.  There are currently no plans to increase these allowances.</P>

My Department&rsquo;s design guidelines for schools include guidance on the provision of PE Halls, general purpose rooms and outdoor hard play areas such as basketball courts. PE facilities have been provided, where appropriate, as part of my Department&rsquo;s school building programme which, between 2000 and 2006, involved the delivery of over 7,800 projects, with an investment of &euro;2.6 billion and a further &euro;4.5 billion is to be invested under the current National Development Plan 2007-2013. Close to &euro;600 million of this will be provided this year alone. This multi-annual funding will enable my Department to continue to take a proactive approach to the provision of modern school accommodation including PE facilities.</P>

        <Quest> the number of students waiting for a psychological assessment within both primary and post-primary education; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I can inform the Deputy that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) which is administered by NEPS.  NEPS does not keep waiting lists for assessments of children but in common with other psychological services encourages a staged assessment process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school&rsquo;s best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the General Allocation model for primary schools in 2005/06 means that children with high incidence special needs now longer have to wait for an individual assessment before they can get access to extra support.</P>
        <P>Children who manifest very special or urgent needs in school and who have not been previously assessed by a psychologist and are brought to the attention of a NEPS psychologist by the Principal teacher will usually be assessed by the psychologist within that school term. Normally, principals of schools prioritise those children in need of psychological assessment in consultation with the assigned psychologist.</P>
        <P>In the case of schools that do not currently have dedicated NEPS psychologists assigned to them, as I already mentioned, such schools have access to psychological assessments through the SCPA. Under this Scheme, schools can commission assessments from a member of the panel of private practitioners approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the fees directly to the psychologist concerned.  Should school authorities have specific difficulties with regard any of the foregoing I would suggest that they should contact the local NEPS Regional Director, contact details for whom are also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, given the significant investment by the Department in this scheme &mdash; &euro;175.2 million in 2008 &mdash; it is a matter of concern for the Department that some parents would reserve seats for their children and then not make full use of these seats during the full school year.  Bus &Eacute;ireann Inspectors and drivers provide feedback to Bus &Eacute;ireann in this regard on a regular basis.  Their reports indicate that the usage patterns for pupils can vary daily, there are very few pupils allocated tickets who never use their service but, given the number of routes in the network (6,000), it is difficult to specifically identify those pupils who use the service on an irregular basis.</P>
        <P>Where a complaint of regular non use of a seat is received, Bus &Eacute;ireann arranges to monitor the situation.  Those pupils who are identified as using the school transport service on an irregular basis can be asked to surrender their tickets and make alternative transport arrangements. This facilitates the reallocation to other families of the seats in accordance with the terms of the school transport schemes.</P>

	<P>The statistical data requested by the Deputy is contained in the following document.  These figures refer to all candidates who entered for Leaving Certificate and Junior Certificate in each of the years 2004 to 2008. The Leaving Certificate figures include school based candidates, external candidates and repeat candidates. The Junior Certificate figures include school based candidates and repeat candidates.  The data is gathered through the Post-Primary Database returns from schools each October.</P>
        <P>Exemptions from learning Irish are granted in accordance with the provisions of Circular M10/94, including:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />students whose primary education up to 11 years of age was received in Northern Ireland or outside Ireland</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />students who were previously enrolled as recognised students in a primary school or post-primary school who are being re-enrolled after a period spent abroad, provided that at least 3 years have elapsed since the previous enrolment in the State and the student is at least 11 years of age on re-enrolment, and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />certain categories of students with special educational needs.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The scheme devolves decision making to school authorities who are required to operate strictly within the criteria.  The figures therefore refer to the exemption from the study of Irish in a recognised school and not to the examination itself. The figures provided for exemptions refer, in each year, to the number of Leaving Certificate and Junior Certificate candidates from recognised schools who had an exemption from the study of Irish.</P>
        <P>The post-primary data includes information on each student&rsquo;s &ldquo;country of origin&rdquo;.  This data is derived from the answers given by parents to the school authorities when enrolling their children. The country of origin field on the database defaults to &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; unless otherwise indicated in the returns submitted by schools.</P>
        <P>In compiling these data, the languages referred to in the attached tables are the modern languages French, Spanish, German and Italian. It should be noted that the data records the number of students studying each modern language and not the numbers studying a modern language.</P>
        <P>The choice of subjects for post-primary students, including those for students with an exemption from the study of Irish, is a matter for the student and his or her parents in consultation with the school Principal in the context of the students overall educational needs and in accordance with policies and procedures obtaining in the school.  In that context, students cannot ordinarily qualify for exemptions from modern languages except those students following the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme and then only subject to consideration by the <Col N="837"/>inspectorate. Data on students which qualify for this exemption are not readily available and are not recorded on the Post-Primary Pupil Database.</P>

	<P>My Department has provided significant additional capacity at primary level in the Lucan area with the opening in September, 2008 of the new 8 classroom primary school in Clonburris. The long term plan for this school is the provision of a 16 classroom school and appropriate ancillary space as per <Col N="839"/>Department guidelines.  Based on current demographic trends, my Department anticipates that there will be a need for a further post-primary school in Lucan in the medium term and it has asked South Dublin County Council to identify a site for this development.  A timeframe for the delivery of the school will be known when a suitable site has been identified and acquired. The local authority has a number of Local Area Plans in train and it is likely that the Department will be able to secure a site under this process.</P>
        <P>My Department is conscious of the lead-in period for the delivery of a post-primary school and it would be anxious to conclude the site issue as soon as possible. It will continue to engage with the local authority until this matter is resolved.  My Department will also be making a post primary school available in the Adamstown SDZ which is adjacent to Lucan. This school building is planned to come on steam for the 2009/10 school year. This new post-primary school will operate under the patronage of County Dublin VEC and will cater for 1,000 pupils.  Further school provision will be provided as the need arises in the Lucan area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1774 to 1776, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The issue of the re-introduction of third level fees should be viewed in the context of a wider debate on the funding of higher education.  As the Deputy will be aware, I have indicated my intention to produce a new strategy for higher education that will provide a vision and strategic direction for the future development of the sector in contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s economic and social development. In developing that strategy, it is appropriate that we examine how well our higher education system is performing currently, how existing resources are being used and how the system can be best supported to meet the challenges that lie ahead. The agreement of the Government will be sought on the draft terms of reference for the strategy which is expected to take some eighteen months to complete.  The Government is investing unprecedented levels of public funding in higher education. In 2008 some &euro;2 billion is being invested in our third level sector. In contributing to the achievement of national policy goals for social and economic development, it can be anticipated that there will be continuing significant resource needs for the sector. It is appropriate, however, to raise questions around how future additional resource needs can be met and how our higher education institutions can be sup<Col N="841"/>ported in their development ambitions through a widening of their non-exchequer sources of income.</P>
        <P>The introduction of a form of student contribution, which would only be applied to those who can absolutely afford to pay it, is one possibility that merits debate. In that regard, there are many complex and competing considerations that will fall to be taken into account in the estimation of revenue that might accrue from such an introduction.  Any move towards the introduction of a student contribution in some form would require Government approval.</P>
        <P>In shaping a new strategy for higher education, we have an important opportunity to set the sector on direction of development and change that will serve vital national economic and social interests in to the future. I look forward to engaging constructively with the sector and all of the wider interests in addressing some of these major policy issues.</P>

The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support. I have arranged for the details supplied to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> the number of primary schools whose buildings consist entirely of prefabricated buildings; the statistics on a county basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>With the recent rapid increase in the school going population, a large number of new schools have been established in recent years, under the process for the recognition of new schools conducted by the New Schools Advisory Committee.  It is the general practice of my Department not to provide permanent accommodation for schools which have only received temporary recognition.  When the school receives permanent recognition, it is then open to the school to apply for funding for permanent accommodation.  In the meantime, some new schools are accommodated in prefabricated buildings, while others rent permanent premises.</P>
        <P>The information sought by the Deputy is not held by my Department in a readily-accessible format.  However, the investment of almost &euro;4.5 billion under the current National Development Plan is increasing the number of permanent school places across the country.  This investment in schools includes the completion of construction work during the course of 2008 on 67 large scale building projects, the opening of 26 new school buildings in rapidly developing areas and the progression of 374 devolved projects under the Permanent Accommodation and Small Schools Schemes.</P>
        <P>This level of activity under the school building programme builds on the significant achievements under the last National Development Plan when over 7,800 building projects were delivered to provide new and modernised educational infrastructure.  The Permanent Accommodation Scheme was introduced in 2003 to reduce the need for prefabs. It was designed to give value for money in terms of providing permanent accommodation in place of prefabs, where an accommodation need was likely to exist for a considerable length of time. Since its introduction, over &euro;100 million has been allocated to schools under the scheme and it has resulted in the provision of an additional 625 classrooms and 275 resource rooms in schools around the country. This is in addition to those classrooms provided under the major capital projects managed by my Department.</P>
        <P>Had the Permanent Accommodation Scheme not been in place, a very significant proportion of those classrooms and resource rooms would have had to be provided using temporary accommodation such as prefabricated classrooms.  Despite this, it will continue to be necessary for prefabricated accommodation to be provided because competing priorities mean that it will not always be possible to have a permanent accommodation solution in place in a short time-frame.  My Department will continue to provide funding for such prefabricated accommodation and the decision on whether to rent or purchase will depend on the likely length of time it will be required. In all cases, the approach will be to ensure best value for money.</P>

        <P>The Forward Planning Section of the Department is in the process of identifying the areas where significant additional accommodation will be required at primary and post-primary level for 2009 and onwards, including Glencullen/Sandyford.  Factors under consideration include population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places. Having considered these factors decisions will be taken on the means by which emerging needs will be met within an area.  As is the case with all large capital projects currently on hand within the Department, their progression will be considered in the context of the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Schools have flexibility in the way in which they assign pupils and teachers to classes and the Department does not allocate teachers to specific classes or age groups.  The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.</P><Col N="849"/>
        <P>Posts allocated on the basis of this staffing schedule are specifically for mainstream classes and should be deployed accordingly. School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</P>
        <P>Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year.  Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure.  If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</P>
        <P>According to data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy, the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2007 was 460 pupils.  In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0010/2008), which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which has been issued to all primary schools, the mainstream staffing in the school for the current school year is a Principal and 17 mainstream class teachers.</P>
        <P>It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools.  Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule.  The criteria are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The first meeting of the Appeal Board took place on 20th May, 2008.  The next meeting is scheduled to take place on 28th October 2008.  The closing date for receipt of appeals is 10 October 2008.  Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made.  The standard application form is available from Primary Payments Section or on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, a number of sections of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 have been commenced.  Following discussions with the Education partners, my Department developed proposals to facilitate implementation of the remaining sections, including the provisions in respect of assessment and individual education plans (IEPs). These proposals are being considered in the context of the 2009 estimates process.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to note that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has published guidelines on the IEP process, and a copy issued to all primary and post-primary schools at the commencement of the 2006/2007 school year.  These guidelines provide advice and assistance to schools, teachers and parents on devising and implementing individual education plans.  It is intended that schools will use these guidelines to develop school practices and procedures in relation to individual education plans, in advance of the mandatory requirement for them to do so.</P>
        <P>I remain committed to the provision of resources for students with special educational needs and my Department continues to expand capacity and services for these students across the schools network through the work of the National Council for Special Education.</P>

	<P>The Department of Education and Science has as one of its primary goals the achievement of high literacy standards. Both the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion (2007-2016) and the National Development Plan (2007-2013) have a high level goal of reducing the proportion of pupils with serious literacy  difficulties in primary schools serving disadvantage communities from 30% to 15% by 2016.</P>
        <P>The National Action Plan for Social Inclusion complemented by the social inclusion elements of the National Development Plan 2007-2013, sets out Ireland&rsquo;s social inclusion strategy over the period 2007-2016.  No specific monies are allocated under the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  However, since 2007 some &euro;3.1 million has been allocated to literacy and numeracy programmes at primary level.</P>
        <P>My Department will spend some &euro;800 million this year on tackling educational disadvantage at all levels &mdash; from pre-school to further and higher education. This represents an increase of some &euro;70 million since 2007 and is testament to the Government&rsquo;s determination to prioritise social inclusion and ensure that  all our children and young people get the supports they need to do well at school.</P>
        <P>Significant resources to address literacy and numeracy difficulties in schools serving disadvantaged communities are being provided through DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion.  These measures include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a maximum class size of 20:1 in junior classes and 24:1 in senior classes in the 190 urban/town schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />increased access to literacy and numeracy support services for all primary schools and to specific literacy and numeracy measures for all urban/town primary schools in DEIS.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />access to a range of supports for young people based on best practice identified through the School Completion Programme (include homework clubs).</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Reading Recovery is now in place in 197 schools and a newly trained teaching leader will increase capacity in Dublin from autumn 2008 with another two  teachers to undergo training in the 2008/2009 school year.  There are currently 260 schools taking part in the First Steps Programme, 334 schools in Ready Set Go Maths and 252 schools in Maths Recovery.</P>
        <P>Resources are also being made available for intensive professional development programmes for principals and teachers in DEIS schools.  A Family Literacy Project is also being implemented, the aim of which is to develop a family-literacy approach based on parents and children enjoying learning  together.  The Schools Development Planning service will continue to support schools in developing their plans and policies for teaching literacy and  numeracy and in setting measurable targets for the reduction of serious literacy and numeracy difficulties.</P>

	<P>A Value for Money Review of the ICT Support Service, which addressed the work of the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE), the ICT Advisory Service and specific posts assigned to the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, was undertaken by my Department and will shortly be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. While concluding that the Service is generally effective and efficient, the Report recognises that each school must plan and execute its own policy for ICT integration across the curriculum. It concludes that now, ten years on, the resources currently utilised by the ICT Advisory Service operating from the regional Education Centres would be better employed  focussing supports for ICT leadership and change within each school.</P>
        <P>There were three vacancies among the 21 ICT Advisor posts attached to the regional full-time Education Centres in June 2008 and a further post was due to be vacated following the retirement of an ICT advisor.  Of the remaining 17 posts, 14 were filled by teachers on secondment from their teaching duties and three were filled on a non-secondment contract basis.  These posts have been renewed annually.  Against this background, the Education Centres were advised by the NCTE that my Department was not prepared to renew secondment arrangements for the 14 teachers seconded as ICT Advisors. The implementation of these arrangements was discussed with the Education Centres and schools concerned and any difficulties arising in specific schools due to the return of the teachers concerned were addressed by my Department.</P>
        <P>The position in relation to the three non-seconded ICT advisor posts is that my Department authorised the NCTE to fund the relevant Education Centres to offer temporary short-term contracts for the persons concerned for the remainder of  the calendar year.  While I understand that the three persons concerned did not wish to avail of this offer, my Department is engaged in ongoing  discussions with the relevant Unions.</P>
        <P>The NCTE will continue to provide advice and support to schools on the integration of ICT into teaching and learning and will continue to provide a range of ICT continuing professional development courses for teachers.  The NCTE will work closely with the support services supported by my Department.  The role of the school&rsquo;s ICT coordinating teacher, with the support of the school principal, will be prioritised as central in the provision of ongoing ICT support and advice to teachers.  Local school-based and peer to peer support has been identified internationally as the most effective way to further ICT integration in schools.  This emphasis on &ldquo;in school&rdquo; promotion of, and support for, ICT integration in teaching and learning is consistent with the Reports of the Strategy Group, Investing Effectively in Information and Communication Technology in Schools 2008-2013, and the evaluation report  undertaken by my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate, ICT in Schools, which I published in July.</P>
        <P>The NCTE will be publishing a handbook, Planning and Implementing e-Learning in your School, for principals and ICT co-ordinating teachers. A professional development course for ICT coordinating teachers on the development of e-Learning Plans will also be available along with nationwide seminars on e-Learning for principals and ICT coordinating teachers to be run this Autumn.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) provides behaviour improvement support and advice to 62 schools nationally and special behaviour support classrooms/programmes have been established in 36 of these schools.  Behaviour support classrooms/programmes provide an individualised intensive intervention for students who are unable to abide by a school's code of behaviour.  This intervention teaches appropriate behaviours to students and also addresses literacy issues if they arise.  The core purpose of a behaviour support classroom/programme is to enable a student to access all education provision in their school.</P>
        <P>All schools with a behaviour support classroom/programme have the equivalent of two additional teachers above their allocation.

	<P>The Teaching Council is the designated statutory body for the recognition of qualifications for teaching.  A post-primary teacher in this State must hold a suitable degree and a suitable teacher-education qualification.</P>
        <P>A suitable degree is a degree or equivalent award from a State recognised university or similar third level college which is adequate to enable the holder to teach to the highest level (in the case of the majority of subjects,  this is Leaving Certificate, higher level) at least one subject from the post-primary schools curriculum.  The duration of such a degree programme must be at least three years of full-time study or equivalent.</P>
        <P>A suitable teacher-education qualification is a qualification from a State recognised university or similar third level college directed towards the 12-18 age range (First year to Sixth year). The duration of such a programme must be  at least one year of full-time study or equivalent.</P><Col N="858"/>
        <P>Recognised third level institutions can apply to have particular qualifications approved for post primary teaching.  Where granted, this approval is referred to as general recognition for teaching at post primary level. Where a third level institution has not applied for and been granted general recognition for a particular qualification, it is open to the individual to apply to the Teaching Council for recognition.</P>
        <P>The Teaching Council has informed my Department that it has not been asked to assess qualifications from Ballyfermot College of Further Education for the purposes of general recognition.  If an individual graduate or Ballyfermot Further Education College wishes to have a qualification assessed for teacher registration purposes, the individual or the College should apply to the Teaching Council and the qualification will then go through the assessment process.</P>
        <P>Access to the Postgraduate Diploma in Education is managed by the Postgraduate Diploma in Education Applications Centre in Galway www.pac.ie for the NUI colleges or Trinity College, University of Limerick and DCU directly. In all cases applicants are required to hold a degree recognised by the Teaching Council for registration purposes.</P>

	<P>Under the Small Schools Scheme, a grant of &euro;380,000 was allocated in 2007 to Loughill National School to enable the Board of Management to extend and modernise their school.</P>
        <P>The Small Schools Scheme is not intended to leave schools with significant fundraising needs, rather the terms of the Scheme require the schools to tailor the scope of capital works commissioned to the available funding.  The decision on whether to continue participating in the scheme or to drop out, if the scope of build is more than the funding envelope permits, is a matter for each school authority.</P>
        <P>A central tenet of the devolved scheme is that the school, granted discretion and funding, must equally accept responsibility for prioritisation, adherence to statutory regulations, as well as control of costs and ensuring value for money.</P>
        <P>In line with the original intention of the Small Schools Scheme, the Board of Management is required to take the necessary steps to ensure that the scope of the works undertaken <Col N="859"/>matches the funding being allowed and that the school should complete the project within the funding envelope provided.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> if he will increase the capitation grant to a school (details supplied) in County Wicklow in view of the fact that the school is running annually at a loss and parents have to continuously fundraise and pay voluntary contributions; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The scope for any increases in the capitation grant for this or any other school has to be considered in the context of Government budgetary policy and the overall economic climate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department is aware of the funding pressures on schools.  However, progress has been made in recent years that has seen the primary school capitation grant increased from &euro;81.26 per pupil in 2000 to its current rate of &euro;178.58. This represents an increase of almost 120% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 2000. This compares to a cumulative increase in the Consumer Price Index between 2000 and the end of 2007 of about 30%.</P>
        <P>In 2008 alone the Department has paid around &euro;167m to primary schools to meet their day to day running costs. The improvements mean that the combined day-to-day funding for primary schools has increased by &euro;21 to &euro;330 per pupil. As a result, a primary school with 300 pupils will receive almost &euro;100,000 to meet their running costs.</P>
        <P>Furthermore enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools. The current rates range from &euro;457.00 to &euro;880 per pupil &mdash; an increase of 42% from the rate in 2006.</P>
        <P>Voluntary contributions by parents of pupils in recognised primary schools are permissible provided it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay and that, in making a contribution, they are doing so of their own volition. The manner in which such voluntary contributions are sought and collected is a matter for school management, <Col N="861"/>however their collection should be such as not to create a situation where either parents or pupils could reasonably infer that the contributions take on a compulsory character.</P>

	<P>Data for the current school year, 2008/09, is not available as the Annual Primary School Census has yet to take place.</P>
        <P>In the school year 2007/2008, of 6,561 primary school pupils in County Monaghan, 1,276 were taught in classes of 30 or more.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The mainstream staffing schedule allocates teachers within enrolment bands and the current bands are based on an average of 27 pupils. While the schedule allocates on the basis of an average each individual school decides how to arrange its classes. This means for example that two different schools that have the same enrolment and as a result are allocated the same number of teachers may choose to configure their classes differently. Depending on a school&rsquo;s own circumstances one school may aim for a very even distribution across all class groups while another school may choose to have lower numbers in a particular class group or groups with consequently larger numbers in other classes. With over 20,000 individual classes spread across all schools  throughout the country there will always be differences in individual class sizes.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that an even distribution and splitting classes may not always be an option for a particular school, because for example there might be a large group in junior infants and a small group in sixth class and so on. But where it is possible, I believe that principals should consider the benefits of having smaller multi-grade classes as against having particularly large differences in class sizes at different levels in the school.</P>
        <P>Multi-grade classes are the norm in the majority of our primary schools given the number of relatively small schools that have 4 teachers or less and there is no evidence whatsoever that being taught in a multi-grade setting is to the detriment of the child. I think more principals should consider multi-grade classes where they are in the best interests of pupils who might otherwise find  themselves in a single grade large class.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Permanent Accommodation Scheme was introduced in 2003 to reduce the need for prefabs. It was designed to give value for money in terms of providing permanent accommodation in place of prefabs, where an accommodation need was likely to exist for a considerable length of time. Since its introduction, over &euro;100m has been allocated to schools under the scheme and it has resulted in the provision of an additional 625 classrooms and 275 resource rooms in schools around the country. This is in addition to those classrooms provided under the major capital projects managed by my Department. Had the Permanent Accommodation Scheme not been in place, a very significant proportion of those classrooms and resource rooms would have had to be provided using temporary accommodation such as prefabricated classrooms. Despite this, it will continue to be necessary for prefabricated accommodation to be provided because competing priorities mean that it will not always be possible to have a permanent accommodation solution in place in a short time-frame. My Department will continue to provide funding for such prefabricated accommodation and the decision on whether to rent or purchase will depend on the likely length of time it will be required. In all cases, the approach will be to ensure best value for money. However, it should be noted that the current school building programme which is underway is a major programme, involving an investment of almost &euro;600m in school buildings. This investment in schools includes the completion of construction work during the course of 2008 on 67 large scale building projects, the opening of 26 new school buildings in rapidly developing areas and the progression of 374 devolved projects under the Permanent Accommodation and Small Schools Schemes. This level of activity under the school building programme builds on the significant achievements under the last National Development Plan when over 7,800 building projects were delivered to provide new and modernised educational infrastructure. </P>

        <asker>Deputy Paul Gogarty</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that costs for operating a prefab at a school (details supplied) in Dublin 20 are now in the region of &euro;12,300 per month, not including heating or electricity, an extra telephone and broadband line and extra insurance and that the first ESB bill was &euro;1,400 and the second &euro;7,511; if in view of the fact that such costs, which would be typical in other schools awaiting the go-ahead for proper extensions, any cost benefit analysis has been carried out which would justify not speeding up the programme by investing upfront, thus saving schools and ultimately the Exchequer; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>A building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is at an advanced stage of architectural planning and the temporary accommodation approved for the school is required to facilitate the progression of the building project. The commencement and progression of all large scale building projects from initial design stage through to construction phase, including this project, will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s Multi-Annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the further progression of the project at this time.</P>
