	<P>Anois, iarratais chun tairiscint a dh&eacute;anamh an D&aacute;il a chur ar athl&oacute; faoi Bhuan-Ord&uacute; 32.  We will now deal with requests to move the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the renewed threat of post office closures across the country, which must be addressed by the Government in the interest of rural communities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the fact that the Taoiseach yesterday flatly contradicted the Minister for Transport&rsquo;s repeated assertions that, even in difficult economic circumstances, the necessary funding will be provided for Transport 21 projects.  This means major projects such as metro north may, as a direct result, be deferred or put on the long finger.  The truth is that cutbacks and time delays are being plotted in the Department of the Taoiseach even while progress in motion meetings on Transport 21 are being held with Members.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 13, motion on the proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Regulations 2008 &mdash; back from committee; No. 2, Legal Practitioners (Irish Language) Bill 2007 &mdash; amendments from the Seanad; and No. <Col N="590"/>23, statements on climate change.  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 13 shall be decided without debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the proposal for dealing with No. 13 agreed to?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government explained this week that a problem has arisen in respect of the Attorney General and that the amending regulation is intended to tidy up legal issues.  I listened to a discussion of environmental impact studies on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and I accept that the intent behind this is to prevent duplication in the planning process.  However, I ask the Minister to open regulations such as this to debate because obvious difficulties with this approach were identified this week.  As a result of the debate we held on this matter last week, it transpired that planning notices do not have to be published for developments of a significant size because they are exempted.  I question the approach being taken by the House on this matter and, particularly in light of the public participation directive and other matters, stress that changes to planning regulations should allow local public inputs into developments that affect communities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware that briefings were given to Opposition Members prior to the debate and a full and frank discussion was held with the Minister.  He offered to remain with the committee for as long as necessary.  All the issues have been dealt with and there has been absolute clarity regarding the matters raised here last Thursday.  As it was agreed by the committee that it would revert to the House with a recommendation, I do not see the necessity for further discussion on the matter.</P>
</Speaker>
        <P>Question, &ldquo;That the proposal for dealing with No. 13 be agreed to&rdquo;, put and declared carried.</P>
      
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I will start with a two mark question for the T&aacute;naiste.</P>

	<P>Thank you.  Does the T&aacute;naiste agree with the statement by the Minister for Finance that the construction industry in this country has come to a shuddering halt?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That question is not on the curriculum.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am left to put questions to his deputy, the T&aacute;naiste.  I wanted to ask whether she agreed with the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Will these be subject to scrutiny and will they be referred to committees?  The only one we know of for certain is the Department of Social and Family Affairs&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That issue is being debated next week.  Deputy Kenny is not in order.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="592"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;where there is a huge increase expected and no cutbacks unlike the Departments of the unfortunate Ministers sitting on either side of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P>Will the T&aacute;naiste clarify the situation in regard to the Supplementary Estimates?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The House will debate that issue next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">A report in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> states that the Health Service Executive will propose to Government a change in the legislation on health.  The T&aacute;naiste will recall that in November 2004, the Minister for Health and Children stated during discussions on the Health Bill that the change being proposed to amalgamate 11 health boards was a once in a generation move that would bring about an efficient, professional best practice health service.  As Deputy Reilly and others on this side of the House have pointed out this is not the case.</P>
        <P>Is that report, which states there will be a change in the legislation to provide for a return to devolved managers on a regional basis, correct?  When are we likely to see this legislation which is not included on the list of proposed legislation for this session?</P>
        <P>I draw the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s attention to a letter given to me by Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett in respect of funding for persons with disabilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is completely out of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not.  I will explain to the Ceann Comhairle the reason it is not out of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is completely out of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Barrett was informed that the Department of Health and Children approved an allocation of &euro;50 million for disability residential, respite and day services for 2008.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is completely out of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Barrett has also been informed by the HSE that approval has not yet been received for the commencement of these developments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If Deputies want to change Standing Orders they are quite entitled to do so.  I must implement Standing Orders as they stand.  Deputy Kenny is not in order.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter was sorted yesterday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>This affects not alone Deputy Barrett and his constituents but services throughout the country.  I want to know if this &euro;50 million is guaranteed and has been ringfenced for the provision of services for the people whom Deputy Barrett and others have mentioned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is not in order.  I call the T&aacute;naiste to respond to the question relating to the legislation on health.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm this is the case?</P>

        <P>I am surprised at the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s response to Deputy Kenny in respect of the report in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> that it is intended the HSE will devolve into a regional arrangement.

	<P>Is it the intention of the Government to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families?  The other matter I wish to mention is one about which I have asked two parliamentary questions.  Is it the Government&rsquo;s intention to legislate in the area of collective bargaining, given that the 1948 ILO convention establishes that right?  The reply to one of my parliamentary questions was that it was a matter for social partnership, but in the other reply it was stated that the Government had in fact ratified the convention in 1955.  Does the Government propose to clarify the issue of collective bar<Col N="601"/>gaining in terms of the ILO conventions of 1948 by way of legislation?  The first question was related to the United Nations International Convention on the Protection of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families.  The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s predecessors suggested the Government did not intend to recognise it, yet it is the only way to establish a basis that would assure all workers in the State equality and protection of their rights.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I will have to communicate with the Deputy on the issue of migrant workers as I do not wish to mislead him.  The issue of collective bargaining is being discussed by the social partners.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it the ILO convention is not being implemented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>We must await the outcome of discussions with the social partners before a final decision is made on a number of pertinent issues.  I do not wish to pre-empt the outcome.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Speaking of Green Party Ministers, a newspaper report today suggests the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, may wish to shift the incinerator from his own constituency to Rathcoole in the constituency I share with his colleague, Deputy Gogarty, and the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Curran.  This application got in under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act which was opposed by the Labour Party.  The Act is surely in breach of the public participation directive which has been promised but which has not yet been transposed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We must discuss promised legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that people have a genuine say in issues such as this.  These matters should not be at the whim of a Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware that legislation is promised but I will communicate with the Deputy if there is to be transposition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a number of points to raise on legislation.  When will we see the Health Information Bill?  Yesterday we were promised a health study of Cork Harbour.  It would be useful if the Health Information Bill was published in order that it could be discussed with the study.  Given the pollution in Cork Harbour from the Irish Steel plant, it is important to bring forward the Foreshore (Amendment) Bill in order that the issue can be discussed in the context of the Bill.  </P>
        <P>I understand the environmental liability directive has not yet been signed or brought forward by the Government and that it will probably take legislation in the House to do so.  There are proceedings against the State in this regard.  The 1998 Aarhus Convention provides information on these issues.  Therefore, when will the matter be addressed?  The Minister yesterday promised reports on research at Haulbowline but we have not seen them.  Will the T&aacute;naiste please remind him to forward them to us?</P>
        <P>Are there plans to change the position of the CEO of the HSE as Accounting Officer?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Information Bill will come before the House next year.  I indicated last week that no date had been finalised for the Foreshore (Amendment) Bill.  I will have to revert to the Deputy on the other issues, directives and conventions because I do not have the full information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle knows I always obey his rulings.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="602"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am interested in the basis for the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s ruling today that it is not in order to ask questions about matters of legitimate public interest concerning Supplementary Estimates for Departments.  The nation is consumed by the mismanagement of this Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government which must now find &euro;500 million through savings, adjustments, cutbacks or whatever one wishes to call them.  It is a matter of legitimate political interest to inquire as to which Departments will have to produce Supplementary Estimates.  I am interested in the basis of the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s ruling that it is not in order to ask a question about this.  To which Standing Order does he refer?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The one in question is Standing Order 26(3) which is quite specific.  It states a question may be raised on promised business.  This applies equally to the introduction of a Supplementary Estimate and the seeking of a debate.  In other words, it must be promised.  The same applies to secondary legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a sure thing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If the item is not promised, it is not in accordance with Standing Orders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>But it is promised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not my decision, but that of the Members of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>I beg to differ with the honourable Member from south Kerry who now sits in a high position.  The precedent during the years in the House has been that if legislation or business is promised, either inside or outside the House, it is a legitimate matter for questioning here.</P>
        <P>I recently heard the Minister for Social and Family Affairs on &ldquo;News at One&rdquo; tell the nation that there would be no cutbacks in her Department and that the pinch would be felt by other Departments.  I have heard promises of &euro;500 million of cutbacks, savings, adjustments or whatever one may wish to call them from the Minister for Finance who says he is in the unfortunate position of being in that Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a matter of business promised inside and outside the House and I beg to differ with the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s interpretation of Standing Order 26(3).  We have been told that the Government must make &euro;500 million of savings and cutbacks, which means Department after Department will have to take out the cleaver and decide on the areas for the chop and where Supplementary Estimates will have to be introduced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.  We need to know about this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Pure speculation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to know what scrutiny and committees the Supplementary Estimates will face.  This is legitimate business that was promised outside the House and referred to inside it.  I beg to differ with the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to argue with the Deputy because we can discuss the matter later if he wishes but promised business must be specific, not a generalisation, for <Col N="603"/>example, on the state of the economy.  If we allowed general business to be discussed, we would have no parameters to guide us.  I must obey Standing Order 26(3).</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I again respectfully differ with the Ceann Comhairle as this matter is specific and refers to &euro;500 million of savings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be a debate on the issue next week.  If Members wish to change Standing Orders, they are entitled to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>This comes down to the fact that people who must fork out &euro;1,000 for home heating oil and so on or must seek home help hours will face the frontline cuts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We must move on.  We cannot debate the matter now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government will hide all this behind the reorganisation of the HSE.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Who will organise all this?  The Government needs the authority of the House to do it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Health and Children referred to an operational move.  There will be &euro;500 million of cutbacks and I want the T&aacute;naiste to respond.  This is specific promised business that was referred to in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy knows well that the issue will be debated next week.  Are Supplementary Estimates promised?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>For clarity, I will point out that the process is as follows.  The Government will make its decisions on Tuesday.  There will be a debate on all these issues in the House on Wednesday and Thursday for nine and a half hours.  There are no proposals to introduce Supplementary Estimates to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Following the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s clarification, may I ask her whether there is any truth in the references to the Government&rsquo;s need for &euro;500 million of savings to be made?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter did not arise from Government sources.  It is prudent and proper for the Cabinet to make its decisions on Tuesday.  It will be fully informed of the decisions that must be made by the Minister for Finance and the outcome will be discussed in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Do we live in the real world?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter of &euro;500 million was raised by the man sitting next to the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Finance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kenny is out of order.  I do not want to take the unprecedented step of asking the Leader of the Opposition to leave the House but if I must, I will.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am here to defend the rights of the people and will do so. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be a debate on the issue next week.  The T&aacute;naiste has clarified the position and I have clarified the rules but the Deputy will not accept this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste has not clarified the position.  I seek a final clarification from her.  Did I hear of and read yesterday a statement from the Department of Finance?  Did the Minister for Finance tell us on television that there was a &euro;1.5 billion deficit in Government <Col N="604"/>income at this point in the year?  Did I hear that this would require adjustments, savings, cutbacks or whatever one may wish to call them?  Will these cutbacks be due to the extent of the deficit?  Will the Government deal with the deficit through adjustments, cutbacks and Supplementary Estimates?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the issue.  The issue is whether Supplementary Estimates have been promised.  Have Supplementary Estimates been promised?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>No Supplementary Estimates have been promised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the end of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, how can there be a &euro;500 million cut in spending without Supplementary Estimates?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is 11.10 a.m. and there is a debate on the issue next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Supplementary Estimates will be necessary to seek authority.</P>

	<P>I must implement Standing Orders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to speak briefly on the same point.  The D&aacute;il votes very specific amounts of money for Estimates.  Can Ministers arbitrarily move money provided in the Estimates to other Departments or between headings in their own Departments?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>These issues will be covered in the debate next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>What power does the D&aacute;il have regarding Estimates?</P>
      </Speaker>

        <P>To summarise, a slight technical problem was raised by Deputy O&rsquo;Shea.  I want to refer to the technical aspect.  The problem was that there was a requirement to have passed an Irish exam showing one had reached a standard of Irish to the satisfaction of the Chief Justice.  The amendment provides that everybody who has completed the relevant course in advance of the enactment of the new legislation being finalised today will be deemed to have passed the Irish test.  That is the nub of the issue.  Deputy O&rsquo;Shea called for this reasonable provision to be made.  If it is not accepted, some will be in no-man&rsquo;s-land.  The two amendments made in the Seanad deal with the issue in a reasonable way.  It does not arise in the case of solicitors.  My understanding is that nobody was refused entry in seeking to be a solicitor because he or she had failed the Irish exam and that this is a matter solely for those who have finished their course.  The amendment attempts to deal with the issue raised by Deputy O&rsquo;Shea.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>Climate change is the biggest challenge facing humanity.  Global warming threatens not just our quality of life but the very survival of the planet and all who live on it.  If it is allowed to continue unchecked, the sheer scale of potential disruption and destruction of people and the environment is almost beyond comprehension.</P>
        <P>In recent years scientific research has been profound.  Last year the research was collated and presented in the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC.  All countries have recognised that the report represents the most comprehensive and authoritative assessment of climate change to date and provides an integrated scientific, technical and socio-economic perspective on relevant issues.  The research has found that climate change has been caused by man-made emissions and that if these emissions continue to grow, they will have potentially catastrophic effects throughout the globe by the end of this century.</P>
        <P>Some of the key findings  are truly shocking and worth recalling.  Climate change is unequivocal.  There is very high confidence that the net effect of human activities since 1750 has been one of warming.  Global total annual greenhouse gas emissions from human activities have risen by 70% since 1970.  Concentrations of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, now far exceed the natural range in the last 650,000 years.  Global temperatures have increased by 0.74&deg; since 1906 and our current emissions alone have built-in approximately another 0.5&deg; of an increase.  Of the past dozen years 11 ranked among the 12 warmest since 1850.  The pace of sea-level rise increased from 1.8mm per year in 1961 to 3mm per year in 2005.  Temperatures are likely to rise by between 1.1&deg; and 6.4&deg; Celsius, and sea levels by between 18 centimetres and 59 centimetres this century.  Human-induced global warming could lead to impacts that are &ldquo;abrupt or irreversible&rdquo;.  There is high confidence that by mid-century many semi-arid areas such as the Mediterranean basin and the western United States will suffer a decrease in water resources.  Between 75 and 250 million people in Africa may experience water stress by 2020.  Almost one third of plant and animal species will be at increased risk of extinction if global temperatures increase by 1.5&deg; to 2.5&deg; Celsius from late 20th century levels.  If temperature increases exceed 3.5&deg;, between 40% and 70% of species may be at increased risk of extinction.  Consequently, it is essential that carbon dioxide emissions peak within less than ten years.  Global CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions must be reduced by 50% to 85% relative to 2000.  This would limit global warming at 2&deg; to 2.4&deg; <Col N="610"/>Celsius above pre-industrial levels and thereby reduce significantly the number directly affected by climatic stresses.</P>
        <P>It is possible to take action, despite the enormity of the scale of such findings.  The IPCC has also stated there is substantial economic potential for the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions in coming decades which could offset the projected growth in global emissions, or reduce emissions below current levels.</P>
        <P>Another finding is that addressing climate change is affordable.  The macro-economic cost of stringent mitigation would be equivalent to global GDP being 3% lower in 2030 than it would be if no mitigation measures were undertaken.  This is equivalent to a reduction in the annual global GDP growth rate of 0.12%.  If we take such measures, we will delay reaching the same level of GDP in 2030 by less than 12 months.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland is not immune from climate change.  The recent research report by Met &Eacute;ireann outlined a number of predicted impacts.  Our climate will continue to warm with possible increases of 3&deg; to 4&deg; Celsius towards the end of the century, resulting in wetter winters and drier summers.  These changes in precipitation and temperature are likely to increase the risk of flooding in winter and reduce water supplies in summer.  Sea levels around Ireland are rising by 3.5 cm per decade and the frequency of intense cyclones affecting Ireland is likely to increase.  Ocean modelling suggests a consequent increase in the frequency of storm surge events around Irish coasts.</P>
        <P>The European Union has based its international strategy on climate change on this scientific background.  If we are to prevent the worst impacts of climate change, the Union wants to ensure the global temperature does not rise by more than 2&deg; Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the next century.  The only way this can be achieved is through very significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, primarily in developed countries.  The Union&rsquo;s objective is to stabilise global emissions within the next decade or so and, by 2050, cut them by at least 50% below 1990 levels.  Developed countries must continue to lead by reducing their emissions in the order of 30% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels with a view to collectively reducing their emissions by 60% to 80% by 2050.  This will keep us on track towards the 2&deg; Celsius target and is consistent with the IPCC findings.</P>
        <P>Efforts by industrialised countries alone will not suffice.  Developing countries, particularly emerging industrialising economies, must be encouraged to reduce the emission intensity associated with their economic growth.  This would require new incentives and flexible commitments, in addition to further transfer and deployment of climate-friendly technologies, as part of a new international agreement.</P>
        <P>Between now and the UN climate conference in Copenhagen in December 2009, there will be an opportunity for the global community to act on climate change.  The European Union is determined to demonstrate a leadership role in the UN negotiations.  Last year, the European Union set out its aims for a comprehensive and fair international agreement to come into force by the end of 2012.  The Union is willing to reduce its emissions by 30% by 2020 compared to 1990 as part of an effective international agreement.  It expects other industrialised countries to take on similarly ambitious reduction targets so developed countries as a whole will reduce their emissions by 30% by 2020.</P>
        <P>The European Union is determined to demonstrate that this scale of reduction is achievable and that it, the Union, is committed to transforming its economy into a low-carbon economy.  As a result, it made an independent commitment to reduce its own emissions by at least 20% by 2020, which it is willing to increase to 30% as part of an effective international agreement.</P><Col N="611"/>
        <P>The European Union played a pivotal role and provided global leadership at the UN climate change conference last December in Bali in Indonesia.  That conference set out a path to reach an international agreement on a par with the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.  It established a negotiations roadmap on how we are to reach that new international climate change agreement.  That, in itself, was a significant victory, bringing reluctant developed nations such as the United States together with developing countries to reach agreement on the best way forward.</P>
        <P>For the first time in over a decade and a half, all countries, both developed and developing, are negotiating new commitments for all to take action to address climate change.  This represents remarkable progress by the global community.  If we look back just four years, we will note the global picture was much bleaker.  The United States had already rejected the Kyoto Protocol.  The protocol itself had not even entered into force as an insufficient number of countries had ratified it.  Only the leadership demonstrated by European Union brought us to the current position.</P>
        <P>The UN conference launched formal negotiations among the 192 parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, on action up to and beyond 2012.  These formal negotiations will involve the United States, which is a party to the UNFCCC but not to the Kyoto Protocol.  The conference set out a roadmap to guide the negotiations, which includes the key building blocks of a future agreement.  These are enhanced mitigation of climate change by limiting or reducing emissions; enhanced adaptation to climate change; action on technology development and transfer; and the scaling up of finance and investment to support mitigation and adaptation.</P>
        <P>The Bali agreement acknowledges explicitly the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&rsquo;s recent fourth assessment report, emphasises the urgency of addressing climate change and recognises that deep cuts in global emissions will be required to reach the convention&rsquo;s objective of preventing dangerous levels of climate change.  At the European Union&rsquo;s insistence, it also makes reference to a section of the report that demonstrates that emissions reductions for developed countries in the range of 25% to 40% below 1990 levels by 2020 are required to limit global warming to 2&deg; Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</P>
        <P>Enhanced action to mitigate climate change will be a key focus of negotiations.  The roadmap envisages commitments or actions by developed countries, including quantified objectives for limiting and reducing emissions.  Developing countries will also take action, but in their case no reference is made to quantified emissions objectives.</P>
        <P>In parallel with these negotiations under the climate change convention, the parties to the Kyoto Protocol will continue negotiations already under way on new post-2012 emissions targets for developed countries that are in the protocol.  The negotiations under both tracks, that is, the convention and protocol, will be completed at the UN climate change conference to be held at the end of 2009 in Copenhagen.  The European Union and many other parties insisted on this simultaneous deadline to ensure a coherent result.</P>
        <P>This provides the global political and scientific background for the publication of the climate and energy package by the Commission at the start of this year in response to a request by the member states&rsquo; Governments.  It is important to recall that the full climate and energy package encompasses more than measures pertaining to greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition to including proposals on climate, the package includes measures to increase the use of renewable energy, to enhance energy efficiency, to provide a regulatory framework to stimulate carbon capture and storage technology and to amend state aid rules to support environmental actions.  The aim of the package is to reduce the European Union&rsquo;s dependence on fossil fuel, to enhance the competitiveness of the European economy, and to reduce European greenhouse gas emissions.  The energy and climate measures mutually support the attainment of these goals.</P><Col N="612"/>
        <P>The revised emission trading scheme, ETS, and the effort-sharing proposals specifically set out how the European Union will achieve its independent target of 20% below the 1990 level by 2020.  To achieve this 20% target, the European Union needs to cut its 2005 emissions by 14%.  The 14% reduction is achieved by two separate but linked measures, namely, the revision of the ETS and the effort-sharing proposals.  Under the revision of the ETS, the energy and industrial sectors have an EU-wide cap that is to reduce ETS emissions to 21% below 2005 levels by 2020.</P>
        <P>The basic principle for the allocation of allowances is auctioning as this is the most transparent process and eliminates windfall profits.  Industries that are subject to international competition from outside the European Union will be subject to special treatment, including the possibility of free allocation of allowances.  The European Commission will report on &ldquo;carbon leakage&rdquo; by 2011 with appropriate proposals, as necessary.</P>
        <P>Under the effort-sharing proposal, there was a need to take into account the wide divergence of wealth in the EU 27.  As a result, the Commission used GDP <i>per capita</i> as a criterion for differentiating between member states&rsquo; ability to pay for the necessary actions within the limitations of -20% and +20% targets.  In this context, a reduction target of -20% was proposed for Ireland as a function of our high GDP <i>per capita</i>.  The Commission proposal has included flexibilities in terms of how a member state can meet its commitments without undermining the level of ambition of the climate and energy package and ensuring significant action is taken within the European Union.</P>
        <P>Naturally, the proposals raise serious economic and social issues for Ireland and a detailed analysis of the elements of the package is ongoing in the relevant Departments.  Given the scale of the implications of the proposals for the citizen, it is important that decisions on the elements of the package be seen to arise from a fair and transparent process.  However, it is important to reiterate that the Government fully supports the targets agreed by the Heads of State and Government at the European Council meeting in the spring of 2007 to reduce the European Union&rsquo;s emissions by at least 20% by comparison with 1990 levels by 2020 and by 30% as part of a global comprehensive agreement.</P>
        <P>Ireland is playing its part, at national level and within the European Union, but also in supporting international efforts to achieve consensus on a comprehensive global response to climate change.  The Ireland National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012, published last year, sets out the measures by which Ireland will meet its Kyoto Protocol commitments, and how these measures will position us to achieve further significant emission reductions in the period beyond 2012.  Since taking office, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has taken a number of additional steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</P>

	<P>As Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, I sought this debate some months ago and the day eventually has arrived.  Without showing any disrespect towards the Minister of State, who is new to the Department, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should show his face and contribute to this debate.  One reason for such a debate is to try to raise the profile of one of the most serious problems that faces mankind today and in the future.  The world cannot continue to emit greenhouse gases on the present scale without realising the consequences for future generations.  At present, some parts of the world are suffering droughts, starvation, disease and other chronic health problems and envisage no solutions to them unless developed regions, such as the European Union, lead the way by taking steps, first to stall the ongoing rise in greenhouse gases and thereafter to proceed with steps to reduce drastically their levels over the next 50 years.</P><Col N="613"/>
        <P>We cannot continue to ignore what is happening around us in the world today.  Recently, the head of the World Bank has predicted that 3.5 million children will die this year of malnutrition.  Huge energy prices make it more expensive to transport food from the places where it is grown to the places where those who are starving live.  If any sense of humanity is left in us, we cannot ignore the prediction of the head of the World Bank that 3.5 million children will die this year.  While Ireland may have its own problems regarding current budget deficits and other economic problems facing it, they pale into insignificance in the face of the possibility of such a large number of children dying before one&rsquo;s eyes.  One should consider the amount of concern that is expressed, and rightly so, regarding illnesses that affect children in Ireland and no money is spared in trying to save the life of a single child.  While this is how it should be, we close our eyes and ears to the estimate that 3.5 million children will die of malnutrition this year.</P>
        <P>Members are aware that lack of food weakens people&rsquo;s resistance to infectious diseases and poor countries lack adequate health systems to deliver the medicines that could prevent some deaths and reduce suffering.  The increased demand in countries such as Ireland for sophisticated health care systems draws doctors and nurses from poorer countries to those which have higher incomes available to them.  For example, in recent times Zambia has trained 2,500 doctors.  Today however, only 600 of them work in the country in which they were trained.  Similarly, while only 1,000 doctors work in Ghana, in New York City alone, 600 Ghanian doctors are in practice.  Not alone does a problem exist in respect of climate change, the ongoing effects of starvation and so on, but trained professional personnel to deal with the illnesses arising from these changes are lacking.  This problem also applies to nurses.  In Ireland, one only needs to look around one to see the number of professional nurses from abroad working throughout the health services.  However, every time we take a nurse from the Philippines or wherever, it means the system in the Philippines has been left without a nurse who trained and qualified there.  While all these people are welcome in Ireland, it is enormously difficult to deal with problems facing Third World and developing countries because of such ongoing facts and statistics.</P>
        <P>In the short time available to me, I will refer briefly to the present position in respect of climate change and Ireland&rsquo;s targets in this regard.  Members are aware that after the Kyoto conference in 1997, it was agreed the EU would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 8% below 1990 levels.  Ireland was given a target of plus 13% because of the developing nature of its economy.  As the volume of emissions produced by Ireland in 1990 was 54 million tonnes, the target set for Ireland to achieve amounts to 61 million tonnes.  I have seen recent figures from the Environmental Protection Agency for 2005 in which our emissions had increased to 70 million tonnes.  Consequently, we have greatly exceeded the target set for us.  I fear that given the present rate of progress as seen by members of the aforementioned joint committee, if matters continue as they are, there is little chance of Ireland achieving its target of plus 13%.</P>
        <P>Lest anyone believes that failure to reach the target means no more than that, failure to so do will cost Ireland a great deal of money.  At a time when Ireland&rsquo;s health service and other important services are being reduced because of a shortage of money, it would be an absolute scandal to spend a considerable amount of money as a consequence of failing to reach our targets because of our inability to deal with a problem such as greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
        <P>The main problems facing Ireland in respect of greenhouse gas emissions are centred around three main areas.  Agriculture, energy production and transport account for approximately<?oasys _jy ?>28%, 23% and 20% of our emissions, respectively.  The problematic growth area for Ireland is transport and emissions from that sector have grown by 260% since 1990.  Urgent measures must be taken in the transport area to deal with the continuation of such growth in its emissions.  I suggest to the Minister of State that the Government should instruct the CIE group to bring forward, by year end, an investment plan for public transport that would have the effect of <Col N="614"/>reducing overall transport emissions by 50% by 2020.  The CIE group should be as brave in its level of ambition as has been the ESB group in respect of energy production.</P>
        <P>As for the issue of transport, what we have done or failed to do is an absolute scandal.  I do not object to investment in new road structures because it makes roads safer, reduces costs, traffic jams and so on.  In addition, however, we should have been and should be investing considerable sums of money in a proper rail service that will transport both people and goods.  It would make basic common sense to divert many heavy vehicles carrying various materials from the roads on to rail.</P>
        <P>As for public transport, it has been demonstrated that people have responded where the service is available.  People in the Dublin region are fortunate to an extent because they have Luas, a DART system and a decent bus service.  Unfortunately, however, the number of buses that are available for people is insufficient and for as long as this position is maintained, people will use private cars to travel.  I believe there is need for radical thinking in this regard and the Dublin transport authority, when it is up and running, should be to the forefront in making such necessary changes.</P>
        <P>As I said earlier, people will use public transport if it is available to them but if someone is living three or four miles from a DART or Luas line or a quality bus corridor it can be difficult to gain access to that service.  Some imagination is needed in that regard and one suggestion is to have a link up service between, say, a quality bus corridor and a Luas and DART system.</P>
        <P>For years we have been speaking about an integrated ticketing service yet after six years of examination and investing approximately &euro;13 million we have yet to see that service.  It does not make sense that people cannot hop onto a DART or a bus and get to their destination using one ticket.  In the age of modern technology surely it is not beyond the expertise of men to come up with a system that would allow that to happen.</P>
        <P>Cycling is becoming more popular but to cycle on our roads we need proper and safe cycle lanes.  Some of the existing cycle lanes are an excuse for cycle lanes and are quite dangerous.  In some areas it is impossible for a bus or a car to stay out of a cycle lane because the road is so narrow.  It is a foolish exercise to install cycle lanes that are not safe yet local authorities are widening footpaths without allowing for proper cycle lanes.  That does not make sense to me.</P>
        <P>We talk about promoting cycling holidays and so on, both from a health point of view and to improve our economy, yet if someone wants to travel with their bicycle on a train it becomes an impossibility.  Thirty or 40 years ago one could put one&rsquo;s bike in the guard&rsquo;s van of the train and get from A to B.  Allowing someone to put their bike on a train to go on a cycling holiday around Kerry should be a basic facility in this day and age.</P>
        <P>In countries like Copenhagen taxis are fitted with a device on the rear capable of taking two, three or four bicycles.  If someone wants to cycle to work in the morning but the weather turns bad, as it is today, and they do not want to cycle home, they simply call a taxi, put their bicycle on the back and away they go.  These measures will not cost huge amounts of public investment but they make basic common sense.</P>
        <P>Action in this area must be led by the Government, the Minister for Transport and other Ministers.  If they do not lead in this area, show example and call in the taxi regulator and other bodies, including the CIE group chairman and so on, and insist this will happen, we will continue talking about this problem of climate change and energy security and boring people to death because nothing is happening.</P>
        <P>It is a simple measure to sign up to targets; it is another thing to achieve them.  If the Minister intends to sign up to targets he better be sure he knows what he is doing in terms of what it <Col N="615"/>will cost this country, the way we will do it and when we will do it.  We must deal with the simple issues such as the few I have outlined, and there are many more, which I am sure speakers following me will give examples.  Many actions can be taken that will not cost vast sums of money if there is proper political leadership.  That is a matter for Government, and it is a matter for us to highlight these issues to ensure Government can take action.</P>
        <P>As well as dealing with the targets to 2012, we must also examine the European Commission&rsquo;s proposals, following on the Heads of Government agreement of 2007, to reduce greenhouse gases by a further 20% for the period 2012-20.  I should point out that this Government, along with other Heads of State, has said that if there is international agreement, that 20% will increase to 30%.  It is very easy to refer to 20% and 30% but how will that be achieved, given that our main problem areas are agriculture, energy production and transport?  Where will we find those savings?  Time is not on our side, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry about that.  I will not be too much longer.</P>
        <P>I suggest that a consultation process should begin in the next three to six months and a new climate change strategy be agreed.  It is important also that we communicate better with the public regarding the need for change in our habits in terms of dealing with our household waste, and also in businesses.</P>
        <P>In dealing with the matter of cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for agriculture, I suggested in the committee recently that before we delve into reducing our cattle herd it is important that a serious debate take place, not alone in Ireland but within the EU, on the role of Ireland as the producer of quality food for the future.  We are living in an era where there is a shortage of food and food is highly priced.  The European Union can decide how it will distribute the cuts I have spoken about, and Ireland must play its part.  It would be simple to do that.  Cutting the herd would reduce the methane gas emissions but that would reduce the amount of food available at a time when prices are increasing and there is a shortage of food.  Before we rush into that, the Government should insist that proper debate takes place on the way those cuts are distributed among member states.  If Ireland is to be a food producer in the future, there should be recognition of our particular circumstances.  That is vitally important.</P>
        <P>Before we sign up to a final agreement, part of our negotiations with the EU must focus on the way we intend to deal with the area of agriculture and the role Ireland has to play in agriculture in providing food in the future for the European Union and the rest of the world.  We cannot ignore that food prices have escalated, that there is a grave shortage of food and that the population of the world has increased from 3.6 billion in the 1960s to approximately 6 billion today, and that it may rise to 9 billion.  People must be fed and as I told the House earlier in the debate, the head of the World Bank estimates that 3.5 million children will die of starvation this year because of malnutrition.  We cannot ignore reality.</P>
        <P>Before we finalise our agreement we must examine and audit the effect of these cuts in terms of jobs and business.  We must plan for the future before any final agreement is reached.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the first opportunity to speak in the House about climate change under the portfolio of this Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and it is disappointing that he is not present for the debate.  It is surprising also because <Col N="616"/>the Green Party and the Minister, Deputy Gormley, have made climate change the main plank of their participation in Government.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Climate change is a vital issue.  It is welcome that it is on the agenda in a way that was not the case before the Green Party got into Government.  It is an issue we must address and there are steps we could take that would be of benefit to us as a society and an economy but the way the Minister is using this issue is detrimental to what he should be about, namely, protecting our environment.  There have been no reductions in emissions, and the Minister is not planning on there being actual reductions in emissions up to 2012 when this Government&rsquo;s terms in office will end.  Everything the Minister is doing is on the surface; there is not substance to it.  It is all about appearances, public relations and spin.  It started with the carbon budget, which was not a carbon budget at all.  In that carbon budget the Minister admitted &mdash; what else could he do &mdash; that for the next five years the way we will achieve our carbon reductions is by purchasing carbon credits.  There will be no reduction of carbon emissions while the Greens are in Government.</P>
        <P>The latest report from the EPA about carbon emissions in Ireland showed that they are increasing.  Carbon emissions increased from 2005 to 2006.  There was a marginal decrease shown, but that was because of the closure of Moneypoint.  In fact, there was no reduction in emissions.  For example, there was a considerable increase in transport emissions.  There has been a 165% increase on the 1990 transport emissions, with road transport accounting for 97% of the transport sector emissions.  There is no way we will reduce our emissions in line with the Kyoto Protocol.  There is no way we will reach the EU targets to which the Minister wants us to sign up for 2020, if we carry on the way we are going.</P>
        <P>There is no fast-tracking of public transport.  In fact, buses are being forced off the road.  Dublin Bus has been made take buses off routes in Lucan, Swords and Blanchardstown.  Private bus companies have withdrawn their services because they cannot operate under the current licensing system.  The Department will not allow Dublin Bus put extra buses on the road.  It is turning down Dublin Bus applications, for example, to provide extra buses for my area of Lucan at peak hours.  This is the type of initiative that would reduce our carbon emissions and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is just sitting back and doing nothing about it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One cannot question the Minister on his policies on climate change because if one does, he makes one out to be in favour of climate change.  If one raises the many complex issues involved such as whether it is good for the environment and whether it will affect people who are not wealthy, the Minister just laughs them off and makes one out to be somehow colluding in climate change.</P>
        <P>Recently the Minister publicised a climate change survey which his Department carried out.  He highlighted that 90% of people thought climate changed needed to be dealt with, but he did not disclose, until I tabled a number of parliamentary questions and emailed him, that when the public were asked, for example, were they in favour of an 8% increase on car fuel, a 10% increase on a bag of coal or 10% on a bale of briquettes, a 6% increase on a typical gas bill or an 8% increase on a delivery of home heating oil, the majority were opposed to such increases.  They were opposed because they knew they would not be fair.  Why would it be fair to jack up the price of petrol or home heating fuel when there are no alternatives provided and when one has no option but to use a car?  The public are not stupid.  Of course they want to do something about climate change and they care about the environment.  However, they want fairness and measures that really are about reducing our carbon emissions, not just stealth taxes, revenue raising measures or measures which are purely to make the Minister look like he is doing something.</P><Col N="617"/>
        <P>As I stated, this is complex.  Climate change is an extremely important issue for the world and for us in Ireland, but it is not the only issue.  We must deal with issues such as famine and poverty.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must deal with the issues here at home as well.  A considerable amount of people in Ireland live below the bread line and cannot afford fuel, for example.  The issue of fuel poverty is one which my colleague, Deputy McManus, has raised but it is not being raised by the Greens in Government.  If one applied the type of carbon taxes the Minister seems to plan, one would impact on inflation and the cost of living.  The cost of food has risen considerably in this country over the past year and people are pressed by their food bills etc.</P>
        <P>The Green Party is using climate change to mask what they are not doing in Government about the environment.  The Greens used be the party of the environment and it looks like that has been left behind.  It is not the priority it used to be for them.  Nor is quality of life.  They used be called the quality of life party.  They are not a quality of life party, quite the opposite.  They are leaving people stuck in traffic with a poor quality environment, poor quality water etc.  All of the issues the Green Party used say in Opposition were a damning indictment on the Government, a black mark on Ireland etc., are now legacy issues, according to the Minister, who absolves himself of responsibility.</P>
        <P Just="Left">No doubt environmental issues are out of control.  Of course these issues did not just arise when Deputy Gormley became Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, but he is the Minister now.  For example, habitats are important in terms of reacting to and addressing climate change, and if one makes habitats resilient and of good quality, they are better able to deal with the impacts of climate change.  A recent report by the National Parks and Wildlife Service found that of 59 protected habitats, only four, or 7%, had good status overall with the remainder either poor or bad.</P>
        <P>There is the landfill issue.  A recent ESRI report found that 80% of household waste is going to landfills and that there is a discrepancy between the stated policy of the Government and the landfill policies in place.  Ireland is in significant danger of missing its European Union targets for diverting recyclable waste from landfill, according to the EPA this year.</P>
        <P>There have been U-turns such as the one on the M3.  Recently it has been reported that vital archeological information was apparently not provided to the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government at the time about the archeology along the M3 before he gave the route the go-ahead.  What has the Minister done about that?  He has just let it go ahead.  He is not even properly protecting the national monuments.  It was protestors who really had to force the issue in the case of Rath Lugh, for example.</P>
        <P>The Minister is not stopping incineration.  He used to oppose incineration; now he is just opposed to where it is located.  What is that about?</P>
        <P>There is the issue of Haulbowline and the threat to public, marine and animal life.  It was important to the Greens that people had proper participation in environmental decisions.  Nothing has been done about that since the Greens entered Government.</P>
        <P>There is nothing being done to stop urban sprawl.  There have been no amendments to the planning Act.  There has been phenol contamination of the Cavan and Monaghan water supply.  I asked the Minister a question about that at one stage and he stated it had nothing to do with him.  It was only when I pushed it that he stated he would consider the reports and recommendations from the HSE and the two county councils.</P>
        <P>There is pollution from transport.  Noise pollution, which is bad for people&rsquo;s health, is becoming a greater issue.  There is poor water quality.  One in three water supplies tested by the EPA <Col N="618"/>were found to be of poor quality.  There is today&rsquo;s judgment about Derrybrien on the fact that proper environmental impact statements are not required in Ireland.</P>
        <P>As I stated, the Greens are not doing anything about quality of life.  If they concentrated on the environment and quality of life, they would reduce carbon emissions.  If one provided proper public transport, one would reduce carbon emissions.  Instead, the Minister is all about the targets, for which he buys credits.  He is not doing anything about people&rsquo;s quality of life and their right to good public transport, which reduces emissions and results in better quality air.  Instead, it is about changing the type of car one buys and buying bio-fuels to ease one&rsquo;s conscience.  Social justice in these matters just does not rate with the Greens.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are some small gains.  A good development is obviously the pilot scheme for the insulation of houses, although the Government slashed the greener homes scheme as soon as it came into office.  Other than that, it is tinkering around the edges on issues such as light bulbs and carbon purchases, where their view is let us pay on the double for Ministers&rsquo; travel &mdash; for their flights and then for their consciences.</P>

That is why I find it so dispiriting that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has not chosen to come into the House when this debate is being held.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, and I compliment him on his appointment, but the speech he has given contains five pages of the same old stuff and one page on policy.  We do not need to be convinced anymore.  The scientific evidence is overwhelming now about global warming.  There is consensus in this House about the importance of the issue.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security is working very well across party lines on the basis of consensus.  We do not need the material to be regurgitated anymore.  We need to see implementation of policy, including practical measures to change the way we live, work, consume energy and manage our lives in an appropriate way to ensure that we save the planet.  However, we are not getting that.  Even this debate is derisory in reflecting how the Government deals with climate change and I get the impression it does very little apart from pay lip service.  We have benign neglect from Fianna F&aacute;il and good intentions from the Green Party, which is not enough to meet the challenge.</P>
        <P>At EU level we will likely be subject to the requirement of a 30% reduction in carbon emissions by 2020.  This is a good target and one to which we ought aspire.  We are a developed country and we live in a part of the world that could be described as rich, despite the current economic recession.  We have a duty of care to the planet.  We need more than the presence of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the House to discuss what needs to be done; we need the Taoiseach.  If policy is not led from the very top, change will not happen and we will not have a chance in hell of meeting either our international <Col N="619"/>obligations or our duty of care to the planet.  I welcome the invitation that will go from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security to the Taoiseach to address it.</P>
        <P>Addressing climate change requires the type of leadership of which this country is capable.  We have seen such leadership in the past, whether it was in achieving our independence, developing our economy in the 1950s and 1960s, or creating peace in Northern Ireland.  We have done magnificent work in this country and we need the sense of urgency, understanding and leadership applied to those challenges now to address what is not just an issue for us, but a global issue.  We must address these challenges in a way which meets targets set, changes behaviour and deals with the significant issues, but is also fair.  This is the essence of sustainability.  Unless the changes are brought about in a fair way, there will be alienation, especially from those who suffer most from the changes required.  We need a fuel poverty strategy.</P>
        <P>We need to address the issue of a bio-fuels policy.  Why has the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, postponed the publication of the bio-fuels policy until the autumn and not dealt with the matter now?  We are discussing global starvation, yet the Minister does not have a policy.  The matter is put on the never never, which is rather typical of the man.  There is an urgency, importance and a centrality to this issue that cannot be ignored.  Today&rsquo;s statements on climate change in no way meet the need for a proper parliamentary debate or a proper approach from Government and I intend to pursue the matter until we get these.</P>

	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran, and I wish him well in his new office.  I believe he is more than capable of doing a fine job.  It is timely that one of the first debates he leads in the Chamber is on the issue of climate change, which affects all of us.  It is a matter which has not come to public attention lately, but has been present for several years.  One wonders, given the weather on the way into the House this morning, if we are too late in trying to tackle this problem.  There does not seem to be any sign of summer.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State outlined where we are coming from and the challenges we face.  I will talk in general terms about how it will affect us as a country and a people, and the wider context of how we address the challenges in Europe.</P>
        <P>We cannot deal with this problem in isolation.  As a relatively small country in Europe and an even smaller country in the global context, we must look for a global solution.  I commend the efforts of the European Union in trying to bring some order to what is a serious international problem.  However, the European Union cannot solve the problem on its own as it is not a European problem or an Irish problem, but a global one and it must be sorted out in the context of a global solution.</P>
        <P>It is important to refer back to the Kyoto Protocol.  The protocol was an admission and a bold effort to try to bring some order to what is a difficult problem.  It is important to make some comparisons to show how the protocol has affected Ireland and Irish industry.  When the agreement was negotiated in 1990, Ireland&rsquo;s gross national product was &euro;58 billion, but today it is &euro;145 billion, an increase of approximately 140%.  Our gross domestic product then was &euro;63 billion and in 2007 it was &euro;157 billion.  We had 83,000 cars in the country in 1990 and now we have over 170,000.  These increases and the wealth that has been created have impacted on our carbon emissions.  When we negotiated the Kyoto Protocol in 1990, we were producing 54 <Col N="620"/>million tonnes of carbon emissions.  Today, we produce in excess of 70 million tonnes.  It is easy to look back in hindsight, but one could say we got a very poor deal at the negotiations.</P>
        <P>We must be realistic and understand the current EU emissions trading scheme proposals will impact severely on the health of Irish industries if we do not take a firm hand in the negotiations.  A timescale has been set down by the European Union and the European Parliament and decisions will be taken early next year on finalising those proposals.  The Commission proposes a system of auctions as the basis of carbon allowances after 2012.  This will have a serious impact on certain Irish industries.  This proposal is not acceptable to energy intensive industries.  There is not one town or county that would not be seriously affected if the energy intensive industries were to be pushed out of business, or where the produce of those companies would be imported as a result of these proposals, and we must examine this issue seriously.</P>
        <P>Many companies are beginning to question whether they will invest here.  Many of these intensive industries require an investment timescale of five or six years and must plan in advance.  These companies need certainty and clarity now on the impact of EU plans on their investment proposals.  The also need reassurance from the Government and from the European Union that, having invested, they will get a timeframe to claw back their investments and that they will not be faced with unfair competition from overseas.</P>
        <P>Many of these companies have invested in best available technology, but are subject to competition from countries where there is no carbon constraints.  We must be careful of this and if it is not changed, the inevitable consequence of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals will be to drive energy intensive industries out of the European Union, which is not acceptable to many Members.  It makes no environmental or economic sense.  We have already seen the leakage of jobs due to the high cost of doing business not only in Ireland, but in the European Union.  Some 10 million tonnes of cement were imported into the European Union in 2007 from China alone.  We will see more and more of this unless we get our act together and come up with sound economic proposals to address these problems.</P>
        <P>Many Irish companies have invested in world class energy-efficient technologies.  In recent years the reduction of between 10% and 20% has been achieved in carbon emissions per tonne of product, which is a good sign.  I do not think the same efficiencies are being made in some of the countries we are competing with currently.</P>
        <P>Fuel and power accounts for approximately 40% to 50% of production costs in some of these companies.  In Deputy Hogan&rsquo;s constituency and my own we have a lime production plant and I spoke to the company management recently.  I was told there was between 50% and 60% energy input in production there.  The company is seriously concerned about its future if it must face competition from countries with no carbon restraints.  These people have invested significantly in updating the plant in Carlow and are building a new plant in Clare.  They would like to see a chance for fair competition.</P>
        <P>It is important to remember that if we lose business to overseas companies, apart from the loss of jobs and the loss to the economy, carbon emissions will increase.  The carbon emissions in making the product will remain but there will be additional emissions from the transport costs over the sea and sometimes halfway around the world.  These issues must be addressed and I hope the Government will take action in that regard.</P>
        <P>The deadline for the plenary amendments for the European Parliament is December and a vote is expected on 16 December.  It then goes to the European Council for decision and this will probably happen during the course of the French Presidency, which finishes at the end of the year.</P><Col N="621"/>
        <P>The question of climate change is topical and not only in Ireland.  Of late I have noticed the business sector has become increasingly interested in the topic because of the impact it will have.  It affects generation of electricity, cement and lime production, and these are industries which will be seriously affected unless we, as a Government, protect them.</P>
        <P>It is timely that the partnership process is under way and we are getting a new social partnership agreement.  The Minister and Taoiseach are very interested in securing agreement in that respect.  We face challenges in the economy with a rise in the rate of redundancies, other challenges in the labour market and a much more difficult trading environment, which threatens export growth.  How we deal with climate change must take this into account.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister and his Government to look sympathetically on the industries that will be most seriously affected by these proposals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, as well as the Minister of State present, that Fine Gael as a party is committed to playing a constructive and meaningful role in combating climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  My party and I are convinced of the need for action and we certainly do not need to be lectured in any way by people about this matter or the importance of taking initiatives to deal with a subject that is becoming more topical and important to the future development of our country and the European Union.</P>
        <P>As an example, the Fine Gael spokesman on energy matters, Deputy Simon Coveney, recently announced a proposal which submitted to the Government an idea that windfall profits can be generated from our electricity supply stations and rebalanced in the context of other measures that could be taken, such as reducing VAT.  These are the types of proposal that will come more to the fore in the next couple of years to deal with some of the measures reflective of Government and national policy in stemming the tide of increasing levels of greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
        <P>Some dramatic evidence, if we need such evidence related to the global climate, is the rapid decrease of the Arctic Sea ice cover over the past few years.  Consideration of what is happening in the Arctic and Antarctic appears to be a litmus test of how policymakers are positioned with regard to climate change.  The sea ice reaches its minimum in September each year at the end of the Arctic summer.  I read that the ice cover reached an all-time low last year when it was 23% below the previous record.</P>
        <P>We have seen in the media and our television screens that for the first time in living memory, the North-West Passage, connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans across the north of Canada, was open.  I recently read in some UK publications and newspapers articles detailing a prediction from polar scientists that the Arctic Sea ice will disappear completely this September.  If that is right, it will be the first time in human history that this section of the North Pole will have been ice-free.</P>
        <P>Often people wonder what changes taking place in climatic conditions worldwide and the melting of ice in the Arctic and Antarctic has to do with us and they believe it will not affect us.  It will affect us and the information and education process required to convince people of the need for action is urgent.  There is a necessity to convince people that a do-nothing strategy is not viable and it will have significant implications on our quality of life and how priorities will be implemented by Government in order to deal with potentially savage outturns if nothing is done to change policy.</P>
        <P>I was disappointed with the speech of Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran, in that there was no mention of the 3% average reduction per annum target for greenhouse gases over the next five years set in the programme for Government.  We have had no indication from the <Col N="622"/>Government about what policies have been implemented and the success of those which are implemented.  What is the result of the recent EPA studies with regard to reducing, or otherwise, greenhouse gas emissions as a result of Government policy?</P>
        <P>I am not surprised as the targets are completely turned around at this stage, like the programme for Government itself.  The biggest mistake the Green Party made before getting into bed with Fianna F&aacute;il was not asking the question of whether that party would respect the Green Party in the morning.  It did not ask if the Green Party would respect itself in the morning, or if Green Party supporters would respect it because the party is not achieving anything in Government related to this significant issue.  We heard so much about it from the Green Party before the general election.</P>
        <P>Now the Green Party is in Government, the devil will be in the detail, action and results of what we are achieving.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>We are doing our best.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy needs the No. 2 votes.  After one year, a fair period to see what can be done in Government, we have merely seen tinkering around the edges with no substantive change on the targets set out in print by the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Gormley, last summer.</P>
        <P>Once the Greens sacrificed their political virtue, we were told we would feel better and have a better quality of life.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, has made a substantial amount of running on the changes in VRT and motor tax rates.  These had already been announced by the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, when he was Minister for Finance in 2006, so the Minister, Deputy Gormley, had nothing to do with them.</P>
        <P>The manner in which these are being implemented has ensured, for the past six months, and three months in particular, that there has been no activity in car showrooms around the city or country in general.  People were confused, ill-informed and did not understand what was coming down the tracks on 1 July.  There will be a little spike in sales for the next couple of weeks for people who have held off but there will be a massive reduction in the amount of money coming into the Exchequer and local government fund.  We will then see how the Estimates are faring because of those bad decisions.</P>
        <P>A Government cannot be run by photo opportunity, which is what the Minister, Deputy Gormley, is trying to do.  I would not blame him for getting &euro;15 million for a campaign to inform people of the impact of climate change policy.  At the same time he slashed the greener homes fund, which provided important assistance to householders seeking to insulate their houses.</P>
        <P>Approximately 500,000 houses were built in the past seven or eight years, including 90,000 last year.  Throughout this period proper energy efficiency standards did not apply and we must now play catch-up.  Standards were an equally important issue when the Minister&rsquo;s two predecessors in the Department, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Dick Roche, were in office.  We now find that a fund available to assist people, particularly the less well-off, is being slashed at the expense of an advertising campaign to promote the Minister.</P>
        <P>The Minister will beat members of the public senseless with high cost advertising to conceal the reality that no meaningful change is taking place.  The Government, of which the Green Party is a part, committed itself to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 3% in each year of its term and by 8 million tonnes over the full five year term or 2 million tonnes nominally per annum over 2006 levels.  We have not yet heard what progress was made in the Government&rsquo;s <Col N="623"/>first year of office because it did not come within an ass&rsquo;s roar of meeting its target.  On the contrary, we are heading in the opposite direction and the Government has no chance of delivering on its environmental promises.  It is big on rhetoric and advertising campaigns telling the rest of us to make changes but low on delivery.  It has failed to deliver in areas within its control and should have put the &euro;15 million spent on the recent advertising campaign to better use.  We cannot have a Government of photo opportunities and little action.</P>
        <P>Citizens are well ahead of the Government and probably Parliament in dealing with this pivotal issue.  They understand we are breaking European law and endangering our collective future and are increasingly tuned into the action required.  According to a survey commissioned by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, almost everyone in Ireland believes the world&rsquo;s climate is changing.  The same survey shows the overwhelming majority accept that humans are responsible for climate change.  A similar majority are concerned about the issue, with three out of every ten respondents indicating they are very concerned about it.  The encouraging finding is that an overwhelming majority want Ireland to play a leading role in tackling the problem of climate change and that only one third of the population believe the Government is doing enough to address it.  More than eight in ten citizens believe it should do more.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to remind ourselves that the Green Party is in government.  The small initiatives being taken are meaningless in achieving reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.  The Green Party should examine its performance and accept it is no more than an appendix to the Fianna <?oasys _dc18- ?>F&aacute;il Party in government.  It has done nothing about the massive carbon footprint of government, the Civil Service and public service, the bus fleet and other areas within the control of the State.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P>The famous slogan used by various people during the years, &ldquo;A lot done, more to do&rdquo;, applies in this case.  Unlike other countries, Ireland is becoming the exception in the European Union in meeting our Kyoto Protocol targets.  The United Kingdom, Sweden and France are ahead of their targets, while it appears Germany, Belgium, Greece and the Netherlands will comfortably meet theirs.  Why can Ireland not meet its targets, particularly given the Green Party element of the Government?</P>
        <P>Climate change is the single biggest moral choice facing this generation.  The Fine Gael Party and the Oireachtas must ensure we take decisive action, rather than running photo opportunities and advertising campaigns to pretend we are doing something.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to speak in this important debate on climate change.  </P>
        <P>I disagree with my colleague, Deputy Hogan, on the role of the Green Party.  I commend the two Green Party Ministers, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on the magnificent work they are doing in government.  They have put climate change and the care of the environment and country at the heart of government and we should all support them.</P>
        <P>On a practical issue, I thank the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for the additional sum allocated to cleaning up Dublin Bay and improving its water quality.  This is a major investment and we have a duty to support common-sense projects which clean up the bay.  We must also constantly monitor and challenge the Dublin Port Company and its efforts to destroy Dublin Bay.  This issue, specifically flooding in Clontarf, Fairview and along the River Tolka, is linked to the climate change debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the broader issue, it is important to understand precisely what is meant by the term &ldquo;climate change&rdquo;.  It is a significant change in average weather or climate conditions.  While it <Col N="624"/>can be caused by natural factors such as variations in sunlight intensity, the term is now generally used to refer to changes in our climate due to a build up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  This build up is caused by excess emissions caused by activities such as burning fossil fuels for energy, transport and heating.</P>
        <P>Climate change is a shift in the average weather conditions that a given region experiences.  This is measured by changes in all the features we associate with the weather such as temperature, wind patterns, precipitation and storms.  Global climate change means change in the climate of the Earth as a whole and also occurs naturally, the Ice Age being an example.  The Earth&rsquo;s natural climate has always been changing.  The climate change evident today differs from previous climate change in both its rate and magnitude.  This is a key issue.</P>
        <P>The temperature on Earth is regulated by a system known as the &ldquo;greenhouse effect&rdquo;.  Greenhouse gases, primarily water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, trap the heat of the sun, preventing radiation from dissipating into space.  Without the effect of these naturally occurring gases, the average temperature on Earth would be -18&deg; Celsius, instead of the current average of 15&deg; Celsius and life as we know it would be impossible.</P>
        <P>During the past 200 years emissions of greenhouse gases due to human activities have accumulated in the atmosphere where, owing to their long life, they remain for periods lasting from decades to centuries.  As a result, since the Industrial Revolution, concentrations of carbon dioxide have increased by 30%, methane by 145% and nitrous oxide by 15%.  The cause of these increases has been human activities related to our increasingly sophisticated and mechanised lifestyle, in particular, the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas to generate electricity and in factories and cars.  In addition, we have cleared more land for human use in the past 100 years than in all of prior human history.  This has resulted in the loss of forests and wetlands which absorb and store greenhouse gases and naturally regulate the atmosphere.  In effect, by increasing the amount of these heat trapping gases, we have enhanced the natural greenhouse effect to the point where it has the potential to warm the planet at a rate never experienced in human history.  Already, the average global temperature has increased by about 0.5&deg; Celsius in the past 100 years and temperature increases in the next 100 years are expected to significantly surpass any such change in the past 10,000 years.</P>
        <P>This is a wake-up call for everyone involved in the climate change debate.  The issue extends beyond the Government and every individual must play his or her small part.  Around the world, climate change is projected to threaten the world&rsquo;s boreal forests, with an increased fire risk because of the drying climate; cause water needs to outstrip supply; cause severe water loss due to changes in evaporation and precipitation patterns; cause flood damage to low lying countries and island states, including loss of coastal land to rising sea levels; encourage the movement of tropical diseases such as malaria northward where populations have little or no immunity; and affect international trade patterns.</P>
        <P>These core issues must be addressed.  People from the Sammy Wilson school of environmentalism should wake up and smell the coffee.  Mr. Wilson, MLA, Minister for the Environment in the North, professes to know a great deal about the environment and is threatening to use the North as a dumping ground for nuclear waste.  We cannot stand idly by and allow the North to have a Sellafield mark 2.  I challenge Mr. Wilson and others who share his beliefs to examine the broader debate on climate change and the dumping of nuclear waste.</P>
        <P>I wish to focus on the impact of climate change on fisheries.  Climate change can be expected to have a significant impact on fisheries countries such as Canada and will affect both the productivity of fish populations and how they are distributed throughout lakes, streams and oceans.  Changes to water temperature, currents, water quality and food supply could all have <Col N="625"/>effects on fish populations.  Consideration should be given to this matter, particularly in the context of this week&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; debate on the fishing industry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must ensure that every interest group, citizen and Member of the Oireachtas plays their small part in the debate on climate change.  I referred earlier to flooding and the major impact it could have on Clontarf, Fairview and the River Tolka in my constituency.  It is important that we link the potential damage that could be done to the 52 acres of Dublin Bay &mdash; in which I am particularly interested &mdash; to the broader debate.</P>
        <P>I welcome the recent report compiled by CDM and partners.  This company completed an economic, amenity and environmental study of Dublin Bay, including the port area, in July 2007.  This study was intended to be the first stage in the preparation of a strategic framework plan for the Dublin Bay area that would guide stakeholders in the long-term development of this resource.  CDM and partners put forward a number of options and 75% of the submissions received in respect of them favoured the option which proposes the transfer of Dublin Port to an alternative location and the redevelopment of the port lands.  This was assisted by the active engagement of householders in the Clontarf area and by great organisations, such as Dublin Bay Watch, which have a strong interest in the outcome of this debate and a history of opposition to plans by the Dublin Port Company to reclaim further land in order to extend the port estate.  It is clear that a positive approach by Dublin City Council in favour of the option to which I refer would be broadly welcomed by those in my constituency.  It is essential that this matter be dealt with in the context of the debate on climate change.</P>
        <P>We must consider how human activity leads to the production of additional greenhouse gases.  This is an important matter.  Greenhouse gases are emitted through numerous activities.  The main greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide, CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>, which arises from the burning of fossil fuels and land use changes.  Other greenhouse gases include methane from agriculture and waste food and nitrous oxide, which mainly arises from agriculture.  Industrial gases also act as very powerful greenhouse gases but are emitted in much smaller quantities.</P>
        <P>In general, the sources of emissions can be broadly divided into two categories: energy related and non-energy related. Energy-related emissions arise from power generation, transport, industry, and buildings &mdash; via heating and other fuel use.  Non-energy related emissions arise from agriculture, forestry, land use change and waste disposal activities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome this debate.  I commend Deputy Barrett, Chairman of the Joint Committee on <?oasys _dc18- ?>Climate Change and Energy Security, who has done magnificent work during the past five or six months.  I also commend my other colleagues on that committee on the great work they are doing.  This issue relates to more than one party and people should take it on board and play their part.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Creed.</P>
        <P>I have spoken on a number of occasions in the House in respect of this issue and, therefore, I do not wish to comment on the generalities of climate change.  I will instead focus on the current EU climate-energy package.  I understand the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, is in Brussels today to deal with this matter.  I further understand that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, will also be travelling to Brussels in the coming days to discuss the same issue.</P>
        <P>The European Commission produced a climate-energy package at the beginning of this year.  The aim of this package is to reduce the EU&rsquo;s dependence on fossil fuels &mdash; mainly gas, coal and oil &mdash; enhance the competitiveness of the European economy in general and, primarily, to reduce the Union&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions.  A revised emissions trading system, ETS, within the EU and the new effort-sharing proposal specifically set out how the Union will achieve its <Col N="626"/>independent target of reducing emissions to 20% below 1990 levels by 2020.  Regardless of what the rest of the world is doing, this is a commitment we are making.</P>
        <P>In order to achieve the reduction to which I refer, the EU, as a whole, must reduce 2005 emission levels by 14%.  The latter will be achieved in two ways.  First, within the ETS, energy and industrial emitters will be subject to an EU-wide cap, through a system of, depending on the circumstances, either allocating or auctioning carbon allowances.  This will reduce emissions to 21% below 2005 levels by 2020.  The second way in which the reduction will be achieved is through the effort-sharing proposals,  Under these, member states will reduce the remaining non-traded sector emissions to 10% below 2005 levels by 2020.  This will be further subdivided among member states in a range of either plus 20% or minus 20% compared to 2005 figures.  The Commission has used GDP <i>per capita</i> as the basis for the effort-sharing targets allocated to each country.</P>
        <P>The Commission&rsquo;s proposals sound complex but that is not the case.  Put simply, large industrial concerns in Ireland &mdash; this applies to approximately 106 companies, many of which are energy generators and other major businesses &mdash; will be obliged to compete and survive within a trading environment under the ETS, where carbon will have a measurable value and where emissions allowances will have to be purchased on the open market through an auctioning system.  The remainder of Ireland&rsquo;s emissions are the responsibility of the Government.  These will have to be reduced to 20% below 2005 levels by 2020.  That will be a significant task.  The Government will be obliged to target transport, agriculture, small industry and households to achieve the reduction to which I refer.</P>
        <P>The enormity of the task is becoming clearer to people as time passes.  It will not be easy to achieve a 20% reduction in emissions by 2020, particularly when one considers that emissions from the traded sector are not included in our target.  If the ESB was to reduce all of its energy emissions with immediate effect, this would have no impact with regard to the Government&rsquo;s responsibility to honour the commitment it made in respect of emissions reductions prior to 2020.</P>
        <P>The EU climate change package is not a done deal.  I wish to raise a number of concerns.  The Government must outline to the House its priorities regarding any changes it wishes to make to the package.  It must also ensure that there is far greater clarity in respect of the transition from the free allocation of allowances to an auctioning or purchasing system for such allowances.  The latter will be applied differently to the energy and non-energy sectors.  Those in the non-energy sector require clarity as to how, between 2012 and 2020, we are going to gradually introduce an auctioning system for them.  Large emitters planning to invest millions or, potentially, billions in their operations require certainty in respect of this matter.  The Government must give priority to providing such certainty.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, and the official from the Department will be familiar with issues such as carbon leakage, which is extremely important in the context of Irish and EU economic competitiveness, permeability between the traded and non-traded sectors, the vulnerability of agriculture and the importance of ensuring that forestry &mdash; in terms of its use as a carbon sink &mdash; is factored into the equation in respect of our emissions commitments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Coveney for sharing time.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this matter.</P>
        <P>The target of a 20% reduction by 2020 is ambitious, and rightly so.  It will be extremely difficult to meet this target.  To place the matter in context, a 20% reduction would be equivalent to the total emissions produced by cars in Ireland.  It will not be easy to reach the target.  We must increase public awareness in respect of it because everyone must buy into achieving <Col N="627"/>the reduction.  Never has the slogan &ldquo;The Power of One&rdquo; been more relevant than it is in the context of each citizen&rsquo;s carbon footprint.</P>
        <P>My specific concerns in respect of this matter relate to agriculture.  At a time when the lights are going out or are being dimmed in other sectors of the economy, the future for agriculture and food production is reasonably bright.  Although we should not celebrate the current global food shortage, it does present opportunities for the industry in Ireland.  We have to perform a delicate balancing act if we are not to hamstring commercial agriculture and its capacity to meet food demands, which is a moral obligation.  If global thinking is not joined up and we reduce Ireland&rsquo;s food production, there may not be a net environmental gain because reductions here will be taken up elsewhere.  We need assurances that there will be joined-up thinking within the European Union, as well as globally, if these targets are to be met.  It is regrettable that the Lisbon treaty which sought EU competence in the area of climate change was rejected.</P>
        <P>I attended this morning&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, at which concerns were expressed about the WTO.  I am struck by the almost symbiotic relationship between what is on the table for the WTO negotiations and our objectives for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  The WTO proposals would lead to the slaughter of approximately 1 million cattle in Ireland.  To meet our aim of a 20% reduction, to which agriculture contributes 28%, a similar reduction in the national herd is envisaged.  I was alarmed to hear the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, speak about the cow and the car, while Government backbenchers remained silent.  This is a clear threat to commercial agriculture.  I am not making a special plea because if we reduce the national herd, food production will increase elsewhere on the globe.</P>
        <P>Individual farmers are more than capable of responding by offsetting carbon.  On the Continent more money is made from producing energy through anaerobic digestion of pig slurry than from pork production.  Germany and the Netherlands, in particular, are light years ahead of us in producing agricultural energy for the national grid.  We need to catch up by entering strategic partnerships with those on the Continent who have been carrying out carbon modelling.  Teagasc should build research alliances because we cannot catch up on our own and we will need international assistance in the area of research and development.  Forestry also offers opportunities for offsetting carbon but it is missing from this debate.</P>
        <P>The increased milk quota has the potential to meet global demands for dairy products.  Are we going to hamstring our processing industries by preventing them from taking up the opportunities offered by increased quotas?  This is a complex issue which calls for joined-up thinking but the national herd is not up for negotiation because the result would be the replacement of our grass-based, environmentally appropriate method of food production by intensive agricultural imports from outside the European Union and standards over which we would have little control.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a lot of sympathy for the last point made by Deputy Creed.</P>
        <P>Climate change is a global issue but we have national and international responsibilities.  As well as being a matter to be addressed in its own right, it intertwines with key issues such as the price and security of food, water and energy supplies.  Actions that address one problem, while having a deleterious impact on another, are best pursued with moderation, the obvious example being crops grown for fuel which, if pursued too aggressively, could have negative consequences for feeding the world&rsquo;s population.</P><Col N="628"/>
        <P>It is fair to say the direct impact of climate change on Ireland has been relatively small to date.  The most obvious change in the past 60 years has been our milder winters.  Mean temperatures may have risen slightly but we have not experienced extremes of either heat or cold for a long time.  Even a fortnight without rain &mdash; an Irish drought &mdash; is a rare phenomenon.  The incidence of flooding has thus far not increased.  However, climate change is more perceptible elsewhere.  The atrium of the Office of Public Works is hosting a European Environment Agency exhibition on Greenland, where a considerable impact has been registered.  The exhibition makes the point that global warming may have benefits for the native Inuit community and the region in that it allows easier access to the Arctic&rsquo;s resources, potentially increases tourism and could help to keep hunting traditions alive.  Against this, however, it may threaten species such as polar bears and change ocean circulation and weather patterns.  Given the rain outside which is only just stopping, many might welcome a little climate change.</P>
        <P>Some years ago I acquired an umbrella at Stratford-upon-Avon with Shakespearian quotations such as &ldquo;the rain it raineth everyday&rdquo;, continuity seems greater than change.  There is a great deal we do not know, however, and the safest approach to adopt is the precautionary principle.  Applied sensibly, it will also help us to conserve resources and cut costs.  Ireland must play its part, with its European and international partners, in mitigating the effects and spread of climate change by working through the Kyoto agreement and the national climate change strategy and other commitments.</P>
        <P>I will now speak about areas within the responsibility of the Office of Public Works, namely, flood risk management and energy management in public buildings in OPW ownership.  The role of the OPW, as the Government&rsquo;s lead agency in the management of flood risk, is to take on board advice and the current range of estimates coming from climate scientists in developing and implementing policies and procedures for managing the potential change and, most importantly, the uncertainty associated with these predictions.  Our biggest challenge is the uncertainty associated with the climate change scenarios being developed by climate scientists.  If we knew with confidence what was going to happen, it would be easier to make the economic and other decisions related to investment in flood protection and risk management works, development planning, etc.  Uncertainty requires the implementation of policies based on emerging scientific data and general assumptions about the impacts.</P>
        <P>Adaptability is another key challenge which is intimately linked to uncertainty.  We have to carry out the design of flood defences based on current estimates of flows.  It is necessary to make provision for anticipated climate change impacts on the design parameters, provided this approach is acceptable when measured against the costs of environmental assessment criteria, in other words, the precautionary approach.  We must also ensure the construction works we carry out are, as far as possible, adaptable at a future date to cater for anticipated changes.  The degree, cost and acceptability of this adaptability are now criteria against which the OPW assesses flood relief scheme options.  The challenge is how to apply and assess the economic viability of defence schemes in face of the uncertainty.</P>
        <P>The issue of design standards is related to the issue of uncertainty.  For example, the recently completed Kilkenny flood relief scheme was designed to provide protection against the 1% flood.  We do not know, however, what level of protection the scheme will provide in 50 years time, which works need to be planned and financed in order to maintain the design standard, or how economically viable it will be to maintain this standard.  This topic is tied into the concept of risk management, as opposed to protection measures, and adaptability.  As we move to a risk management approach in which the risk is most economically reduced and a strong emphasis is placed on adaptability of the constructed scheme to meet future changes as they emerge, the concepts of fixed design standards are outmoded in many cases.  The adoption by <Col N="629"/>the Government of the report of the flood policy review group provides the framework for the OPW to fundamentally change how we approach the issue of flood protection works.</P>
        <P>With regard to building design and management, the Government has set a target of 33% energy savings across the public sector for the period 2007-12.  As part of this commitment, the OPW is engaged in a three-pronged strategy to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and the State&rsquo;s dependence on fossil fuels.  It is embarking on a programme to convert the heating systems in approximately 20 large State buildings from their existing fossil fuel burners to biomass burners.  The biomass fuel will be in the form of wood pellets.  The estimated result is an equivalent reduction of 500,000 litres of oil per annum.  Apart from the obvious benefits of biomass, the conversion programme is intended to stimulate the native production of these fuels.  The tender process is already under way and the programme is due for completion in September.  The use of biomass in new buildings is also considered in the design process and where appropriate is being used as the energy source.</P>
      
        <P>Highly motivated and energy conscientious staff offer the single largest opportunity for zero cost energy savings across the whole building stock.  The ethos of switching off equipment when not in use, when applied across a large number of people, will lead to substantial energy savings.  Published research shows that up to 20% energy savings can be achieved from good energy housekeeping.</P>
        <P>At the central core of any energy conservation campaign is the ability to benchmark performance.  It is necessary to establish exactly where we are now and how this compares to other similar buildings.  It is then necessary to set a target for energy saving, for example, a 15% reduction in overall energy consumption or CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions and, finally, to monitor performance against the target.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>During the last three years, the OPW has installed a web-based energy monitoring system linked to all large State buildings, of which there are approximately 200 in the OPW portfolio, which monitor and record electrical and heating fuel consumption every 15 minutes.  The data can be accessed via a dedicated website.  The target is to reduce carbon emissions in each building by 15% through local energy conservation campaigns, energy workshops and close monitoring of the performance of heating and air-conditioning equipment.  Staff will be able to monitor the energy reductions in their building via the Internet site.  Two firms have been appointed for the provision of services for this campaign that started in early in 2008.  It is planned to complete the programme within two years by which time it is expected that good practice will prevail in the buildings leading to ongoing savings into the future.</P>
        <P>The scope for improving energy efficiency in new buildings is very significant.  At design stage there are key factors which can considerably improve the energy efficiency of the building over its entire lifetime with little or no additional construction costs.  With the advances in computer simulation of buildings during the past ten years, it is now possible to model accurately the energy and environmental performance of a building at the design stage.  This is achieved by modelling the effects of using different construction materials, orientations, the amount of glazing used, the insulation levels and the type of fuel used for heating and so on.</P>
        <P>The OPW has a policy of designing naturally ventilated buildings whenever possible.  Properly designed naturally ventilated buildings can use up to 66% less energy than equivalent fully air-conditioned types.  The use of computer modelling also facilitates the proper design of naturally ventilated buildings by accurately predicting airflows, internal temperatures and internal comfort conditions.  This technology is being used by the OPW to optimise energy performance in all new large building projects, including in the decentralisation programme.</P><Col N="630"/>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to say a brief word about coastal erosion and flooding which may shortly revert to the responsibility of my office.  Coastal erosion and flooding can be seen to be disruptive of coastal communities and typically occur when the gravitational pull of sun and moon coincide with spring tides and storms.  We must also take account of the slow rise in sea level.  Actions include planning controls in vulnerable areas, coastal defence works, better warning systems allowing temporary emergency measures to be put in place and data collection, research and design guidance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity speak on this important topic.  I returned only last night from a meeting of Socialist International in Athens which was attended by 700 delegates from 170 countries.  Socialist International has decided to make climate change its principal topic of discussion.  The forum will discuss the challenge of the new structure of the global economy, issues of conflict and peace and migration, all of which are inter-related.</P>
        <P>It is important we do not make a descriptive gesture in regard to the challenge we face.  Socialist International decided, for example, to provide a slot for a presentation by Professor Rifkin.  It is clear and obvious that we have at most ten or 15 years in which to deal with the crisis we face.  It is also the case that all of the scientific estimations of the crisis have been off target in so far as that which was predicted to happen has happened at a faster rate and is happening already.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I listened to Professor Rifkin, I was struck by the fact we are talking about a planetary impact that goes back beyond human life, which is approximately 175,000 years; that we are talking about millions of years in which the planet was unable to sustain any life and almost about a species crisis.  For this reason, I reject entirely the suggestion that one could in any sense see in the melting of the northern ice cap anything other than the disaster that it is for all forms of life.  Also, one can trace in the history of science precisely what the species impact would be.  This is not to make a deep ecological argument in the North American sense but to acknowledge, in terms of the scale of the crisis, that we have ten or 15 years to address this given scientific projections have proven insufficient.</P>
        <P>I will move on to what I believe is the human side of this issue.  We are talking about an inter-linked set of crises.  Closely related to the climate change crisis is the food production crisis which in turn relates to the energy crisis which in turn relates to issues of political instability.  For example, Dan Smith in his book <i>Climate Change and Conflict</i> makes the point, in regard to countries producing fossil fuels, that there exists countries within which there are what might be called &ldquo;weaknesses&rdquo; in the political and social infrastructures: that there is a serious risk of armed conflict in approximately 46 of these countries and a risk for serious political instability in another 56 countries.  One is, therefore, talking about the climate change crisis, the food production crisis, the energy crisis and the instability that flows from fossil fuel producing regions.  Another crisis not sufficiently recognised is the disastrous crisis in intellectual and economic thinking.  The reduction in the influence of the State and respect for international institutions introduced in the Thatcher-Reagan era and the release of what might have been regarded as a single neo-liberal model of development that came from the Chicago school under the tutorage of Professor Milton Friedman, has been a disaster in every sense in terms of its idea of what one might call non-inflationary consistent economic growth and a single model to be spread all over the world.</P>
        <P>I have only a few minutes to raise what we might do.  I accept issues arise in regard to mitigation.  It is irresponsible to suggest we can deal with this crisis by not changing our way of life.  That requires public education.  A question also arises in respect of adaptation in respect of new forms of life, the economy and society and so on.  The Government is challenged to <Col N="631"/>state why it is not valorising public transport rather than its roads programme.  One cannot be taken seriously if one makes the slightest cut in public transport when one should be driving it on.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On technology transfer, I listened to the spokesperson from India ask if he was to tell the expanding population of India to do without electricity.  He asked if the technology used for changing to a new carbon free type society, one which would result in a better connection between economy and society, could be transferred to those countries with population pressure.  This requires institutional change of the character of the Bretton Woods institutions, the IMF and World Bank following the Second World War.  We need a new council for sustainable development and capital transfers that would report to the Secretary General.</P>
        <P>Many issues have been thrown up for discussion, many of which relate to inter-generational justice.  This is a difficult area for parliamentarians elected for a five-year period or for members of parties founded a generation or two ago to address.  The idea that one should not take actions that in their own sense or cumulatively have an irreversible effect or an inter-generational effect challenges us to invite ourselves to a new type of inter-generational jurisprudence.  I very much contribute to that.</P>
        <P>I will turn to the issue of the new relationship.  People piously say this will require a contract between the developed and the developing world.  How would that happen?  I have mentioned already that technology must be transferred to places such as India and Pakistan, but it is not.  In addition, if we were, for example, to put a tax on carbon emission activity, the results of that should be transferred to the developing world to enable its people to develop new, responsible forms of production.</P>
        <P>There is also good news, which is that every euro invested in cleaner industry and so on has a multiplier effect on the economy that is four to five times that of fossil fuels.  This has been scientifically shown.  There are better jobs, cleaner industries, better social forms and more responsible forms of economy, but they require a mental shift.  I am glad this environmental consideration is lodged in the minds of all parties.  However, I have a point to make about our seeking to create a new contract between the developed and the developing world.  We cannot go on as we are in some parts of the developed world.  We must also realise, in structuring our response, whether we are looking at mitigation, adaptation or technology transfer, and the new institutional forms of which I speak, that certain groups are making the greatest contributions to the problem, such as the United States.  In addition, there must be a proportionate response because some of the countries of which we are making demands do not have the capacity to make the response we ask of them.  They need technology transfer, as I mentioned, and they need funding.  They also have the right to development.  For example, in the case of India, are we to say that hundreds of millions of people must bend their backs without electricity?</P>
        <P>Professor Rifkin has made some positive proposals which are very interesting.  He talks about the third industrial revolution and proposes that we look at the question and consider that our strategy can in fact be based on renewables.  We can go so far with that.  It could also take into account hydrogen-based development, carbon storage and so on.  What is most important, however &mdash; this will be the hardest part for people to accept &mdash; is that the new liberal model, which has driven irresponsible growth and suggested that the process of change and transition on the planet had to be from one model, has been a disaster.  We are not requiring people to drive everything back, but we must recognise that we no longer have two decades to reverse the intergenerational changes that are taking place.  We have a decade and a half.  These changes are so strong that they threaten the species.  We are talking not just about the human species, which emerged over 175,000 years slowly and with many progressions, but about forms of life that themselves emerged in a cosmic sense.  It is nonsense to suggest that we can somehow <Col N="632"/>decide to live with the melting of the polar ice caps, develop tourism and explore for fossil fuels.  Let us stop the madness before it is too late.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomMcEllistrimFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas McEllistrim</NameTxt>
	<P>Climate change is among the greatest challenges of our time.  The debate is no longer about whether climate change is happening; we all know for sure that it is.  It is obvious from increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising mean sea levels.  It is accepted that most of the warming that has occurred over the past 50 years is very likely to have been caused by human activities.  This warming is projected to continue and increase over the course of the 21st century and beyond.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Climate change does not distinguish by nationality, colour or religion, and is a real threat to our way of life.  It is no longer something that we hear about on the news from somewhere else.  It is affecting our lives directly.  We have all become accustomed to seeing the problems associated with various environmental catastrophes on our TV screens and in the media.  In many ways people can become desensitised to issues that affect people in countries that seem far away.  One reason the tsunami that occurred around Christmas 2004 had a deep effect on people across the world was that the victims included western holiday makers and businesses.</P>
        <P>The surge in oil and food prices, particularly in the past year, has caused a wave &mdash; if not a tsunami &mdash; of concern.  This is no longer just about the issue of climate change but also about the economic consequences of our response to it.  The developed world, it may be argued, had become complacent about cheap food.  That is no longer the case as we grapple with the consequences of the replacement of food crops with energy crops.  In the least developed parts of the world, climate change is an issue of deep injustice, as it is the people who have contributed least to creating the problem who are being disproportionately affected by it.  The interaction between climate change and poverty is potentially catastrophic as climate change pushes fragile livelihoods over the edge.  The effects of unpredictable rainfall, droughts, floods and hurricanes are already being felt across the developing world and the poorest people in these countries are being hit the hardest.  In addition, it is they who are most affected by rising food prices.</P>
        <P>Tackling poverty means addressing both the causes and the consequences of climate change in an equitable way.  It is widely recognised that global temperature increases must be kept within a limit of 2&deg; Celsius above pre-industrial levels in order to prevent the more dangerous effects of climate change.  However, for many of the world&rsquo;s poorest people, climate change has already reached danger point.  For this reason, the global response to climate change must emphasise support for developing countries in adapting to these changes.</P>
        <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland tells us that climate change is already starting to affect Ireland.  It refers to the increase in extreme weather events, including floods, storms and droughts, in recent years, and predicts that Ireland&rsquo;s winters will be warmer and wetter.  By 2050, the temperature in January will have increased by 1.5&deg; Celsius.  Winter conditions in Northern Ireland and the north midlands will be similar to those on the south-west coast today.  While milder winters might seem like a good thing, this is not necessarily the case.  Rainfall will increase by 11%.  SEI also predicts that Ireland&rsquo;s summers will be warmer and drier.  By 2050 the average July temperature could increase by 2.5&deg; Celsius.  Although this does not sound very threatening, there could be serious implications, such as summer droughts which will cause competition for water supplies.  The impact of these changes could include an increase in flooding &mdash; particularly in the west &mdash; and droughts in summer.  Irish farmers will no longer be able to grow potatoes.  New agricultural pests and diseases will appear and the possibility of water pollution problems will increase.</P><Col N="633"/>
        <P>Everyone has an important role to play in preventing human-influenced climate change, as everyone contributes to its effects through electricity use, heating and cooling, and transportation.  A recent survey showed that most people recognise that climate change is occurring and that steps need to be taken across the board and at every level in society.  However, unsurprisingly, people begin to step back from this general standpoint when they are confronted with the likely cost implications of these changes.  The considerable growth in the Irish economy over the last decade has undoubtedly put upward pressure on our emissions.</P>
        <P>With challenges come opportunities.  However, the scale of the challenge facing us means that we must also look beyond the energy sector to achieve the necessary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.  Responsibility must be shared by a wide range of actors, including the public sector, which must lead by example.  Achieving the targets will also necessitate voluntary changes in behaviour by individual citizens in small ways; for example, by increasing their use of low-energy light bulbs and driving in a more fuel-efficient manner.  This is an area in which everyone can and must play a part if we are to be successful in protecting the environment for the next generation.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012 was launched by the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Dick Roche, in April 2007.  The strategy sets out, in a detailed and specific way, the comprehensive measures the Government has put in place to enable Ireland to meet its target under the Kyoto Protocol.  It addresses measures in all sectors of the economy, including energy, transport, agriculture, the residential sector and businesses, and includes existing measures put in place on foot of the National Climate Change Strategy 2000 and, subsequently, through the National Development Plan 2007-2013, Transport 21, the White Paper on energy and the bioenergy action plan.  It also includes a series of additional measures to deliver the overall objective of putting Ireland on a pathway towards a low carbon economy.</P>
        <P>The national climate change strategy looks beyond the Kyoto Protocol period and shows that the total contribution of measures adopted by the Government will account for 80% of the effort Ireland will need to meet its Kyoto Protocol commitments.  The remaining 20% will be made up by Ireland&rsquo;s use of the flexible mechanisms.  These flexible mechanisms allow Kyoto Protocol parties to support the development of clean technology in the developing world in return for emissions credits.  Some &euro;270 million has been allocated under the National Development Plan 2007-2013 for investment in such projects over the lifetime of the strategy.</P>
        <P>The Carbon Fund Bill will provide the necessary legislative underpinning for the National Treasury Management Agency to undertake its role as purchasing agent on behalf of the State.  The public sector will be required to measure, report and reduce its emissions.  Public sector bodies will have specific targets for emissions reduction and be required to report progress in their annual reports.  The Government will publish another climate change strategy for the period to 2020 when Ireland&rsquo;s post-2012 commitments are known.</P>
        <P>The strategy sets out, on a sectoral basis, that a combination of existing and additional measures will reduce Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions by over 17 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in the period 2008-2012.  Additional funding for the purposes of this strategy encompasses policies and measures adopted since the last projections were completed for the Government in March 2006.</P>
        <P>The strategy brings together the range of actions being taken by the Government to reduce Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions.  It provides the necessary co-ordination by the entire Government to meet Ireland&rsquo;s Kyoto Protocol commitments and builds on progress already made since the original national climate change strategy was published in 2000.</P><Col N="634"/>
        <P>Carbon credits arise under the flexible mechanisms, which are an integral part of the Kyoto Protocol since the environmental benefit of a given emission reduction is the same irrespective of where on the planet it is achieved.  The protocol, therefore, allows countries to determine the most cost-effective balance between domestic reductions and investing in reductions elsewhere.  There will be further reductions, not included in these calculations, as a result of measures such as the rebalancing of motor tax and VRT in favour of low-emission vehicles.  There are also a number of key additional measures over and above those already in place when the review of the first national climate change strategy was published in 2006.  With regard to energy, for example, 15% of electricity is to be generated from renewable sources by 2010 and 33% by 2020.  Biomass is set to contribute up to 30% of energy input at peat stations by 2015, there will be support for combined heat and power projects and a national ocean energy strategy.</P>
        <P>Our education system has played an important part in preparing our younger generation for the task ahead.  As a former secondary teacher, I believe educators are in a unique position to play a leadership role in reducing emissions by encouraging young people to take what they have learned about climate change home with them.  By nurturing activities that can help reduce climate change, we can all make a difference.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of climate change is one that we ignore at our peril.  There may still be disputes about exactly how much we are contributing to the warming of the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere and how much is naturally occurring, but what we can be scientifically certain of is that our continued use of fossil fuels is pushing us to a point of no return.  Unless we free ourselves from a dependence on these fossil fuels and chart a new course on energy in this country, we are condemning future generations to global chaos.</P>
        <P>These words are not my own.  However, I endorse them and support their strong message on climate change.  They are in fact the words of US presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, but who said them is not important.  What is important is that we take heed of and act sooner rather than later to ensure a future for generations to come.</P>
        <P>What hope is there for this country under the current Government in the light of the admission by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, that the Government&rsquo;s climate change strategy since 2002 has largely been a failure?  The fact that the Motor Vehicles (Duties and Licences) Bill has proven to be a damp squib is difficult to face.  Speaking on 25 February, at the launch of a public consultation document on the Government&rsquo;s proposed 12 year sustainable travel plan, the Minister said about the strategy: &ldquo;We did not take the hard decisions in 2002, or certainly if we took them, we did not get to implement them or achieve them.  We are now at the endgame in relation to the Kyoto targets.&rdquo;  If the Minister felt he was at the endgame in February, where are we today?  This is not a game of chess in which, on completion of the endgame, the pieces can be put away and taken out another day.  Climate change is deadly serious and the clock is ticking fast.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the efforts of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, do not seem to be any more effective at the helm of the Department of Transport than they were in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  It is heartening, though, that he should criticise his own party, Fianna F&aacute;il.  The party deserves much criticism in this regard, as it does in many other areas, particularly after yesterday&rsquo;s announcement.</P>
        <P>A recently commissioned Government opinion poll shows that 86% of respondents, an outstanding majority of the 1,000 adults surveyed, believe that the Government is not doing enough on climate change and is, by default, ignoring climatic change, our health, the economy and financial security.</P><Col N="635"/>
        <P>Currently, Ireland is the sixth highest polluter <i>per capita</i> among developed countries and, according to Stop Climate Chaos, if everyone polluted on the same level as us, we would need three planet Earths to survive.  This is not an achievement to be proud of and I hope the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, takes note.  It is a pity he is not in the Chamber today to hear the debate on this important issue.</P>
        <P>There is a tendency for western public opinion to blame global warming on countries such as China and the United States while overlooking the considerable contribution to climate change made by other western countries.  In this respect Irish people are guilty of a head in the sand approach.  They are prepared to throw stones at every glasshouse but their own.</P>
        <P>The greatest sell-out by any party in coalition has been by the Green Party.  A wilting Green Party Minister who appears to be colour blind is certainly not the bonus for the environment we might have hoped for.  Shortly after entering into government after the general election, the Minster promised that &ldquo;this Government will deliver on Ireland&rsquo;s Kyoto Protocol commitments and will prepare Ireland for the further reductions that lie ahead&rdquo;.  A year later, his officials, and certainly the rest of us, are pessimistic about his aspirations.  According to a paper prepared for the Minster for Finance, the bottom line is that we are obliged to meet certain climate change targets under the Kyoto Protocol but there are doubts about the possibility of success.  Success will mean changes to policies that will have social and economic implications.</P>
        <P>In a move that brought outrage from the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, suggested earlier this month that the size of the national herd might have to be cut in order to meet targets.  This is nonsense on the Minister&rsquo;s part.  We are proud to say that this is an agricultural county.  How dare the Minister threaten the future of agriculture with such comments?  When one considers that the Government is targeting the sick, the vulnerable, small children and the elderly, it is not surprising that the animals in this country are being earmarked for cutbacks.</P>
        <P>I wish to speak about our climate.  Met &Eacute;ireann announced yesterday that long-standing records have been broken by the recent heavy rain, storms and frost.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle comes from the supposedly sunny south east, which recently experienced its wettest June day for 50 years.  The strongest winds since 1980 have been recorded in Dublin in recent times.  The amount of rain that fell in the south and south east in June was twice the average for that month in that part of the country.  The reality of climate change for the daily lives of citizens throughout the world, including Europe, is that food prices will continue to increase dramatically and water shortages will lead to a reduction in agricultural production.  Food rioting will continue in the urban areas of developing nations.  The world&rsquo;s most vulnerable nations will have to endure famine.  Facts and details of this nature were expressed by Deputy Michael D. Higgins during his fine contribution to this debate in the Chamber this morning.  It is likely that the rich-poor divide will become more marked.  The poorest nations in the developing world will suffer dreadful hunger as the demand for bio-fuels grows in industrialised nations.  There will be mass migration from Africa, Asia and the Middle East as hunger and rising sea levels drive people towards Europe.  That will have negative implications for the EU.</P>
        <P>I am particularly concerned about the increasing carbon figures in our transport sector.  Such increases are cancelling out the gains being made in other areas.  The transport sector needs to stabilise this adverse impact by reducing its contribution of more than 20% to this country&rsquo;s carbon emissions.  Strong Government input and direction is needed if our dependency on fossil fuels is to be reduced.  Such leadership has definitely not been shown by the wilting Green Party Ministers in the past 12 months.  The potential for the deployment of renewable energy in Ireland is immense.  I refer to energy from wind, solar, biomass and ocean sources.  If we invest in the potential of technologies associated with renewable sources of energy, we will <Col N="636"/>improve the economies and employment opportunities of rural areas.  Action, rather than talk, is needed.  Spin doctors should not be employed to come up with soft and palatable words behind the scenes.  The Minister needs to get a grip on the situation if we are to ensure that our young people have a future in 2030 and beyond.</P>

	<P>I do not underestimate the challenge of climate change.  The former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, said last week that there is a glaring gulf between the statements of politicians and the actions required to tackle climate change in a meaningful way.  The role of the Green Party, which is in government in Ireland for the first time, is an immense one.  It will not be easy to meet the challenge of turning the super-tanker around.  It is important that we do not gloss over the fact that there will be legacy issues.  On many occasions during the past 25 years, the Green Party delivered a robust critique of the Ireland&rsquo;s system of economic development and the policies which were followed by successive Governments.</P>
        <P>I do not think one can expect the Green Party to turn the ship of State around over the course of 12 months.  Policies cannot change dramatically overnight.  Climate change has been brought centre stage in the past 12 months.  There are signs at international level and at home that decision-makers realise the immense task that lies ahead of them.  In my 25 years as a member of the Green Party, I have never before seen such a sea change in the space of 12 months.  There is a recognition of the problem and the need to tackle it.  I see the first signs of the change that is needed.  The new vehicle registration and taxation system, which kicked in two days ago, will bring about radical changes in the way we consider our motoring habits.  The profound changes which have been made to the building regulations are dramatically different from the kind of regulations we had last year, five years ago or ten years ago.  Opposition Deputies who suggest that the Green Party is doing nothing in government are ignoring the facts.  We have made significant changes in two key areas which affect people&rsquo;s lives.  While we have not turned the ship of State around, we have taken the first steps towards tackling climate change in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I wish to mention some other measures.  Those involved in energy research in our universities have been given sizeable grants.  We have introduced pilot schemes to encourage domestic energy saving and new electricity micro-generation programmes.  There has been an increase in the support given to renewable energy.  While such measures may not be that visible to those on the Opposition benches, they will change significantly the way we live our lives.  I remind the Opposition speaker who suggested that nothing has changed in the planning sector that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, rejected the development plans of various local authorities.  He said they were not good enough because they did not provide for sustainable planning.  He has <Col N="637"/>brought an end to the passing around of rezoning motions like snuff at a wake.  Enough is enough.  It is time to focus development in our towns and villages, rather than three or four miles up the road where people will need to jump into a car to get anywhere.  The steps that have been taken to promote sustainable development represent progress in tacking climate change.  Deputies on the Opposition benches have stayed silent on the need to tackle rezoning anomalies in our counties and cities.  The Green Party is making a difference in such areas.  We are overseeing the provision of finance for research into wave power, environmental projects and bioenergy.  The first budget to be influenced by the Green Party provided for tax incentives to be given to green businesses.</P>
        <P>I do not deny that the Government and the country as a whole face substantial challenges.  Ireland has one of the highest <i>per capita</i> emissions levels in the world.  We need to take radical action, for example by reviewing our land use and transportation policies.  We need to change the way we live our lives.  The tackling of climate change involves individual action.  I do not doubt that people can make profound changes in their own lives.  Such changes can have benefits for everyone.  We have to go further.  There are huge opportunities in the sunrise industries of green energy.  Hundreds of thousands of jobs have already been created in many European countries in the area of renewable energy.  I have no doubt the future of Irish job creation lies in the green solutions we have spoken about at great length.  The announcement by the head of the ESB of a &euro;22 billion plan to turn that organisation into a renewable-energy company shows the kind of figures involved and the challenges we must tackle.</P>
        <P>Farming and transport offer immense challenges.  It is not business as usual, however.  Those on the other side of the House who think we can continue to accept substantial emissions from these sectors must take a reality check and examine what changes can be made.  The Green Party has long advocated significant capital investment in public transport.  The success of the Luas light rail system in Dublin and the improvements made in long-distance rail routes show we can tackle climate change and reduce emissions through better public transport systems.  It is not easy to make such changes.  It is important we continue to prioritise public transport measures in the capital programme for transport.</P>
        <P>Looking ahead to the kind of changes that might be suggested at the climate change conference in Copenhagen in December 2009, it is likely we will be required to make dramatic changes in almost every sector within the Irish economy.  This can be a good news story.  From my experience I know that providing greater levels of insulation and putting in better systems of heating and controls can result in real savings for the householder.  We must provide safety nets.  If we are to introduce a climate change levy there must be a system of supports for those on lower incomes.  We already have systems in place to provide fuel allowance for the bulk of the year and we must look at those supports and, if necessary, change them to ensure people do not suffer unduly from fuel poverty.</P>
        <P>In the face of global crisis in climate change we cannot do nothing.  We cannot resist change and pretend things can go on as they have until now.  We have only uncovered the tip of the problem that lies ahead.  We have made only limited changes in the scale of Government policies that must be addressed in the future.</P>
        <P>We have made a good start for the first year in government.  A lively discussion will continue to bring about changes in future budgets and policies.  There is an enormous challenge ahead.  If members of the Opposition suggest we should not change the lightbulbs or that we should not make changes in agricultural policy they are simply burying their heads in the sand.  That is no longer a solution to the challenge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Deputy Frank Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the chance to take part in this serious debate on climate change which is not a local but a global issue.  I take on board what the previous Deputy said, <Col N="638"/>speaking from the perspective of the Green Party.  However, global warming and environmental issues must be addressed across parties.  I welcome the involvement and participation of the Green Party but the green agenda on climate change is a global issue and is not the reserve of one party.  I am sure the Deputy agrees that within the ranks of Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and other parties this subject is high on the agenda.  That is the way it should be.</P>
        <P>We talk about waste management and wonder what we can do in this country.  Sometimes we despair because it seems we are not doing enough.  I take great consolation from the following.  When I was elected to the local authority in Roscommon in 1999 the issue of the regional waste management Acts was to the fore.  The Irish have never been good at complying with authority.  People gave up drink-driving not because they feared they would kill themselves or an innocent individual but because they feared they might lose their licence or that their insurance might be increased.  It is the same with many issues.  We embraced waste management and while great credit must go to local authorities and politicians who implemented it most credit is due to people who set up recycling centres and bring centres.  We must take the issue further but we have come a long way.</P>
        <P>Deputy Cuffe mentioned rezoning.  This matter can be a two-edged sword.  I have had my runs in with people in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  They are not elected but think they know better than the elected representatives. In my area, in Lough Key Forest Park, there was a major tourism development but people in the Department decided they knew better.  We have come full circle.  There was a time when big developers and builders had a major influence on planning but now faceless bureaucrats in certain Departments are implementing their own policy.  All that we want in life is fairness, openness and transparency from politicians but we want the same from departmental officials.  That is not a reflection on the vast number of officials who do their job.  It is only a few who pursue their own agenda and they do not do so in a democratic fashion.  That is a matter I wish to state for the record.</P>
        <P>It is better to live in a house with good insulation so the heating system will be better and it will not be cold in the morning.  However, a majority of people live in local authority housing that was built in the 1960s and 1970s, where the insulation is not up to scratch.  These people are effectively the new poor.  No matter what they do to try to heat their house, bringing in briquettes and coal and whatever, the house is never warm.  We could do more concerning insulation.</P>
        <P>We can address the matter of light bulbs.  Leinster House has new bulbs which is welcome although it probably does not make much difference.  When I bought my house it was fitted with candelabras which contained six or seven bulbs.  I took out five of them and have only one.  I know it does not look great but it serves the same purpose.  We should all make the same effort.  I will not say &ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo; because I am saving money and I believe I am saving the environment.</P>
        <P>Concerning cars, I was at a conference some weeks ago where the talking point was hybrid cars.  However, if one is making long journeys, a diesel car is probably just as good if not better for the environment.  I was very enthused by the fact that a member of the Green Party had a bio-fuel car.  I say this as a compliment.  I believed the car was very worthwhile but we now hear that bio-fuel cars may not be as appropriate as once believed because of the role of bio-fuel crops in food shortages around the world.  The Green Party member was acting in the right spirit and I was nearly thinking of obtaining a bio-fuel car myself but we need to know more about the subject and debate it further before we jump in with our two feet.</P><Col N="639"/>
        <P>Solar and wind power projects are very necessary but the ESB has not been up-front regarding the addition of new suppliers to the grid.  There is now a movement in this regard but we had to wait ten or 12 years for it.  Operators with serious sums to invest obtained planning permission for alternative energy projects but these were held up by the ESB.  They are now coming on stream but this should have occurred five or six years ago.  There was an impasse but it should not have been allowed.  Generating electricity using wind and ocean energy is very necessary and it is exciting that we can harness such energy.</P>
        <P>There are two sides to the debate on farming.  One comprises Deputies from rural constituencies who represent the farming community.  Farming is a vital part of life in rural areas.  On the other side there are Deputies from Dublin and other cities, whose constituencies do not include the farming community.  We must be careful to strike a good balance.  We must be mindful of the fact that practices deemed bad years ago are now deemed good, or <i>vice versa</i>.  We need to debate this issue.  In our mad dash we should not undermine the farming community.  We can make savings in other areas, by way of carbon credits, for example.  Therefore, we should not jump in with two feet.</P>
        <P>I live on the Sligo line and it is great to see there are eight trains each day in both directions.  We have engaged in a mad dash to develop road transport but more could be done to encourage rail freight such as utilising small ports.  It could be beneficial to have a port in Sligo or along the west coast for the importation of goods.</P>
        <P>Those of us who have Sky television see environmental programmes and note that species are under threat.  This debate is worthwhile and welcome.  We can make a difference together.  I like the Power of One advertisement that claims everyone can make a difference.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>Having been mentioned on a few occasions by Opposition Members during the Order of Business, which is unusual, I was planning on keeping a low profile for the rest of the day.  However, I am anxious to contribute to this debate, albeit briefly, because it is important to do so.</P>
        <P>Deputy Feighan made a point I was to make in that he stated it was a question of what each individual could do to combat climate change.  It is well and good to discuss the responsibility of governments but it is ultimately up to individuals to take responsibility and make a contribution, however small.</P>
        <P>This morning I read that climate change was already proving to be a defining issue of the 21st century.  There is no doubt about this.  It is important to have this debate, as Deputy Feighan stated.  Years ago we believed climate change and saving the world were issues that fringe groups worried about and tried to address.  However, it is important that we understand we all have an impact.  When I rose this morning and went for a walk, I noted it was almost like a winter&rsquo;s day.  One wonders whether the world is changing.</P>
        <P>I remember my maternal grandmother who is dead 42 years but whom I remember very well telling me when I was quite young that she always had worried about the world after the Russians had launched the Sputnik spacecraft.  She never believed the weather would be right again.  It could well be that her generation held this view.  It could have been correct because during my lifetime it has been interesting to see how the world environment has changed and how climate change has become very much part of the agenda.  It could well be that it has become a political issue 40 or 50 years later than it should have.  There have been many contributing factors, including energy demands.  We should regard climate change as an issue which poses a challenge for us all.  It is important to debate it to get the message across to the public.  I am not saying it does not care but that the public, in all countries, understands the political issues of the day and the challenges it faces.</P><Col N="640"/>
        <P>I am not so sure we all take the state of the world sufficiently seriously.  Suddenly the worldwide phenomenon of climate change is clear to us all.  It is certainly true that in Ireland, in all constituencies, the environment and climate change are being ascribed greater importance.  We always make a point about education and awareness campaigns and I am glad the national climate change strategy is taking account of this.  There is a very important message to be circulated to all of us, especially young people.  Without putting pressure on schools or teachers, I hope the message is receiving considerable attention.  Damaging one&rsquo;s own environment, rambling along the streets and dropping litter and defacing walls with graffiti are all sins against the environment and the climate.  It is very important that we understand the challenges that arise in this regard.</P>
        <P>Climate change will prove to be the greatest challenge to face humanity this century.  Clearly, it is profound in its implications for the planet and all of us who live on it.  It cuts to the core of modern living and commerce in the 21st century.  There are those who believe the solution is obvious.  Clearly, reducing greenhouse gas emissions sufficiently quickly to avoid the worst aspects of climate change will be emphasised by many.  We all have, or should have, a personal interest in meeting this objective.  We have a responsibility to play our small part in whatever way we decide we can.  Clearly, the onus is very much on governments, businesses and individuals.</P>
        <P>Colleagues have referred to how we might address the problem of climate change.  There are many ways of doing so in our communities, including the protection of the environment locally.  Reference was made to insulating one&rsquo;s own home and ensuring green bins are more full than black bins.</P>
      
        <P>Deputy Ring referred to all the reports Members received.  Not a day goes by without my receiving tonnes of material, glossy magazines and brochures with pictures of various people at my home and offices in Tallaght and the D&aacute;il.  One wonders where we are going in this regard.  While I was a slow developer in working with computers and websites, undoubtedly, if it is possible to create a paper free environment in respect of Members&rsquo; work, it is important to do so.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I also have long believed one can make a contribution by keeping out of one&rsquo;s car as much as possible.  It is not always completely possible and although I live only eight miles from Leinster House, sometimes it is necessary to use my car for various reasons such as bringing back good news leaflets or visiting different parts of my constituency.  However, I try, in so far as possible, to use public transport and use both buses and the Luas.  As I have mentioned in the House previously, I experienced a health challenge approximately nine years ago when I had a serious heart attack, although thankfully, I am now fit and well.  I have done much walking since, having taken advice from the cardiac rehabilitation unit in Tallaght Hospital about leaving one&rsquo;s car as far away from one&rsquo;s destination as possible.  While it is not easy on a morning like this, simple initiatives such as getting across a positive health message also help the climate change agenda and all Members should make an effort to do so.</P>
        <P>I have made reference to the initiative regarding the climate change awareness programme.  I am glad that strategy provides for a multi-million euro public awareness campaign on climate change.  I note the emphasis placed on the issue of climate change in An Agreed Programme for Government reinforced the necessity to put in place the resources necessary to effectively communicate this complex and far-reaching issue.  The campaign has a number of aims.  In addition to raising general public awareness of climate change and promoting behavioural changes to reduce emissions, it will include a strong partnership aspect to focus on stakeholders <Col N="641"/>in specific sectors and work with them to develop specific programmes and initiatives tailored to achieve emission reductions in their sectors.  Another important goal of the campaign will be to empower individuals and groups to play their part in tackling climate change.  The campaign has been designed specifically to ensure it dovetails with related public sector awareness campaigns and initiatives such as the Power of One, One Small Step and the Race against Waste.  Duplication of message and unnecessary overlaps will be avoided and every effort made to enhance the messages of existing campaigns and programmes.</P>
        <P>I have listened to many of the contributions to this debate and, to an extent, all Members are reading from the same handbook.  However, one must face the challenge raised by Members which also has been referred to in the Seanad of how to deal with waste and what methods are to be used.  Deputy Tuffy referred to a proposal for an incinerator at Rathcoole which is close to my constituency and a town I represented on the county council from 1991 to 1999.  This issue is important and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will be aware that people have concerns in this regard.  At the same time, this must be balanced against the challenges under discussion in this debate.  It will be interesting to see how such issues develop; how future Governments will deal with the question of waste management and what is to be done about waste and its reduction.  Moreover, in respect of the residual waste that must be dealt with, how will this be done without damaging the environment?</P>
        <P>The presence of Deputy Lynch as Acting Chairman reminds me of the debate this week on the Haulbowline site and I have much sympathy for those affected.  I thank the Acting Chairman for her courtesy and appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash; and considering the weather, one must restate one&rsquo;s commitment to tackle climate change, given that it is pouring from the heavens outside.</P>
        <P>The term &ldquo;climate change&rdquo; has become part of daily discourse.  However, what are people saying when they use the term?  In particular, how does it connect to them on a day-to-day level?  One aspect to be feared is that people may consider tackling climate change to be the responsibility of the Government or international bodies such as the United Nations or the European Union, without perceiving a personal connection to the issue.  Arising from this debate, I hope for a number of outcomes.  The public should consider that dealing with climate change can be done simply, is not full of complications and is attainable.  Part of the discourse suggests it is the greatest concern facing humanity.  While that may be the case, it makes it sound like an inevitable disaster.  However, the problem can be turned around.  Members must show leadership to demonstrate that dealing with climate change is an attainable objective.  This should be done by putting in place measurable goals for people regarding steps that can be taken at both local, national and international level.  I refer to measurable steps that can be taken on a week-to-week basis in order that people can discern change in their own domestic and professional lives, as well as to the benefit of their communities and so on.  This can be achieved by adopting consistent and repetitive approaches to one&rsquo;s daily life that individuals can control.  Moreover, one should avoid disconnection or divorce on the part of people&rsquo;s engagement with the process.  Ultimately, there should be a commitment modelled at both Government and individual level.</P>
        <P>Before turning to the main body of my speech, I wish to preface my remarks by stating that in our anxiety to deal with climate change, a number of precautions must be taken.  In this House last week, as a means to facilitate and encourage renewable energy systems, the Planning <Col N="642"/>and Development Act was changed by the Minister to provide for a series of exemptions, whereby renewable energy sources will no longer be obliged to go through the standard planning regulations.  While all Members may have a high regard for such energy systems, it should not be separated from what constitutes good planning practice.  It constitutes bad planning practice, regardless of what the infrastructural development might be, to allow the construction of a development within a local community without putting in place a site notice or without advertisements in the local media.  It is bad practice for a number of reasons.  First, it denies local participation and public information.  Second, if it goes wrong, it will undermine the entire concept of planning in respect of enforcement because a local community or housing estate that was unaware of a development that has been exempted under conditions will not know what such conditions are and what the extent of the development should be.</P>
        <P>As Members move towards adopting more legislative approaches to dealing with climate change, I wish to put down a marker that they should not deregulate matters to such an extent that the baby is thrown out with the bath water.  That is what happened in the House last week when a good idea was implemented extremely badly through secondary legislation.  Consequently, the obvious anomalies and flaws in the measure were put through the House by the Minister and could not be dealt with or amended.  While the Minister likes to invite ideas and suggestions from the other side of the House, unfortunately, neither ideas nor common sense are being accommodated when processes are put through the House by this method.</P>
        <P>Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity.  As I noted, it requires urgent and decisive action within the next decade, a measurable period of time.  This is a global problem that affects every individual and every local community.  Ireland must make a significant contribution to finding the solution.  I will summarise some of the areas in which Ireland will be affected by this issue.  In agriculture, for example, we may be obliged to change from grass to maize to feed our livestock and there may be an increased requirement for irrigation in the eastern part of the island, in particular.  A traditional staple product such as the potato may become unviable in a different climate.</P>
        <P>Regarding water resources, we fear the likelihood of increased flood events in winter and pressure on water supplies and infrastructure during the drier summer months.  Regarding forestry, there is the likelihood of an increase in harmful exotic pests and diseases because of a warmer temperature.</P>
        <P>Regarding marine ecosystems, there is the likelihood of negative impacts on aquaculture from increased algae blooms, and infection rates and pests as mentioned.  Other issues such as sea level rises and biodiversity will have to be examined on this island.</P>
        <P>The international consensus on the need for radical action has been growing since the Kyoto Protocol was negotiated in 1997.  The effects of radical climate change are already evident including the melting polar caps, unseasonable weather in many parts of the world, rising sea levels and increasingly stormy weather.</P>
        <P>Ireland must play its part in the global effort to combat climate change.  We had ten years to prepare for our first run of commitments under the Kyoto Protocol which commenced on 1 January this year.  Despite that, we are set to overshoot our target by 7.2 million tonnes of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> a year for five years.  The Government has sanctioned the purchase of 270 million worth of carbon credits from abroad to compensate for its failure to meet our domestic target.  Carbon credits operate in a market and if the market increases, the cost could rise to as high as &euro;750 million.</P>
        <P>The latest projections from the Environmental Protection Agency indicate that in 2006, the total emissions decreased by 0.8%.  That was supported by a large reduction of 4.6% in emis<Col N="643"/>sions from the electricity generation sector.  That was accounted for in large part by adaptations made in the Moneypoint station and not through general usage throughout the country.  Emissions from transport continue to add to overall emissions as do waste services, which advanced by 5.2% and 3.3%, respectively.</P>
        <P>Despite that good performance in 2006, the European Environmental Agency has stated that based on past trends, Ireland is not on track to meet its target, even with the use of carbon sinks such as planting forests and so on.  The Kyoto Protocol mechanisms as accounted for will require further domestic actions not currently in place or outlined.</P>
        <P>Instead of regarding CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> reduction as a cost to the economy to combat climate change, we should see it as an opportunity.  Ireland is favourably situated to exploit the potential of wind and tide and to go from being a net importer of polluting fossils today to an exporter of clean, renewable energy within a few decades.  That is a realisable and measurable target.</P>
        <P>We have the expertise and the ability to become world leaders in ocean and tidal technology.  Instead of standing idly by as Irish companies succeed abroad, we must ensure they are given every opportunity to succeed here and become leaders in this field.</P>
        <P>In this year&rsquo;s budget &euro;13.2 million was provided for energy research in the national development plan.  That is clear evidence that renewable energy is not viewed as a matter of urgency requiring immediate action.  Buying carbon credits is not a long-term solution but unfortunately it appears to be a mid-term approach by the Government.</P>
        <P>Climate change is a global problem that can only be solved by collective action on the part of the international community, and also at a local level.  The ability to make strategic foreign policy decisions at EU level will be vital in future climate change negotiations, particularly if the EU is to exploit its diplomatic and economic power to the full.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party is committed to supporting a climate change protocol setting out what the EU would do to tackle climate change through the mechanisms it creates.  That could also help to break the European deadlock and demonstrate the relevance of the EU and a strong, cohesive Union that can act in the global interest at a greater level on this global issue.</P>
        <P>Ireland must take serious action now to meet the Kyoto commitments and to position ourselves for a medium to long-term economic climate where energy and environmental issues will dominate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to speak again in the House on the issue of climate change but when I heard Fine Gael&rsquo;s Deputy Hogan speaking on climate change it reminded me of the graveyard scene in Shakespeare&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; when he says, &ldquo;Alas, poor Yorick!&rdquo;.  Alas, poor Deputy Hogan, a fellow of infinite jest.  It is obvious Fine Gael does not understand or has deliberately misunderstood climate change.  Perhaps Deputy Hogan was absent without leave, AWOL, during the Green Party&rsquo;s constructive input into tackling climate change in the past year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Just over six months ago when this House had a similar debate on climate change Fine Gael&rsquo;s Deputy Coveney stated: &ldquo;I contend also that my party, a big catch-all party, has not perhaps offered enough insistence and leadership in this area, but that must change&rdquo;.  It is a bit rich for Deputy Hogan to start throwing stones from glass houses about greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
        <P>Above and beyond party politics I can assure the House that my party in Government is delivering real and significant reforms in the way Ireland is behaving in terms of its contribution to tackling climate change. Contrary to assertions by Deputy Hogan, the reform of VRT and motor tax would not have been purely emissions based were the Green Party not in government.  An emissions based system has already led to a radical rethink of the type of cars people drive.  One has only to look at the advertisements and read the newspapers to see that people <Col N="644"/>are taking heed of the way we drive our cars, and car manufacturers are producing cars to meet this global climate change threat.  Deputy Hogan talked about the repercussions of the reforms taking effect in July but converting systems takes time.  It is better to get the system right rather than rush through a radical reform without paving the way.</P>
        <P>Other important reforms such as new energy efficiency standards, planning exemptions for certain renewable energy generators and the planned ban on the sale of incandescent light bulbs will save over 700,000 tonnes of carbon emissions per year.  These are radical measures which have required transition phases but which are important components in the Government&rsquo;s programme of combating climate change.  Recent proposals for offsetting Government business flights is an example of the Government practising what it preaches.</P>
        <P>My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, has been equally energetic in moving the economy towards more renewable sources of energy.  The home energy saving scheme is accessible and innovative.  His reform of the refit scheme for wind energy and the encouragement of new forms of green energy such as anaerobic digestion, which will be a fantastic source for local agriculture to get rid of raw products in a sustainable way by flaring off the methane to heat houses, schools and hospitals, is the way to go.</P>
        <P>The introduction soon of net metering will allow consumers to sell electricity back to the grid and other green energy forms going back into this natural grid will reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels.  These are significant moves in the direction of a post-carbon society and economy.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that policies and attitudes in many areas of combating climate change must be constantly reviewed and re-evaluated.  Those involved in the current debate on bio-fuels &mdash; nationally, globally and in my own party &mdash; are acutely aware and engaged in the issue.  Many issues concerning net carbon savings, food prices, deforestation, the destruction of carbon sinks and the repercussions for the developing world are now associated with the first generation of bio-fuels.  We must look at the second generation.  Looking at the tops and tails of the beet, waste, straws and slurries we will be able to generate these fuels for our cars without compromising the need for food versus fuel.  Bio-fuels using resources such as these wastes and not requiring land changes must be researched at length and prioritised.</P>
        <P>All parties in the House should join the debate on bio-fuels to ensure it does not become another partisan petty squabble on the wider issue of climate change.  Above all, as fuel prices soar and the debate on climate change deepens, we must protect those on low income from fuel poverty, particularly as we head into the autumn and winter.  After a year in government, my party is delivering significant reforms in its campaign to tackle climate change.</P>
        <P>Before I finish I want to return to Shakespeare, where I started:</P>
        <P LI="1">All the world&rsquo;s a stage,</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">and all the men and women merely players.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Each one plays his part but we in the Green Party have a leading role in this.  There has been no time for a dress rehearsal.  Climate change is the greatest moral imperative of our time.  We, in the Green Party, are driving change.  We are delivering reform and are delighted to be in government in these extraordinary times in which we live to implement these policies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on climate change.  We all accept climate change is one of the greatest challenges to humanity in the medium to long term.</P><Col N="645"/>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s targets for reduction of emissions are way out of line with what they set.  We have not heard today &mdash; in fairness, I have not heard all of the debate &mdash; that the Government has firm proposals to ensure our promised contribution will be achieved.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Devins, will understand the value of &euro;15 million and how hard it is to get that sum for projects, including his own in a previous life.  The Government is spending &euro;15 million on a public relations exercise to tell people to make changes while it has done substantially nothing about its massive carbon footprint in Civil Service buildings etc.</P>
        <P>Total greenhouse gas emissions in 2006 were 69.77 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, which is 0.8% lower than the level of emissions in 2005.  The slight decrease is mainly accredited to the temporary closure and generation reduction at Moneypoint power station due to maintenance and upgrading work.  I impress on the Minister the need to continue the upgrading and improvement of Moneypoint.  It directly affects my constituency of Limerick West because the prevailing winds pass over it.  We have had problems.  We can not say conclusively that these were due to emissions from Moneypoint but we believe they contributed in the Askeaton area.  I urge the Government to ensure the ESB continues to upgrade Moneypoint to ensure it is environmentally friendly.</P>
        <P>Under the Kyoto agreement, Ireland has committed to limiting the increase of greenhouse gases to 13% above its 1990 levels, a limit that must be reached during the period 2008-12.  Current levels of Irish greenhouse gas emissions are more than 25% above the 1990 levels.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland, unlike other EU countries, looks unlikely to reach the Kyoto targets.  Other countries, such as the UK, Sweden and France, are already running ahead of their Kyoto targets.  Germany, Belgium, Greece and the Netherlands all look like they will comfortably reach their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.  We hope the Government will ensure over the next number of years to alter its approach to the Kyoto Agreement and reach our targets as agreed.</P>
        <P>The European Commission has set Ireland a challenging target to cut Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 in its new climate strategy.  The EU has given Ireland the toughest individual target because of its prosperity and poor track record on cutting emissions, particularly transport emissions.  While we welcome the changes on emissions in the last budget, they do not go far enough to achieve the objectives that the Government has set itself.  In the response to the debate we would welcome details of how the Government will approach ensuring we reach the targets.  However, Ireland will benefit from the upper cap, which restricts the maximum emissions cut demanded from a single EU state to 20% when compared to its emissions in 2005.</P>
        <P>According to Harry McGee, in <i>The Irish Times</i>, the latest report on greenhouse emissions in the European Union shows Ireland is in the bottom half of the table of the 27 states in terms of meeting its Kyoto Protocol targets.  Overall emissions fell by 14 million tonnes or 0.3%, and now stand at 7.7% below 1990 levels.  In all, 5,142 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent were emitted in the 27 member states in 2006.  The fall was even greater among the EU 15 &mdash; the 15 member states of the EU before the accession of the new member states in 2004 &mdash; which cut emissions by 35 million tonnes or 0.8%.  The Irish figures for 2006 show a marginal decrease from the previous year of 0.6 million tonnes or 0.8%.</P>
        <P>Irish emissions rose by 25.6% between 1990, the base year for Kyoto Protocol targets, and 2006, which is 12.6% above our target.  Energy and agriculture remain the biggest factors in Ireland, though agricultural emissions have been declining considerably in line with the decline in the agricultural industry.  The biggest problem within Ireland is the transport sector, to which I referred earlier, where emissions increased by 180% between 1990 and 2006.  Year-on-year, emissions in transport increased a further 5.2% between 2005 and 2006.</P><Col N="646"/>
        <P>It is generally acknowledged that Ireland&rsquo;s Kyoto Protocol targets were comparatively generous compared to other EU countries.  However, it is lagging behind considerably countries such as the UK, Sweden and France, which are already running ahead of their Kyoto Protocol targets.</P>
        <P>The reduction in countries such as Germany, Belgium, Greece and the Netherlands have been attributed to the use of technology and better efficiencies in power plants and heavy industry.  In the UK, a major switch from oil and coal to gas in electricity production has also been a major factor.  This brings me back to the issue of ensuring carbon efficiency at Moneypoint which I raised earlier.</P>
        <P>Of the accession countries, all but Slovenia have achieved significant reductions, thanks to what the EEA describes as &ldquo;the decline of energy-inefficient heavy industry&rdquo;.  However, in a slightly worrying trend, most of those recorded small increases &mdash; a reversal of what was happening &mdash; in 2006.</P>
        <P>Ireland is by no means the worst performer.  We are one of the lowest performers, but Spain&rsquo;s emissions were 35% above its target in 2006.  We must get perspective on the position in Europe.  The other states with big gaps between emissions and goals were Luxembourg at<?oasys _jy ?>29%, Austria at 28% and Denmark at 23%.</P>
        <P>I referred to the &euro;15 million which has been spent by the Government on its public relations exercise.  The Minister of State, Deputy Devins, will be aware that &euro;15 million is hard to come by.  This &euro;15 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money, which is currently being spent on the climate change media campaign, is an enormous expense which follows money which had already been spent in that area.  Fine Gael suggests that a large share of this money would be better spent on tangible products to help the environment such as home insulation schemes.  A new home energy saving scheme was launched some time ago by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and will spend &euro;5 million on improving home energy efficiencies via insulation.  There are 1 million homes in the country requiring investment to improve energy efficiency, yet the Government sees fit to spend three times more on a media campaign designed to make it look good.  I suggest the investment should be in real projects rather than public relations exercises.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I did not know whether I would be able to come to the House today.  As I listened to the speakers it struck me this was a debate in which I wished to have an input.  We have had &ldquo;do-good&rdquo; debates for the past few weeks, including a seemingly endless debate on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill.  While I know it was very worthy, I declined to speak on it because as a person who likes a glass of wine I believe it would be hypocritical of me to lecture others on what they should and should not drink.  For this reason I hesitated to show my face.  It is not as if a glass of wine is in any way dangerous, but if one enjoys a glass it seems a little odd to lecture that others should not have one.</P>
        <P>While listening to this debate I was struck by several matters which I wish to lay before the House.  Climate change is truly an international global issue and it is no overstatement to say as much.  However, by so doing we strike the fear of God in everyone.  One wonders if is there anything one poor, single person can do to help effect change and of course there is.  Climate change is a personal issue as well as an international and a national issue.  We cannot say it is all the Government&rsquo;s fault.  Nor can we say the Government must do something wonderful to address climate change overnight and if not there will be finger-wagging in the D&aacute;il next week.  All that is silly as responsibility is down to every individual.</P><Col N="647"/>
        <P Just="Left">This is why I found the &ldquo;Power of One&rdquo; campaign very interesting and heartening.  It is down to each person how he or she will address climate change.  It sounds very ordinary but I understand if one walks about the house before leaving on a Tuesday morning and plugs out every appliance it would mean quite a decrease in carbon emissions.  Imagine the impact if everyone lucky enough to have kettles, radios, televisions, clothes dryers and so on did this.  I did exactly this before I left the place where I stay in Dublin this morning &mdash; a small apartment.  It struck me that I had not done so for months, which shows how careless one can get.</P>
        <P>This brings me to my beef or crib.  Why is the campaign always painted in such penitential and punishable ways?  We hear the seas will cover Ireland again.  I recall that we were told when we were growing up that Ireland and England was one land mass and there was no division.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a long time since the Deputy grew up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I used to teach history, so I know what is in some of the history books.  The debate on climate change is painted in such biblical terms that one wonders how could one woman unplugging a kettle have any bearing on what will happen if we are all going to be submerged beneath the waters, never to rise again.  Sometimes, rather than confront what needs to be addressed, we simply push it to the back of our heads and say, like Scarlett O&rsquo;Hara in <i>Gone with the Wind</i>: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think about that another day&rdquo;.  We are inclined to put it on the back burner and say it is for someone else to address, but no one else will address these matters; it is up to every single person.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I applaud the Green Party which was convinced it could change the world overnight on the Opposition benches.  However, the reality of being in Government has shown this is not possible.  Even God Almighty cannot change the world overnight.  When the Green Party came into Government it decided it would proceed by short steps and did so.  Addressing such matters as efficient light bulbs among others seem small, but no more than the &ldquo;Power of One&rdquo; campaign when added up will render what the Green Party hoped to and will achieve in Government.  The Green Party during its term of office in Government with Fianna F&aacute;il will be able to bring about a reduction in emissions.</P>
        <P>I do not know which of the previous speakers brought up the matter of how we buy carbon credits.  I have spoken about this in the D&aacute;il and I believe it is a con-job.  The idea that a country can somehow buy carbon credits from a remote island in the Samoan ocean and that this renders the power plant in County Clare or some other guzzling installation relieved of some of its duties makes no sense.  How could that be?  We are all one global village and, therefore, it is one world.  I do not know who thought up the idea of buying of carbon credits.  It was probably some brainy civil servant and the relevant Minister nodded, agreed it sounded like a good idea, brought it further and so it became official policy.  However, this cannot be right.  The implication is some poor benighted small place in the world with no power or emissions of any kind should be allowed to sell off what it would have used to a country which has over polluted.  This does not make for an equitable or arithmetic solution.  We are only fooling ourselves.  I wish we would drop the idea because it is an erroneous path to pursue.</P>
        <P>I believe the future lies with children and young people.  It is not that I wish to divest myself of my responsibilities in this regard.  I have found that visiting schools, discussing the matter with young children and listening to my very young grandchildren, who are only beginning to talk, has revealed to me their good ideas.  They want to make changes and they do not feel exhausted and worn out as we do.  It is lashing rain outside and it looks like it will rain for the whole summer.  There are very bad weather forecasts.  There is a deepening economic gloom.  However, instead of being bogged down by all of that young people see the rainbow all the time, which is lovely for them.</P><Col N="648"/>
        <P>If we can &mdash; indoctrinate may be the wrong word and I would not like to over-use it &mdash; give our bible on how the world can be changed to young people, they could bring their common sense, youth and optimism to bear on what is truly a sizable problem.  It would be easy for us to ask what good is all our effort, given the behaviour of China and the USA.  The USA has been very tardy in coming to the table with any ideas.  One is tempted to ask what poor Ireland can do in such a climate.  However, this brings me back to what I said about the &ldquo;power of one&rdquo;, which is a concept we do not emphasise enough.  We must find some language for them and I appeal to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Green Party and all parties who wish to convey our sense of momentum and urgency about this matter to do so.  We should seek to express it in a positive way.  When one begins to read an article about climate change it is couched in such biblical, awesome terms that one is inclined to ask what the point is in installing solar panels on one&rsquo;s roof.  I hope to do that this winter.  I do not know if it will make a great change, but I am told it might.</P>

	<P>I do not know if solar panels will work or unplugging every plug in the land will work, but I believe the &ldquo;power of one&rdquo; should be emphasised more.  The message should be given in positive and optimistic terms, not gloomy and doom-laden language, which makes us all just want to dive under the duvet and stay there for the day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is good to be here discussing this important issue, which will only get more significant as the years go by.  It is important to put in context the scale of the problem we have.  Some of us on the Joint Committee on the Constitution met the Indian Ambassador a number of months ago and we were trying to wrap our heads around the scale of the Indian subcontinent.  He informed us that the Indian population increases by the same number as the population of the island of Ireland every two months.  That is the scale we are dealing with.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke quoted Scarlett O&rsquo;Hara and I will paraphrase Humphrey Bogart in that we do not amount to a hill of beans in the scheme of things.  America and China, which has a population approximately 30% bigger than India, together with India contribute over 50% of significant pollution and, in truth, they are only making very small token gestures.</P>
        <P>One must consider some positive aspect from the current price of oil.  For the first time ever, it has started to dawn on the American population that it cannot have V6 gas-guzzling engines to drive from one end of the country to the other just for fun.  It is also starting to dawn on the aircraft industry that it is not just a matter of jetting here and there on the back of cheap fuel.  There must be a balance, which I am not sure we are striking, between energy and food provision.</P>
        <P>In 1900, 70 years before I was born, the population of the world was approximately 1.5 billion.  The projected numbers for the end of this century are in the region of 20 billion, which is a massive increase.  The land producing food is reducing because of climate change.  The land which is marginal is not able to produce a crop yet the numbers of people are ever increasing.  The people of the world must certainly be fed.</P>
        <P>The way we are currently promoting the biofuels industry, whether first or second generation, will in time be considered a crime against humanity.  I am speaking as a commercial farmer.  One cannot take an acre of good land, sow a crop and expect to get between 1.75 tonnes and <Col N="649"/>2.1 tonnes of product before using the same amount of energy to press that crop that would be saved through using the product.  It would amount to three quarters of a tonne of biofuel.  One cannot make any saving to the environment this way.</P>
        <P>It has been said here that agriculture is a major polluter, which is true.  There is innovation within the agricultural sector at the moment which is not being substantially supported by Government.  Practically all funds for research and development are coming from the private sector.  I am a commercial dairy farmer and the Keenan Group is doing significant research into the reduction of gas from bovine animals, which must be considered.</P>
        <P>The position taken by the World Trade Organisation to Ireland, which will lead to a reduction in cattle numbers by 1 million, will make no difference as somebody elsewhere on the planet will take up the same production.  A carbon sink is provided by other crops, including forestry and grass.  Crops consume the negative emissions to the atmosphere and sugar beet, for example, was a superb carbon sink crop.  We lost that industry far too easily.</P>
        <P>I have been trying to promote the extraction of biomethane gas from dairy stock for some time.  This would take some research and time to look into the prospects of pooling dairy herds, putting together herds of hundreds of stock and housing them all year round while extracting biomethane gas.  Bovine stock are a negative but we should take some positive from them.  If we could extract biomethane gas we would use less diesel and petrol, which would be a benefit.</P>
        <P>A word people have studiously avoided using is &ldquo;nuclear.&rdquo;  We must accept that at some stage in the future of energy production, Ireland will not be able to ignore this type of energy.  I am not saying we must go in that direction but we must consider it.  We should open the debate on the nuclear option.</P>
        <P>France and Finland have significantly reduced their emissions and have gone very much in the direction of using nuclear energy.  We should get the debate on the table and consider the positives.  Of course there are negative aspects but we should weigh the options.</P>
        <P>The Government must be more proactive in the grants available.  Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke spoke of solar panels on rooftops but a negative aspect is the SEI not providing grants for wood log gasifiers, which are timber burners.  There is a grant for wood pellets, although there is a production cost in turning wood shavings into pellets.  We do not produce those pellets in Ireland so there is also a cost in terms of transport, as well as the cost to the environment.  I cannot understand, when wood is available freely throughout the country now with plantations available for thinnings, why people cannot use them.  The thinnings are available as a resource and a number of farmers provide them with minimal transport costs, if only burners could be grant-aided.</P>
        <P>We should consider the matter.  I pursued the issue a bit and an answer I received was silly in the extreme.  I was told that if a grant was provided for a wood log gasifier, people could burn what they wanted in it.  It is a self-defeating argument.  If somebody goes to the bother of procuring a wood log gasifier, that person will not put other products into it.</P>
        <P>I would like to see the extension of recycling centres.  If the public is given the opportunity to recycle and not shove everything they have into a landfill site, they will take it.  We are not fast enough in getting the recycling centres open to the public.</P>
        <P>I spoke to a geologist yesterday who made a very stark point.  He told me it took tens of thousands of years to produce coal, oil, gas and other products we are burning for energy, and in a matter of a few hundred years we have begun to extract and consume the products for energy and have nearly consumed it all.  I spoke of a balance at the beginning, which we must strike.  We need to achieve a balance between renewables, such as wind turbines on land and off-shore, nuclear energy and other types of renewables.</P><Col N="650"/>
        <P>If we are proactive and positive in the issue, we will make a difference.  However, if India, China and the US continue to ignore concerns, what we do in this country will have no impact whatever.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies on both sides of the House for their contributions to the debate.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, wished to take part in this important debate given his strong interest in the issue of climate change, which was the main reason the Green Party entered Government.  However, the Minister is meeting other EU Ministers of the Environment to press Ireland&rsquo;s case in the European Union&rsquo;s climate and energy package and its strategy for the next UN climate conference in December. </P>
        <P>Our modern and very busy lifestyles exert enormous pressure on our natural environment, as is evident from the scientific advice on climate change.  If climate change is allowed to continue unchecked, the consequences for humanity and the environment are almost beyond comprehension.  It is hard to believe we face the real possibility of triggering abrupt or irreversible impacts which have the potential to devastate whole countries and displace millions of people all over the world.  The scientific and economic advice points to the need for and benefits of early and effective action.</P>
        <P>Ireland is playing its part at national and European Union level and in international efforts to find an effective global response to this significant global challenge.  The ultimate objective of the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is to stabilise greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at a safe level.  Achieving this objective will entail significant changes in our lifestyle, socially and economically.  The Kyoto Protocol was only a first step in the global response to climate change and a much greater effort by developed countries in reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be required if the ultimate objective of the 1992 convention is to be achieved.</P>
        <P>The next decade will be crucial.  We have a window of opportunity for an effective global response to climate change.  Fundamental to this response is the need for global greenhouse emissions to peak within ten to 15 years and, thereafter, decline significantly by 2050.  The longer it takes to mobilise an effective global response, the higher will be the cost in human and economic terms.  The European Union is providing leadership in the international negotiations on climate change and pressing for an ambitious agenda for global action in the period to 2020 and beyond.  Ireland fully supports this proactive approach.</P>
        <P>The scientific advice underpins the need to have significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and the economic advice points to the advantages of acknowledging and embracing the inevitable change to a low carbon future.  Last January, the European Commission published a package of proposals to address EU greenhouse gas emission reductions and renewable energy targets for 2020.  As expected, the proposed individual targets are tough and raise serious economic and social issues for Ireland and other member states.  At this year&rsquo;s spring meeting of the European Council, Heads of State and Government of all 27 European Union member states endorsed the package as a good starting point and basis for agreement on the Union&rsquo;s ambitious 2020 targets.</P>
        <P>The economic and environmental realities of climate change have hit home and the firm focus within the European Union is on achieving the necessary greenhouse gas emission reductions.  The national climate change strategy sets out the measures by which Ireland will meet its Kyoto Protocol commitments and how these measures will position us to achieve further significant emission reductions in the post-2012 period.</P><Col N="651"/>
        <P>Central to the strategy are measures such as reform of energy markets, ambitious targets for renewables, participation by Ireland in the EU emissions trading scheme, record investment in public transport and substantial reduction in energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions through strengthening of building regulations.  All will play their part in Ireland reducing its greenhouse gas emissions.  The strategy has been enhanced by further measures introduced by the Government.  These include the revision of motor taxation and vehicle registration tax, strengthening the energy requirements in building regulations, the commencement of work on energy standards for lighting and a programme of expenditure on energy efficiency, including pilot funding announced in the recent budget.  These and other measures were announced by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, in his first carbon budget last December.</P>
        <P>In meeting our international and domestic targets, the Government will aim to introduce further measures to reduce national emissions.  The more we can achieve in terms of transition to a low carbon society in the Kyoto Protocol period, the better prepared we will be to manage the more demanding agenda in the period to 2020 and beyond.  We have a national climate change strategy to meet our Kyoto challenges up to 2012.  A new climate change strategy will make sense when we learn what will be are 2020 targets following the UN climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009.</P>
        <P>The Government is strongly representing Ireland&rsquo;s concerns and interests in the EU negotiations.  As Deputies noted, agriculture is an important economic sector and a major source of emissions.  We continue to press this issue with our EU partners in negotiations.  A whole-of-government approach is taken on climate change.  It is led by a special Cabinet committee on climate change and energy security chaired by the Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>On the issue of energy intensive industries, I concur that it is important to give industry greater certainty for the purposes of making investments and this point has been made in the negotiations.  Carbon leakage is an issue we also want properly addressed in the Commission&rsquo;s proposals.  I thank Deputies who contributed to this productive and, I hope, fruitful debate.</P>

	<P>The change to which the Deputy refers arises from a value for money review of the ICT support service undertaken by my Department, which will shortly be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The review concluded that while the service is generally effective and efficient, the resources currently utilised by the operation of the service from the regional education centres would be better employed in focusing supports for ICT leadership and change within each school.  The review highlights the need to ensure the integration of ICT is specifically incorporated into all support <Col N="652"/>service activities funded by my Department and that it is recognised as an integral part of all curriculum development, support and training rather than as an optional add-on.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are three vacancies among the 21 ICT adviser posts attached to the regional full-time education centres.  A further post is due to be vacated in September following the retirement of an ICT adviser.  Of the remaining 17 posts, 14 are filled by teachers on secondment from their teaching duties and three are filled on a non-secondment contract basis.  These posts have been renewed annually.  Against this background,  the education centres have been advised by the National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, that my Department is not prepared to renew secondment arrangements for the 14 teachers seconded as ICT advisers.  The NCTE has discussed the implementation of these arrangements with the education centres and the schools concerned and my Department will ensure that any difficulties arising in specific schools due to the return of the teachers concerned will be addressed.  The position of the three non-seconded ICT advisers is under consideration.</P>
        <P>The role of ICT co-ordinating teachers, with the support of school principals, will be prioritised in the provision of ongoing ICT support and advice to teachers.  Local school-based and peer-to-peer support has been identified internationally as the most effective way to further ICT integration in schools.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
<P el="0">This emphasis on in-school promotion and support for ICT integration in learning and teaching is consistent with the findings of the report of the strategy group appointed to advise on the priorities for investment in ICT in schools and the evaluation report undertaken by my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate on the impact of ICT on teaching and learning.  These reports will be published shortly.</P>
        <P>I have previously indicated to the Deputy that I am reviewing the overall financial position for my Department, having regard to spending trends to date and emerging pressures, prior to making decisions on specific areas of expenditure such as ICT in schools.  I expect to be in a position to make such decisions shortly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A key area of the ICT in schools programme is the provision of broadband connectivity to schools.  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has worked in partnership with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Telecommunications and Internet Federation on the current schools broadband programme.  I am sure the Deputy will welcome the launch this morning of the next-generation broadband policy paper, which includes the objective of equipping second-level schools with broadband connectivity of 100 Mbps and installing local area networks.  I look forward to working with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in the pursuit of this objective.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I must add to my previous reply by stating that even though the decision was taken by my predecessor, having examined the files I would have come to the same conclusion.</P>
      </Speaker>
<?oasys _cl14- ?>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I understand this decision was taken in March by the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor.  Thus, it landed on the Minister&rsquo;s desk when he was appointed.  Does the Minister think it acceptable that the way in which these ICT advisers learned of the abolition of their posts <Col N="653"/>was on a news programme on RTE on 20 June?  From March to June, nobody in either the Department or the NCTE informed the advisers of this position.  Does the Minister feel this is an acceptable way to treat professionals?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not the way I would have preferred it to be done.  I accept that.  When the decision was taken, a strategy report was available and an evaluation was carried out by the inspectorate.  To give the background to the notification process, on Friday, 20 June, the director of the NCTE first attempted to contact the chair of the Association of Teachers&rsquo; Education Centres in Ireland, ATECI, to say that the renewal of contracts would not be taking place.  Unfortunately the chair of the ATECI was not available until 4.30 p.m., at which time the issue was discussed.  Letters to the education centre directors were e-mailed at 4.45 p.m. and hard-copy letters were posted the same day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>When I raised the issue of ICT with the Minister during Question Time last May, I made the point that the Government had given a cast-iron commitment to spending &euro;252 million over the lifetime of the national development plan.  In the context of this issue and the Department&rsquo;s appalling record of supporting schools in enhancing technology, when will the Minister provide an opportunity for schools to draw down that money?  Is that money in place?</P>
        <P>Can the Minister tell the House whether the expert report given to the Department in September was doctored in any way?  Why has this report not been fully published and placed out in the open despite the statement by the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor that this was the best way to decide how to spend the money?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Under no circumstances am I aware that any doctoring of an independent report took place.  I am quite satisfied it did not.  It certainly has never come to my attention that such a thing would happen and I do not believe it would happen within the Department.  We must bear in mind the evaluation that was carried out by the inspectorate.  While it was accepted the education centres were performing a very important role, we must recognise that ICT, like education, evolves.  They were set up in the early 2000s and now, nearly nine years later, we had to have another look.  International practice would suggest it is far better to have a principal and a fully trained ICT co-ordinator within each school, providing leadership and ensuring that other teachers within the school are brought into play.</P>
        <P>One of the issues that was pertinent in this decision was the impact the service was having.  How well aware were schools of the existence of the education centres?  My information from the evaluation was that levels of recognition were quite low.  Obviously, while the centres were performing an excellent function in many ways, their impact was not equal to that of having the service within the school itself, in accordance with international practice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Will that report be published soon?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I intend to publish the evaluation and the strategy report together.  I hope to be in a position to do that next week.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 4 together.</P>
        <P>Due to demographic increases in the general population, my Department is planning for a minimum increase in primary school enrolments of some 58,000 pupils over the next five years.  This increase will require the building of about 2,300 classrooms nationwide during this time.  These extra classrooms will be provided through a combination of brand new schools in developing areas and extensions to existing schools.</P>
        <P>A total of 1,548 schools have applied to my Department for major capital projects under the school building and modernisation programme.  The projects in question vary greatly in size and priority and include renovations to existing schools, extensions and applications for new schools.  While many of these applications will require capital investment, not all are of a sufficiently high priority to warrant the expenditure of substantial capital.</P>
        <P>As I have indicated in the House and elsewhere, I am currently in the process of reviewing my Department&rsquo;s school building and modernisation programme with my officials.  I do not propose to make any further announcements on the school building programme until that review has been completed.  However, it should be noted that the current school building programme is a major programme, involving an investment of almost &euro;600 million in school buildings.  This includes the completion of construction work during the course of 2008 on 67 large-scale building projects, the opening of 26 new school buildings in rapidly developing areas, and the progression of 374 devolved projects under the permanent accommodation and small schools schemes.</P>
        <P>This level of activity under the school building programme builds on the significant achievements under the last national development plan when over 7,800 building projects were delivered to provide new and modernised educational infrastructure.</P>
        <P>As I have outlined, the current schools building programme is delivering a record number of new schools and extensions.  In response to growing demand for school accommodation in rapidly developing areas, a dedicated developing areas unit has been established within my Department&rsquo;s planning and building unit.  This unit is focused on planning solutions for the accommodation needs identified in these areas.  In addition, my Department has a programme of public private partnerships, PPPs, for the construction of new schools and I am currently examining the suitability of additional projects for inclusion in the PPP programme.</P>
        <P>While the capital funding available to my Department has increased significantly over the years, I accept that there is also a very significant level of demand from schools and that it will not always be possible to respond to this demand as rapidly as I would wish.  While there may be surplus capacity in the construction industry at present, my Department has to operate within the overall financial parameters set out in the national development plan.  Nevertheless, the financial resources being made available for school building under the current national development plan and the prudent allocation of these resources will see continued improvements in the quantity and quality of the accommodation available in Irish schools.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="655"/>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Having been recently appointed to his post, is the Minister surprised that the Department has been totally taken by surprise by demographic figures that were boasted about by his Government colleagues when speaking of the growth in the labour force?  Was there no joined-up thinking between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and the Minister&rsquo;s Department, which, ironically, is called the Department of Education and Science?  Surely it was recognised that an increase in the labour force would mean an increase in the children of those extra workers knocking on school doors.  What effective action has been taken to deal with this massive managerial deficit in the Department?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Is the Minister confirming for the House the statement made during the debate on the Estimates?  It was said that just under &euro;600 million would be invested in the schools building programme.  This would mean the completion of work on the 67 large projects, the opening of 26 schools, although the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor announced 27, and the completion of work on over 150 devolved projects.  Are these projects to go ahead in this calendar year or has the Minister frozen financial commitments contained in the figures he quoted and further decisions on the release of moneys as a result of the review that will not be completed until September?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I was asked whether the Department anticipated this and I am in the best possible position because I was previously the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with responsibility for housing, urban renewal and developing areas.  During my time in that post I arranged full contact with the Department of Education and Science because local authorities would influence the availability of sites and so on.  A developing areas team was established at that time within the Department of Education and Science.  Meetings between the Departments are ongoing and there is much integration and understanding.  Before I left the housing office, we arrived at a situation where local authority city and county managers were prepared to anticipate demand and purchase sites on behalf of the Department of Education and Science.  There is evidence of this all over Dublin.  The level of co-operation I received from city and county managers was outstanding and there was much joined-up thinking and joined-up action between the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Education and Science.</P>
        <P>I was asked whether the difficulties that were to arise were not anticipated within the Department of Education and Science.  There was not a lack of anticipation but migration patterns tend to favour certain locations and approaching April to June of 2007 there was an indication that there would be serious issues with regard to finding places in developing regions of the greater Dublin area.  This was handled extremely well, with the co-operation of local authorities and others, to ensure that by the end of September all the people were accommodated.</P>
        <P>Regarding the programme, Deputy Quinn will understand that the previous Minister announced around 54 projects.  Some 24 of these were allowed to go to construction phase.  My arrival at the Department coincided with a change in economic circumstances and, as a result, I had to review Departmental spending.  I am well into the review at this point, although until Cabinet takes a collective decision I will not know for sure what finances are available for the remainder of the year.  I am confident that I can produce a construction programme in the latter part of 2008 but I cannot outline the extent of it this afternoon.  By September I will be in a strong position to outline what can and cannot be achieved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister referred to the 54 projects announced by his predecessor last February and said 24 have gone ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I think it was actually 26 projects.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="656"/>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Where stand the remainder?  They are obviously in limbo.  The standard reply we get to parliamentary questions is &ldquo;however, in the light of current competing demands on the capital budget for the Department, it is not possible to give any indicative timescale for the progression of this project&rdquo;.  The previous Minister for Education and Science said in February that a further list would be announced after Easter but, obviously, that time has passed and no announcement has been made.  Should we expect, therefore, that the Minister will indicate a timescale for the remainder of the 54 that were originally announced in February in addition to those that should have been announced at Easter?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister have a timescale for the completion of the review that is taking place in the Department?  Will he announce the outcome of this review?  The Minister says there is now an indicative group established in the Department for these projects.  I know of a particular case in which no capital expenditure demand is placed on the Department and in which a programme is being put in place, under a PPP scheme, with the Department.  The physical building, completed to the standards required of the Department of Education and Science and fully fitted, is being provided on the site for the Minister and the Department to consider without any capital demand.  It will be leased back to the Department for a period to be agreed at the Minister&rsquo;s discretion.  Surely this is an opportunity for the Minister because there is a dire need for projects to proceed urgently.  The Minister cannot turn his back on such a proposal if there is any understanding in the Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>There were about five questions there.  When I came into the Department, I had to examine spending within the terms of the budget.  I indicated clearly that, given the downturn in revenue, it would take me some time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to examine what could and could not be achieved.  I confirmed to Deputy Quinn this afternoon that I have made much progress regarding what has been spent and what we will be capable of in September.  I must wait to see what the Government decision is on overall spending for the rest of 2008 before I can make a complete decision on what can and cannot go ahead.  I have indicated this afternoon that I believe I will be in a position to make some announcements in September on a building programme for the latter part of 2008 and into 2009.  </P>
        <P>At a time when our finances have taken a downturn it is important that we be as innovative as possible.  I want to make it clear to the Opposition and everyone else that if people have innovative ideas, I will listen to them.</P>
        <P>Regarding Deputy Burke&rsquo;s point, we must always remember that the Secretary General of the Department will always be answerable to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In taking on board any particular scheme, one has to have regard to the borrowing power of the Department &mdash; the level at which it can borrow.  It is obvious that no charge can be more than the long-term cost of the borrowing to the Department.  We will have to have a serious look at how competitive is the offer mentioned by the Deputy.  It is obvious that if it is competitive, we will be happy to take it on board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Do I take it from the Minister&rsquo;s reply that the Revised Estimate his predecessor announced in this House on 24 April last no longer stands, in effect?  Is it the case that the commitment to 67 large-scale projects in the primary sector, 26 new schools and 150 other works no longer stands?  The Minister has put all projects which have not yet started on-<Col N="657"/>site under review.  He intends to make a decision in September on the projects which have been put on hold.  He will communicate that decision to those involved at that stage.  He is taking four months of capital spending out of the Estimate, in effect.  I am sure it will be the end of September by the time the outcome of the review is communicated to the people in question.  At that stage, there will be less than two calendar months remaining in the year in which cheques can be cashed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not the case that a massive cutback, in real terms, is being dressed up as a review?  The reality is that there will be less than seven weeks left in which money can flow on to a building site or into the pockets of building workers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Can the Minister give a definitive answer in respect of the many schools to which specific promises and guarantees were issued?  On 15 May 2007, a guarantee was given to Kinvara secondary school that everything would be up and running within 12 months.  A deadline applies in that case.  The Sisters have given some leeway to the Department and the board of management so that the school can enjoy a continuous intake.  Some 15 months have passed since the guarantee was given, but the project is still not finished.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> if, regarding the two rulings made against his Department by a rights commissioner, where two part-time teachers were awarded &euro;100,000 in total salary arrears, he will quantify the amount owed to teachers as a result of this failure to implement the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[26516/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Deputy that the Department of Education and Science is aware of the issues relating to the pay adjustments which are due to certain part-time teachers under the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001.  It has worked closely with school management bodies and teacher unions to ensure the legislation is implemented and applied to teachers fairly and consistently.  The Department has made pay adjustments and paid arrears to the majority of part-time teachers, including substitute teachers, who are on the payrolls it directly administers.  It has funded VECs to do likewise for part-time teachers on their payrolls.  Part-time teachers who are employed on a part-time basis by individual boards of management of primary schools have yet to receive adjusted pay and arrears.  There is a grant system in place to allow the boards to claim from the Department the funding required to pay such teachers.  The boards of management pay part-time teachers directly.  Such teachers are mainly employed by schools as resource teachers for special needs pupils, as language support assistants for newcomer pupils or under the modern languages primary schools initiative.</P>
        <P>Under the Protection of Employees (Part-time Work) Act 2001, qualified eligible part-time teachers are entitled to be paid salaries appropriate to their qualifications and to receive incremental credits for their relevant teaching service.  The Department decided to extend the single payroll process for all other teachers in primary, secondary and community and comprehensive schools, rather than persisting with the practice of having boards pay them directly, to ensure that the terms of the 2001 Act could be applied to part-time teachers who are paid directly by school boards.  This approach ensures that teachers who have served part-time in more than one school can get full credit for their overall service.  Software development is well advanced on the required extension to the payroll system.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to assess the amount of money due to individual teachers, or in aggregate, because the Department holds no records on the teachers concerned.  To calculate the correct salary details, the Department needs to obtain a complete service history for the teachers in question from each of the schools involved.  This information will be added to the payroll database to make any salary adjustments needed when entitlements under the legislation are matched to the service history of the teachers.  Under the implementation schedule, the collection of this service history data will begin when primary schools reopen in the autumn.  All part-time teachers will be paid directly on the teachers&rsquo; payroll from 2009.  The system will have the capacity to pay arrears due on the basis of past service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to focus on the real problem that exists at present, rather than the payroll system that will be introduced in the 2008-09 school year.  I understand that up to 1,000 part-time teachers have not been paid the correct amounts for their work over the past seven years.  Will the Minister give the House an indication of the total financial liability the Department of Education and Science will face when the review has been completed?  Will he confirm that arrears of &euro;100,000 &mdash; &euro;60,000 in one case and &euro;40,000 in the other &mdash; had to be repaid to two teachers in the cases, taken at rights commissioner level, which were brought to the Minister&rsquo;s attention in a brief when he took over as Minister for Education and Science?  Will he also confirm the total number of cases taken by part-time teachers which are before <Col N="659"/>rights commissioners or the courts at present?  I presume he will face a huge financial bill as a result of the incompetence of the Department of Education and Science in enforcing this legislation.</P>
        <P>When the Minister read the departmental brief on this matter when he took office, what was his view?  What was his reaction when he read the part of the brief which suggested that the Department&rsquo;s failure to pay the appropriate rate of salary to part-time teachers could lead to it being found to have acted unlawfully?  This problem has emerged seven years after the enactment of legislation that was supposed to give part-time workers the same rights as permanent workers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>My first reaction was to ensure that those who are entitled to increased wages are paid those wages as soon as possible.  As the Deputy is aware, a substantial process of negotiation and discussion took place before agreement was reached on the payments.  It was agreed by all the stakeholders in the agreement that those who are on the direct payroll should be paid immediately.  Unfortunately, information about the system that applied to part-time teachers, including resource teachers, in primary schools, was not available on the Department&rsquo;s database.  Under the system that was used, the Department paid two moieties to each school.  The board of management of each school paid each part-time teacher directly.  We have started to obtain all the relevant information.  It is not as easy as it sounds because some teachers work in a number of different schools.  The collation of this information is difficult and time-consuming.  We want to be as fair to everybody as we can.  We have made contact with all the schools to ask them to supply the information.

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> the steps he is taking to address the English language deficit of legally resident migrants; the steps which have been taken to date to provide additional resources to vocational education committees to take <Col N="660"/>over the operation of the Integrate Ireland Language and Training programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[26392/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The English language needs of legally resident migrants are being addressed on a number of fronts. </P>
        <P>First, there are currently almost 2,000 English language resource teachers working in our primary and post-primary schools at an annual cost of some &euro;120 million.  This number has increased from 262 teachers in 2001-02.  I believe most Members will accept that this is a significant upping of resources.</P>
        <P>The arrangements for enhanced provision of English language resource teachers were set out in a circular from my Department which issued to schools in May 2007.  The previous restriction of two such teachers per school was removed and a two-year limit of English language classes for the students was also lifted, where a specific request is made.  A school with more than 121 pupils with English language needs can now have six English language resource teachers.  Resource materials, including intercultural guidelines and assessment kits, have been prepared and provided to assist teachers with this work.</P>
        <P>Second, for adult migrants the network of VECs throughout the country provides English language classes.  In 2007 there were approximately l3,000 students attending these English language classes at a cost to the Exchequer, or to the VECs, of approximately &euro;10 million.</P>
        <P>Third, Integrate Ireland Language and Training, IILT, provided English language classes to immigrants with refugee status.  In 2007, just over 900 learners attended IILT courses at 12 centres around Ireland.  Due to turnover, approximately 450 students are in  direct tuition at any one time.</P>
        <P>IILT approached my Department earlier this year with a proposal to withdraw from direct tuition for adult refugees and with a request that this tuition be mainstreamed.  IILT envisaged continuing direct tuition for a group of up to 200 programme refugees, namely, those on the resettlement programme.  I accepted that mainstreaming of service provision was appropriate as it accords with the overall approach to provision of services to migrants as set out in Migration Nation &mdash; A Statement by the Government on Integration Strategy and Diversity Management, a report I wrote myself and recently launched.</P>
        <P>In this context, it was decided that all direct tuition provision should be mainstreamed and provided by VECs as it would be less efficient to seek to continue with a small element of provision by IILT.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P el="0">The funding allocated to IILT will now be redirected to provide for the continuation of this service to refugees through the VEC network.  The Irish Vocational Education Association, IVEA, has confirmed that it is happy to co-operate and collaborate with my Department in the delivery of English language services through its nationwide network of 33 VECs.  The VEC sector has already developed best practice in teaching English for speakers of other languages, ESOL.</P>
        <P>My Department has already had discussions with the IVEA with a view to ensuring a smooth transition to the system.  An independent review was commissioned to develop a national English language policy and framework for legally resident adult immigrants.  The review involved extensive stakeholder consultations.  I await the report and recommendations which will inform the future development of provision for adult immigrants.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The statement issued by the Department announced that, via the VECs, the Department would immediately take over the provision of the service for refugees. <Col N="661"/> I presume that means from 1 August.  If that is the case why was the IVEA approached to come into the Department about this matter only last week?  What additional funding will be provided to the VECs?  What funding over and above that provided to IILT will be given to the VECs?  Surely it will cost more money if it is to be mainstreamed rather than continue as the pilot scheme in place to date.  </P>
        <P>Why have the VECs not yet been given any indication of the additional funding that will be provided?  They must have this service in place within less than a month.  Is it not the case that, because of the lack of adequate funds, funding will be taken away from the training and education of the indigenous population to support this scheme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise to the Deputy because time did not allow me to read the full answer into the record of the House.  I assure him and anybody else concerned about this issue that this particular service is being mainstreamed.  The provision for IILT service will be incorporated in the overall provision that the VECs will now deliver in place of IILT.  This service is now to be mainstreamed through the network of 33 VECs across the country so there is absolutely no question of there being a shortfall.  The cost will be absorbed by mainstream spending through the VECs which is very good news for the service and for migrants in particular.  Rather than being on a pilot basis the service will be part of the conventional provision made by the Department.  Any funding that IILT had will be given to the VEC structure and network.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  In light of that information is it not the case that there is to be no additional funding over and above what was given to IILT?  As a result the money will be spread over 33 centres instead of 14.  Is it not a fact that the existing services provided by the VECs around the country will be directly impacted as a result of this decision?</P>
        <P>What specific provision is being made to retain the staff and expertise developed over the past nine years by IILT?  I understand that the IVEA recommended this expertise should be incorporated into the VECs throughout the country.  Will the Minister of State give a specific recommendation that the staff be taken on in this manner?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>From the point of view of Government it is very clear what is happening.  IILT is a private not-for-profit company based on the Trinity College campus.  It makes the decisions with regard to this matter.  It approached the Department with a view to ending its service because it is delighted, as we are, that it is now to be mainstreamed.  The decisions will be made by the company in the first instance, with regard to redundancy payments and entitlements.  In terms of the actual provision, the VEC network was enthusiastic about taking on this particular challenge.  It is not looking at the situation as a burden that will involve extra stress or pressure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The CEOs around the country are saying that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The VEC officials are in direct discussions with me.  I have spoken to them twice within the past week and my officials are in constant contact&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>They are extremely concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The priority from my officials&rsquo; point of view is that there be a seamless transition to the mainstream option.  That will happen in July and August this year and nobody will be at a loss because of it.  </P>
        <P>With regard to the staffing issues and the expertise the Deputy referred to as being lost, namely, the 40 teachers who are ably represented by SIPTU, that is a matter for negotiation between that union and the staff and management involved from IILT.  Obviously any decision <Col N="662"/>by the VECs to employ any of those 40 teaching staff who will lose their jobs because of IILT&rsquo;s decision to close will be a matter for the VECs.  I cannot dictate to them that they should employ one person over another.  From the point of view of the VECs, the employment of staff will involve an open competition.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> if additional funds will be provided by his Department to schools to pay for water rates; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[26217/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very much aware of the cost pressures on schools, including those arising from the changes in water charges.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Primary schools now get over &euro;178 per pupil to meet their day-to-day running costs.  This is an increase of nearly 70% on the 2002 rate of &euro;105 and &euro;15 more per child than they got last year.  Post-primary schools have also seen improvements in funding and through a similar &euro;15 increase this year now receive &euro;331 per pupil.  These increases are significant and well ahead of the consumer price index increases for the same period.</P>
        <P>The position on water charges is that the Government agreed a transition period to full water charges in the case of non-fee charging recognised schools and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has advised local authorities of the detailed arrangements regarding the implementation of this decision.</P>
        <P>The transitional arrangements afford schools the opportunity to put in place water conservation arrangements and practices and to undertake works that can help reduce water usage significantly before full water charges are introduced.  By virtue of good water conservation, schools can be in a much stronger position to reduce the impact of water charges on their overall budgets.  Guidance was also recently issued to schools on the most appropriate measures to minimise excess consumption of water and to reduce wastage where it occurs.  In addition, water conservation issues will continue to be addressed by my Department as a matter of routine where new schools are being built or where major renovations are being carried out to existing schools under the schools modernisation programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department remains in close liaison with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding water conservation and is supportive of any initiatives by it and local authorities that will help reduce water costs for schools.</P>
        <P>The funding needs of schools generally and the support I can give them to help them meet day-to-day running costs are a matter that I will be considering in the context of next year&rsquo;s Estimates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister is aware, schools are trying to keep their heads above water in terms of a range of new costs, particularly heating and fuel costs.  One charge on foot of which most schools are having to pay through the nose is the new water charge.  For example, water charges levied on all the schools in the area of South Dublin County Council have more <Col N="663"/>than doubled over the past five years.  Will the Minister conduct a nationwide survey of all the local authorities to determine exactly what increases have occurred in recent years?  Bearing in mind the transition period between now and January 2010, what enhanced capitation and other benefits will the Minister give to schools next year to ensure they will not have to pay the very excessive water charges they expect at present?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is difficult enough to run my own Department, not to mention trying to run the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has many Ministers to help him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I will raise Deputy Brian Hayes&rsquo;s point on local authorities with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, to determine the exact differences that exist.</P>
        <P>Deputy Brian Hayes referred to increases and claimed the Government committed to addressing the issue of charges in the programme for Government.  The programme states, &ldquo;Examine the provision of waste and water allowances to schools, with charges becoming effective after these agreed allowances are exceeded&rdquo;.  There is absolutely no commitment but a reference to examining the matter.</P>
        <P>The green flag concept is outstanding.  It involves three phases, the first pertaining to waste management, the second to energy conservation and the third to water conservation.  We have issued guidelines to each of the schools on how they can minimise the impact of water charges.  Regulatory efforts are being made so many schools can carry out a project, at very little cost, to ensure they will decrease their water consumption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Department of Education and Science be able to fund or make a contribution towards the introduction of water meters for schools so they can measure their improved performance?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The introduction of water meters is currently a matter between the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the schools involved.  I did not make a commitment but indicated quite strongly that I would determine the help I could give schools, primary schools in particular, in terms of capitation in line with the 2009 Estimates.  We should improve the level of capitation, particularly to primary schools, and I intend to prioritise this.  It is important to note that capitation for a school with 300 pupils amounts to &euro;100,000 per annum.  Many schools, therefore, are doing particularly well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>They are coining it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>We provided for a 44% increase in capitation last year and, therefore, significant improvements have already been made.  There is an action plan for the DEIS schools in disadvantaged areas and &euro;19 million was allocated to meet their needs.  Much work is being done and considerable funding is being invested in the system.</P>

     <QRef></QRef>
   </Qst> 
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to talk specifically about the report but will talk about the plans, if that is in order.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to answer these questions.  I confirm there are management changes taking place in the Health Service Executive.  Work has been proceeding on these changes since the middle of last year.  The CEO of the HSE recruited consultants to help him and the board of the executive to devise an appropriate organisational structure for the executive.  Considerable work preceded the passage of the legislation to establish a unified service in 2004.  Some called for its establishment as long ago as 1980.  The legislation does not need to be changed as it provides flexibility to the CEO, which is appropriate, to delegate functions and organise the management structure as he or she sees fit.  This must obviously be with the authority of the board of the HSE.</P>
        <P>I have been in discussions with the HSE for quite some time.  As we know, the higher review group on public pay drew attention last year to the need to have greater clarity regarding the management roles in the HSE.  More recently, the Fitzgerald report drew attention to the systemic weaknesses in governance and management in regard to the events in Portlaoise.  Following this, on 4 March, I wrote to the chairman of the HSE asking him whether the deficiencies identified in Portlaoise had wider application.  In that context, the HSE is proposing it will continue with nine national directors but will consolidate, into one pillar, the National Hospitals Office and primary, community and continuing care.  It believes it is appropriate when providing an integrated service to patients to merge the two pillars into one, not just at the top but right down the line.  I support this.</P>
        <P>Merging the pillars will mean that, at hospital level, there will not be confusion over whether a home care package comes from the hospital budget or another budget.  The merger of the pillars will allow for a more effective response to the needs of patients.  The population health directorate will be entering a new planning unit which will have different care managers.  This will be headed by a director of planning, who will effectively be the person responsible for setting standards, making strategic plans and overseeing the implementation of change.  The communications functions will be at directorial level.  These are the changes taking place.</P>
        <P>The HSE will continue to have nine national directors.  It is simply a question of reorganising what they do, and particularly of elevating the post of director of communications to directorate level.  All the directors will report to the CEO of the organisation and will carry out the responsibilities delegated by the CEO.  There will be no increase in head count.  Rather, when the new management structure is in place, as will occur over the coming months, the contrary will be the case.</P>
        <P>At local level we want to consult stakeholders, particularly employees, on local arrangements and this will take some time.  The intention is to recruit the directors at national level very quickly.</P>
        <P>Recently, a new head of human resources started with the HSE.  I had written to the HSE asking it to fill these posts because many posts at national level are held by people in an acting capacity, rather than by people who have been appointed to the positions.  Clearly, that is <Col N="665"/>unsatisfactory for an organisation that now is more than three years old.  Consequently, I am delighted to note that a new head of human resources started recently with the HSE and he will be charged with overseeing the implementation of the new approach.</P>
        <P>Essentially, what is happening in this regard is that many of the decisions that currently require approval at central level are being devolved to a more local level in respect of service delivery.  One of the deficiencies identified in the Portlaoise report was that some people were managers for delivery of service, while also being involved in many strategic and national initiatives, such as negotiating with consultants or whatever.  Clearly, those who have the responsibility to manage the delivery of services cannot focus completely on such delivery if they also are involved in national issues.  The new organisational changes that are being made will bring an end to this, which is appropriate.</P>
        <P>Many people have called for greater clarity and accountability.  Many human resources gurus and management consultants have stated and advised &mdash; one telephoned me in this regard today &mdash; that to be able to devolve appropriately, one must centralise.  One must know one&rsquo;s organisation and its capability.  The HSE was not simply a merger of ten health boards and the Regional Health Authority.  It also involved the merger within it of more than 50 different organisations.  Clearly, before one even contemplates something like a redundancy plan, one must know what one&rsquo;s resources are, what resources one requires and what such resources should do.  Notwithstanding the calls for redundancy programmes, the idea of a redundancy programme could not be entertained until clear organisational structure and lines of accountability were in place.  As I noted earlier, this is a forerunner to giving consideration to what redundancy programme might be put in place, obviously on a voluntary basis.</P>
        <P>Many of the changes that now are taking place have been called for in this House.  More recently, the Labour Party outlined in a six-point plan proposals on how the Health Service Executive could function more appropriately.  Some of these developments must be music to the ears of those in IMPACT and other trade unions who believed the decision making and day-to-day delivery of services to be over-centralised.</P>
        <P>Finally, this change will involve an increase in neither budget nor headcount and will involve no change to legislation.  Clearly, however, as Minister for Health and Children, notwithstanding the operational nature of the HSE&rsquo;s remit, it also is my responsibility to ensure that appropriate management and governance exists within the HSE.  This is the reason the Department of Health and Children and I have been involved in detailed discussions over the past 12 months pertaining to the changes that now will be put into effect and which were communicated to the worker representatives through the unions this morning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does this constitute an admission that the centralised structure, which was the Minister&rsquo;s big idea a couple of years ago, has failed?  This is how it appears to me.  While I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s reference to the Labour Party&rsquo;s proposals, I am unsure whether her proposals closely resemble them.  On the one hand, the Minister spoke of not being more centralised while, on the other, I understand that everyone will report to nine national directors at central level.  The Minister should clarify this point because I now am more confused about what is being proposed than I was after reading this morning&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>.</P>
        <P>Are regional structures proposed?  The article that appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> today suggested that such regional structures were proposed.  The Minister has made no mention of regional structures and were such structures not proposed, I would welcome it because the Labour Party seeks the devolution of decision making down as close as possible to the patient&rsquo;s level.  If the Minister states she agrees with the Labour Party proposal, its Members are on her side in that regard.</P><Col N="666"/>
        <P>I wish to question the Minister in respect of a number of issues.  First, how is one supposed to believe this?  On the introduction of the HSE, Members were told there would be fewer layers of management and more staff on the front line.  However, the complete opposite happened.  Will more than 600 managers still be at grade eight and above?  Before the establishment of the HSE, one could count such managers on two hands.  The Minister stated there would not be an increase in staff.  However, where will such staff be located and will new people be brought in?  The Minister mentioned a couple of new posts and mentioned various directorates as new posts.  Can the Minister explain to Members what exactly will happen in respect of staff?  Does she intend to thin out the existing top management levels?</P>
        <P>In addition, the Minister stated that, essentially, she would make decision making more streamlined between community and hospital care.  Can she explain exactly how she proposes to so do?  Will this take place at local level or does the Minister continue to refer to an entity that is led from the top, is centrally controlled and in which those who wish to make a decision in their patients&rsquo; interests are obliged to go to the top?</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I noted at the outset, I am considerably more confused now than I was after reading the newspaper this morning because the Minister now appears to be stating there will not be regional structures.  I seek clarity on whether there will be such structures.  As for the implementation of this initiative, has consultation taken place?  What is going on and to whom is the Minister talking?  Has the measure been costed and has the Minister done her homework in respect of how it is to be implemented from the perspective of personnel and so on?</P>
        <P>It appears that what has been proposed is a good deal more confusing than the existing structures.  Having read the Fitzgerald report on Portlaoise, it noted, for example, that when meetings were held on what to do, although five different kinds of managers attended such meetings, not a single clinician did so.  The meetings were attended by network managers, safety managers, hospital managers and all sorts of managers.  How will the Minister&rsquo;s proposals address the need to have clear decision-making processes at the level of the patient and which do not constitute a continuation of the mess that is the HSE at present, in which no one who tries to make decisions that are close to the patient has the power to so do but is obliged to refer them up the line?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>First, regional structures exist at present.  On the hospital side there are eight network managers and on the community and primary care side, four regional structures are in place.  Implementation units probably are what are being envisaged under these proposals, whereby the two will be together.  For example, in the case of a long-stay patient in a hospital, the responsibility for funding either a home care package or a long-stay place rests not with the hospital, but with the primary and continuing community care division.  This leads to many service deficiencies and we want it to be integrated as close to the patient as possible in order that someone on the ground can make that decision and that such a decision will not be inhibited because it affects someone else&rsquo;s budget.</P>

	<P>So far so good.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>As for the new directorates, I wish to make clear that the people at the top, including the chief executive officer, are responsible for strategy, standards and configuration of services, such as, for example, the cancer plan.  Professor Keane is implementing the cancer plan and this is a national role.  Clearly, however, he has people at local level who are responsible for implementing it in Cork, Galway, Dublin or wherever.  I wish to <Col N="667"/>distinguish between service delivery, that is, the implementation of the strategy, and the people who are responsible at the top.  In this regard, there will be a new post of clinical affairs director.  I believe it is extremely important to have a clinician at national level with responsibility for risk assessment, protocols and the kind of issues that have emerged in recent years.  The public has much greater confidence in a clinical response than in one from someone who does not have a clinical background.  In fairness, Professor Drumm identified this deficiency approximately one year ago.  He has put this in place at local level, including the Deputy&rsquo;s own area, where she is familiar with Professor Lyons who has responsibility for the implementation of the changes there.  I believe this will work well.</P>
        <P>The communications job is being elevated to director level because, as the Fitzgerald report highlighted and Members are aware, the HSE faces a major communications challenge to communicate what it is doing and to inspire confidence in the wonderful new things that are happening.  I have stated in other fora that the HSE is somewhat like German unification.  While it was known the principle was right, it takes one a long time to put together all the pieces.  The current cancer plan, which is based on eight centres, would not have been developed had the health boards continued in existence because a number of areas will not have a designated centre.  Similarly, we would not have consistency and uniformity in the way nursing home standards are being implemented.  We would not have the current focus on where services are provided if the local hospital, as the Taoiseach said here the night he was elected, was the centre of the medical universe.  We know high quality service cannot be provided at local level.  None of that is possible without a unified organisation and I remain convinced it is the right way to go.  As the Deputy is aware, other countries are going down the unified organisation route but that is not inconsistent with ensuring that for the day-to-day delivery of service, responsibility rests as close as possible to where services are provided.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy asked me about front-line staff on which I have given the statistics previously.  It is wrong to say there has been an increase in administration staff at the expense of front-line staff but it is true that under the old health board regime there were many people in managerial roles with various titles and when a single organisation came together, both as a result of that and through IR issues that arose in connection with it, there was greater clarity on that aspect.  I look forward to a reduction in the number of people in management positions but a precursor to that must be to have clear lines of accountability and responsibility before we go down a redundancy route.  The purpose is to reduce the layers of bureaucracy.</P>
        <P>On the Portlaoise issue, which the Deputy mentioned, one of the criticisms was that the person responsible for the hospital was also involved in a great deal of national activity and clearly one cannot do the two.  That is why it is important that some people are concerned with the national focus.  In some countries some people are involved with the reform and others get on with the delivery of the services on a day-to-day basis.  That is what is happening here and it makes a great deal of sense.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to take this Private Notice Question on a rather miserable July day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not responsible for that.  I hope the Deputy is not blaming me for it.</P>

	<P>Climate change.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>No, but the Minister&rsquo;s Government is responsible for the misery patients suffer under the Health Service Executive and that we must suffer in terms of the finances of the country.</P>
        <P>Like Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, I am no clearer now on the position and I want to ask the Minister a specific question.  It is reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> that there will be four or possibly eight <Col N="668"/>new regional management structures.  Is the Minister telling the House there will be new management structures regionally or there will not because it is not clear from what she has said?  It said also that the existing services would be broken up and existing management structures streamlined.  If that is not true, I would like the Minister to clearly indicate that.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned redundancies, something we have all looked for, but it is clear that should have been done before the HSE was formed.  The Minister coming into the House and talking about more changes in anticipation of redundancies down the road is a recurring theme because whether it is cancer services she referred to or other services, removing existing services today on a promise of something wonderful to come tomorrow is wrong.  We now have another plan that promises to deliver something further down the line.  The Minister&rsquo;s promises have not been well kept.  She promised there would not be any health cuts, but there were, and she promised they would not hurt patients, but they did.</P>
        <P>Some time ago I asked the four questions I felt had to be answerable by management in the HSE.  They were not answerable in either the Fitzgerald report or the Doherty report.  Can the Minister give us a guarantee as a result of this measure that in the future management will be able to say who made the decision, why it was made, what it cost and, most important, how it impacted on patient care because none of this matters a whit if that is not the net result?</P>
        <P>Furthermore, anybody in the HSE should be able to say what is their job, who they report to and who reports to them.  If, as a result of these changes, the Minister can say those questions can be answered she will have done a good day&rsquo;s work but, unfortunately, I do not believe from what the Minster has said that that will be the case.</P>
        <P>Another recurring theme of the Government is that the Minister intends to promote the communications director to that of national director.  If that director was to control internal communication, which is a major deficit within the HSE, that might be something we could applaud the Minister for, but I have a sneaking suspicion, having listened to her outline all the wonderful work going on in the HSE that must be communicated to the wider public, that we are back to another Transport 21 situation where &euro;15 million was spent on explaining to people why Transport 21 is not being delivered while telling them about all the great measures that will be taken.</P>
        <P>The same is being done with the HSE.  It seems to be a case of more money spent with very little gain for the patient.  That is the major issue.  How will patients benefit from this measure?  Rather than the philosophical, patient centred wonderful words we heard from the Minister, we should see some action because we have seen no action that has resulted in true improvements for patients.</P>
        <P>The Minister has told us in the past, as has the chief executive of the HSE, that services have improved, the figures are much better etc., yet independent figures taken from the Irish Association for Emergency Medicine show that in Beaumont Hospital the figures for the number of people lying on trolleys for over 12 hours waiting for a bed in April of last year were in the region of 380.  Last April the figure was 904.  It is the same in Galway.  The figure was 185 in April last year while this year in April the figure was 444.  That is one of the regions that will be a centre of excellence for cancer services, which are being delivered to an excellent standard currently in Mayo and Sligo, but the Minister wants to remove them and locate them in Galway where there is no adequate parking, there is a &euro;4.6 million ICU suite that cannot be used because there is no staff and in April or May they were already &euro;4.6 million over their budget.  I do not know what the figure is now.  There are all the signs of overcrowding, with the accident and emergency figures and MRSA.</P>
        <P>I believe the Minister has taken notes of the main question but I want to ask one other question.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>To repeat again, I remain a strong fan of a unified service.  I will give the figures for the cancer plan because it is so important.  Our outcomes in Ireland &mdash; 18th out of 23 countries in Europe &mdash; are very bad.  It is important that we put in place the appropriate services for cancer patients, but that did not happen.  We saw what happened in the midlands when there was a piece of the action for every hospital in the region and we could not get multidisciplinary expert care.</P>

	<P>Deputy Reilly will always go on about the measures that do not work.  Every vested interest in the health system that has a whinge seems to be able to get it aired on the floor of the House but the reality is that accident and emergency services have improved greatly since the establishment of the HSE, and the Deputy knows that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>It has not.  I refute that.</P>

	<P>Any merger would do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot do that.  I have no expertise in this area but I have spoken to quite a few people in other sectors who have and they all say that we need to centralise before we devolve and know what we have in place.  For Professor Drumm or the board of the HSE to decide before the organisation was put together who they would get rid of would not have made sense.  Some people, like CEOs, went because we abolished their jobs by law&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The organisation has to be put into effect before deciding the management structure that is required, the individuals or whatever.  The idea is to have fewer layers of bureaucracy.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked me about regional structures.  We have regional structures currently.  We have eight network managers for hospitals and four such persons for community continuing care.  In the first instance they will be brought together because it does not make sense to have them separate.  We want to have consultation with stakeholders and the HSE should have consultation.  It is the employer, either directly or indirectly, of 130,000 people.  It wants to and should have consultation with stakeholders, community groups and others.  What the shape of those operational units will be &mdash; whether there will be six or eight &mdash; is not yet determined.  It is around that ballpark figure on which they are having discussions.  The first measure taken today was that the structure agreed by the board and supported by me, my Department and the Government was put forward to the IMPACT union and other unions today.  That is the first step because, obviously, it affects many people who work in the organisation.</P><Col N="670"/>
        <P>I was asked about a voluntary redundancy programme.  I remain committed to a redundancy programme, once we know what we want to do by way of numbers and what is required to do the job.  In particular, we do not want to lose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>It is not.  This State does not have a good history of redundancy programmes.  Sometimes the best people go and then they come back as consultants.  We want to ensure before a redundancy programme is devised that we put this organisational structure in place.</P>
        <P>On communications, even Deputy Reilly&rsquo;s own organisation, Fine Gael, has a director of communications, who is an excellent person.  Surely an organisation that spends a budget of &euro;16 billion is entitled to have a director of communications at a reasonable level.  I do not think anybody would begrudge that.  It is important for internal communications and for external communications.</P>
        <P>All of the directors report to the CEO.  Professor Drumm remains the CEO for the organisation.  He is given significant powers in the legislation that established the organisation to delegate etc.  He remains responsible and people report to him.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I have three short questions.  First, will the improvement in the management structures planned in the regional areas improve delivery of services for persons with disability?</P>
        <P>My second question relates to the communications challenge.  The Minister accepted there is a negative image of sections of HSE services.  How do we improve that?</P>
        <P>My third question relates to the redundancies.  The sum of &euro;30 million would appear to be a high cost.  How does one prevent top quality staff leaving the senior management and medical sections of the HSE?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister aware that it seems to be official policy that an elderly person who is seeking accommodation in long-stay nursing home facilities is being told officially in a letter I received yesterday that one of the ways of doing so is to remain in a bed in a public hospital until a place in a public nursing home facility becomes available?  In other words, we are now being told that one brings somebody through accident and emergency into a hospital to remain in a bed until a place becomes available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an important issue but perhaps it would be more suited to an Adjournment debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Is this official policy, which I received by way of letter yesterday?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>If I could start with Deputy Barrett, I would be horrified to think that it was an official letter.  I would like to see the letter, if he would share it with me.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="671"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a letter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course it is not the policy.  The policy is to allocate long-stay beds to those who need them most.  In fact, the policy is very much to keep people out of long-term care and to encourage people to stay at home with home-care packages and clinical support.  From a zero base five years ago, we now have 11,000 such persons being supported at home.  That is what older people want.  If the Deputy would share the letter with me, I would like to pursue it.</P>
        <P>In reply to Deputy Finian McGrath, the HSE is an enabler of providing services.  It is not the panacea, or anything like it, nor could any organisation be.  The purpose in having a unified organisation, and the reason so many people advocated it &mdash; all the parties in this House supported it although they had issues about the speed at which we implemented the legislation &mdash; and former Deputy Ivan Yates, in 1998, recommended it was because they believed it was a more appropriate way of providing better services.  I believe it will provide better services.  In particular, it will allow decisions around services to be made locally.  At present, if one wants to make simple decisions, he or she must go into Professor Drumm&rsquo;s office.</P>
        <P>That brings me to the issue of redundancy.  With appropriate management structures right down the line, one will provide incentives to people to remain in an organisation where their talents are used appropriately, where they have got responsibility and where they can make key decisions.  Nobody would want to stay in an organisation where they felt they had no real role except passing issues up the line, and that will be important.</P>
        <P>It is too early to speak of redundancies.  Clearly, there will be capacity to reduce the number of people who work for the Health Service Executive, not just in the corporate HSE headquarters where there are approximately 3,800 but in the health service generally.  We must ensure, before we even embark on that, that we encourage the right people to stay.  That is a human resource job.  Other organisations can do it successfully and I believe we can too.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to address the report of the independent monitoring group on A Vision for Change.  The group is chaired by an eminent person, Dr. Ruth Harrington, and I note that a member of the monitoring group is the former Minister of State in the area, Mr. Tim O&rsquo;Malley.</P>
        <P>The monitoring group, in the conclusions of its first report which was published last year, recognised that 2006 was a year of significant challenge and change for mental health services and expressed the view that it expected to see accelerated action in the second and subsequent years.  It is disappointing to report, by and large, that the recommendations of the first report of the independent group have not been addressed in 2007, but they have been prioritised for 2008.  However, no resources have been allocated to introduce them because the Minister has suspended giving any further resources to implementing A Vision for Change.</P>
        <P>The main concerns of the monitoring group on the implementation by the HSE include the absence of clear, identifiable leadership within the HSE to implement A Vision for Change.  The monitoring group considers that the Health Service Executive was mistaken in its decision not to implement the recommendation to establish a national mental health service directorate to drive the changes recommended in the report.  The monitoring group does not believe that the administrative arrangements put in place by the HSE are appropriate to the scale of the changes requires.  The monitoring group notes that the HSE appointed a director of cancer services in 2007, which was mentioned earlier, to lead implementation of the cancer strategy, and the reform of the mental health services, it states, requires a similar approach.  The national steering group appointed to manage the planning and implementation for A Vision for Change is not multidisciplinary and includes no service user or carer representative, as recommended.  In addition, the role and relationship of the steering group to the HSE expert advisory group on mental health and the implementation group is unclear.  There is a confusion of roles in that regard.</P>
        <P>The HSE implementation plan relates to 2008 and 2009 and spans 11 chapters of A Vision for Change, and it identified six key priorities to do so.  The plan is selective and vague and is mainly limited to the years 2008 and 2009.  Although many of the recommendations require a longer time span for implementation, it does not address the impact of the employment control measures with the HSE on the recruitment of key staff necessary for the implementation of A Vision for Change.</P>
        <P>The monitoring group has been informed that a comprehensive plan will be provided by the HSE before the end of 2008.  The group regrets that a comprehensive plan has not been published heretofore.</P>
        <P>The recommendations of A Vision for Change are not being addressed as a comprehensive package.  The monitoring group is concerned that the HSE transformation process is taking precedence over the implementation of the recommendations.</P>
        <P>The resourcing of multidisciplinary community health care teams is not being adequately prioritised, an issue which we have raised repeatedly over the past three years in this House.  There appears to be a lack of clarity regarding the key central role of multidisciplinary teams, as envisaged in A Vision for Change.  Primary care and significant aspects of specialist mental health care, including the multidisciplinary community mental health care group, are concerned about the potential for a blurring of boundaries.</P>
        <P>The monitoring group also raises the issue, highlighted on several occasions in the House, of the use of funds.  Some &euro;24 million of the &euro;51 million development funding allocated to the <Col N="673"/>HSE for the implementation of A Vision for Change was not used as planned.  It was hived off elsewhere and it is not apparent to the monitoring group who in the HSE has budgetary responsibility for mental health services or how budgetary decisions affecting mental health services are made.  Will the Minister of State identify who is responsible for making these budgetary decisions?  As he has come into the House with a prepared script I am sure the matter will not be addressed.</P>

	<P>I take this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  I thank Deputy Neville for raising this issue.  I warmly acknowledge that it has been inspired by a genuine commitment to ensure that persons with mental health difficulties receive the best service possible and, for that reason, I welcome the opportunity to explore this issue in the House this afternoon.</P>
        <P>I will discuss the findings of the report, but it is important to acknowledge how far we have come in the area of mental health.  I do not wish to dwell on the past, but in 1961 the rate of psychiatric beds per 1,000 of population was 7.3, which was believed to be among the highest in the world.  Ireland was described as being &ldquo;hospital prone&rdquo;.  For a considerable time those in need of treatment or care had little choice but to seek it within an institution.  Although there was considerable stigma attached to these institutions, they were the only places available.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to say that since then, significant developments have taken place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;with the full implementation of the Mental Health Act 2001 and the launch of two important strategy documents, A Vision for Change, the report of the expert group on mental health, and <i>Reach Out</i>, the national strategy for action on suicide prevention.</P>
        <P>A Vision for Change, launched in January 2006, represents an action plan for the development of a quality mental health service which places the patient at the centre.  It recognises both the strengths and inadequacies of existing services and a strategy for building on the innovations outlined in previous strategy documents.  The Government has accepted the report as the basis for the future development of our mental health services and is firmly committed to its full implementation.</P>
        <P>Although there have been great strides taken in the development of mental health services in Ireland, I accept that we are not where we want to be, but we are getting there.  A Vision for Change is an ambitious and aspiring publication, containing 200 recommendations to be implemented over a seven to ten year timeframe.  The challenge is to maximise the benefits of having such a progressive strategy to ensure that real benefits for the patient and indeed for society as a whole are realised.</P>
        <P>The second annual report of the independent monitoring group was published on 27 June 2008.  I welcome the findings and recommendations in the report.  The group expressed its disappointment at the slow rate of progress in implementing A Vision for Change.  We must accept that much work needs to be done and I look forward to seeing increased progress this year and in subsequent years.</P>
        <P>The HSE recently approved its implementation plan which sets out six key priorities for 2008 and 2009.  These include the provision of eight additional consultant child psychiatry teams.  The HSE recently advertised an additional 12 consultant child and adolescent psychiatrists and is examining new ways of working to address waiting lists.  Another priority is the provision of 18 additional beds for children and adolescents at St. Anne&rsquo;s Hospital in Galway, St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital in Fairview and St. Stephen&rsquo;s Hospital in Cork.  This will increase the bed complement from the current provision of 12 to 30 during 2008, which represents a 150% increase in child <Col N="674"/>and adolescent inpatient bed capacity.  A third priority is the construction of two 20 bed units for children and adolescents in Cork and Galway.  Construction of these units is expected to be completed in 2009.</P>
        <P>The HSE will also expand multidisciplinary community based mental health teams and complete existing teams.  It is intended to support new and existing teams to develop the multidisciplinary nature of their services and provide a more comprehensive range of medical, psychological and social therapies to service users and families.  Adopting a holistic approach to developing services lies at the core of A Vision for Change.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Work is also advanced nationally on the process of replacing the remaining psychiatric hospitals with a range of modern mental health services.  Closure plans for existing psychiatric hospitals will be put in place by the end of 2008 and the revenue raised from these sales will be directed towards improving mental health services.</P>
        <P>Mental health has been in receipt of unprecedented investment in recent years which has allowed us to make real improvements to mental health services.  However, it is not just funding that has made a difference.  It is a completely different approach that has and will enable new mental health services to develop.  We now have a much greater focus on community services, the provision of multidisciplinary teams, early intervention services and many others.  The modernisation and reform of services is in line with what patients want and what they need.</P>
        <P>I assure Deputy Neville that the Government is firmly committed to the implementation of A Vision for Change.  The Government&rsquo;s decision to establish an office for disability and mental health reflects its ongoing commitment to developing a more coherent and integrated response to the needs of people with disabilities and mental health problems.  The overall vision is to establish structures which provide greater cohesion in supporting disability and mental health across the public service.  The office brings a new impetus to the implementation of A Vision for Change, working in partnership with the HSE and other stakeholders to achieve implementation of agreed targets.  The HSE has undertaken to prepare a more comprehensive implementation plan for beyond 2009 by the end of this year and I reiterate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the full implementation of A Vision for Change.</P>

      <sTitle>Drug Dealing.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak about this pilot programme in the House.  Much drug dealing takes place in public houses.  Moreover, there is a great propensity for multi-drug use with alcohol consumption.  Publicans have a legal responsibility to ensure that drugs are neither traded nor consumed on their premises.</P>
        <P>Last Christmas the supply control committee of the Dublin north inner city drug task force, of which I am chairman, linked up with Store Street Garda station through the good offices of Inspector Gus Keane, a very active member of the supply control committee.  Inspector Keane organised several meetings with the proprietors of public houses in the north inner city.  We explained the need for publicans to ensure their premises were drug free.  Large posters were produced, advertising the publicans&rsquo; responsibilities and displaying dedicated telephone numbers with &ldquo;dial to stop a drug dealer&rdquo; emblazoned, for display in each public house.  The Garda funded the cost of these posters.  Large quantities of beer mats were made available for distribution on bars and tables in public houses.</P>
        <P>The programme has been in operation for 12 months.  There was originally a slow take-up, but it was very important that all publicans bought into the programme.  They turned up in large numbers at the meetings.  Anecdotal evidence suggests the initiative is providing encouragement to people to reject drug dealing and refrain from drug consumption in public houses in the area.  Publicans have signs prominently displayed.  They are happy with the initiative, happy to participate, and they feel reassured by their ability to demonstrate they are actively <Col N="675"/>implementing the law by preventing drug dealing and drug consumption on their premises.  It is reassuring for them to have these signs prominently on display and to have corresponding beer mats on the tables.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>This is a practical initiative that adds to the curtailment of the activities of drug pushers.   If it was rolled out nationwide, it would make a valuable contribution to the fight against drug abuse.  I call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take steps to mainstream the &ldquo;dial to stop a drug dealer&rdquo; programme as quickly as possible.  If the programme were successfully established on a wide basis, it could be extended to other retail outlets in community areas such as off-licences and shops.  There could be bus stop advertising too and we could begin the process of creating drug free zones where a premises would have on display material stating it is drug free &mdash; steps to ensure this have been taken.</P>
        <P>This is a practical initiative which, in so far as it has been operational, demonstrates that it has good effect.  It is not a very expensive programme and requires no extra personnel or staffing.  Costs would be limited to the necessary materials.  The steps involved are to organise several meetings, explain what is intended, explain the law and get the programme operational.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I reply on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  I thank Deputy Costello for raising this matter.  The Government very much welcomes and wholeheartedly supports this initiative taken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in its introduction of the &ldquo;dial to stop drug dealing&rdquo; project in the Garda Dublin north central division and the similar initiative on which it was based, which was led by the Blanchardstown local drug task force in its area during 2006.</P>
      
        <P>Before getting into the detail of the Government&rsquo;s specific proposals, which will now further assist the development of such initiatives, I would like, on behalf of the Minister, to first set out the context in which this work needs to take place.  First, all of us in this House are well aware that the issue of drug misuse remains one of the most pressing social problems facing us.  It is, sadly, a problem experienced globally for which there is no quick and easy solution.</P>
        <P>Given the severe harmful and destructive consequences brought about by drug abuse at individual, family and community levels, it is undoubtedly an issue on which we as a society must continue to collectively maintain a keen focus and urgency in addressing.  As the Minister and many of my other Government colleagues have stated previously, the focus in our jurisdiction must be to strive constantly to ensure that the measures and policies we have in place to address the problem are appropriate and flexible enough to be able to respond to what is a global and dynamic issue.</P>
        <P>As the House will, I am sure, appreciate, the remit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the national drugs strategy is primarily, although not exclusively, in the area of drug supply reduction and drug law enforcement remains a key feature of the Government&rsquo;s drug policy framework.  It follows that the &ldquo;dial to stop drug dealing&rdquo; initiatives which have emerged recently are of such particular interest to my colleague the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na retains primary responsibility in this regard and it will continue with the Government&rsquo;s full support to invoke vigorously the range of broad strategic responses it has in place to address the issue.  However, any assistance which can be provided to the Garda by the public in tackling the crime of drug dealing is to be welcomed and fully encouraged.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;Dial to stop drug dealing&rdquo; campaigns offer a real opportunity to deliver the integrated action to which I referred to earlier in a very pragmatic way.  The Minister understands that the campaigns in Blanchardstown and Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city are deemed to have been <Col N="676"/>successful local initiatives with feedback on their operation from the local drug task forces there, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the local community all of a supportive nature.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has reported that the information generated in some of the reports made to the confidential numbers has been particularly helpful in terms of identifying new dealers, confirming existing suspicions and generally assisting police intelligence on local drug dealing activity.  The campaigns have directly led to a number of arrests for drug dealing in the local areas.</P>
        <P>The Minister also understands that during the formal evaluation of the Blanchardstown model, the garda&iacute; in the local area particularly welcomed the sense of an increased co-operative approach between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the local community to tackling drug dealing in the area, which the campaign there appears to have generated.  All of this is very positive and I am pleased to advise the House that following the success of these initiatives, the national drugs strategy team in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently finalising proposals to begin a national roll-out of this programme this year in conjunction with the 14 local and ten regional drug task forces.</P>
        <P>To facilitate this, an allocation of &euro;300,000 has been secured from dormant assets funds to proceed with this programme.  On behalf of the Minister, I am pleased also to advise the House that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is also providing additional funding of &euro;50,000 to support this initiative.  The Minister understands that the national drugs strategy team anticipates that the roll-out of this programme nationally will begin this autumn.  The Minister looks forward to the implementation of this programme and he will continue to support it in every way he can.</P>

      <sTitle>Water and Sewerage Schemes.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this most important issue.  We have no records that Coleridge&rsquo;s ancient mariner ever made it as far as Ennis, but the refrain, &ldquo;Water, water, everywhere, nor any drop to drink&rdquo;, certainly gets one thinking.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some 30,000 people are dependent on the Ennis water supply, which services Ennis, Clarecastle, Barefield, Crusheen, Doora, Drumcliff and Spancilhill.  Since July 2005, these 30,000 people have had to deal with boil notice after boil notice on their water supply due to the presence of cryptosporidium.  The spring at Drumcliff from which the Ennis water supply is drawn remains volatile, due to its limestone karstic base, and is considered highly susceptible to cryptosporidium.</P>
        <P>Almost three years ago, in July 2005, the first reported outbreak of cryptosporidium in the Ennis water supply came about, yet it took a full 13 months before an interim treatment plant was commissioned to filter the water.  Ennis has also fared quiet poorly in comparison to Galway.</P>
        <P>In Galway, a water voucher scheme was established within weeks of the first outbreak of cryptosporidium and rate payers also received a rate rebate.  None of these measures was introduced in Ennis and residents and business people alike are very angry as a result.</P>
        <P>Since the provision of the temporary water filtration plant, five or six full<b> </b>boil notices have been placed on the Ennis water supply.  Since July 2005, the HSE, together with the local authority, has placed a partial boil notice on the water, which advises water be boiled before consumption by the immuno-compromised, infants and pre-school children.</P>
        <P>Given these circumstances, confidence in the Ennis water supply is at a very low level.  Last Sunday, that confidence was almost sunk when residents were informed that they should conserve water, as the quantity of treated water passing through the interim treatment plant was <Col N="677"/>not sufficient to meet demands because of heavy rainfall.  I understand that following consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency and the HSE, Clare County Council later decided to partially bypass the filtration system with a view to increasing the quantity of water that could be dispatched to consumers.</P>
        <P>This move was designed to replenish the storage levels in reservoirs, restore supply to all consumers and ensure that critical areas such as the fire service and hospitals such as Ennis General and St. Joseph&rsquo;s hospital had an adequate volume of water.  To think that a town&rsquo;s water supply was put out of action because of heavy rainfall is both ironic and tragic.</P>
        <P>This latest problem with the Ennis water supply highlights the fact that we now urgently need an alternative water supply not just to address the water quality issue, but also the water quantity issue.  This evening, I propose a solution to the daily problems which residents encounter, such as having to boil or buy water to brush teeth, wash vegetables or simply drink a clean fresh glass of water.  Significant water pressure problems also exist throughout parts of Ennis, Clarecastle and Doora, which prevent people from washing and taking showers when they want.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to fast-track the delivery of the Ennis water augmentation scheme.  This scheme will provide Ennis with a new water supply which will be a plan B.  It will be a source of water free of cryptosporidium and which will address our water quantity issues.</P>
        <P>The scheme up to now has been looked upon as a long-term project.  It is clear Ennis needs access to an alternative water supply as soon as possible.  I ask the Minister and Department to engage directly with the local authorities in Ennis to drive the speedy delivery of this vital scheme.</P>
        <P>The outstanding elements of the Ennis water augmentation scheme consist of the following elements.  A new pumping station a Clareabbey must be built, a new reservoir at Edenvale must be constructed and extraction capacity at Castle Lake must be increased.  The remaining piping work, which has been laid along the Newmarket-on-Fergus bypass and new Ennis bypass, must be completed.</P>
        <P>As an immediate action, I am asking that a simple pump and less than a kilometre of piping be provided from Carnelly to Kerins Cross in Clarecastle, as this work would access the Castle Lake water supply and provide a solution to the water shortages in Clarecastle and Doora, taking pressure off the Ennis town supply.  I have proposed this measure several times in the past in the chamber of Clare County Council; it makes common sense and must happen as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>I am appealing to the Minister on behalf of the 30,000 people who are dependent on the Ennis water supply.  I am looking for a commitment that the Minister will ensure that the Ennis water augmentation scheme is prioritised.  This scheme will solve the daily intolerable problems relating to our water.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to take a hands-on approach to this issue because if he does not, our problems will only worsen.  Water is a basic right and we live in a First World economy.  The people of Ennis, Clarecastle, Barefield, Doora and Crusheen are depending on the Minister to provide that basic right of clean fresh drinking water with proper pressure and service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>Since its adoption in 2002, the objectives of the national spatial strategy have been among the key criteria local authorities have taken into consideration in their needs assessments for new water services infrastructure.  It will be no surprise, therefore, that the current water services investment programme, announced by the Minister last September, allows for invest<Col N="678"/>ment of some &euro;2.6 billion in the hubs and gateways over the next few years.  The programme is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
        <P>The range of new water and sewerage schemes planned and in progress in the hubs and gateways provides strong evidence of the Government&rsquo;s determination to safeguard the environment in these areas while making provision for new housing, new jobs and all the other requirements of a successful hub or gateway location.</P>
        <P>In the period since 2000, over 400 water services infrastructure schemes have been completed by the Department, many in hubs and gateways.  The completion of major wastewater infrastructure projects in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway are cases in point.  In the hub town of Ennis, the Department is providing substantial funding towards new long-term water services infrastructure which will serve the objectives of the national spatial strategy and benefit the residential and business communities in the town.</P>
        <P>Three major water supply scheme projects are included in the Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2007 to 2009.  A new water treatment plant is being constructed as part of the Ennis town water supply treatment scheme.  I understand the council signed the &euro;8.3 million contract in July 2007 and work will be finished in February 2009.  The Ennis town water supply augmentation scheme, which will supplement the Ennis supply with water from Castlelake, is in the programme at an estimated cost of &euro;6.3 million.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government approved Clare County Council&rsquo;s proposals to lay the pipework for the scheme in conjunction with the Ennis Road bypass and completion of these works is a matter for the council.</P>
        <P>The water services investment programme also contains the &euro;21 million Castlelake water supply scheme, which will improve the Castlelake source to cater for future needs.  I understand the Department is awaiting a brief from Clare County Council for the appointment of consultants to draw up the preliminary report for the scheme.  Also included in the programme is the Ennis-Clarecastle sewerage scheme which will cost in the region of &euro;58 million.</P>
        <P>The Minister is aware that there have been problems with the town&rsquo;s present water supply for some time and there is a continuing precautionary boil water regime in place for certain groups, such as the elderly, the very young and people who are immuno-compromised.  This is not what should be expected in this day and age.  However, I understand the council has tried to minimise the problems by installing a temporary water treatment plant while the new permanent &euro;8.3 million treatment works is constructed.  The Minister provided special local government fund assistance towards the running costs of this temporary plant in 2006 and 2007 and will soon announce the 2008 round of allocations.</P>
        <P>I understand the temporary plant has been unable to meet demand in recent days.  Clearly, it would be much better if this situation had not come about.  However, a temporary plant is just that and cannot be expected to perform as well as the new permanent treatment facility which will come on stream next year.  The Minister shares what must be the view of everyone in the town that progress with the new plant must be kept on track in terms of time and I understand Clare County Council is doing everything possible to ensure it is completed on time.  In the meantime, it is a matter for the council, as the statutory water services authority, to take whatever steps are needed to ensure the requirements of all consumers in the town are accommodated to the greatest extent possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this issue.  It was interesting to listen to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response to the issue raised by <Col N="679"/>Deputy Joe Carey regarding the Ennis water supply.  I hope the state-of-the-art sewerage plant scheduled to come on stream next year will be much more successful than the Ringsend plant in my constituency of Dublin South-East where the entire process has been farcical, to say the least. </P>
        <P Just="Left">I will raise two connected and significant issues.  First, as reported in the media in the past week, the Ringsend sewage treatment plant is operating at between 20% and 30% above its capacity.  I have found it difficult to obtain concrete information, other than a submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, from Dublin City Council on this matter.  It is astonishing that the Minister has claimed population growth in Dublin city could not be predicted.  The CSO&rsquo;s prediction of even greater population growth than we have experienced contradicts the Minister&rsquo;s bizarre and ridiculous claim, made on the national broadcaster, that he did not know what population growth was expected in the capital city.</P>
        <P>Second, Dublin City Council paid a startling sum of money to the ABA consortium which has operated the Ringsend sewage treatment plant in a shameful fashion.  Not only was the sum of &euro;38 million paid out, but it was sanctioned by the Minister who represents the constituency in which the plant is located.  It is extraordinary that the Minister who sanctioned this payment has, in press statements and media interviews, called for an investigation into how the payment was made and went wrong.  This would be laughable if it were not so serious.</P>
        <P>The reason I object to the payment of a substantial sum to the ABA consortium is that it did not honour the contract it signed up to in terms of operating the sewage treatment plant in Ringsend.  In response to a recent question I submitted to Dublin City Council, I received an extraordinary update in which the council detailed the short-term remedial works which have been done at the plant since 2006.  The company covered channels, installed additional odour control units and improved sludge handling and drying.  These steps should have been taken from day one.  The plant was sold to the people of Dublin as a state-of-the-art facility in 2003.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The long-term works referred to in the council&rsquo;s reply included the covering of the primary treatment tanks.  A sewage treatment plant was built in the centre of a large urban population without the tanks being covered up and Dublin City Council is surprised to learn that an odour was emanating from the facility.  The company which constructed the plant clearly did not do what it should have done to ensure it was of an adequate standard to serve the population of Dublin.  Having failed to do this work, Dublin City Council did not have the capacity to demand from the company any form of accountability.  The ABA consortium should have paid for the remedial works but was instead paid by Dublin City Council to do works it should have done in the first instance.  It is a fundamental flaw of the public-private partnership process that the contracts signed do not include penalty clauses.  This is a major problem across the board.</P>
        <P>I wish Deputy Joe Carey luck regarding the sewage treatment plant in County Clare.  I hope it is not the disaster we, in Dublin South-East, have had to endure for the past five years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to reassure the House, on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, that there is no imminent threat to water quality in Dublin Bay.  This is clearly demonstrated by the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s bathing water quality report for 2007, which shows all bathing areas from Skerries to Killiney comply with EU standards.  Indeed, Dollymount Strand has also gained a blue flag in recognition of premium water quality.</P>
        <P>I am also pleased to confirm that Dublin City Council reports that the Ringsend plant consistently meets the required effluent standards for treated waste water.  The Minister is aware of suggestions in recent days that the plant is operating beyond capacity but this needs to be <Col N="680"/>qualified in order for the full picture to be seen.  Capacity can be calculated in a number of ways, namely, from influent flow, biochemical oxygen demand, BOD, suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand and nutrients, each of which would give a different capacity figure.  When a plant is being designed, it must have sufficient capability to deal with load fluctuations higher than the design average on all these parameters.</P>
        <P>The design capacity of the Ringsend plant is a nominal 1.64 million population equivalent, average load, based on BOD.  The plant provides secondary treatment to approximately 99% of waste water arising in the Dublin region.  It deals with the waste water treatment needs of approximately 1.1 million people, with the non-domestic load associated with areas as far apart as D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Ratoath, Ashbourne and Portmarnock.  The critical fact is that the required effluent standards are being met.  This has transformed water quality in Dublin Bay and that improvement is being maintained.</P>
        <P>While water quality in Dublin Bay has greatly improved, the Minister is aware that there were protracted delays during the commissioning and testing of the new plant in 2002, when difficulties were experienced in achieving the required performance standards.  In particular, he is conscious of the odour problems that were experienced by residents in his and Deputy Creighton&rsquo;s constituency within a short time of the plant coming into operation and that have occurred intermittently since.  Works under way to resolve this issue are due for completion later this year.</P>
        <P>To resolve as many as possible of the questions surrounding the design and capacity of the plant and past efforts to deal with the odour issue, the Minister is arranging for an independent examination of the design parameters of the works to determine whether they adequately addressed existing and projected loads at the time they were approved.  A broad range of issues will be considered during this examination.  These include the appropriateness of the design capacity of the plant, having regard to the information available at that time; the volume and timing of actual waste water loads going to the plant by comparison to the load projections when the design capacity was determined; and the factors that contributed to the odour problems and the effectiveness of the actions taken to deal with such odours.  The Minister expects to be in a position very shortly to appoint a suitably qualified person to carry out the examination and report back to him before the end of the summer.</P>

	<P>In 2003/2004, my Department moved towards a model of devolving funding, responsibility and authority for building projects directly to school management authorities. The intention was to improve the quality of the school building infrastructure in a structured and prioritised manner, to improve efficiency in the use of resources and to achieve value for money. The Summer Works Scheme introduced in 2004, was one such solution.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Summer Works Scheme was to ensure precise targeting of funding for smaller scale works by using a time-bound process, from application to implementation, which would be open to all recognised schools.  The works would be carried out in the summer months to prevent disruption to schools.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the Scheme, school authorities are empowered to manage these works with guidance from, and minimal interaction with, my Department.</P>
        <P>The Scheme has enabled the Department and school authorities to address deficiencies arising from the historic under-investment in school infrastructure over the years. This is particularly the case in relation to upgrading of gas, mechanics and electrics and addressing structural defects.  Projects to facilitate inclusion and access for special needs pupils are also a feature of the scheme.</P>
        <P>Since its inception, the scheme has been refined annually to incorporate feedback both from school authorities and from staff administering the Scheme.  It has also been amended where necessary to reflect any changes in Public Procurement Procedures and Health and Safety regulations.</P>
        <P>Since the Summer Works Scheme was introduced, over 3,000 projects, costing in excess of &euro;300 million, have been completed. With so many smaller projects having been completed over <Col N="682"/>the past few years, the particular emphasis in 2008 is on providing sufficient school places in developing areas, while also delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country. Accordingly my Department is focusing on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008 and funding was not made available for a Summer Works Scheme this year.</P>
        <P>However, I recognise the benefits of the scheme in addressing the needs of schools and I intend to have a Summer Works Scheme in 2009.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 10 together.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s total capital allocation for 2008 is &euro;827m. Just under &euro;600m of this allocation will be invested in school buildings.</P>
        <P>The extent of the school building and modernisation programme is determined by the annual capital allocation. This has grown steadily in recent years from just under &euro;400m in 2004 to &euro;542m in 2007 and to over &euro;586m this year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The principal component of the school building and modernisation programme is the delivery of large scale projects which consist of either new schools or major extensions or refurbishments of existing schools.</P>
        <P>In 2007, a total of 16 new schools were completed together with 44 extension/refurbishment projects giving an overall total of 60 large scale projects completed in 2007.</P>
        <P>The expected completion of large scale projects in 2008 will consist of 21 new schools and 46 extension/refurbishment projects giving an overall total of 67 large scale projects completing in 2008.</P>
        <P>An additional feature of the 2008 school building and modernisation programme is the provision of new schools in developing areas under an accelerated programme. To cater for the anticipated increases in the school-going population, my Department has established a Developing Areas Unit to identify areas of rapid population growth, to assess the educational needs in these areas and to plan solutions for the accommodation needs identified.</P>
        <P>As part of a fast-track programme of construction for September 2008, the Department is building six 16-classroom schools, 20 eight-classroom schools and a number of smaller projects in those areas where school accommodation is under greatest pressure.</P>
        <P>Under the Permanent Accommodation and Small Schools Scheme in 2007, a total of 130 projects were completed. To date in 2008, a total of 52 projects under these devolved projects have been completed while a further 174 projects are currently under construction. In addition, <Col N="683"/>a further 148 devolved projects have not yet gone on site but it is expected that the majority of these will be under construction before year-end.</P>
        <P>With such a high level of activity underway, the completion of buildings in 2008 under these devolved schemes will significantly exceed the number of projects completed in 2007.</P>
        <P>As I have already stated, the capital allocation on the Primary and Post-Primary sectors for 2008 is over &euro;40m greater than the allocation in 2007.  However, I should point out that a supplementary estimate and internal adjustments in 2007 gave a final outturn for that year of &euro;646m of which over &euro;30m was in respect of a technical adjustment in respect of payments to the OPW the previous year.</P>
        <P>Decisions in respect of the expenditure of the annual allocation are made on the basis of the elements of the school building and modernisation programme that are most pressing in terms of need.</P>
        <P>As the programme for the delivery of large scale projects and the purchase of sites is a larger component of the 2008 school building and modernisation programme than in previous years, it was not possible to have a Summer Works Scheme this year. Because over 250 projects under the devolved Permanent Accommodation or Small Schools Schemes had not managed to commence construction at the beginning of 2008, it was decided not to add further projects to the programme without substantial progress taking place on those projects not yet on site.</P>
        <P>The primary and post-primary capital allocation for 2008 is higher than the 2007 allocation and the combined output of traditional build schools and extension and refurbishment projects together with the schools fast-tracked for delivery in September 2008 will result in the practical completion of far more large scale projects than the level of output experienced in 2007. When the large scale projects are combined with the expected level of projects being completed under the Permanent Accommodation and Small Schools Schemes this year, it is clear that the scale of delivery in 2008 addressing accommodation needs is at an all time high.</P>
        <P>As I have indicated previously to the House, I am currently in the process of reviewing my Department&rsquo;s school building and modernisation programme with my officials.  I do not propose to make any further announcements on the school building programme until that review is completed.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has surveyed schools regarding their use of prefabricated accommodation and is in the process of compiling this information.  I will write to the Deputy regarding this survey and the information my Department has compiled from it.</P>
        <P>My Department has undertaken an assessment of the rental of temporary accommodation with a view to identifying the point at which purchase of such accommodation provides better value for money than rental.</P><Col N="684"/>
        <P>As a result of this assessment, my Department now has a policy of purchasing temporary accommodation where the need for this is likely to last for more than three years. The effect of this change in policy will be to minimise the amount paid on the rental of accommodation.</P>
        <P>The Permanent Accommodation Scheme was introduced in 2003 to reduce the need for prefabs. It was designed to give value for money in terms of providing permanent accommodation in place of prefabs, where an accommodation need was likely to exist for a considerable length of time. Since its introduction, over &euro;100m has been allocated to schools under the scheme and it has resulted in the provision of an additional 625 classrooms and 275 resource rooms in schools around the country. This is in addition to those classrooms provided under the major capital projects managed by my Department.</P>
        <P>Had the Permanent Accommodation Scheme not been in place, a very significant proportion of those classrooms and resource rooms would have had to be provided using temporary accommodation such as prefabricated classrooms.</P>
        <P>Despite this, it will continue to be necessary for prefabricated accommodation to be provided because competing priorities mean that it will not always be possible to have a permanent accommodation solution in place in a short time-frame. My Department will continue to provide funding for such prefabricated accommodation and the decision on whether to rent or purchase will depend on the likely length of time it will be required. In all cases, the approach will be to ensure best value for money.</P>

	<P>The audit of school enrolment policies, published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 28 April last, looked at the enrolment of Traveller children, newcomer children and children with special education needs in almost 2,000 schools at primary and post-primary level. The audit also looked at the written enrolment policies of a proportion of these schools and, more tellingly, how these policies translate into practice in terms of actual enrolment patterns.</P>
        <P>At a general level, the audit finds no evidence of any system wide enrolment practices that give rise to concern.  The audit does give rise to wider policy questions relating to:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The need for enhanced information for parents about their rights should a school refuse to enrol their child.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Those aspects of the written enrolment policies of schools which may be deemed exclusionary, e.g. pre-enrolling children from birth or providing preference to children of past pupils, thereby putting newcomers to communities at a disadvantage.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The potential for improved inter-school co-operation in a given area in order to address enrolment anomalies.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Possible proposals for intervention in local admissions where inter-school co-operation is not achieved.</P><Col N="685"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />How identified problems can best be addressed.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">A process of consultation with the main education partners on possible follow-up policy responses was commenced at the end of April, with a deadline for receipt of submissions of 6 June 2008.    As part of this consultation process, specific questions were posed around the policy issues and possible approaches identified above.  The potential role of a designated officer with powers of intervention in local school admissions, where inter-school co-operation cannot be achieved, is one possible approach on which specific views were sought.  Under this particular proposal, it is envisaged that such powers would only be used in exceptional circumstances and as such I am satisfied that it would not run counter to the spirit of the Cromien Report recommendations.</P>
        <P>The responses received under the consultation process are now under consideration and it is my intention to take account of all views expressed before formulating any specific proposals for action in order to address any anomalous enrolment practice that has been identified by the audit.</P>

	<P>My Department is providing broadband connectivity to recognised primary and post-primary schools under the Schools Broadband Access Programme. This programme is being undertaken in partnership with industry in the context of a Government &mdash; IBEC/TIF (Telecommunications and Internet Federation) Agreement to provide local broadband connectivity to schools.</P>
        <P>The Programme has three elements &mdash; local connectivity to schools, a national broadband network and a broadband support service desk. Schools connectivity is being routed to the Internet through a national broadband network, which is supported by HEAnet and provides centrally managed services for schools such as security, anti-spam/anti-virus and content filtering. The broadband support service desk has been established to interface between the network, the local broadband service Access Providers and schools. It is managed by the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE).</P>
        <P>A competitive, technology neutral, central procurement process for the provision of local connectivity for schools was undertaken based on a tiered bandwidth provision, ranging from 0.5 Megabits per second (Mbps) in the case of small primary schools up to 2 Mbps for larger post-primary schools. Contracts were finalised in 2005 with six Service Providers for the provision of local access connectivity to 3,925 schools and with a further Provider for the installation of a broadband router at school level where appropriate. The 3,925 initial individual school awards involved a range of technologies. Roll-out commenced in June 2005.  The total number of schools involved in the Programme has been adjusted in the meantime to reflect a number of school openings, closures and amalgamations and stands currently at 3,936. As of 24th June, 2008, 3,901 (99%) have had their local connectivity installed and of these 3,899 have had their router capability installed and tested.   These figures have been updated to remove the inadvertent double counting of six schools that had amalgamated, following their initial broadband installations.</P>
        <P>The breakdown of technologies across the 3,901 local connectivity installations is 27% fixed line services, 26% wireless services and 47% satellite services.  Having regard to the usage levels observed by HEAnet, my Department has procured additional bandwidth from its two satellite <Col N="686"/>providers to improve the broadband connection speeds for schools on this portion of the Schools Broadband Network. The situation continues to be monitored closely.   Increased bandwidths have also been provided to some schools with fixed line services as a consequence of improvements in the wholesale broadband market. Over 650 schools are now receiving bandwidths of 3Mbps or higher. In addition, my Department has migrated schools to superior alternative technologies, where feasible.</P>
        <P>A further 72 schools have had broadband access provided under the Hermes and Advanced Deployment programmes and are not included in the 3,901 figure. The split of technologies across these schools is 60% fixed line, 35% wireless and 5% satellite.</P>
        <P>Looking to the future, my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has this morning launched the Next Generation Broadband Policy Paper which includes the objective of equipping second-level schools with 100Mbits per second of broadband connectivity and installing local area networks.  I look forward to working with my colleague, Minister Ryan, in the pursuit of this objective.  Furthermore, my Department will shortly issue a Request for Tenders for the next round of service under the existing Schools Broadband Programme and having regard to the general developments in broadband availability nationally, improved service offerings are expected to be received under the new tender process.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In May of 2007, the Department of Education and Science issued a circular to the Management Authorities in primary and post primary schools outlining the resources available to meet the varying levels of needs of pupils for whom English is a second language.   This circular has facilitated a significant expansion in the appointment of language support teachers. </P>
        <P>There are now almost 2,000 language support teachers in primary and post primary schools, at a cost of some &euro;120 million per annum, compared with 262 in the 2001/02 school year.  The circular removed a previous limit of two language support teachers per school.</P>
        <P>It also extended the provision of language support beyond two years for a pupil, where a specific request is made to the Department.  In fact, it is now possible for some schools with over 121 students with English language needs to have 6 language support teachers.  Schools with less than the 14 such pupils needed to qualify for one support teacher are provided with financial resources to assist them.  In addition to providing additional teachers a number of other steps have been taken.</P>
        <P>Two copies of the &ldquo;Primary School Assessment Kit&rdquo;, prepared by Integrate Ireland Language and Training (IILT) have been circulated by my Department to all primary schools in recent weeks.  This kit will enable teachers to carry out initial and on-going assessments of the language proficiency of newcomer children.  The Assessment Kit has also been placed on the Department&rsquo;s website. It is proposed to have an assessment kit for post-primary schools available later in the year.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has prepared guidelines for teachers in primary schools to assist them in meeting the language and learning needs of children for whom English is an additional language so that they can access all areas of the primary school curriculum.</P>
        <P>The Inspectorate of the Department is also conducting an evaluation of the provision of English as an Additional Language (EAL) in a number of primary and post-primary schools in 2008 and 2009. A report on their evaluation will be prepared for mid 2009.  The objectives of the evaluation are to examine the provision and the quality of teaching of English as an additional language in primary and post-primary schools.  The evaluation will also review the quality of learning achieved by the migrant students, the effectiveness of supports and the inclusion of services for these students in whole-school planning.</P>
        <P>At the request of the Department of Education and Science the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) has undertaken a large-scale study into how an increasing diversity of students impacts upon resource requirements and day to day teaching and learning in <Col N="688"/>primary and post-primary schools.  It is expected that this study will be completed in autumn 2008.</P>
        <P>The Department is also participating in an OECD review of migrant education policy and practice. This review will be carried out by a team of OECD experts. This review is expected to be completed in autumn 2009. I will evaluate the findings of the Inspectorate&rsquo;s research and, based on their findings, and those of the ESRI, OECD and others, I will consider if any further reform is necessary in relation to the provision of English as an additional language in schools.</P>

        <Quest> the way he will address the fact that tens of thousands of young people are being priced out of higher education due to their parents&rsquo; income being only slightly above the threshold to qualify for grants. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the student grant is to contribute towards the maintenance costs associated with going to college where parental means are likely to be insufficient to meet those costs.  I&rsquo;m sure that the Deputy will agree with me that income thresholds are necessary, therefore, to ensure that this support is properly targeted towards those who are most in need of this assistance.</P>
        <P>The reckonable income limits for ordinary maintenance grants were increased by 3.5% for the 2007/2008 academic year. This increase was in line with the increase in the average industrial wage for the September 2005 to September 2006 reference period. The top limit for standard rate grant eligibility where there are less than four dependent children was increased from &euro;46,700 to &euro;48,355, aiming to ensure that more students from households with moderate incomes will not have to pay the Student Service Charge of &euro;825.</P>
        <P>I should also say that the prescribed income limit for the special rate of maintenance grant for the academic year 2007/2008 was increased by 7.8% to &euro;18,055 in line with the relevant increases in social welfare payments.</P>
        <P>In September 2003, my Department doubled the number of qualifying thresholds from two to four, allowing qualification for 100%, 75%, 50% and 25% rates of grant.  This broadening of the income thresholds benefited an estimated 5,000 additional students.  Some 37% of the student population at third level now qualifies for some level of student grant assistance.  In addition, it must be remembered that over 90% of undergraduate students, at all income levels, avail of Government support for free fees at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;346 million in 2007.</P>
        <P>I am committed to delivering ongoing improvements in my Department&rsquo;s student maintenance grant schemes, including increasing the rates and income limits, as resources permit.</P>
        <P>My Department, with the assistance of the National Access Office of the Higher Education Authority, monitors the trends in access to higher education for all socio-economic groups in order to address any inequities arising in the system.  For example, the most recent data available indicate that the lowest levels of participation are now found within a socio-economic group called the &ldquo;non-manual&rdquo; group &mdash; 27% as against the national average of 55%.</P>
        <P>The level of participation in higher education among this very diverse group is a complex issue that extends beyond financial barriers. A study, commissioned by the HEA, is currently being carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute on the participation in higher education of the non-manual socio-economic group.  The key aim is to develop a better understanding of educational participation among young people from this group so that strategies can be developed which will support them in accessing and completing higher education.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to adopt a name change for the Leaving Certificate that would cast it in a narrow light with a sole focus on entrance to third level programmes.</P>
        <P>The general aim of education is to contribute towards the development of all aspects of the individual and the Leaving Certificate comes at an important point in that process, namely, the end of second-level education.</P>
        <P>The Leaving Certificate is designed as a measure of achievement, rather than a predictor of academic success or an indicator of vocational suitability, though clearly it is utilised widely in the context of admission to third level courses.  Its primary purpose is to certify attainment at the end of a two-year course, rather than to provide a starting point for a third level course. The Leaving Certificate fulfils a valuable function for a much wider range of students than those who intend to take up third level courses immediately, even in times of maximum desired uptake levels.</P>
        <P>In considering this matter we need to reflect on the broader purposes that the examination serves. The Leaving Certificate course is intended to prepare students for further education or training, for entry into employment and for their role as participative, enterprising citizens.  To that end there are in fact three separate Leaving Certificate programmes, each of which lasts for two years and culminates in the award of a Leaving Certificate upon completion.</P>
        <P>The majority of senior cycle students (68%) take the established Leaving Certificate. Typically, students take six or seven subjects in which they undergo written terminal examinations along with oral and aural examinations for Irish and modern languages.  Practical tests and project work form part of the assessment for some subjects.</P>
        <P>Some 26% of students take the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme (LCVP).  This is best described as a Leaving Certificate with a strong vocational dimension. LCVP students must take at least five Leaving Certificate subjects along with two link modules &mdash; one on preparation for the world of work and the other on enterprise education.  Assessment comprises two elements &mdash; a written examination and coursework.</P>
        <P>The Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA) is taken by around 6% of students. It is aimed at preparing students for adult and working life and it is a person-centred course involving a cross-curricular approach rather than a subject-based structure.  Assessment for the LCA is carried out over the two years of the programme.</P>
        <P>The Leaving Certificate has a wide variety of users. Foremost amongst these are third level institutions who, since 1992, use a common points system based on grades achieved in Leaving Certificate subjects. In addition, employers and training providers use the Leaving Certificate extensively as a selection tool.  F&Aacute;S also accepts the LCA as a qualification for entry to standards-based apprenticeships.</P>
        <P>On that  basis I believe it would be unwise to change the title of the Leaving Certificate to reflect its use by third level institutions for selection purposes.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, the National Council for Special Education is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special needs. Applications for SNAs may be considered by the NCSE where a pupil has a significant medical need for such assistance, a significant impairment of physical or sensory function or where their behaviour is such that they are a danger to themselves or to other pupils. A pupil&rsquo;s level of care may diminish over time as the child matures.  Pupils may move to a different school or on to post-primary school. In such situations, the NCSE will review and adjust the SNA support required in the school.   The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support.</P>
        <P>All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</P>
        <P>The NCSE will undertake to review a decision taken by a SENO on foot of a request from a school or parents/guardians, when accompanied by relevant additional information, which may not have been to hand at the time of the decision. The NCSE has outlined this process in its Circular 01/05.</P>
        <P>I have arranged for the details supplied by the Deputy to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>In June 2001, the then Minister for Education and Science announced that the Government had approved a programme of structural reform of the Department arising from the recommendations in the Cromien report.</P>
        <P>The programme consisted of:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="is0p4" />i. <Miles com="ix" />The establishment of a State Examinations Commission (SEC) (para. 32).</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="is0p2" />ii. <Miles com="ix" />The establishment of a National Council for Special Education (NCSE) (para. 28).</P>
<P el="5">iii. <Miles com="ix" />The establishment of a framework of regional offices of the Department (paras 49 to 52).</P>
<P el="5">iv. <Miles com="ix" />Bringing forward legislation to extend the remit of the Higher Education Authority (HEA) to the Institutes of Technology (para 37).</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The SEC has operated from Athlone since its establishment in 2003.  The NCSE was established in 2003 by statutory instrument and re-established by the Education for Persons with Special <Col N="691"/>Educational Needs Act 2004 (ESPEN). It is based in Trim, with a regionalised network of Special Educational Needs Organisers.</P>
        <P>A network of 10 regional offices has been established, with offices located in Findlater Street, Dublin, Tallaght, Dublin, Naas, Mullingar, Limerick, Navan, Sligo, Waterford, Cork and Galway. As this network was in the process of development from 2005 to 2007, managing high staff turnover arising as a consequence of decentralisation during that period was challenging. Turnover in the regional offices is now at normal levels and a recurrence of high levels of turnover is not anticipated. The Directorate of Regional Services has recently decentralised from Dublin to Mullingar.</P>
        <P>The Institutes of Technology Act 2006 extended the remit of the HEA to co-ordinate and fund the Institutes of Technology. Decentralisation does not impact on this arrangement.</P>
        <P>In addition to the reforms approved by Government, my predecessors indicated throughout 2001 and 2002 that the reform of the Department would also include regulatory reform and appellate processes to under-pin key allocation functions, along with the implementation of efficiency measures designed to bring the Department&rsquo;s procedures and processes more into line with modern administrative practice. A range of measures have been introduced since 2001 &mdash; many of which are in line with recommendations in the Cromien report. Examples include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Establishment of independent Appeals Boards in connection with teacher allocation.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Establishment of School Transport Appeals Boards.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">Continuing implementation of EPSEN will provide a statutory appeal process. The Student Support Bill 2008, when enacted, will provide for an appeal process.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Responsibility for the operation of payrolls for schools was previously spread over several sections. My Department has since set up a Central Payroll Division, catering for approximately 70,000 school based employees, along with a web based on-line claims systems for primary and second level schools.</P>

        <P>Negotiations with school bus operators regarding school bus contracts are a matter between Bus &Eacute;ireann and the individual contractors and these negotiations take place prior to the commencement of the new school year in September.

	<P>Education Ireland is a new body which is to be established in line with the recommendations of the Report on the Internationalisation of Education Services. The new body will be responsible for promoting the development of Ireland as a centre of excellence for international education. It will bring together, and build upon, the work of  two existing bodies &mdash; International Education Board Ireland (IEBI), which promotes Irish third-level education overseas, and the Advisory Council for English Language Schools (ACELS), which undertakes voluntary regulation of the English language sector.</P>
        <P>Education Ireland&rsquo;s specific functions will include:</P>

	<P>Integrate Ireland Language and Training Ltd. (IILT) approached my Department earlier this year with a proposal to withdraw from direct tuition for adult refugees and with a request that this tuition be mainstreamed.</P>
        <P>IILT envisaged continuing direct tuition for a group of up to 200 programme refugees.</P>
        <P>My Department accepted that mainstreaming of service provision was appropriate as it accords with the overall approach to provision of services to migrants as set out in &ldquo;Migration <Col N="693"/>Nation&rdquo; &mdash; a statement on integration strategy and diversity management which I recently launched.</P>
        <P>In doing so the Department decided that all provision should be mainstreamed and provided by VECs as it would it would be less efficient to seek to continue with a small element of provision by IILT.</P>
        <P>The funding allocated to IILT will now be redirected to provide for the continuation of this service through the VEC network.</P>
        <P>The Irish Vocational Education Association has confirmed that it is happy to cooperate and collaborate with my Department in delivery of necessary English language services.</P>
        <P>The VEC sector has already developed best practice in ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) provision. The sector is already providing English language services for those whose first language is not English.</P>
        <P>At present services are provided to over 12,000 people annually which clearly demonstrates the capacity of the VECs in this area. A further advantage of mainstreaming such provision through the VEC sector is the fact that the VECs have a nationwide network across all counties and cities that can readily provide classes where needed in the country using their facilities in schools and centres.</P>

At the time of his previous Parliamentary Questions on 20th February 2008, the issue of patronage of the two new primary school buildings in Gorey referred to by the Deputy had not been decided and finalised.</P>
        <P>The Department had made a written proposal to the Patrons of the two existing primary schools in Gorey seeking their formal agreement to relocate their existing schools to the new school buildings for which planning permission had been applied. These written proposals were forwarded to the patron bodies of the schools concerned on 11th February 2008. No formal response to these proposals had been received from the Patrons at the time of the earlier Parliamentary Questions and therefore it was not possible to state that the issue of patronage had been decided and finalised at the time.</P><Col N="694"/>
        <P>Detailed agreement to these proposals were subsequently achieved with the Patrons and arrangements are well advanced for the two schools concerned to move to the new school buildings at the commencement of the new school year.  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The new Leaving Certificate examination schedule for 2008 was agreed with a working group representing the Partners in Education, and was designed to reduce the demand on students especially during the first week of the examinations. It advanced Chemistry, which is sat by some 7000 students, and Geography, sat by some 25000 students, to Thursday and Friday respectively of the first week, which, along with Home Economics which is sat by some 12000 students, ensured that the majority of students got a break of at least one half day during this intensive phase. The new timetable was designed to reduce the writing burden on students by introducing a new mix of subjects between those that involve concentrated writing and those that involve less such as mathematical or scientific papers.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to say that the new timetable meant that there were only 64 students who did not get a half day off in the first week of the 2008 Leaving Certificate exams.  This is a vast improvement on 2007 where there were 11,080 students who did not get a half day.</P>
        <P>I met with more than 90 students on Tuesday last who have just completed the Leaving Certificate to hear their views on the new timetable. The very valuable feedback which I received from the students will be taken into account in our consideration of any future changes to the Leaving Certificate timetable.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government sets out the overarching policy position in relation to the provision of additional teachers and on reductions in class size over the life of the Government.</P>
        <P>The Programme contains a commitment to increase the number of primary teachers by at least 4000 and on that basis to make further progress on reducing class sizes.</P>
        <P>Budget 2008 provided my Department with &euro;4.6 billion or &euro;380 million extra for teacher pay and pensions. This was a very substantial level of additional investment in the terms of the economic environment on which the budget was based. That allocation provides for paying for over 2000 extra primary teachers more than the number in schools when the Government took office last Summer. It covers the additional teachers that went into schools last September for the previously announced reduction to a 27 to 1 based staffing schedule along with additional <Col N="695"/>teachers this school year and in the coming school year to meet increasing enrolments, to provide for special needs and the language requirements of newcomer children.</P>
        <P>This means that in terms of the overall commitment to provide at least 4000 additional teachers the Government in its first two years in office will be well ahead of target.</P>
        <P>All Programme for Government commitments to improve public services including those relating to class size are contingent on the economic and budgetary environment and the need for prudent expenditure and fiscal management. Even since the presentation of Budget 2008 last December there have been significant alterations in the external and domestic environment. In that context any reasonable observer would regard the fact that the Government has already taken measures that will see the allocation of over 2000 additional teachers to primary schools as a considerable investment all things considered.</P>

<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Primary Curriculum Support Programme (PCSP) and the School Development Planning Support (SDPS) service have prepared planning templates (with prompts) for schools to assist them in school planning for the implementation of PE curriculum and the wider aspects of physical activity and school sport.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The majority of schools currently participating in the School Completion Programme, under the DEIS action plan, operate breakfast clubs or other meal provision, in accordance with nutritional guidelines issued by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>

	<P>A consultancy report, which was submitted to my Department in 1993, dealt with the factors which contribute to the cost of school text books.  The main conclusion of that report was that book rental schemes are the most practical way of limiting the cost of school books to parents.</P>
        <P>The report, copies of which were sent to all schools, contains a number of useful suggestions, including a Code of Good Practice for successful operation of book rental schemes.  My Department endorsed the recommendations and urged school authorities to put in place book rental schemes to the greatest extent possible.</P>
        <P>At post primary level, in addition to the provision of grants towards the cost of providing school textbooks for needy pupils, my Department also provides seed capital funding towards the cost of establishing book loan/rental schemes in schools designated as disadvantaged and/or schools which participate in schemes designed to combat educational disadvantage.  The intention is to provide some specific financial support for the introduction or expansion of book loan/rental schemes in individual schools on an annual basis. This funding is made available for a maximum of five or six years, depending on whether a school offers a Transition Year programme.  It is envisaged that schools which receive seed capital will be in a position to establish sustainable book loan/rental schemes which, after the initial special assistance, will operate on a self-financing basis where ongoing costs will be met by fee income, which can be subsidised in the case of needy pupils from the general book grant scheme allocation.  Funding in respect of seed capital amounts to &euro;0.5m in 2008.</P><Col N="697"/>
        <P>Schools are also free to operate second-hand book exchanges and I consider that locally operated rental or exchange schemes are the most appropriate and efficient way to address the issue of the cost of school books.</P>

	<P>Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a mandatory part of all programmes for primary students, and its implementation is being assisted by a full-time support service. The programme begins in the infant classes and specifically addresses the need for regular exercise, and examines food and nutrition issues and the need for a balanced diet. The objective is that by fifth and sixth classes, pupils are equipped to take responsibility for making wise food choices and adopting a healthy balanced diet, and in that context, exploring and examining the food pyramid. These themes are continued in the SPHE programme at junior cycle, as well as in the Home Economics, PE and Science curricula.</P>
        <P>Health and well-being along with food and nutrition are two areas dealt with under the &ldquo;taking care of my body&rdquo; unit of SPHE at primary level. SPHE is presented in three strands: Myself, Myself and others and Myself and the wider world.</P>
        <P>The strand &ldquo;Myself&rdquo; is concerned with the personal development of the individual child and his/her health and well-being. This strand also contributes to children establishing ways of thinking, feeling and acting that can help to promote and maintain health and well-being both now and in the future. Part of this strand deals with food and nutrition and enables the child to:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />become aware of the importance of food for growth and development</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />explore food preferences and their role in a balanced diet</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />discuss and explore some qualities and categories of food</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />realise the importance of good hygiene when preparing food to eat.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Physical education is also part of the curriculum at primary and at post-primary level and plays a key role not just in giving students an opportunity to exercise during the school day but also in encouraging a positive attitude towards physical activity which students will hopefully carry with them into adult life.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 43 together.</P><Col N="698"/>
        <P Just="Left">The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the 124 School Completion Programme sites, comprising 224 post-primary and 468 primary schools currently participating in the School Completion Programme, has been forwarded to the Deputies. These projects will continue to be funded for the duration of the DEIS Action Plan.</P>
        <P Just="Left">&euro;28.8 million was allocated to the School Completion Programme in 2007 with &euro;31 million allocated for 2008. The programme is funded on a multi-annual basis under the National Development Plan (NDP) and was assisted under the European Social Fund (ESF) up to 2007.</P>
        <P>The School Completion Programme encompasses both primary and post-primary levels and focuses on young people between the ages of 4 and 18 years and is designed to deal with issues of both concentrated and regionally dispersed disadvantage. SCP is a key component of DEIS ( Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion, which discriminates positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving.</P>
        <P>19,059 young people were targeted in-school under the School Completion Programme in 2006/2007.  This figure has increased to approx. 36,000 in 2007/2008 with the inclusion of new schools under DEIS.</P>
        <P>SCP projects target and focus programme resources in the first instance on the individual young people who are most at risk of early school leaving. Additionally, some strategies may include a wider group (e.g. in the case of sporting and leisure activities) or the entire school population (e.g. where tracking attendance is involved).</P>
        <P>The level of funding allocated to projects is dependant on the submission of their annual Retention plan and taking into account the level of disadvantage in the schools involved in each project, the target group selected for intensive supports, the salaries of personnel employed and the overall level of funding available to the programme.</P>

	<P>As part of the Programme for Government, a Developing Areas Unit was set up recently in my Department to focus on the school accommodation needs of rapidly developing areas, including the area to which the Deputy refers. The main emphasis in 2008 is on providing sufficient school places in these developing areas, as well as delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.</P>
        <P>In this context, the status of all schools in the area referred to by the Deputy are being assessed. The school referred to by the Deputy is being included in this assessment.</P>
        <P>On the matter of the offer of the new site, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that following a technical examination of the two acre site in question, my officials wrote to the local developer requesting contract documents.  A reply is awaited.</P>
        <P>As an interim measure while the school are awaiting their permanent building, my Department has sanctioned the rental of temporary premises and accommodation in order for the school to operate.</P><Col N="699"/>

The information sought by the Deputy regarding the amount of rental payments made to individual suppliers is not readily available in my Department and given the number of payments involved it would require a very large amount of staff time to assemble. The Deputy will appreciate that the matter is complicated by the fact that my Department provides grant aid (less the local contribution) to approved schools to meet rental costs. However, the actual contract is between the school and the supplier of the accommodation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the schools which have been identified for inclusion in DEIS, the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion, has been forwarded to the Deputy. A total of 90,000 children attend primary and 61,000 children attend post-primary schools participating in DEIS.</P>
        <P>In the region of &euro;800 million will be spent by the Department this year on tackling educational disadvantage at all levels &mdash; from pre-school to further and higher education. This represents an increase of nearly &euro;70 million on the comparable 2007 figure and is testament to the Government&rsquo;s determination to prioritise social inclusion and ensure that all our children and young people get the supports they need to do well at school. Social inclusion measures across all Government departments have also been prioritised under the Towards 2016 agreement, the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-16 and the National Development Plan.</P>
        <P>Enhancing attendance, progression, retention and attainment are central to DEIS which is being implemented at present. The action plan represents a shift in emphasis away from individual initiatives, each addressing a particular aspect of the problem, with the new plan adopting a multi-faceted and more integrated approach. This is the first time that an integrated educational inclusion strategy has been developed for 3-18 year olds in this country.</P>
        <P>The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) as the national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework, promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of <Col N="700"/>absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognized school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. The Board operates through 5 regional teams, with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. A service is provided from 26 locations nationwide.</P>
        <P>Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs) are appointed and deployed throughout the country to discharge the Board&rsquo;s functions locally. The NEWB&rsquo;s network of EWOs is the key means by which the Board delivers on its statutory remit to ensure that each child attends and benefits from education. EWOs employ a welfare oriented approach in the interests of the children and young people who do not attend school regularly, working collaboratively with schools, parents and other agencies in meeting the needs of the children and the young people concerned.</P>
        <P>In deploying its service staff, from its earliest development, the NEWB has prioritised the provision of services to the most disadvantaged areas and the most at-risk groups. This deployment includes areas designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme and to schools in the DEIS programme. There is a significant overlap between RAPID areas and the most disadvantaged areas identified under DEIS. EWOs provide an intensive service in these areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under Towards 2016 a commitment was made that an additional 100 posts in total would be provided for the NEWB and the National Educational Psychological Service by the end of 2009, to help further address absenteeism, early school leaving, behavioural problems and special needs. 15 of these posts were sanctioned for the NEWB in 2007. As new posts come on stream, DEIS designated schools will receive priority attention. EWOs respond to referrals from schools and every effort is made to work with those children most at risk and where schools indicate particular concerns. The NEWB also gives priority to children who have no school place or who have been expelled or who have been referred by the courts regardless of location.</P>
        <P>Early analysis of attendance data has shown improvement in areas. However, more in-depth studies are required to measure outcomes in respect of attendance and retention in the long term.</P>
        <P>The service provided by the NEWB is just one aspect of the comprehensive framework that this Government has put in place to support schools, families and young people themselves.</P>
        <P>The range of curricula available to students has also been widened by promoting the Junior Certificate Schools Programme, the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, and the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme in addition to the traditional Junior and Leaving Certificate curricula.</P>
        <P>Preventative measures have also been put in place such as the School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme.  The number of projects participating in the School Completion Programme has increased under DEIS to 124 projects spanning 26 counties, comprising 224 post-primary schools and 468 primary schools and targeting approx. 36,000 young people. A total of 450 local HSCL coordinators provide HSCL services to 691 schools (370 Primary and 281 Post primary), with an additional 80 posts made available in 2006 to extend Home School Community Liaison services to all schools selected to participate in DEIS that did not have such services. The previous Minister for this Department Mary Hanafin T.D., also extended a commitment to schools not selected to participate in DEIS but already in the HSCL scheme, to continue to support these schools in their efforts to deal with educational disadvantage among their students in line with both their size and level of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>The latest Retention Report published by the Department in March this year provides data on the cohort of pupils who entered the first year of the junior cycle in 1997, 1998 and 1999 and most of whom completed their senior cycle five to six years following the year of intake. <Col N="701"/>This is the third such report tracking pupil retention and the trend is showing yearly improvements in retention rates.  It is compiled from data on the Department&rsquo;s Post Primary Pupils Database and tracks students in State aided schools (with an estimate of those attaining their Leaving Cert in private institutions). It does not take into account students pursuing other educational pathways such as Youthreach or apprenticeship training.</P>
        <P>Key results from the report are:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Retention rates have been increasing slightly year-on-year since 1996. The national unadjusted retention rate for the 1999 cohort is 80.5% compared to 77.8% in 1996.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />When an adjustment is made for external candidates who complete their Leaving Cert in privately funded institutions, emigration and deaths, the national retention rate is 83.7% compared to 81.3% in 1996.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In relation to second chance educational opportunities for young people who left school early, this Government has shown a sustained commitment to providing greater opportunities in the adult and further education sectors. Many such young people take up places in Youthreach centres, while others pursue options such as F&Aacute;S apprenticeships.</P>

        <Quest> if the commercial companies who supply prefab classrooms and resource rooms to primary schools on a rental basis on which rent is paid in whole or in part by his Department are required to produce a tax clearance certificate to either the board of management or his Department before a rental contract is signed; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>My Department currently provides grant-aid towards the provision of temporary school accommodation to the management authorities of education providers where it is established that a need for such temporary accommodation exists.</P>
        <P>Generally, where primary schools require temporary accommodation, the Board of Management is responsible for acquiring temporary accommodation and the rental contract is between the Board of Management and the supplying contractor.  My Department provides grant-aid to the individual school authorities towards the costs of procuring the accommodation.  Such grant-aid is paid at a rate of 95% for schools with permanent recognition and 75% for schools with provisional recognition.  Schools are expected to pay a local contribution of the balance, with a threshold on the local contribution of &euro;3,175.</P>
        <P>While payment of State / Public Authority Grants, subsidies and similar type payments, by Government Departments and public authorities, of a value of &euro;10,000 or more, is subject to the person holding a current tax clearance certificate, Section 4.1 (iii) and 4.1(ii) of Circular 44/2006 Revised Tax Clearance Procedures for Grants and similar type payments excludes schools from this requirement.</P>
        <P>Increasingly, where new schools are established in rapidly developing areas, my Department directly provides the accommodation for schools from the start, and in these cases, the issue of local contributions and co-funding of the rental accommodation does not arise.  The rental contract is between my Department and the supplying contractor.  In these instances my Department require details of the relevant supplying contractor&rsquo;s Tax Clearance Certificate and the expiry date of such.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that my predecessor appointed a strategy group to advise on the priorities for expenditure on information and communications technology in schools, having regard to the provision in the National Development Plan for the investment of &euro;252m in the ICT in Schools Programme.  I intend to publish the group&rsquo;s report shortly. The report will cover areas of required investment over the lifetime of the national development plan. At its core will be the embedding of information and communications technology in the teaching and learning culture of schools. This will require continuing investment in teacher professional development to build further on the impressive teacher participation levels which have been evident to date. It will require the <Col N="707"/>continuing maintenance of a national broadband network for schools, the upgrading and renewal of hardware and the provision of software and digital content.</P>
        <P>Decisions on the timing and amount of expenditure in this area this year must be made in the overall context of the current budgetary situation. I am required to work within the budget set for the Department of Education and Science. My officials and I are reviewing the overall financial position with regard to spending trends and emerging pressures. Following this review, I anticipate that I will be in a position to make decisions on specific areas of expenditure.</P>
        <P>Turning to the specific position of disadvantaged schools, these schools are benefiting from the &euro;3.4m ICT Grant Scheme for DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) Schools from the Dormant Accounts (Educational Disadvantage) Fund.   Having approved the applications under the scheme last year, my Department has issued grants amounting to &euro;3.1m to schools so far this year.   The establishment of a &euro;1m Fund from the Dormant Accounts (Educational Disadvantage) Fund to assist up to 100 DEIS schools achieve Digital School Status was announced earlier this year.   My officials are finalising the scheme arrangements with the National Centre for Technology in Education and I will be announcing the details in due course.</P>

	<P>My Department does not have information on the average cost of a set of text books for the three years of the Junior Certificate cycle.</P>
        <P>Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second-level, mainly in the case of language subjects, decisions on which textbooks to use in first and second-level schools are taken at school level. My Department does not approve, commission, sponsor or endorse educational text-books. Books are commissioned and published by educational publishers, and schools select their books from those available from a number of publishers.</P>
        <P>My Department operates a grant scheme towards the cost of providing school textbooks for pupils from low-income families in schools at first and second-level. Schools are notified of the scheme each year by circular letter. Principal teachers administer the book grant schemes in schools in a flexible way under the terms of the schemes based on their knowledge of particular circumstances in individual cases. Many schools operate book rental schemes and second-hand book exchanges.</P>
        <P>A total of &euro;8m has been provided in my Department&rsquo;s Estimate in 2008 in respect of the School Books Grant Scheme at second-level.</P>

        <Quest> the relationship between his Department and its various agencies, including the National Education Welfare Board, the Garda National Immigration Bureau and the Reception and Integration Agency, in order to ensure that young adults attending secondary school are not arbitrarily removed from one area to another causing them to leave the secondary school into which they have settled as either refugees, asylum seekers or unaccompanied children, as described to his predecessor at a meeting in his Department on 22 April 2008 and representatives of the SSN group, all of <Col N="708"/>which are Dublin based inner city secondary DEIS one-band schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to note that the meeting referred to in the question was about second level DEIS One band schools that are located in inner city Dublin.  The Garda National Immigration Bureau and the Reception and Integration Agency are not agencies of the Department of Education and Science but instead come under the remit of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Department of Education and Science has a member of staff seconded to the Reception and Integration Agency.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, the National Educational Welfare Board does come under the remit of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
        <P>With regard to moving young adults from one area to another the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform draws a clear distinction between three categories of persons.</P>
        <P>Firstly, refugees are recognised by that Minister as being persons entitled to protection under the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees, as incorporated into Irish law.  Such persons have, in essence, the same residency rights as Irish citizens and are free to live and attend schools where ever they wish, throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The second category comprises asylum seekers who can opt to be accommodated by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA). RIA is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers under the system of Direct Provision.</P>
        <P>I understand from the RIA that the position is as follows.</P>
        <P>Generally, asylum seekers are accommodated in Dublin based reception centres for a few weeks and thereafter are dispersed to centres around the country in accordance with the long standing Government policy in this regard.</P>
        <P>Generally, once a family is dispersed there is no need to move that family further unless (i) RIA has a requirement to close that centre or (ii) there are overwhelming individual reasons to transfer that family.</P>
        <P>In relation to the former, accommodation provision is a demand led process driven by factors over which the RIA has no control. It is obliged to adjust its accommodation portfolio to reflect current demands.  Where a centre has to be closed down, RIA deals with the resultant moves sensitively, taking account, amongst other factors, of the need to ensure that disruption to education is minimised.  Similar account is taken when a move arises because of individual family circumstances.</P>
        <P>It needs to be understood that disruption of an asylum seeker&rsquo;s education can arise for a number of diverse reasons such as the family itself seeking a transfer or because of removal by the Garda National Immigration Bureau to another State by way of deportation or Dublin II removal.</P>
        <P>The third category comprises separated children seeking asylum (SCSA) &mdash; otherwise known as unaccompanied minors.  Responsibility for accommodating separated children seeking asylum (SCSA), aged under 18, lies with the Health Services Executive (HSE).  In general, the HSE provides such accommodation until they reach the age of 18 years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, under the Childcare Act, 1991, it is within the scope of the HSE to continue the care of those separated children over 18 whom the HSE consider &lsquo;vulnerable&rsquo;. The RIA does not insist on SCSA&rsquo;s aged 18 years and over, who are awaiting a decision on their application for asylum, moving on to adult accommodation if the HSE has, for example, raised the issue <Col N="709"/>of them being in a current Leaving Certificate year.  Any decision to move this group lies solely with the HSE.</P>
        <P>In summary, the Department of Education and Science has no part to play in the removal from one area to another of the categories of people specified above.</P>

        <P>Most sections of the Act are in operation, however, a small number of provisions have not been commenced.  While no dates have been set for the commencement of these provisions they will be commenced when it is feasible to do so.

	<P>The student services charge is levied by third level institutions to defray the costs of examinations, registration and students services. The charge was &euro;825 for the 2007/08 academic year. I should point out that the charge does not represent the total allocation towards student services from institutions budgets. The Institutions are autonomous bodies and as such determine the internal disbursal of funding, including funding of student services.</P>
        <P>All students who are eligible for means tested student support have the student charge paid on their behalf by the Local Authorities or the Vocational Education Committees, in addition to any maintenance grant and tuition fee grant they are entitled to.</P>
        <P>The Higher Education Authority (HEA) issued a Framework of Good Practice for the Provision of Student Services to the publicly funded Higher Education institutions in 1998. Particular reference was made to the principles of transparency and accountability. The Framework consists of guidelines to establish an appropriate system of consultation with students in the allocation of funding from the charge and in the determination of student services to be funded from this source. The HEA has periodically written to all institutions to remind them of their <Col N="711"/>function in relation to the student services charge and requesting confirmation that correct procedures are in place, in accordance with the Framework of Good Practice. I understand from the HEA that the Authority recently wrote once again to all institutions in relation to the charge reminding them of this Framework.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the HEA considers, generally, that the Framework has operated quite well in the sector.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved and paid for by NEPS.</P>
        <P>I can inform the Deputy that the number of educational psychologists employed by my Department for each year from 2004 to 2008 is as follows: 2004 &mdash; 128, 2005 &mdash; 123, 2006 &mdash; 127, 2007 &mdash; 138.   The figure currently stands at 137.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the current year under the terms of the T 2016 agreement my Department is committed to the expansion of psychologist numbers in the NEPS service to 169 and again in 2009 to 200.  In this connection and following a national recruitment competition organised by the Public Appointments Service, a panel of suitable candidates has been formed. Currently some 33 panellists have been offered specific appointments within the NEPS regional structure, some 30 have accepted the post offered and of these 13 have passed through the requisite Garda vetting process and are finalising arrangements with my Department&rsquo;s Personnel Section. This process will continue until the available posts are filled.</P><Col N="712"/>
        <P Just="Left">It is envisaged in this regard that the new recruits will be in place by the commencement of the new academic year in the order of the commitment as outlined.  Additionally it is envisaged that the undertaking in respect of 2009, a further 31 posts, panellists will be processed through this system to commence employment in the service early in the new calendar year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Further expansion or reorganisation of the service, including the SCPA, is being considered in the wider context of my Department&rsquo;s response to the full implementation of the EPSEN Act. In this regard my Department is now at an advanced stage in finalising proposals to facilitate implementation of the remaining sections of the Act, including the provisions in respect of assessment and individual education plans (IEPs). The time taken to finalise proposals reflects the complexities involved, the need for consultation across the wide range of people and sectors involved, the need to align with the requirements of the Disability Act, 2005 and define how the Health Service Executive (HSE) and NCSE will work together under both acts.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s priority is to ensure that the necessary training, guidance and supports are in place to facilitate the commencement of the remaining sections of the Act. It must also be acknowledged that, during this necessary period of preparation and planning for the roll-out of the EPSEN Act, my Department continues to expand capacity and services for students with special educational needs across the schools network through the work of the National Council for Special Education.</P>

	<P>Integrate Ireland Language and Training Ltd. (IILT) approached my Department earlier this year with a proposal to withdraw from direct tuition for adult refugees and with a request that this tuition be mainstreamed. IILT envisaged continuing direct tuition for a group of up to 200 programme refugees. My Department accepted that mainstreaming of service provision was appropriate as it accords with the overall approach to provision of services to migrants as set out in &ldquo;Migration Nation&rdquo; &mdash; a statement on integration strategy and diversity management which I recently launched. In doing so the Department decided that all provision should be mainstreamed and provided by VECs as it would be less efficient to seek to continue with a small element of provision by IILT.</P>
        <P>The funding allocated to IILT will now be redirected to provide for the continuation of this service through the VEC network. The Irish Vocational Education Association has confirmed that it is happy to cooperate and collaborate with my Department in delivery of necessary English language services. The VEC sector has already developed best practice in ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) provision. The sector is already providing English language services for those whose first language is not English. At present services are provided to over 12,000 people annually which clearly demonstrates the capacity of the VECs in this area. A further advantage of mainstreaming such provision through the VEC sector is the fact that the VECs have a nationwide network across all counties and cities that can readily provide classes where needed in the country using their facilities in schools and centres.</P>
        <P>IILT is a limited company. The company will now enter voluntary liquidation as a solvent concern. The Company will comply with its statutory obligations in relation to redundancy payments for the staff concerned.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the exploitation of parents and children who are obliged by some secondary schools to purchase new or revised editions of existing school text books when there has been no syllabus change for the year involved and the increased costs to pupils and parents associated with the new revised books; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second-level, mainly in the case of language subjects, decisions on which textbooks to use in first and second-level schools are taken at school level.</P>
        <P>Syllabus planners are conscious of the need to avoid over frequent changes, primarily in order to minimise increases in the cost burden for parents. School authorities have been advised that books should be changed only to the extent that is absolutely necessary. However, textbooks have to be changed periodically to enable teachers to keep their own and their students&rsquo; work educationally stimulating and to ensure that content and methodology are kept up to date.</P>
        <P>My Department operates a grant scheme towards the cost of providing school textbooks for pupils from low-income families in schools at first and second-level. Schools are notified of the scheme each year by circular letter.</P><Col N="714"/>
        <P>Principal teachers administer the book grant schemes in schools in a flexible way under the terms of the schemes based on their knowledge of particular circumstances in individual cases. Many schools operate book rental schemes and second-hand book exchanges.</P>
        <P>A total of &euro;8m has been provided in my Department&rsquo;s Estimate in 2008 in respect of the School Books Grant Scheme at second-level.</P>

	<P>My Department established a Gaeltacht Scholarship scheme in 2007. It is designed to enable children enrolled in designated disadvantaged post-primary schools to attend approved summer colleges for teaching Irish. The Galway Education Centre provides administrative support for the initiative.</P>
        <P>Funding of &euro;100,000 has been made available for the scheme for 2008. Applications for the 2008 scheme are still being processed and, to date, approximately 138 have been received.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 53 together.</P>
        <P>Further to Parliamentary Question No. 604, ref no 26456/08, the following documentation details the information pertaining to State-owned buildings plus buildings and car parking facilities that are leased by the Commissioners of Public Works on behalf of Government Departments.</P>
        <P>With regard to tenancy/occupancy termination the Commissioners are investigating the feasibility of surrendering the lease on Dundalk Government Offices, Earl House.  This property has been held on a 35-year lease without a break from 1975.  It had been used to house mainly Revenue and a small number of Social, Community &amp; Family Affairs staff.  These have now relocated to new accommodation as part of a previous Government Decentralisation programme.  The building is currently utilised as a storage facility for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>The following reply can also be used to respond to PQ ref no. 26454/08 which Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd has put down to the Minister for Agriculture and Food for reply.</P>

        <Quest> the estimated tax loss prevented by the introduction of Section 118B, Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, via section 21, Finance Act 2008; the main areas of avoidance giving rise to introduction to the section; the State and semi-State bodies involved in tax avoidance schemes prior to the introduction of the section; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that section 21 of the Finance Act 2008 clarified the tax treatment of what are known as &ldquo;salary sacrifice&rdquo; arrangements. These arrangements, which are in reality an application of a person&rsquo;s remuneration, consist of benefits being purchased or provided by an employer with the employee effectively paying for the benefits by means of a reduction in remuneration. Section 21 also placed on a legislative basis two long-standing administrative concessions that operated in this area, namely, for:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Travel passes given by an employer to an employee where the cost of the travel pass provided by the employer is matched by a corresponding reduction in the employee&rsquo;s remuneration and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a contribution by an employer to a Revenue approved profit sharing scheme where the contribution or part of the contribution by the employer is matched by a corresponding reduction in the employee&rsquo;s remuneration.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In both cases, the new legislation ensures that a tax charge does not arise on that part of an employee&rsquo;s remuneration used to buy the travel pass or to fund the profit sharing scheme.</P>
        <P>In all other cases of salary sacrifice, the legislation copper-fastens the Revenue view that such schemes are ineffective for tax purposes and do not operate to reduce an employee&rsquo;s taxable income. This position was outlined in an article in Tax Briefing 41, dated September 2000 which is available on www.revenue.ie.</P>
        <P>Over the last year or so, Revenue have become aware of a number of salary sacrifice arrangements, which as part of their motivation sought to reduce the taxable income of employees and thereby avoid PAYE, and employers and employees PRSI. While, as already stated, Revenue <Col N="719"/>dispute the effectiveness of such arrangements, the opportunity to copper-fasten this view was taken in the Finance Act 2008.</P>
        <P>Schemes in this area that have come to the attention of Revenue include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Attempts to circumvent the limits on personal contributions to pension schemes by forgoing taxable salary and transferring the contribution from the hands of the employee to the employer by means of a reduction in salary, and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Schemes designed to provide benefits, such as company cars, club fees or childcare, with the employer being recompensed by the employee foregoing taxable remuneration.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">As stated, Revenue has never accepted that these schemes are effective for tax purposes and as such it is not possible to say what, if any, tax loss may have arisen in this area. As such schemes are discovered, on audit or otherwise, they will be challenged and any tax found due will be recovered, together with interest and penalties, if appropriate. If, as part of any settlement, any such case falls to be published in accordance with the terms of section 1086 (publication of names of tax defaulters) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 then it will be published in accordance with that section but not otherwise.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that credit claims and requests for refunds from PAYE taxpayers are checked on a tiered basis based on value.  Larger claims are subject to a higher proportion of examination as they are thought to be higher risk.  I am further advised that overall, about 1% of claims for all tax credits, including One Parent Family Credit, are verified in this way. Some claims may subsequently be selected for a verification check.  Where it seems from the checks carried out that the claim is not valid, the credit will be withdrawn. Results of claims checked are recorded at case level, not centrally and are not credit specific. Consequently, it is not possible to provide the information requested.</P>
        <P>I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in taking this approach to PAYE credit claims, they are applying the principles of presumption of honesty and self-assessment to PAYE workers that have worked successfully for business taxpayers since 1988.  Where <Col N="721"/>credits (including one parent family credit) are claimed by self-employed taxpayers, this is done on the standard return of income.  These returns are all subject to audit and compliance checks in the normal way.</P>

        <Quest> the actuarial value of the pension benefits of civil service grades (details supplied), retiring on 1 July 2008, aged 60 with 40 years service completed; if he will provide a separate value for men and women and assume all are pre 1995 appointments including the basis for the calculations, including mortality, discount rate and future salary increases. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The information requested is set out below. The values provided are for a married person retiring on 1 July 2008 at age 60 with pensionable service of 40 years.  The pension benefits are those applying to a pre-1995 recruit to an established post in the civil service i.e. a person not subject to integration.  The benefits taken into account are therefore a retirement lump sum of 1.5 times pay, a main scheme pension of 50% of pay and a spouse&rsquo;s pension of 25% of pay. </P>
        <P>In order to value these benefits a number of technical assumptions must be made and the actuarial value of the benefits depends greatly on the assumptions used. The main assumptions used were:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A mortality table considered appropriate for valuing pension benefits for public servants; under this table the life expectancy at age 60 is 27 years for a male and 30 years for a female;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Annual discount rate of 6%;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Long term rate of inflation of 2% p.a. with pay increasing in line with inflation.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In the cases of all the grades mentioned and on the basis of the assumptions quoted above the actuarial value of the pension benefits works out at about 10 times current annual salaries.</P>
        <P>It might be noted the calculations are on the basis of maximum pension benefits in each case. On average, the value of pension benefits for a civil servant retiring from the relevant grades will be substantially less as many civil servants will retire with less than the maximum of 40 year&rsquo;s service, many others will retire after the minimum retirement age of 60 and some will not be married.</P>
        <P>Females are expected, on average, to live for longer than males so that the value of a main scheme pension is estimated to be greater for a female than for a male. However, this is balanced by the value of a spouses benefit being greater for a male member since a female spouse is likely to be younger and have a greater life expectancy than a male spouse. Therefore the figures apply equally to both males and to females.</P>

	<P>The Deputy is aware that the operation of the scheme for tax relief on donations to certain sports bodies is governed by the provisions of section 847A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. These bodies must be an &ldquo;approved body of persons&rdquo; established for and existing for the sole purpose of promoting athletic or amateur games or sports.  They must also have been granted tax exemption under section 235 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a list of sports bodies who have been granted tax exemption under this section is available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie.  </P>
        <P>The precise arrangements for allowing tax relief on donations depends on whether the donor is a PAYE taxpayer, a person who is subject to self-assessment or a company.

In this instance the claim for refund of the tax deducted by the donor is made to Revenue by the approved sports body.  In the case of a self-assessed donor, the donation is paid gross and that individual claims the tax relief in their tax return. In the case of a company, the donation is paid gross and the company claims a deduction for the donation as if it were a trading expense.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Deputy is aware that the operation of the scheme for tax relief on donations to eligible charities and other approved bodies is governed by the provisions of section 848A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. Bodies, including schools, colleges, universities, bodies approved for education in the arts as well as a number of other specified organizations are defined as approved bodies for the purposes of the donations scheme by virtue of the specific groups of entities listed in Schedule 26A of the 1997 Act. In addition charities that hold charitable tax exemption for a period of at least two years may apply for approval under the donations scheme. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a list of charities approved for the purposes of the donations scheme is available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie. The full details of the terms and conditions of the scheme are available in Leaflet CHY 2 which can be also accessed on the Revenue website.</P>
        <P>The precise arrangements for allowing tax relief on donations depends on whether the donor is a PAYE taxpayer, a person who is subject to self-assessment or a company. For a PAYE donor, the relief is given on a &ldquo;grossed up&rdquo; basis to the eligible charity or approved body, as the case may be, rather than by way of a separate claim to tax relief by the donor. In this instance the claim for refund is made to Revenue by the approved body or eligible charity.  In the case of a self-assessed donor, that individual claims the relief and there is no grossing up arrangement. In the case of a company, it will claim a deduction for the donation as if it were a trading expense.</P>
        <P>I am informed by Revenue that the records maintained by them do not easily provide a basis for compiling the detailed information sought by the Deputy. In particular their records do not readily differentiate between tax refund/relief allowed in respect of donations to national schools, fee paying or non-fee paying second level schools, third level institutions, Universities or third world charities. In addition the arrangement for granting the relief is dependent on the donors tax status i.e. PAYE only donor where the charity or approved body claims the relief, self assessed donor where the individual claims the relief and a company donor where the donation is claimed as if it were a trading expense.</P>
        <P>The following table sets out figures of the estimated cost to the Exchequer of tax relief on donations to approved bodies and eligible charities within the meaning of Section 848A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 in so far as they are available for the years 2003 to 2007.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I am advised by Revenue that they are not in a position to provide data for 2006 to 2008 in respect of self-employed donors, as the tax returns for those years are either being processed currently or not yet due. In respect of PAYE donors for 2008 the claims by the approved bodies are not yet due.</P><Col N="725"/>
        <P>There were no recorded claims for tax relief on donations to approved bodies by companies with accounting periods ending in 2006. As data on donations made by companies were not captured in corporate tax returns for accounting periods ending in years prior to 2006 there is, therefore, no basis on which an estimate of the associated costs to the Exchequer can be compiled for those years.</P>

        <AskConj><b> </b>asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> the number of claims under sections 847A and 848A of the Taxes Consolidated Act audited in the years 2003 to 2007 inclusive with a summary of the findings. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 847A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 governs the scheme for tax relief on donations to certain sports bodies and section 848A governs the operation of the scheme for tax relief on donations to eligible charities and other approved bodies. </P>
        <P>I am advised by Revenue that the precise arrangements for allowing tax relief on donations under both sections depends on whether the donor is a PAYE taxpayer, an individual who is subject to self-assessment or a company.  In the case of donors who are PAYE taxpayers, the relief is given on a &ldquo;grossed up&rdquo; basis to the eligible body (rather than by way of a separate claim to tax relief by the donor).  In this instance the claim for refund is made to Revenue by the eligible body.  In the case of a self-assessed donor, that individual claims the relief in his/her income tax return and there is no grossing up arrangement. In the case of a company, it will claim a deduction for the donation as if it were a trading expense.</P>
        <P>In processing claims by eligible bodies, Revenue carries out routine checks commensurate with the risk involved. These checks include a sampling of the claims and declarations made by the donors to verify the accuracy of the information contained therein.</P>
        <P>The veracity of claims by both donors and eligible bodies may also be checked as part of the audit process undertaken by Revenue. However, as many Revenue audits cover more than one tax and more than one issue it is not possible to provide statistics in relation to the number of cases where Revenue auditors specifically looked at Section 847A/848A claims in particular cases. Where a case is selected for audit the auditor will usually take the opportunity to look at many aspects of compliance, including Sections 847A and 848A claims if they are applicable to the case, but no separate statistics are kept as regards the nature of the aspects examined.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the absence of statistics in relation to the audit of claims under sections 847A and 848A, I am advised by Revenue that they have no indications of any significant problems with the operation of these tax reliefs.</P>

	<P>The Bill providing for the Fair Deal scheme is being finalised by the Office of the Attorney General at present. The legislation is complex and requires careful drafting in order to ensure that the interests of older people requiring residential care are fully protected.</P>
        <P>My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, intends to publish the Bill as soon as possible following finalisation by the Attorney General and Government approval, and to bring the legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas thereafter. As the timeframe for bringing the legislation through both Houses is contingent upon finalisation of the Bill, a more definitive answer is not possible at this stage.</P>
        <P>The Minister has considered carefully the question of allowing some of the funding allocated for Fair Deal to be used for nursing home subvention and her officials are now discussing this matter with the Department of Finance. As soon as a decision is reached, it will be announced. However, it should be borne in mind that the Government already allocated additional funding of &euro;20 million for Nursing Home Subvention in 2006 and Budget 2007 provided a further &euro;85 million &mdash; this is an increase of &euro;105 million in nursing home subvention in two years.</P>

        <Quest> the proposals which have been put forward under the efficiency review 2008 initiated on budget day 2008 by her Department and agencies operating under her Department; and the aggregate savings to be made by implementation of these savings in 2008 and in the full year for 2009. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of the Efficiency Review announced by the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance, Mr. Brian Cowen,T.D. in his 2008 Budget Speech, my Department has been examining various areas where potential savings and efficiencies can be achieved.</P>
        <P>In relation to Bodies under the aegis of my Department the position is that agencies (other than the HSE and HIQA) are predominantly small in terms of organisational size and expenditure, and a number are self-funding.</P>
        <P>A comprehensive independent review of health organisations (Audit of Structures and Functions in the Health System) was published in 2003. Considerable rationalisation has already taken place under the 2004 and 2007 Health Acts, and other changes are already planned, as follows:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The National Cancer Screening Service Board and the National Cancer Registry are to be subsumed into the 	HSE as part of the Cancer Control Programme;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The National Council for the Ageing and older People is to be mainstreamed into the newly-established Office for Older People;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the Medical Practitioners&rsquo; Act 2007, provides for the dissolution of the Post Graduate Medical &amp; Dental Board and the streamlining of the Board&rsquo;s functions to the HSE, Medical/Dental Councils, as appropriate;</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the functions of the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery are to be subsumed by An Bord Altranais and the HSE once the proposed new Nursing and Midwifery Bill is passed; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the National Social Work Qualification Board is due to be streamlined into the National Council for Health and Social Care Professions in the next year or so.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The potential for further streamlining and/or rationalisation is being considered in the context of the Efficiency Review referred to above, and  will also arise in the context of our response to the OECD Review of the Irish Public Service (&ldquo;Toward an Integrated Public Service&rdquo;), which was recently published.</P>
        <P>Efficiencies are already being implemented by agencies within the health sector in the areas of procurement, business processes, and outsourcing. Additional benefits might also accrue <Col N="734"/>from sharing of functions, and my Department is considering how the necessary co-ordination might be applied to allow such possibilities to be exploited.</P>
        <P>Within my Department we have identified the following as having the potential to deliver further savings and/or efficiencies:</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />an increased use of on-line, rather than hard-copy (paper) publishing;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />in collaboration with the Office of Public Works, we are participating in the Staff Energy Awareness Campaign (Optimising Power @ Work) which has a target to reduce Carbon Dioxide emissions by a minimum of 15% per annum;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />we have reduced the hours during which Hawkins House is open over weekends, thus reducing staff costs;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />we are examining how we might reduce the levels of absenteeism among our staff,and will proactively manage this area;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />we will review our postal and telecommunications spend to obtain the best possible deal for our mobile and other phone and telecoms services;</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">My Department is also examining potential savings through increased use of collective or shared procurement arrangements from shared finance, payroll, ICT and some HR arrangements, but it is likely that these would require central direction and co-ordination if they are to be applied across Departments.</P>

        <P>The HSE is currently reviewing its overall financial position for the year and roll &mdash; out of planned developments in disability services is being considered in that context.  I have been in communication with the HSE with a view to an early determination on the matter.  The HSE has informed my Department that it plans to release &euro;20m  of the &euro;50m  additional funding for Disability Services. The Deputy&rsquo;s specific question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to assure the Deputy that tackling Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs), including MRSA, continues to be a priority for the Government and for the Health Service Executive (HSE). The Strategy for the control of Antimicrobial Resistance in Ireland (SARI) was launched in 2001.  This strategy, which is based upon best international practice, represents a road map for tackling antibiotic resistance as well as HCAIs.  Guidelines on The Control and Prevention of MRSA in Hospitals and in the Community were produced by a SARI Infection Control Subcommittee in 2005.  In drawing up these guidelines, the subcommittee reviewed the 1995 Irish Guidelines and utilised guidelines produced in other countries including the UK, USA, New Zealand and the Netherlands.  Responsibility for the implementation of these guidelines rests with individuals, hospital executives and, ultimately, the HSE.</P>
        <P>The HSE launched a National Infection Control Action Plan in March 2007.  An Infection Control Steering Group is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the plan.  Over the next five years, the HSE aims to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infections by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%.  Achievement of these targets will benefit all patients who are at risk.  The Steering Group is supported by eight Local Implementation Teams which will ensure that all local facilities are focused on achieving the national targets. A new National Surveillance System has recently been established by the HSE to collect data and provide information on a quarterly basis on four key areas,  to monitor HCAIs in our health system:</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P el="5">1. Staphylococcus bacteraemia (blood stream infections);</P>
        <P el="5">2. Antibiotic consumption;</P><Col N="737"/>
        <P el="5">3. Alcohol gel use;</P>
       <P el="5">4. MRSA Surveillance in Intensive Care Units, from 2008 onwards.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This data (excluding MRSA in ICUs) has been compiled and published for 2006 and 2007.  The report represents a significant step forward in terms of providing essential data that will serve as a benchmark for assessing progress in the future.  I firmly believe that you cannot manage what you do not measure. We have now with this system begun a very useful measurement process.</P>
        <P>The results so far show some improvement in 2007 over 2006.  The overall S. Aureus bloodstream infection rate was lower in 2007 (0.36) compared to 2006 (0.37).  The overall proportion of MRSA was also lower in 2007 (38.5%) compared to 2006 (42.4%).  The overall acute in-patient antibiotic consumption rate is marginally up in 2007 over the 2006 rate by 2.4%. The overall alcohol gel use is up by a significant 50%.  This data has many limitations that does not allow for direct comparison between hospitals.  Also, areas like the antibiotic prescribing are calculated on a bed-days usage basis and are affected by the different procedures and data collection and processing systems applied in hospitals.  However, the results are soundly based and will provide a good benchmark to enable us to measure the progress of each hospital.  From now on, this data will be available on a quarterly basis.  Data available from the EARSS Report  Quarter 1 of 2008 indicates that the proportion of MRSA was at the same level as overall for 2007.</P>
        <P>Since 2006, over 30 new staff in posts of Senior Pharmacists, Senior Infection Control Nurses and Surveillance Scientists have been appointed specifically to enhance infection control.  I have instructed the HSE that designated private beds should be used for isolation purposes where required for patients who contract HCAIs.  New environmental building guidelines to inform infection control policy in all new builds and refurbishments are expected to be published by the HSE later this month.</P>
        <P>The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) undertook a comprehensive review of hygiene in our acute hospitals in 2007 and published its report last November.  The report represents a thorough assessment of how hygiene services are provided and managed in 51 HSE-funded acute care hospitals.  This allows individual hospitals identify strengths and areas for improvement.  HIQA is following up on this review to ensure that deficits identified during that process are rectified and the Authority will be undertaking a further national review this Autumn.  In addition, on 3rd June HIQA published draft Infection Prevention and Control Standards for public consultation.  When finalised, these, along with the National Hygiene Standards, will provide a comprehensive framework to control infection in all healthcare settings.</P>
        <P>While accepting that not all HCAIs are preventable, I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of HCAIs generally and to treat them promptly when they occur.</P>

	<P>Work was completed in respect of the decentralisation of 50 Departmental and Road Safety Authority (RSA) staff in July 2007. The decentralisation of 10 posts from the Department&rsquo;s Road Haulage functions and 40 RSA posts to Loughrea was among the priority moves in the programme. This represents 10%  of the original target of 497 posts.</P>
        <P>In relation to Drogheda, The original  proposal to move 37 posts to that location was recently reviewed in the context of an efficiency review by my Department. I considered that decentralising a combination of safety investigation functions, the Railway Safety Commission (which was to relocated originally to Ballinasloe), and other areas to bring the numbers up to the total requirement of 37 for Drogheda offers greater potential for operational efficiency as well as value for money.</P>
        <P>The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) has recruited 36 staff for Shannon and are now located there, representing a further 7% of the original overall target. The decentralisation of 110 posts in the National Roads Authority (NRA) to Ballinasloe and 200 posts from the CIE group to Mitchelstown is also being progressed.</P><Col N="739"/>

	<P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, the Development Cooperation Directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is Irish Aid&rsquo;s Headquarters, is decentralising to Limerick. Following sanction by the Department of Finance of additional posts for DCD, the total number of posts decentralising to Limerick has increased from the original figure of 124 agreed by Government to 138.</P>
        <P>Good progress has been made and personnel have either been assigned to, or identified for, 112 posts or approximately 81% of the 138 posts scheduled to transfer to Limerick. The remaining 26 posts largely comprise the Development Specialist grades. The recent agreement involving the trade union IMPACT and the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs, provide a basis upon which the Development Specialist grades will transfer to the new Irish Aid headquarters in Limerick.</P>
        <P>An advance party has already decentralised to interim office premises in Limerick, with 60 officers currently in place. It is expected that the remaining staff of Irish Aid will transfer to Limerick between now and autumn 2008, on completion and fit-out of the new permanent offices.</P>
        <P>The detailed information requested by the Deputy in regard to the 112 posts currently assigned to, or identified for, Irish Aid in Limerick is conveyed in tabular format:</P>

	<P>In Budget 2008, the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance announced that the Government agreed to an efficiency review of administrative spending across all Departments.  As part of this process, Departments were required to examine their administrative spending and to provide specific proposals for savings to the Department of Finance.  My Department has submitted relevant proposals to the Department of Finance for review.</P>
        <P>I expect that the question of the publication of the outcome of the review exercise, and its implications for public expenditure in 2008 and 2009, will be considered by the Government in due course.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The situation regarding staffing levels in the Department is kept under regular review.  A monthly report is submitted to the Department of Finance detailing the number of staff employed by the Department and the number of vacancies on hand.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the figure for the number of vacancies being carried by the Department is constantly evolving.  The current figure for the number of vacancies is of the order of 20.</P>
        <P>It is the practice of my Department to operate as close as possible to its full complement of staff and to keep the number of vacancies to a minimum.  A competition is underway at present to set up a panel from which vacancies in the Development Specialist grades will be filled.  In addition, the Public Appointments Service is currently organising a competition for the Third Secretary entry grade.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Wage Subsidy Scheme is operated by F&Aacute;S on behalf of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Scheme is available to all employers (except public service employers <Col N="743"/>and/or any employers or schemes where wages are funded by F&Aacute;S) in the State who provide a minimum of 21 hours of employment per week to disabled workers.  The objective of the scheme is to increase the number of persons with a disability in employment, and as far as practicable provide a level playing field for them in seeking out, or remaining in employment.  There are currently 575 participants on the Wage Subsidy Scheme as of June 30 2008.</P>
        <P>An independent consultancy review has been commissioned by my Department to examine the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the operation of the Wage Subsidy Scheme over the initial pilot phase.  The objective of the review is to assess the operation and the impact of the scheme, and to identify areas which can be built upon to ensure that the scheme achieves maximum effect in meeting the objectives of:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />facilitating people with disabilities to enter full-time paid employment in the open labour market</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />encouraging employers, in both sheltered and mainstream settings, to employ people with disabilities</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />giving people with disabilities the opportunity to experience open labour market employment.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">This is with a view to rolling out the initiative into a full programme aimed at providing ongoing incentives for both employers and people with disabilities in the open labour market.</P>
        <P>The review has recently been completed and is now being considered by my Department in consultation with F&Aacute;S.  The findings of this review will inform the Department and F&Aacute;S on how the effectiveness of the scheme may be enhanced in the future as an incentive to both employers and disabled employees.</P>

	<P>F&Aacute;S as an agency of my Department operates two employment schemes namely Community Employment (CE) and Job Initiative (JI).  Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.  The programme helps unemployed people to progress to the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine and assists them in enhancing/developing both their technical and personal skills.</P>
        <P>The Job Initiative (JI) programme provides full time employment for people who are 35 years of age or over, unemployed for 5 years or more, and in receipt of Social Welfare payments over that period.  The main purpose of the programme is to assist long-term unemployed people to prepare for work opportunities by providing participants with work experience, training and development opportunities.</P>
        <P>In relation to the information sought by the Deputy the following tables provide a breakdown of the number of recipients of one parent family allowance from the Department of Social and Family Affairs on Community Employment Schemes and Job Initiative Programmes on a <Col N="744"/>county basis for the years 2005 to 2008.  Table 3 provides an analysis of the time spent on Community Employment Schemes by participants registered in each year between 2005 and 2008.</P>

        <P FLI="0">In the case of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA), a decision was made prior to its establishment that it would be located in Naas, Co Kildare.  Having been established in December 2005 it moved to new offices at Naas, in January 2006.  All IAASA staff have been based in its offices in Naas since its establishment, and as such the Authority is fully decentralised.</P>
        <P>In parallel with the decentralisation process, as recently outlined by the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment in the D&aacute;il, Enterprise Ireland has been strengthening its regional focus in recent years and now has a major new presence in the Shannon Region in addition to its eight other regional offices.  EI now has a major presence in the Shannon region.  EI has established its new National Regional Development Headquarters in Shannon and has established the County Enterprise Support Unit in Shannon.</P>
        <P>Currently there are 40 staff working in our Shannon office and it is expected that approximately 65 EI staff will be in place in Shannon over the coming months.  A senior manager has been appointed as Head of Regions and Entrepreneurship to oversee the establishment of the EI presence in the Mid-West Region.  EI managers with responsibility for the County Enterprise Co-ordination Unit and EI Regional Development strategy as well as the Regional Director with responsibility for the Mid West Regional are now in place in our Shannon office.  As part of EI&rsquo;s regional strategy, these six posts were assigned to the new office in Shannon <Col N="747"/>from Dublin.  EI has leased high-spec office space in Westpark, Shannon, to accommodate this new Regional HQ.</P>

	<P>In his Budget speech on 5 December 2007, the Minister for Finance announced that the Government had agreed to an Efficiency Review of administrative spending across the public service, with a view to reducing the cost of existing levels of service for 2009.  It was further announced that proposals submitted by Departments would be reviewed within the Department of Finance, who would report to the Government on the issue.</P>
        <P>As the outcome of the Efficiency Review is still being considered by the Department of Finance and by the Government, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter at this stage.</P>

	<P>Following the announcement of the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme in the 2004 Budget, the Department, which has a staff of 130 excluding the National Archives, was designated an &ldquo;early mover&rdquo; by the Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG).  To date, 77 members of staff have relocated to temporary accommodation in Fossa, Killarney, in three tranches, 45 in September 2006, 25 in July 2007 and 7 in May and June 2008.  This represents 59% of the original target.</P>
        <P>A further 8 staff have been assigned to posts in the Department in Dublin which will transfer in due course to the Department&rsquo;s new headquarters in Killarney.  Of the staff in the Department who originally indicated their willingness to relocate, four have opted to stay in Dublin.  Such staff will transfer to other Departments remaining in Dublin.</P><Col N="748"/>
        <P>No staff from the State Agencies under the aegis of my Department, namely the Irish Sports Council, the Arts Council and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, have yet decentralised to any of the three designated locations, Killarney, Kilkenny or Mallow.  Although these agencies have not been designated as &ldquo;early movers&rdquo; they have decentralisation implementation plans in place that are under constant review.  The Office of Public Works (OPW) is currently assessing a number of options in respect of suitable locations and properties for these agencies in their designated locations.</P>

        <Quest> the reason a person (details supplied) in County Westmeath who sought an increase in their disability allowance has, on foot of the request, been deemed ineligible for an allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>Disability Allowance is a weekly Allowance paid to people with a specified disability who are aged over 16 and under 66.  The disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to both medical assessment and a means test.</P>
        <P>The person concerned made an application for disability allowance on 30 May 2007.  He was deemed medically suitable for disability allowance.  The person concerned was visited by the Social Welfare Inspector who assessed weekly means from an occupational pension paid to him of &euro;512.98 per week.  As this exceeded the statutory limit of &euro;197.80 per week, he was refused disability allowance on 4 June 2008.  The person concerned was formally notified of this decision by letter and of his right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>
        <P>Following your recent representations, his disability allowance claim was reviewed by the Department.  He was assessed with means of &euro;510.00 per week which still exceeded the statutory limit of &euro;197.80 per week.  Refusal to grant disability allowance was upheld.  The person concerned still has a right to appeal this decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office if he is dissatisfied with this decision.</P>

	<P>The information requested is given in the following tabular statements.  Table A sets out the 2008 monthly schedule of planned expenditure for Vote 38 and Table B sets out the corresponding expenditure and income schedule for the Social Insurance Fund.  Given the demand led nature of the Department&rsquo;s schemes and the difficulties associated with scheduling expenditure on weekly schemes into a monthly framework, these profiles are indicative only.</P>
        <P>Tables C and D show actual expenditure incurred and income received in the first four months of the year for Vote 38 and the Social Insurance Fund, respectively.  Full expenditure data for the month of May is not yet available.  I do not propose publishing this information on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

	<P>Under the Government&rsquo;s current decentralisation programme for the civil and public service, some 1,200 posts comprising the Department&rsquo;s headquarter sections and the Social Welfare Appeals Office are relocating to 6 locations &mdash; Sligo, Carrick-on-Shannon, Donegal Town, Buncrana, Carrickmacross and Drogheda.  In addition, the Combat Poverty Agency (CPA) and Citizens Information Board (CIB) are scheduled to relocate to Monaghan and Drogheda, respectively, under the programme.</P>
        <P>To date, 207 posts have relocated from the Department&rsquo;s Dublin Offices to Carrick-on-Shannon and Sligo &mdash; 135 posts to Carrick-on-Shannon which represents 60% of the original target and 72 posts to Sligo which represents 72% of the original target.  In addition, the Department has decentralised offices in Longford, Sligo, Letterkenny, Waterford, Dundalk and Roscommon and some 210 employees have transferred to these offices and other offices of the Department to fill vacancies created by the current decentralisation programme.  Furthermore, a total of 238 employees of the Department have transferred to other Government Departments for the purposes of their decentralisation programmes.</P>

	<P>One of the qualifying conditions for entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is that the claimant must have sustained a substantial loss of employment and earnings.  This occurs where a person has lost at least one day&rsquo;s work per week in comparison with their normal level of employment, together with a reduction in earnings.  When making a decision as to whether a person has sustained a substantial loss of employment the Deciding Officer examines their work pattern over a representative period.</P>
        <P>The person concerned was employed on an infrequent and irregular basis when she previously claimed jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  She was awarded benefit for any day of unemployment in the course of that claim.   Her entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit exhausted on 18 March 2008.  However, she made a further claim for the benefit on 31 March 2008 and she had sufficient contributions paid to re-qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  A Deciding Officer, having examined her work pattern in the previous year, determined that her normal level of employment is 3 days per week.  She is, therefore, entitled to a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit payment, for days of unemployment, in weeks where she works for less than 3 days.</P>
        <P>Under Social Welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims must be made by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers.  These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, on foot of an announcement in the 2008 Budget of an efficiency review of administrative spending across the public service, each Department was required to examine such spending, both within its own ambit and of bodies under its aegis, and to provide proposals for administrative savings to the Department of Finance.  My Department provided proposals in this regard in March last, which are being considered by the Department of Finance. The Deputy will appreciate that as the proposals remain part of the deliberative process, and are being considered in the context of the preparation of the 2009 Estimates, it would not be appropriate for me to make any such proposals public.</P>

My Department&rsquo;s position is that the person named has a claim to only one of the shares and not three shares as claimed by him. It is the view of my officials that it would be best if a meeting with the person named now took place in the presence of his solicitor. The person named should have his solicitor contact my officials in this regard.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, a large number of students take Masters by research and PhD programmes in our higher education institutions (HEIs). The precise breakdown between those that are publicly funded and those that are not is not readily available. However, as regards the theses arising from such programmes, these are traditionally retained in hard copy in academic libraries in HEIs and are readily accessible by staff and students. Other members of the public can access these works by making the appropriate arrangements with the institution. </P>
        <P>Recently, the research funding agencies have begun the implementation of an &lsquo;open access&rsquo; policy for publicly funded research. The Higher Education Authority (HEA) has developed a policy on Open Access which will be implemented for all future research funding calls.  Where a research publication arises in whole or in part from HEA-funded research, researchers will now also be required to file their published research papers in an open access repository as soon as is practical, but within six calendar months at the latest.</P>
        <P>In Ireland other agencies that have also adopted an Open Access Policy include the Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology (IRCSET), Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) and The Health Research Board (HRB).</P>
        <P>In a project funded under Cycle 1 of the Strategic Initiative Fund, a number of Irish universities have developed open access repositories of their own and are now engaged in the development of a national open access repository system by connecting the repositories of each participating institution for fuller public accessibility and to increase exposure of Irish University published research.  Aside from its benefit to the academic and research community, the move towards open access will make theses and other research outcomes generally available to the interested public.</P>
        <P>As the deputy will further appreciate, the extent of the material sought is very broad and extends beyond the remit of my Department. If the Deputy could be more specific, the relevant funding agency or agencies would, I am sure, be in a position to facilitate her request.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Annual Census of Primary Schools is a paper-based census. Schools are requested to make their returns by 31st October each year. In the 2007/2008 school year 3,282 ordinary and special primary schools made returns.  All returns must be logged as received, checked and in some cases corrected with the input of the school Principal. These returns must then be keyed into a database, and various cross checks and validations must be performed to ensure the integrity of the data. Given the number of schools and returns involved, this process takes many months. In addition some schools can be quite late in making their returns, which can lead to a delay in processing. The information collected is used for payment of some grants, and for statistical purposes including calculating average class sizes. </P>
        <P>Work on the development of a Learner Database at Primary Level is continuing. The timing of the implementation of the Database depends on available resources and the management of competing priorities. However, in line with the Programme of Government and the Data Strategy of my Department, and taking advantage of the existing Education Services Interactive (esinet) portal already used by schools to access the On-Line Claims System, I am fully committed to the development of such a Database as a means of better quality information on pupils as well as reducing the administrative burden on schools and significantly reducing the processing time required for the Annual Census.</P>
        <P>The Post-Primary Pupils Database (PPPDB) holds basic information on each pupil attending a post primary school. In October of each year, all post primary schools make a return to my Department detailing their enrolments for the year. This is known as the &ldquo;October Return&rdquo; and it is used to populate my Department&rsquo;s Post Primary Pupils Database. In the school year 2007/08, 731 schools made returns. The &ldquo;October Return&rdquo; gives a snapshot of school enrolments by Programme level (Junior Cert, Leaving Cert, Class Year) as at 30th September each year. Detailed information on the subject choice of each student is also collected.</P>
        <P>A good overview of the type of information collected can be gained by looking at the Second-Level Education section of my Department&rsquo;s Annual Statistical Report. Much of the data in that section of the annual report is taken directly from the Post-Primary Pupils Database.</P>
        <P>The in-house processing of the October Returns and the provision of a &lsquo;Helpdesk&rsquo; facility for schools is carried out by the Post Primary Pupils Data Section of my Department. The data returned by each school needs to be checked and collated. Processing of the October Returns commences in October of each year and is normally completed around May of the following year. For 2007/2008 there were approximately 336,000 pupils on returns from 731 schools. While provisional figures on overall total enrolments for the school year are available at this stage it takes a number of weeks to prepare the data for publication.</P>
        <P>Data for individual schools become available throughout the process as their returns are received, checked and collated. Data from these schools may be used by my Department for a number of tasks, which impact directly on schools and their pupils, including: payment of per capita grants to voluntary secondary schools; determination of the provisional teacher allocations for all sectors i.e. Secondary, Vocational, Community and Comprehensive.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware the July Education Programme is available to all special schools and mainstream primary schools with special classes catering for children with autism who choose to extend their education services through the month of July. My Department also provides for a July Programme for pupils with a severe/profound general learning disability. My Department encourages all eligible schools to participate in this initiative in the interest of the children in question. There has been a steady increase in the number of schools offering the programme since it was introduced in 2001 when relevant schools were circulated with details.</P>
        <P>Where school based provision is not feasible, home based provision may be grant aided. As home tuition takes place outside of the normal school framework, there is need to ensure that tuition providers are appropriately qualified to give education to the children concerned. My Department&rsquo;s qualification preference is for a fully qualified teacher. Where parents cannot recruit a fully qualified teacher, then some alternative qualifications are acceptable including certain Montessori qualifications. Details in this regard are published on my Department&rsquo;s web site.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.  Posts allocated on the basis of this staffing schedule are specifically for mainstream classes and should be deployed accordingly. School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</P>
        <P>Data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy indicates that the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2006 was 49 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year is a Principal and 2 mainstream class teachers.</P>
        <P>According to data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2007 was 47 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0010/2008), which is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which has been issued to all primary schools, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2008/09 school year will be a Principal and 1 mainstream class teacher.</P>
        <P>Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</P>
        <P>It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. The criteria are also available in Circular 0024/2007 <Col N="769"/>(Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The staffing of the school for the 2008/2009 school year was considered by the Appeal Board on 20 May, 2008. The Board, having considered the appeal with regard to the criteria outlined in Circular 0024/2007, was satisfied that a departure from the staffing schedule is not warranted in this case.  The Board of Management of the school was notified in writing of the decision of the Appeal Board on 23 May 2008. The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum. </P>
        <P>Children in these classes benefit from having fully-qualified teachers who have access to training in a range of autism-specific interventions, including ABA, TEACCH and PECS. These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. Funding is also provided for assistive technology and specialist equipment as required and special school transport arrangements may also be put in place. The establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years. In excess of 315 classes have now been approved around the country.</P>
        <P>An ABA pilot scheme was established in the absence of this network of special classes in our schools. The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government commits to the long-term funding for the centres that are currently in the ABA pilot scheme subject to agree<Col N="770"/>ment with my Department on standards that will enable them to be supported as primary schools for children with autism. As discussions in this regard are ongoing between officials in my Department and groups representing the centres participating in the scheme the Deputy will appreciate that I can not comment further on this issue.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the most recent figures from the Central Statistics Office show that the south-east region has the highest rate of early school leavers and the second lowest rate of participation in full-time education; the measures he proposes to remedy this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[26479/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has adopted a broad-based approach to tackling early school-leaving.</P>
        <P>The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) as the national body with responsibility for school attendance.  The Act provides a comprehensive framework, promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognized school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. The Board operates through 5 regional teams, with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. A service is provided from 26 locations nationwide.</P>
        <P>Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs) are appointed and deployed throughout the country to discharge the Board&rsquo;s functions locally. EWOs employ a welfare oriented approach in the interests of the children and young people who do not attend school regularly, working collaboratively with schools and other agencies in meeting the needs of the children and the young people concerned. It is encouraging to note research findings that attendance at school in the areas where EWOs are working intensively improved by 4% in 2004/05 compared with the previous year.</P>
        <P>Enhancing attendance, progression, retention and attainment are central to DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, which is being implemented at present. This is the first time that an integrated educational inclusion strategy has been developed for 3-18 year olds in the State. DEIS represents a shift in emphasis away from individual initiatives, each addressing particular problems, to a multifaceted and more integrated approach. Additional supports are being targeted at children in the most disadvantaged schools to encourage them to stay in school.</P>
        <P>The key principle of early intervention, to identify and help children at risk of leaving school early, is a major component of the Plan.  In fact, in addition to the NEWB, there are currently in excess of 620 staff within the education sector in education disadvantage programmes of which over 130 are additional posts allocated under DEIS and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP).  The SSP incorporating the School Completion Programme (SCP) and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL) is a preventative measure designed to combat issues of poor attendance and early school leaving.</P>
        <P>Working with parents to promote school attendance and retention is an important part of the work of the Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL). In addition to this, the School Completion Programme is developing strong links between primary and post-primary <Col N="773"/>schools in disadvantaged areas. These are two preventative measures designed to combat issues of poor attendance and early school leaving. Children at risk of early school leaving are targeted under the School Completion Programme for a variety of extra supports aimed at encouraging them to stay in school. The supports cover both educational and non-educational interventions and are provided during and outside of school time. The Home School Community Liaison Scheme works to involve parents in their children&rsquo;s education which is a crucial component in convincing young people of the value of education.</P>
        <P>Under DEIS, a continuing emphasis will be placed on the development of effective transfer programmes for pupils making the transition to second-level, by building on the existing work of HSCL scheme and the School Completion Programme in this area. Initiatives such as Familiarisation Days and week-long transfer programmes for new entrants to second level have been shown to have very positive results in helping children to make a smooth transition to their new school. Other measures facilitated through the DEIS action plan include extending access to Schools&rsquo; Business Partnerships, school meals, guidance counselling and student councils. Increased integration is also being promoted between the work of second level schools and centres catering for young early school leavers, particularly Youthreach Centres and Senior Traveller Training centres. This Government has shown a sustained commitment to providing greater opportunities in the further education sector by supporting second chance educational opportunities for young people who leave school.</P>
        <P>The range of curricula available to students has also been extended to include the Junior Certificate Schools Programme, the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme and the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme. These options provide an alternative for many children who might otherwise opt out of formal education at an early stage.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s particular question, the south east region falls into the Leinster South Regional Area of the NEWB. 13 EWOs and 2 Senior Educational Welfare Officers (SEWOs) and 1 Regional Manager are deployed in the Leinster South region.  Under Towards 2016 provision was made for an additional 100 posts, in total for the NEWB and the National Educational Psychological Service, by the end of 2009, to help further address absenteeism, early school leaving, behavioural problems and special needs. In 2007, 15 of these posts were sanctioned for the NEWB and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that one of the 15 new posts was sanctioned for the Waterford (part city)/South Wexford area.</P>
        <P>Section 29 of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 provides for the establishment and maintenance by the NEWB of a register of young persons aged 16 and 17 who leave school to take up employment. The purpose of the register is to ensure that the young people concerned continue to participate in education until they reach 18 years of age. The NEWB will in the near future conclude the establishment of the register. At present early school leavers who contact the NEWB directly are recorded by the Board.</P>
        <P>Work is ongoing to develop appropriate protocols for all agencies and services to work together and to ensure that optimum use is made of the resources deployed. I would like to assure the Deputy that through increased investment and improved services this government is determined to optimise access, participation and educational outcomes at every level of the system. It will continue to do all that is possible to ensure that every child gets all the opportunities and support they need to enable them to achieve their potential and participate fully in education.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 152 and 153 together.</P>
        <P>The proportion of persons with a third level qualification in any given region does not necessarily correlate with the proportion of the population from that region that continue their studies to third level. There are a number of factors influencing the location in which a person with a third level qualification may chose to live, including for example the concentration of jobs available in high population centres.</P>
        <P>Third level participation rates by region are not currently available. However participation rates by county are available from national studies of new entrants to higher education, which are commissioned by the HEA at six-yearly intervals. The most recent survey of this type was conducted in 2004 and it shows significant increases in participation rates over 1998 for all the counties in the south east region. For example, Waterford&rsquo;s participation rate increased from 41.2% in 1998 to 48.7% in 2004.</P>
        <P>My Department has received applications from three Institutes of Technology, including Waterford IT, for designation as universities. I am considering the appropriate next steps in relation to all the applications for designation on hands, having regard to the need to build on our strengths and to provide an environment where all our higher education institutions can develop in a way that best serves the country as a whole and the regions where they are based.</P>

	<P>Youthreach is designed to offer two years integrated education, training and work experience for young people aged 15 &mdash; 20 who have left school early without achieving qualifications. The programme, which is managed by VECs at local level, is available in 100 centres nationally and caters for almost 3,700 learners.</P>
        <P>In 2007 my Department introduced the Special Education Needs Initiative (SENI) to address special educational needs and provide the necessary supports for learners in Youthreach centres. The SENI was introduced to 25 groups of 25 learners across 20 Youthreach centres.</P>
        <P>The SENI involves a general allocation model similar to that introduced in the primary sector in September 2005. It is team based and caters mainly for students with high incidence needs. The SENI provides for the allocation of increased staffing hours (from 4,200 to 5,700 hours per group per year) to deal with the special needs and disabilities of all the students.</P>
        <P>Additional training was provided to staff in the centres to enable the introduction, on a centre team basis, of a range of professional practices to support students with special educational needs/disabilities. This training followed on from the national introductory training programme introduced into all centres in 2006. In addition, the 20 centres have access to a password protected internet site containing guidelines, tailored training programmes and other materials.</P>
        <P>During 2007, an evaluation was carried out of the SENI to determine its suitability and effectiveness for the learners. The findings of this evaluation were generally positive and found the new initiative to be meeting the needs of learners. The evaluation recommended full integration of the SENI into each centre. My Department is currently examining the possibility of rolling out the SENI to other Youthreach centres, subject to the availability of funding.</P>

	<P>The staffing of a special school is determined by reference to the recommendations outlined in the Report of the Special Education Review Committee, 1993, also known as the SERC Report. In accordance with SERC, the staffing level in the school in question should be a teaching principal and two class teachers. In recognition of the extent of planning work associated with setting up a new school, the Department permitted the principal to operate in an administrative capacity to ensure the successful establishment of the school. The school is now well established and the administrative status of the principal will discontinue for the 2008/2009 school year when the principal will return to teaching duties. The Department initially advised the school of this arrangement in a letter dated 16th August, 2007. However, in recognition of the complexity of the special educational needs of the pupils in the school, the National Council for Special Education has approved a temporary teacher in the school for the 2008/2009 school year.</P>

	<P>In 2007 the school in question received approval to build additional classrooms under the devolved Permanent Accommodation Scheme (PAS).</P>
        <P>The purpose of the PAS is to devolve funding to individual school authorities to undertake building works which will address the school&rsquo;s long term accommodation needs. Under the terms of the Scheme, school authorities are empowered to manage these works with guidance from and minimal interaction with the Department. Devolving funding to school management authorities allows them to have control of their projects, assists in moving projects more quickly to tender and construction and can also deliver better value for money.</P>
        <P>The scheme is not intended to leave schools with significant fund-raising needs; rather the terms of the Scheme require the schools to tailor the scope of capital works commissioned to the available funding. The decision on whether to continue participating in the scheme or to drop out, if the scope of build is more than the funding envelope permits, is a matter for each school authority.</P>
        <P>The Board of Management submitted an appeal for additional funding. Following assessment of the application from this school and in light of the large number of projects seeking funding from my Department from the budget allocated and in line with the original intention of the scheme, unfortunately, it was not possible to provide additional funding on this occasion.</P>
        <P>They were advised to use the grant to achieve the maximum accommodation possible taking into consideration the extra cost which has arisen.  In the current economic climate and with considerable demands on the capital budget of my Department, it is not possible to approve such significant increases in the amounts grant aided to schools. It is the responsibility of the school authorities to manage the resources allocated to them to ensure maximum value for money and to control costs.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.</P>
        <P>Many children with autism are fully integrated into mainstream classes.  The National Council for Special Education provides additional resource teaching hours and special needs assistant support to schools in respect of fully integrated enrolled students with autism.</P>
        <P>Some students with autism require further support in school.  The establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for these children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years. In excess of 315 classes, an increase of 106 since May 2007 have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, including many in special schools.  The National Council for Special Education will continue to establish more classes as required.</P>
        <P>Children in these classes benefit from having a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1; fully-qualified teachers who have access to training in a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA), the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) and there is a minimum of 2 special needs assistants in each class.   Other special needs assistant posts may be allocated in line with the needs of the enrolled children. These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. Funding is also provided for assistive technology and specialist equipment as required and special school transport arrangements may also be put in place.</P>
        <P>My Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including TEACCH, PECS and ABA through the Special Education Support Service. A recent initiative has been the expansion of this service to enable it to recruit a behavioural specialist support team, led by a person with a PhD in ABA.</P>

        <P>I can confirm to the Deputy that my Department is in receipt of applications for large scale capital funding from the schools to which he refers.

	<P>The Programme for Government sets out the overarching policy position in relation to the provision of additional teachers and on reductions in class size over the life of the Government. </P>
        <P>The Programme contains a commitment to increase the number of primary teachers by at least 4000 and on that basis to make further progress on reducing class sizes.</P>
        <P>Budget 2008 provided my Department with &euro;4.6 billion or &euro;380 million extra for teacher pay and pensions. This was a very substantial level of additional investment in the terms of the economic environment on which the budget was based. That allocation provides for paying for over 2000 extra primary teachers more than the number in schools when the Government took office last Summer. It covers the additional teachers that went into schools last September for the previously announced reduction to a 27 to 1 based staffing schedule along with additional teachers this school year and in the coming school year to meet increasing enrolments, to provide for special needs and the language requirements of newcomer children.</P>
        <P>This means that in terms of the overall commitment to provide at least 4000 additional teachers the Government in its first two years in office will be well ahead of target.</P>
        <P>All Programme for Government commitments to improve public services including those relating to class size are contingent on the economic and budgetary environment and the need for prudent expenditure and fiscal management. Even since the presentation of Budget 2008 last December there have been significant alterations in the external and domestic environment. In that context any reasonable observer would regard the fact that the Government has already taken measures that will see the allocation of over 2000 additional teachers to primary schools as a considerable investment all things considered.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182, 183 and 185 together. </P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in any given area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places. This approach ensures that the use of existing accommodation is maximised and that the development and support of one school over others does not occur.</P>
        <P>As part of the Programme for Government, a Developing Areas Unit was set up recently in the Department to focus on the school accommodation needs of rapidly developing areas. The main emphasis in 2008 is on providing sufficient school places in these developing areas, as well as delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.</P>
        <P>In addition Forward Planning Section of the Department is in the process of identifying the areas where significant additional accommodation will be required at primary and post-primary level for 2009 and onwards including the areas referred to by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>Factors under consideration include population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places. Having considered these factors decisions will be taken on the means by which emerging needs will be met within an area.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government sets out the overarching policy position in relation to the provision of additional teachers and on reductions in class size over the life of the Government.</P>
        <P>The Programme contains a commitment to increase the number of primary teachers by at least 4000 and on that basis to make further progress on reducing class sizes.</P>

	<P>In general terms, medals are currently awarded to members of the Defence Forces on the basis of various criteria such as their length of service, for service overseas and for acts of bravery associated with such service both at home and overseas.</P>
        <P>Members who serve overseas, subject to certain criteria, are currently eligible for the award of the UN Peacekeepers Medal. This medal is only awarded once to any one individual, irrespective of the number of overseas missions that they complete during their career.</P><Col N="787"/>
        <P>In addition to the Peacekeepers Medal, a member who serves overseas may also be eligible for the award of a mission-specific medal. Such medals are awarded by the mission organisers, for example, the United Nations, who also set the qualifying criteria for the award.</P>
        <P>There is no immediate plan to add to the range of medals that are available in respect of overseas service. The question of creating a commemorative award to mark 50 years of Defence Forces participation in United Nations peacekeeping is being considered by the Medals Review Group that is currently reviewing medals policies for the Defence Forces. This Group is expected to report before the year end.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government decision on decentralisation provides for the transfer of my Department&rsquo;s Dublin-based civil service staff, together with a number of military personnel, to Newbridge, Co. Kildare and the transfer of Defence Force Headquarters (DFHQ) to the Curragh.  </P>
        <P>Approximately 83% of clerical/administrative staff are now in place in preparation for the move to Newbridge.   This has largely been achieved through a combination of staff volunteering to decentralise to Newbridge and agreed, bilateral transfers of staff with other government departments and offices.</P>
        <P>The total number of personnel to be decentralised to Newbridge will be 244 (including 43 military).  Approximately 410 military personnel will be decentralising to the Curragh.</P>
        <P>No staff have been moved to date, pending availability of accommodation at Newbridge and the Curragh.  I am advised by the OPW that the building in Newbridge is now under construction and will be completed by December 2009.  Tenders will shortly be sought for the construction of accommodation in the Curragh &mdash; the current estimate is that it will be ready for occupation by the end of 2010.</P>

        <P LI="1">Where it appears to an Immigration Officer or an authorised officer that a child under the age of 18 years who has either arrived at the frontiers of the State or has entered the State, is not in the custody of any person, the officer shall, as soon as practicable, so inform the Health Board in whose functional area the child is and thereupon the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991 shall apply in relation to the child.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Department of Education and Science that children under the age of 18 can attend primary and post-primary schools.  Data is available on the nationality of students in post-primary schools.  There are over 160 nationalities represented in post-primary schools in 2007-08.  Such data is not available for primary schools.  There is no data available that would identify children who are trafficked.  The Department of Education and Science does not seek such data from schools.  Schools do not seek to categorise students.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 which came into force from 7 June 2008 creates an offence of recruiting, transporting, transferring to another person, harbouring or causing the entry into, travel within or departure from the State of an adult or child for the specific purpose of the trafficked person&rsquo;s sexual or labour exploitation or removal of his or her organs.  The Act also makes it an offence to sell or offer for sale or to purchase or offer to purchase any person for any purpose.  Penalties of up to life imprisonment apply in respect of these offences.  In the context of this legislation work has commenced, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, on developing a data strategy to capture, amongst other things, details of services availed of by victims of human trafficking as defined in the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008.  This Data Strategy is part of the co-ordinated, comprehensive and holistic response to human trafficking under way in my Department.</P>

	<P>Legal aid may be granted in criminal or civil cases.  Criminal legal aid is granted to persons charged before the Courts.  The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 provides that free legal aid may be granted, in certain circumstances, for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.  The legislation does not distinguish between adults and children.  Consequently, where a child is the defendant in a criminal case s/he is entitled to seek legal aid under the provisions of the above mentioned legislation.  However, it is highly unlikely that a child would be charged with human trafficking.  Furthermore, criminal legal aid does not arise in the case of victims.  My Department has no involvement in the day-to-day running of the Scheme, the granting of legal aid or assignment of lawyers. These matters are handled entirely by the courts.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 which came into force from 7 June 2008 creates an offence of recruiting, transporting, transferring to another person, harbouring or causing the entry into, travel within or departure from the State of a person for the specific purpose of the trafficked person&rsquo;s sexual or labour exploitation or removal of his or her organs.  The Act also makes it an offence to sell or offer for sale or to purchase or offer to purchase any person for any purpose.  Penalties of up to life imprisonment apply in respect of these offences.  The question of legal and other forms of assistance, for both adult and children victims of human trafficking as defined by the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, is being examined as part of the co-ordinated, comprehensive and holistic anti-human trafficking strategy being developed in my Department.</P>

	<P>Legislative, administrative and operational, enforcement and monitoring measures have been put in place to provide a comprehensive, holistic and effective response to the heinous crime of trafficking in human beings.</P>
        <P>On the legislative front, the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 is fully operational since 7 June, 2008.  The Act creates offences of trafficking in children and adults for the purpose of sexual or labour exploitation or the removal of their organs.  It also makes it an offence to sell or offer for sale or to purchase or offer to purchase any person for any purpose.  Penalties of up to life imprisonment apply in respect of these offences.</P>
        <P>Enactment of this legislation brings Ireland into compliance with the criminal law/law enforcement elements of the EU Framework Decision on Combating Trafficking in Human Beings, the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings; and the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons especially Women and Children.</P>
        <P>Section 124 of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill provides for a period of recovery and reflection of 45 days in the State for alleged victims of trafficking and also, in circumstances where the person trafficked wishes to assist the Garda&iacute; in any investigation or prosecution in relation to the alleged trafficking, a further six months period of residence, renewable, to enable him or her to do so.  An administrative framework, reflecting the provisions in the Bill, was introduced on 7 June 2008 to provide for the period of recovery, reflection and residency in the State during the period between the enactment of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 and the full enactment of the provisions in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.</P>
        <P>On the administrative front, an Interdepartmental High Level Group has also been established to recommend to me the most appropriate and effective responses to trafficking in human beings.  Furthermore, an Anti-Human Trafficking Unit has been established in my Department under the Stewardship of an Executive Director.  The role of the Unit is to ensure that the State&rsquo;s response to trafficking in human beings is coordinated, comprehensive and holistic.  A National Action Plan to Prevent and Tackle Trafficking in Human Beings will be approved by the High Level Group for submission to me, with a view to publication by the <Col N="791"/>end of the year.  Roundtable discussions chaired by the Executive Director of The Anti-Human Trafficking Unit are being held with Government and non-governmental organisations on a quarterly basis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition, five interdisciplinary Working Groups have been established to progress matters and, in turn, report to the High Level Group. The Working Groups will deal with: Development of a National Referral Mechanism; Awareness Raising and Training; Child Trafficking; Labour Exploitation Issues; Sexual Exploitation Issues.</P>
        <P>Ireland has taken a lead role in a human trafficking initiative know as the G6 Human trafficking Initiative, which includes the UK, Poland, Italy, France, Spain and the Netherlands along with Interpol, Europol and Eurojust.  The most recent meeting of the G6 took place on the 20th of June. Ireland has recommended a particular focus on trafficking of children in the course of the G6 initiative.  As part of this initiative the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has commenced an operation designed to prevent the trafficking of minors in to, out of, and within the State, to ensure the welfare of suspected victims of such criminal activity is adequately provided for, and to commence prosecutions where criminal activity of the nature concerned has been detected.  An awareness-raising campaign throughout the participating countries &mdash; led by Ireland &mdash; is also planned under this initiative.</P>
        <P>Ireland is participating in an operation, Pentameter 2, launched by the UK.  One of the main objectives of the operation is to raise awareness of the scale of the problem of trafficking of human beings for the purposes of sexual exploitation, particularly among those who avail of sexual services.  The operation assists awareness raising in showing Ireland and the UK as locations which are hostile to human trafficking.  As part of Operation Pentameter a poster-campaign was launched in both Ireland and the UK to encourage victims of human trafficking to report their plight to State authorities.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are taking a pro-active approach in Operation Pentameter to address the need for a coordinated approach to human trafficking with the Common Travel Area which operates between the UK and Ireland.  This cooperation is taking place in a number of ways, including intelligence sharing, joint training exercises and operational cooperation where investigations have a cross-border, UK/Ireland, dimension.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Immigration border controls are maintained by the Garda National Immigration Bureau and a number of traffickers and victims of traffickers have been identified through the rigorous enforcement of immigration legislation.  Joint operations, in association with the UK Immigration Service, continue to be part of immigration policy to prevent and detect possible abuses of the Common Travel Area (CTA), by means of illegal immigration and associated criminality.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are currently over 275 personnel, Garda and civilian, allocated to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB). Personnel attached to GNIB have received training in the investigation of human trafficking at international level.  The work undertaken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to human trafficking is assisted by a network of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are employed as liaison officers in major cities in a number of EU Member States and in international organisations such as Europol and Interpol.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had developed its own human trafficking related training course with such training having been delivered to about one hundred and fifty participants in 2006/2007.  Arising from Ireland&rsquo;s involvement in Operation Pentameter a number of officers from the Police Service of Northern Ireland have also participated in the training courses by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Training College.</P>
        <P>In terms of cooperation, within this jurisdiction GNIB continues to liaise with Government and non-governmental agencies, including Ruhama and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to ensure the exchange of information regarding suspected trafficking in <Col N="792"/>human beings.  In recognising the needs of victims of trafficking, Garda Liaison Officers have been appointed to various non-governmental organisations.</P>
        <P>Funding for the human trafficking activities outlined is paid for as part of the general expenditure from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Garda Votes and does not require specific ear marked expenditure.</P>

	<P>The Garda accommodation programme is based on agreed priorities established by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it is brought forward in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works (OPW), which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.  Officials from my Department, the Office of Public Works and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have regular meetings to oversee the various projects.  In addition, a high-level strategic Garda Accommodation Board with members drawn from my Department, the OPW and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been established to carry out a review of Garda accommodation with a view to preparing a short and longer term strategy for all accommodation.  On a practical level, and with the introduction of various provisions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, project management matters and maintenance issues are dealt with directly between the agencies involved which has led to improved efficiencies and reduced administrative overheads. </P>
        <P>I have been advised by the Garda authorities that it is planned to build a new station on the existing Garda station site at Tallaght to incorporate additional station facilities to meet all operational requirements including the Divisional Headquarters for the Dublin Metropolitan Region South.  I am further advised that the Office of Public Works is currently carrying out a feasibility study on the existing site which is expected to be finalised within the next number of weeks.</P>

	<P>The person referred to by the Deputy first applied for Asylum on 25/9/2003.  This claim was assessed by the Refugee Applications Commissioner who concluded that the person concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee.  The applicant appealed this recommendation but failed to attend her appeal hearing.  The Minister issued his decision to the applicant by letter dated 09/03/2005.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, the applicant applied to my Department under section 17(7) of the Refugee Act, 1996 to be readmitted to the asylum process.  My Department&rsquo;s Ministerial Decisions Unit examined the details of same and concluded that the applicant should be readmitted to the asylum process.  The person referred to by the Deputy reapplied for asylum on 27/11/2007. The <Col N="796"/>claim was assessed by the Refugee Applications Commissioner who concluded that the person concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendation was communicated to her by letter dated 14/05/08. This communication advised the person of her entitlement to appeal the Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendation to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. The applicant failed to do so within the statutory time limit.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the normal procedures, the applicant&rsquo;s file has been forwarded to my Department&rsquo;s Ministerial Decisions Unit for final processing of the Asylum claim. A letter will issue to her from my Department advising her formally that her asylum claim has been rejected and affording her three options as follows:</P>
        <P el="5">1. Return home voluntarily</P>
        <P el="5">2. Consent to the making of a deportation order, or</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Question No. 230 of Thursday, 24 April 2008 and the written Reply to that Question.</P>
        <P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 2 April 2004 and applied for asylum.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 17 January 2006, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. Representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned.</P>
        <P>The person concerned also made an application for residency in the State on the basis of being the spouse of an EU National. However, following consideration of this application, under the provisions of the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2006, a decision was made to refuse the application. The person concerned was notified of this decision by letter dated 21 August 2006.</P>
        <P>The case file of the person concerned now falls to be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). All representations submitted by and on behalf of the person concerned will be fully considered, under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, before the file is passed to me for decision.</P><Col N="797"/>

        <P>Officials in that Section are currently processing applications received in January 2006 and have approximately 9,500 applications on hand to be dealt with before that of the person in question.

	<P>The first named person concerned arrived in the State on 6 August 2002, accompanied by her three children, and applied for asylum.  Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. </P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the first named person concerned was informed, by letter dated 19 June 2003, that the Minister proposed to make deportation orders in respect of her and her three children. She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of deportation orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she and her three children should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations were submitted on behalf of the first named person concerned and her children at that time.</P>
        <P>The first named person concerned subsequently initiated Judicial Review Proceedings, on behalf of her three children, and, in late 2007, these Proceedings were settled. The Terms of Settlement included a provision that would enable the three children of the first named person concerned to lodge individual asylum applications in their own right and they duly did, on 8 January 2008. The three children have had their cases investigated by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner who has concluded, in each individual case, that the three children did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee. The three children have initiated Judicial Review Proceedings against these determinations and these Proceedings are ongoing. In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the cases of the three children referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 14 June 2007 and applied for asylum.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner. <Col N="800"/>The determination of the Refugee Applications Commissioner was conveyed in writing to the person concerned by letter dated 23 January 2008. This communication advised the person concerned of his entitlement, within a stated timeframe, to appeal this determination to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal but the person concerned chose not to do so.</P>
        <P>On 12 March 2008, the person concerned formally withdrew from the asylum process and indicated a wish to return voluntarily to his country of origin, following which contact was established with the Office of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) with a view to the necessary voluntary return arrangements being made. However, despite my Department and the IOM approving the voluntary return request of the person concerned, the IOM advised my Department, by a communication dated 23 June 2008, that it had lost contact with the person concerned and, as such, it could not proceed with his voluntary return arrangement. The person concerned should note that this option remains open to him should he decide to pursue same.</P>
        <P>Based on the recommendation of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the voluntary withdrawal of the person concerned from the asylum process, and in accordance with the appropriate provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) and the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 28 March 2008, that the Minister was refusing him a declaration of refugee status and also proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him. In line with legal and procedural requirements, the person concerned was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006). On 7 April 2007, an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State was received from the person concerned as was an application for leave to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
        <P>The Subsidiary Protection application will be considered first. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>
        <P>In the event that the Subsidiary Protection application is refused, the case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will then be considered under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.

	<P>The Reception and Integration Agency  (RIA) is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision and dispersal.</P>
        <P>By way of background, the Deputy may wish to note that the mother and four of the children referred to in the details supplied made applications for asylum at the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) on 23 May, 2007 and were initially accommodated at Kilmacud Reception Centre. The husband referred to in the details supplied made a separate application for asylum on 30 May, 2007 and was accommodated at Balseskin Reception Centre before being transferred to join his wife and family at Kilmacud Reception Centre on 8 May, 2007. As RIA&rsquo;s reception centres are mainly used for reception purposes and in accordance with the Government policy of dispersal, the family were transferred to Clondalkin Towers accommodation centre on 15 June, 2008. The youngest child was born on 4 April, 2008 and registered with the ORAC on 3 June, 2008.</P>
        <P>Due to the size of the family and the demand on direct provision accommodation across its portfolio, the RIA has had some difficulty sourcing suitable accommodation in this case. However, I can inform the Deputy that suitable accommodation, consisting of a three room suite with en suite facilities has now been identified and the family is currently moving to this accommodation.</P>

        <P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 16 May 2000 and applied for asylum.  Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 29 July 2002, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making represen<Col N="802"/>tations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
        <P>Following consideration of her case under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, a deportation order was signed in respect of the person concerned on 5 August 2003.  The deportation order was served on the person concerned, by letter dated 18 September 2003. This communication advised the person concerned of the requirement that she present herself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau on a designated date and time to make arrangements for her removal from the State. The person concerned failed to present at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau on the appointed date and was therefore classified as an &lsquo;evader&rsquo;.</P>
        <P>On 7 September 2007 an application was received on behalf of the person concerned for the revocation of the deportation order, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 (11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). This application is under consideration at present and when a decision on this application has been made, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>

	<P>A number of different statutory processes are involved in appointments to State boards. In some cases statutory selection procedures must be followed or nominations must be sought from independent nominating panels before appointments are made by the Government or by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  In other cases only particular public office holders may be appointed to certain boards.  In a number of situations, only some appointments to the body concerned are made by the Minister, or appointments are made with the consent the Minister for Finance or following consultation with the Minister for Finance or Minister for Education and Science, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>In the context of the above, the following table sets out relevant information in respect of all persons appointed to the state boards under the aegis of my Department since 2003.  All of the persons concerned are not currently serving board members.  Under the heading in the <Col N="806"/>table relating to relevant qualifications information is provided as to the person&rsquo;s representative role or profession, as appropriate, rather than the person&rsquo;s academic qualifications.  The boards of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Environmental Protection Agency are executive in nature and the members are full-time salaried positions.</P>

	<P>The administration of the Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability is a matter for individual local authorities.</P>
        <P>My Department made a combined capital allocation to all local authorities on 21 May for the operation of the schemes in private houses in 2008.  The schemes are funded by 80% recoupment available from my Department, together with 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority.  It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the level of funding to be provided for the schemes from within the combined allocation notified to them and to manage the operation of the schemes from within this allocation.</P>
        <P>Requests by any local authorities for additional funding for the operation of the schemes are dealt with by my Department in the context of the reallocation of surplus resources from other authorities and, as such, allocations provided to local authorities are generally revised during the course of the year where expenditure is higher or lower than anticipated.  Applications from authorities for additional funding will be considered by my Department in the light of any savings emerging later in the year in other local authority areas.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 399, of 24 June 2008, if he will reconsider his response as the intent of the question is not to seek grant aid for solar panels but rather permission to install solar panels in listed buildings where grant aid has been approved for other works; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 (as amended) sets out over 50 classes of development which are exempted from planning permission, including certain micro-renewable technologies such as solar panels. Article 9 of the Regulations provides that where the carrying out of development that is otherwise exempt  could have one or other of a number of listed effects, such as impacts on sites or objects of archaeological, geological or <Col N="822"/>historical interest, it is not exempted development. The provision of grant assistance for the installation of solar panels has no impact on the planning status of such a development.</P>

        <P>In relation to the former Irish Ispat site at Haulbowline, a comprehensive site investigation was conducted on the site in 2005 by consultants, White Young Green, who concluded that, while there is significant contamination of the site, it posed no immediate threats to human health or the environment in the area.  Staff of the Department, or others acting on its behalf, wear the appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) when out on site.</P>

	<P>Electrical vehicles, including hybrid-electric, plug in hybrid, or battery electric, offer an increasingly realistic solution in terms of reducing both Greenhouse Gas Emissions from transport, and dependence on imported fossil fuels.

        <P Just="Left">Sustainable Energy Ireland has recently published reports on Hybrid Electrical Vehicles and Battery Electric Vehicles.  These reports focus on potential measures that might be used to stimulate uptake in Ireland and make a series of recommendations with regard to how this might be best accomplished.  These provide a useful template for the way forward and will be considered as part of the work of my Department&rsquo;s Renewable Energy Development Group and in the Sustainable Transport and Travel Action Plan currently being finalised by my colleague, the Minister for Transport.  I recently launched an event marking the decision by D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council to install a pilot project for plug in parking/charging facilities.</P>
