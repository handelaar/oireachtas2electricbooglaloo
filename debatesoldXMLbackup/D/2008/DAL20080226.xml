	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the matter of D&aacute;il reform is essentially one for the House itself which, under the Constitution, has responsibility for making its own rules and Standing Orders.  While the Government parties are committed to progressing any commitments contained in the programme for Government, it is ultimately a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which progresses D&aacute;il reform.  Responsibility for promoting D&aacute;il reform is shared by all parties in this House and the Government will play a constructive part in exploring with those parties opportunities for improving procedures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for that very welcome and informative reply.  Will he tell the House if the Government has any proposals in this area?  Could he outline even one proposal the Government would like to put on the table?  Could he name two, three or four proposals?  Does he agree this issue has been debated for at least 20 years?  In that time can he name any proposal that has seen the light of day?  Does he agree that this is an important issue and that you, a Cheann Comhairle, ought to be thanked for trying to move this on?</P><Col N="178"/>
        <P>Does he agree the Opposition has put proposals on the table but that we have seen nothing from the Government?  Will he tell the people, who are watching this in their thousands because it is so relevant to us, what exactly the Government is proposing in regard to D&aacute;il reform after 20 years?  The Minister of State may be able to name five issues but even one would be a huge breakthrough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I am more than happy to share my views with the House and to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for facilitating dialogue with the Deputy and Deputy Stagg as we have been doing in recent weeks.  With regard to D&aacute;il reform, every Chief Whip comes into the position full of ambitions to try to improve our procedures.  I certainly have been endeavouring to do that.  Towards the end of the last D&aacute;il we made an effort to do so.  One of the criticisms I have of the general approach to D&aacute;il reform is that while it is very ambitious, we have a general agreement that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  We introduced some procedural matters in the last D&aacute;il with regard to e-consultation, which the Deputy and others supported, which involved using the Internet to allow the public to access some of the work we do.  It is important that we involve the public.  I would like to see that process of e-consultation, as we called it, extended, for example, to secondary schools which might be interested in some of the legislation relevant to them.  Although we picked the Broadcasting Bill, perhaps this was not the best Bill with regard to young people.  We have strong all-party agreement for a television channel, which is supported by the Taoiseach and the Deputy&rsquo;s party leader, and there are many peripheral but important issues with regard to public access to what we do.</P>
        <P>We endeavoured to progress some issues during the last D&aacute;il, before the Deputy became involved.  One of the specific proposals related to topical issues and bringing forward the Adjournment debate to a more appropriate time, where there would be public access to what is happening.  It is important we do this and that we can agree on the proposal.  There are proposals on improving the procedures on Leaders&rsquo; Questions.  I am aware of the views of Deputy Stanton, Deputy Stagg and others and, again, we can make progress in that regard.</P>
        <P>We proposed that a short period of notice would be given to the leader, perhaps as short as 30 minutes, which would make for better politics, although Deputy Stanton may not agree.  A proposal is on the table on parliamentary questions and on Standing Order 32.  At present, Deputies in many cases simply read out a statement on a local issue in their constituencies but we have some good ideas on how to improve on that.  A further proposal concerns improving the Order of Business, during which much good time is wasted in wrangling to and fro in the Chamber.  There are also proposals on the committee system and legislation in general.</P>
        <P>There are many solid proposals centring on five key issues.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for facilitating progress in this regard.  From my past participation, I accept we perhaps had an over-ambitious approach.  We can continue with the modern ideas on using technology, involving the public and improving the committee system and broadcasting.  However, there are four or five key issues relating to the Chamber that we can address.  We have made progress in our last three meetings.  Hopefully, we can bring this to the D&aacute;il committee dealing with reform, the idea being that we could effectively go from this informal stage almost to a pre-agreed process which we could introduce.  I will be as positive as possible in that regard, as I have been at our meetings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  Does he agree that one of the most important functions of this House is to oversee the work the Government and the Executive performs and to debate that work?  Does he also agree that this is not possible when <Col N="179"/>the House is not sitting?  In other Parliaments, for example, the UK Parliament, the Cabinet does not sit when the Parliament is not sitting.  Does the Minister of State agree that constituents are disenfranchised when Deputies from all sides are unable to put down parliamentary questions during recess?  Does he agree something needs to be done with regard to the many agencies that have been established, in particular since this Government took office, which are unaccountable through the parliamentary system, in particular the parliamentary questions system?  Has he proposals regarding these issues?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of parliamentary questions when the D&aacute;il is not sitting has emerged during our discussions.  An aspect we will have to consider is the position of staff.  As the Deputy knows, I am open to considering the issue of parliamentary questions, written questions in particular.  The issue of questions to agencies, such as the National Roads Authority and the Health Service Executive, has been raised by many of the Deputy&rsquo;s colleagues and Deputies from other parties.  There are valid concerns among all parliamentarians with regard to access to speedy replies from those agencies.  The item is very much on our agenda for discussion and is one of the four or five key items to which I referred.</P>
        <P>Both issues, that of parliamentary questions, particularly when the D&aacute;il is not sitting, and that of agencies, are on the agenda, although we have not made progress on the latter yet.  To be frank, coming to these discussions as Chief Whip, I would have to revert to my ministerial colleagues on some of these issues.  That is the current status of the discussions.  As Chief Whip, I agree there are issues that need to be addressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, to the hot seat for today and probably this week.  In regard to the informal engagements to which he referred, will he outline the exact make-up of those engagements and exactly who is attending?  Will he also explain why the Oireachtas reform section of the programme for Government amounts to a scant, short and even vague reference?  It accounts for virtually six lines in an 86 page document.</P>
        <P>One of the critical areas for reform is the ability of this House to respond to situations presenting or emergency circumstances that occur, sometimes on a week by week or day by day basis; there is no such facilitation in this House.  The Ceann Comhairle is strapped by Standing Orders to disallow matters that Deputies endeavour to have addressed and they are not always, as he suggests in terms of Standing Order 32, matters of merely local relevance.  The criterion for consideration is that they are matters of national importance.  Does the Minister of State not agree that a great number of them are indeed matters that merit and warrant address with the respective Ministers here in a very speedy way which, because of the restrictions of the operation of the House, cannot currently be facilitated?</P>
        <P>Is this one of the areas that the Minister is definitely looking at and where we can expect recommendations in the period ahead?  What is the timeframe suggested to bring forward a set of proposals for reform of the Oireachtas and can the Minister of State confirm that it is not only the D&aacute;il he is addressing but both Houses of the Oireachtas, the Seanad and the D&aacute;il?</P>
        <P>In respect to the Upper House, is it also within the brief of this informal engagement group to which the Minister of State referred, to address the critical need for reform of the electoral process to the Seanad, the Upper House?  Does the Minister of State accept that the current method of election of Members to the Seanad is patently undemocratic, that it is confined to those who are already elected representatives at local authority level or within this Chamber and those who have third level degrees from a number of named academic institutions?</P>
        <P>Is the Minister of State of one mind with this Deputy that real and fundamental reform of the Seanad is absolutely linked to reform of the electoral process to the Seanad Chamber and <Col N="180"/>that this must be extended to universal suffrage so that all citizens have the opportunity to participate equally, as they do in terms of D&aacute;il elections?  Is the Minister of State also of the view that the introduction of such reform offers an opportunity to extend the universal suffrage to all citizens on the island of Ireland and the Irish diaspora, within a given or stated period of time of having left these shores &mdash; 20 years has been mentioned previously &mdash; to see these substantive changes introduced as part of an overall package to address the serious wants in both Houses of the Oireachtas?  Go raibh maith agat.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>My colleague who is present in the Chamber, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, will re-establish the all-party group on Seanad reform.  He will answer questions on that in the D&aacute;il in the next week or so and will deal with all the issues.  Much progress has been made on this in the past and the points the Deputy made will be part of those discussions.  We will have an inclusive approach to that.</P>
        <P>Our informal engagement involves me, the leaders of the two main Opposition parties, Deputy David Stanton, Deputy Emmet Stagg from the Labour Party and the Ceann Comhairle facilitating those discussions.  We have had three meetings and are making good progress.  As soon as we reach consensus I propose to move that to the D&aacute;il reform committee in which the Deputy&rsquo;s party will be involved.  I cannot indicate the exact timescale but there is goodwill on all sides and we are making good progress because we are concentrating on a number of key areas, to which I briefly referred.</P>
        <P>On this House being responsive to emergency situations and issues of the day, as Chief Whip I have been as responsive as possible to requests made by my fellow Whips at our weekly meetings, which are crucial for D&aacute;il business.  I like to think my fellow Whips, including the Fine Gael Whip, would concur with this.  We meet every Wednesday and agree as best we can the business for the following week.  If issues need to be dealt with and requests are made for debates, I respond as best I can.  On Thursday we will have a debate on pharmacies.  That is just one example.  In this House we have the special notice procedure and Leaders&rsquo; Questions, which today and tomorrow the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Brian Cowen, will take.  Questions can be raised at the highest level on any issue.  Under this Government the leaders of Fine Gael and Labour can raise any issue they choose during Leaders&rsquo; Questions and we are examining the operation of that period.  Under this Government just two parties are involved while during the previous Government Sinn F&eacute;in was involved as part of the technical group.  That gives an opportunity for parties to raise issues of the day.  In my view we could have a short period of notice, but I am not sure my colleagues agree.  We have not finalised arrangements on that.  We are looking at reforming many other issues.</P>
        <P>On Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s main point on the responsiveness of the D&aacute;il, we do our best and my approach, with my fellow Whips, is to try to be as responsive as possible on key issues regarding ordering our business.  There are procedures that meet those needs, but if we can improve them, we can examine those issues during our discussions on D&aacute;il reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Why has the Sinn F&eacute;in Whip not been included in the engagement the Minister has just explained is confined to Fianna F&aacute;il, representing the Government, with the Fine Gael and Labour parties?  Why is the only other Opposition party in the House excluded from these preliminary discussions?  We have a view to offer on essential reform and experience here, over a decade in my case.  Will the Minister explain why these informal talks have not included Sinn F&eacute;in and what he is prepared to do to address this deficiency and this further indication of an undemocratic practice, namely the exclusion of one party while others engage in preliminary discussions that will impact on each of us?</P><Col N="181"/>
        <P>When will the Green Paper on local government reform that was promised in the programme for Government be published?  Will the Minister rule out the proposal signalled to move the Seanad Chamber and business to the Natural History Museum, with a likelihood of conducting its business there for 12 months or more?  This would delay the essential refurbishment works to that important building and its artifacts and exhibits, which we believe is very important and must be restored speedily.  Why should there be a delay in bringing the Natural History Museum back into service in order to accommodate an itinerant Seanad Chamber?  Surely some other location within a reasonable radius of this building can be found to accommodate the Seanad&rsquo;s needs in the short term.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The situation regarding meetings not including the Deputy&rsquo;s party is determined by the format of the main parties.  A party can be recognised as a main party for the purposes of discussions, so long as it has more than seven Members in the House.  This has been the precedent in the House over many years and it did not arise today or yesterday.  The number of Deputies from a particular party also has implications in other areas of activity within the Houses of the Oireachtas and its constituent bodies.  The Deputy&rsquo;s party is represented on the Oireachtas Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which agrees issues formally on a regular basis.</P>
        <P>The issue regarding the Natural History Museum would not fall within the ambit of the Government Chief Whip, but rather the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  The commission accepted a proposal brought before it regarding the location of the Seanad during the course of works that must be carried out urgently in Leinster House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Ceann Comhairle show me the Standing Order that excludes parties with fewer than seven Members from an informal engagement, as the Chief Whip described it?  Is the Ceann Comhairle suggesting that there is a precedent or a Standing Order that precludes engagement with a party of fewer than seven?  I would guess that there is a precedent for engagement with parties of fewer than seven on such matters, and not just in the informal arena.  If the Ceann Comhairle checks the Standing Orders, he will see that Sinn F&eacute;in is recognised as a political party with more than two Members, just like any other body.  The interpretation applying in this particular instance is neither accurate nor fair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not my function to engage in a dialogue with the Deputy on this or any other matter.  It is in accordance with precedence and therefore, in accordance with practice.  I would now like the Minister of State to speak on the other matter raised by the Deputy, because I must move on to Deputy Stagg and two other Deputies who are offering.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The other matter raised by the Deputy related to the Green Paper on local government reform.  I understand that the Minister of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will have that paper ready in two weeks&rsquo; time.</P>
        <P>I recognise that Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh is a very constructive and active member of the group of Whips.  At some stage we can take it that he will become involved and I do not see any problem with that.  This is an initial, informal stage and he will become involved at some stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>He should have been involved from the outset.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>The need for D&aacute;il reform is demonstrated by the fact that the questions being debated today were tabled on the agenda for the D&aacute;il in September 2007.  The need to deal with how we order our business is obvious from that alone.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the use of his good offices in bringing forward a tight package of proposals to address the essential issues affecting Deputies and how they can do their job effectively. </P><Col N="182"/>
        <P>The issue of Leaders&rsquo; Questions has been raised in that forum.  My attitude is that if it is not broken, one should not fix it.  As Leaders&rsquo; Questions works perfectly well from the perspective of both sides of the House, it should be left alone.  If the Government were to have its way and be given prior notice of the issues raised, it would remove an important feature of the discussion.  I have not yet encountered a circumstance where the Taoiseach was not briefed, regardless of the issue raised.  To find out the issues of the day, all he needs to do is read <i>The Irish Times</i> or any other newspaper for that matter &mdash; I hope none of the members of the Fourth Estate is offended by my comment that he should read <i>The Irish Times</i>.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Two issues arise constantly on the floor of the House.  We need to have a mechanism for Deputies to raise topical current issues.  As the Ceann Comhairle and Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, will agree, Members currently use devices such as Standing Order 32 to try to place on record, in the barest of terms, constituency matters and various other issues.  The Standing Order is in place for good reason, namely, to provide for occasions when it needs to be used for the purpose for which it is intended, as opposed to being used to raise issues such as schools in Straffan or elsewhere.  However, as Deputies do not have a mechanism available to them to raise such matters, they use Standing Orders or try to attach local issues to questions on promised legislation on the Order of Business.  This is an ineffective approach.  The proposal, on which there will be general agreement, is to have topical issues discussed for one hour every morning and to bring forward the Adjournment debate.  This would be in accordance with suggestions made by the Ceann Comhairle.  </P>
        <P>The major issue is that Deputies cannot raise questions or motions about more than 1,000 quangos established to deal with issues for which Ministers were previously responsible to the House.  We all know the larger of these bodies but Deputies regularly find when they ask questions of Ministers that small bodies are responsible for the matters they have raised.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, referred to this issue in a speech on 18 July last year.  A copy should be sent to those Ministers who have not yet read it.  The Minister described the &ldquo;tendency to establish many agencies and bodies at one remove from Government&rdquo; as &ldquo;a form of abdication from Government responsibilities&rdquo;.  He did not, he stated, agree with this practice and argued that government by quango was not rule.  He added that while he expected the electorate to judge him on the decisions made, it could not judge quangos.  As a result, quangos retain power even when a Government loses an election.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We need to address the ability of Deputies to raise questions with Ministers about the expenditure of public funds provided by the taxpayer through Ministers to these agencies.  We are currently specifically prevented from doing so by legislation.  Is the Government considering or will it agree to change Standing Orders and the legislation which prohibits Members from asking questions?  If the Minister of State can respond positively &mdash; I am aware he is not acting<i> ex cathedra </i>today &mdash; or indicate he is willing to bring such a proposal to Government, the House will have done a good day&rsquo;s work.  That is the main proposal under discussion and it relates to the main problem Deputies experience.  If the Minister of State can indicate we will make progress in clawing back power for the House and those whom we represent from more than 1,000 quangos, we will have done a good day&rsquo;s work.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="183"/>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I touched on this issue earlier.  The straight answer is that the Government has not yet made a decision.  However, I am not in any way ruling out a good decision in this matter.  I accept that, beyond being the Chief Whip for my party and for the Government, I have responsibilities to work as best as I can with the Whips from the other parties for the House.  I have no doubt that my party is also concerned about the problem of getting information from the quangos and agencies we establish.  A danger exists that many of these agencies do their own thing and we must address the matter of accountability.</P>
        <P>I have work to do on this matter and I have an interest in finding a solution.  I referred to it earlier in answering Deputy Stanton&rsquo;s query on written questions with regard to dealing, during non-sitting periods, with this matter of questions to Ministers being forwarded to agencies.  Progress has been made in the discussions.  If Deputies Deenihan, Stanton or Kehoe were in my position, they would also have to get their Government to sign off on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>It happens in some Departments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I know, and Deputies Naughten and Durkan raise the matter on a regular basis.  The Whips are having good discussions on this and I repeat the words of thanks to the Ceann Comhairle for his facilitation.</P>
        <P>As we are discussing parliamentary questions, I believe on occasion an excess of questions is put down on issues which, frankly, do not require so many questions to be asked.  I will not instance examples of detailed questions on irrelevant matters but we all know them.  In some cases, duplication of parliamentary questions occurs.  Perhaps we can also examine this if we want efficiency and value for money.  I understand answering a parliamentary question costs approximately &euro;200.</P>

	<P>I am not trying to muzzle anybody.  However, issues are raised.  It is peripheral to what we were discussing and is not as important, but we should examine it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State consider supplying written answers to priority and oral questions to the questioners while the Minister is reading the reply?  At times, the Minister replying may not be loud and it may be difficult to understand him or her.  This makes it difficult to follow up with a proper supplementary question.  With a written copy of the reply we could frame proper supplementary questions.  It is a simple suggestion but I am convinced it would considerably help the level of questioning in the House.  It should be easy to organise for priority questions because only spokespersons ask questions.  For oral questions, the answer could be given to the questioner or the person who nominated the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I will consider it.  The only issue I have is that Ministers are accountable for the replies they give and he or she may change a reply along the way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>

	<P>It is not that.  At times, the acoustics in the Chamber may not be perfect.  It would help the effectiveness of Opposition spokespersons to have the written reply so considered questions could be asked afterwards, particularly when Ministers have given long replies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>While I thank the Minister of State for getting so involved in this debate, has there been a wider Government debate on it?  Has he brought any of these points to his Government colleagues recently?  Earlier on Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about timescales.  When does the Minister expect some of these proposed, and almost agreed, changes will be implemented?  Does he see it happening when the D&aacute;il returns in the autumn?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister of State agree a wider public debate on the role of the Oireachtas is needed?  Will he give some thought on establishing a forum for such a debate, so the people, of whom we are their representatives, can get involved in what we do?  There is a certain negativity in public debates on the importance of the work we do in the Oireachtas.  That is dangerous for any democracy.</P>
        <P>What does the Minister of State think of the suggestion that important Government announcements be made in the House prior to being made to the press or others?  They should be made first in the people&rsquo;s Parliament.  A Minister should attend the House, make an announcement on X, Y or Z and then attend a press conference, rather than the other way around.  Will he consider that as a change in the way business is done?  This would reassert the primacy of Parliament.</P>
        <P>Important committee reports should be debated in the House.  Does the Minister of State agree a facility, even a mandate, should be put in place to allow a chairman of an Oireachtas committee to present a report to the D&aacute;il for debate?</P>
        <P>It is important a limited number of written parliamentary questions be allowed to all Deputies during each week of recesses.  This would mean people are not disenfranchised and can get information quickly.</P>
        <P>The Freedom of Information Act has been affected by the introduction of charges for requests.  This has led to an increase in the number of parliamentary questions being tabled.  Will the Minister of State examine the suggestion that Deputies would not have to pay for freedom of information requests?  This might cut down on the number of parliamentary questions being tabled.  It would make it easier for the people&rsquo;s representatives to get information on behalf of the people.</P>
        <P>Some State agencies accept questions from Members.  Is it correct that if the Minister or the Department accepts the question, then the agency is obliged to provide the information to the Minister who can then supply it to the House?  Is it correct the blockage of such information is not with State agencies but with Ministers?  Is the thinking among Ministers that they will do everything they can not to answer a question?</P>
        <P>Last week when I raised this matter on the Order of Business, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance accused me of playing games.  We are not playing games with it.  We are serious and would like the Government to engage seriously in the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept Deputy Stanton that it is a serious matter on which we can make progress.</P>
        <P>The Deputy referred to a timescale in the autumn, a realistic timetable for all of us to work to.  We should all work to achieve success in this area by the autumn.</P>
        <P>I have raised the matter concerning State agencies and replies to parliamentary questions, as requested by the Deputy and others, with the Government and the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach formally asked all his Ministers to approach those agencies under their remits with regard to better communications and speedier responses to requests by Members.  This was done some time ago and I can only hope some improvements were made.</P><Col N="185"/>
        <P>I have spoken informally with several of my colleagues and the Taoiseach on these issues from time to time.  Formally, however, I have not put a package to the Government.  I envisage we continue our discussions, get to a stage where we can agree a package and then I can put it to the Government.</P>
        <P>Concerning a wider debate, I acknowledge the Ceann Comhairle is involved in speaking engagements about the work of the Oireachtas with the public.  It is crucial that we do something in this regard.  As I said, e-consultation and the use of the Internet to communicate what we are doing is a step in the right direction and I know the Deputies opposite support this.  I hope we can find a Bill that is more relevant to young people than the Broadcasting Bill and get a committee working on it.  Webcasting of committees is another innovation that we have brought in.  If we could get such a system going with, for example, transition year students in schools, it would be a great opportunity for young people to realise the important work that is going on here.  However, we must find an appropriate Bill.  This can be done, although we would need a Minister who would back such a proposal.  The key thing is not to delay legislation but to let members of the public see all the various stages of legislation and how the system works.  I support a wider debate in this area.</P>
        <P>A system of committee reports would be an important development if we could introduce it in a formal way.  Again, it is up to the chairman of committees, working closely with the Ceann Comhairle and ourselves.  Part of our proposal is to consider the workings of committees.  We could add to our proposals a requirement for some committee reports to be sent back to the Chamber, with a selection process involving the chairpersons of the different committees.  It is a good suggestion.</P>
        <P>With regard to written replies during the session, I mentioned earlier that there may be staff issues in this regard.  The Deputy mentioned July and September&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>We should get extra staff.  That is democracy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>We can consider July and September.  Committees meet during these months.  I said in the course of our discussions that we would consider this.  I answered the question about agencies.  Deputy Stanton suggested that we arrange for Deputies not to be charged for freedom of information requests.  We can consider that but I cannot give a commitment at the moment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed that the Minister of State could not have been a bit more positive.  I know he does not have the power to make the decision, but if he said to the House that he was convinced of the case and he would refer it to his seniors for a decision, I would be much happier.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I will do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State may agree with me that we cannot continue with the current situation with regard to agencies.  The other day in the D&aacute;il, the Taoiseach said that he would talk to two Ministers to see what they could do with the HSE.  The HSE had more authority than the two Ministers and the Taoiseach put together.  The only reason for that is that we in this House gave it that authority.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform also said he could not justify talking to the chairman of an authority about the way in which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could be used.  This is another quango we set up which has removed both the power of the House to question the Minister and the power of the Minister to act.</P><Col N="186"/>
        <P>We are dealing with a limited proposal.  It is not a big package of D&aacute;il reform such as was tried before, it is a limited, specific package that was put on the table by the Ceann Comhairle and I thank him for his good offices in this regard.  Unless the Government can give us an answer on the major issue of restoring power to the House from the quangos we have created &mdash; as I said, there are more than 1,000 of them &mdash; we will not have achieved anything.  I strongly urge the Minister to carry the case beyond its current position to those in government who can make decisions about changing the law as well as Standing Orders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>This has been a useful debate and I have been as open as possible with regard to the various proposals that have been raised at our informal discussions.  Because these discussions are informal I have been reticent about giving the Deputies a specific commitment on the issue of agencies.  So far I have brought the issue of better communications from agencies to the attention of the Taoiseach and he has raised it with his Cabinet colleagues.  That was the first step.  I am convinced that we need to do something about this, not just because of the pleas and demands of Opposition Deputies but also because Deputies in my party have concerns about the agencies mentioned, including the HSE and the NRA, across a wide range of Ministries.  We need better communications for elected Members in the D&aacute;il regardless of which parties they represent.  I will certainly bring the case to my colleagues in government.  As I said, there are a number of key issues.  As Deputies have acknowledged, we have made good progress.  When the overall package is agreed I will bring it to Government.  This would be a key element of such a package.</P>

        <asker>Deputy Richard Bruton</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>  if the Government tax reform priorities remain as cuts in the top rate and standard rate of income tax and the reduction in employee and self-employed rates of PRSI in view of the terms of reference set for the Commission on Taxation.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[8063/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The terms of reference of the Commission on Taxation are entirely consistent with An Agreed Programme for Government.  The terms of reference of the commission explicitly provide, among other things, that it should undertake its work &ldquo;having regard to the commitments on economic competitiveness and on taxation contained in the Programme for Government&rdquo;.  The Government programme is one for the full five years of the Government.  As I have consistently said and as is reflected in the programme for Government, the personal taxation and PRSI commitments in the programme are to be implemented &ldquo;subject to the controlling economic and fiscal framework&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister knows from the terms of reference, the Commission on Taxation has been asked to examine the balance achieved between taxes collected on income and other taxes.  The Government has made clear its commitment in respect of taxes collected on income, that is, to reduce PRSI from 4% to 2%, to cut the standard rate from 20% to 18% and to cut the top rate from 41% to 40%.  There is no reference or direction to the commission that it must honour these specific commitments.  Those commitments are ignored in the terms of reference offered to the commission.  Has the Government abandoned the commitments?  Alternatively, is the Minister waiting to see if the Commission on Taxation approves of it?  These were presented to the people as solemn commitments but now it seems <Col N="187"/>the Government has no intention of implementing them and is looking for cover to quietly drop them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the Commission on Taxation is to examine the taxation code.  As I stated during discussions on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, it has broad terms of reference to enable it to examine the gamut of matters that it believes are germane to improving our tax system.  It is set out in the programme for Government that, subject to the controlling economic and fiscal framework, the Government will implement a specific approach.  Our first priority remains low and middle income earners.  Our first task is to use tax credits and bands to keep low income earners out of the standard rate band and average income earners out of the higher band.  We have made further commitments on the basis of having a controlled economic and fiscal framework.  The assumptions we made are on the basis of achieving 4.5% annual economic growth.  Since autumn we have seen turbulence in the financial markets and growth predictions worldwide have moderated.  Over the programme for Government we continue to have these proposals at the forefront of our minds on the basis of what is responsible fiscal policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Am I correct in reading the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s response as meaning that he has discovered he cannot implement the clear commitments made to the public?  Under the guise of making a proper balance between income and other taxes, the T&aacute;naiste is seeking a way to ignore commitments made solemnly to the Irish public.  In May there was no problem in honouring these commitments.  Fianna F&aacute;il berated every other party and produced deliberate untruths about other parties.  These are firm commitments on which the T&aacute;naiste went to the public.  He is now backing off them, saying he cannot afford them and failing to refer them to the commission.  That is reneging on a solid commitment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a partial and predictable interpretation of the commitments.  The point I made during the campaign, in an argument I believe I won, was that Fine Gael had not costed its proposals properly. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>That was not the point, and the T&aacute;naiste may recall the advertising slogans that were produced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a major problem in the Fine Gael Party in getting over this.  The record will speak for itself and I do not wish to detain the House.  We set out what we felt was possible based on the economic assumptions in our plan, which were 4.5% growth rates.  Fine Gael proposed a slightly lower growth rate and a slightly higher inflation rate.  The bottom line is that in terms of overall nominal&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The question the Minister was asked was if he will honour all the Government&rsquo;s commitments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, Deputy, for the purposes of the House, I am giving information.  The Deputy is shouting across trying to win an argument that his party lost.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Answer the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The fact, as the Deputy knows, although he is trying to stop me from saying it, is that the nominal growth rate assumptions in both sets of proposals were similar.  My economic growth rate was slightly higher and my inflation rate was slightly lower, while the Deputy&rsquo;s proposals were based on a slightly lower nominal growth rate and higher inflation rate.  It worked out at approximately 7.5%.  They are the facts, so all of us are in that position <Col N="188"/>in terms of how we would proceed with the implementation of our plans.  We have always made it clear, and it is a requirement on us as members of the eurozone, that we would have a responsible fiscal policy.  On that basis we will implement all of our commitments, not simply the tax commitments.  All commitments are required to work in that context.</P>
      </Speaker>

        <asker>Deputy Joan Burton</asker>
        <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>  his Department&rsquo;s forecast for the expected level of economic growth for the full year of 2008; the way this compares to the forecast he gave in his budget speech in December 2007; the way this compares to the forecast given to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce recently; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[7856/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department&rsquo;s economic forecasts have not changed from those published on budget day, when GDP growth of 3% was projected for this year with GNP growth of 2.8%.  With regard to what the Taoiseach said in his recent speech to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, there is no inconsistency.  He was speaking in approximate terms.  Furthermore, among economic commentators, the current range for forecasts is from 2% to 4%, with some taking a more pessimistic view and others an optimistic view of the various risks that the Department of Finance identified when it set out its forecasts at budget time.</P>
        <P>The more important point that the Taoiseach was making is that the fundamentals of the Irish economy are strong.  While we must not underestimate the issues that are facing us, once the current situation is managed correctly we should expect to see growth pick up towards 4% in the coming years.  This is the view of most of those who have published forecasts for 2009 as things stand.  We are laying the groundwork for future prosperity through the continued prudent management of the economy and public finances, while at the same time making significant additional capital investment under the continued roll-out of the national development plan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Did I hear the Minister correctly when he said that the Taoiseach spoke at the Dublin Chamber of Commerce in approximate terms about growth?  His growth indicator was half a point below what the Minister and his Department had previously indicated.  Is this a new language?  When there is a dramatic change in the growth forecast, the Taoiseach is speaking in approximate terms.  Presumably, however, the Minister speaks in more definitive terms.  Is the Minister aware that Davy Stockbrokers today downgraded the growth rate forecast to 2% for the rest of the year?</P>
        <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the monuments and milestones he has created so far in this Government as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance?  He is heading for the first budget deficit since the mid-1990s.  Unemployment is anticipated to grow at the fastest rate since 1980.  It is almost back to the days of Charles Haughey and the disasters of 1977.  The  number of unemployed is projected to grow by in excess of 26,000.  We are anticipating, under the Minister&rsquo;s watch, losing 23,000 construction jobs, while tax receipts are falling at the steepest levels since the early 1990s.  With regard to the difference in estimate between the Minister and the Taoiseach, what, if anything, have they agreed to do to address the very steep decline in our <Col N="189"/>economic fortunes?  The Minister mentioned the election earlier.  He promised during the election campaign to keep the boom times going.  The boom is obviously over so what alternatives does the Minister have?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a new line of attack from the Labour Party to suggest that I should have a tighter fiscal policy and no deficits.  Perhaps the party would outline, in the course of the next weeks and months, what areas of current and capital expenditure it wishes to cut so we can accommodate its new fiscal stance.  I will be glad to hear that.  Comparing the challenges currently facing the economy as equivalent to those that faced the economy in 1980 is not only specious but absurd.  The fundamentals of the Irish economy are far stronger now and we are in a far better position to withstand international pressures.  When global conditions change and currency, financial and equity markets take the tumble they have taken since last autumn, which was after the election and was not predicted by the Deputy or anybody else, we must accommodate those changes as an open economy.</P>
        <P>With regard to the growth rate, Davy Stockbrokers are in the lower band of predictions at 2.1% GNP.  The predictions are: Central Bank &mdash; 3%, the ESRI &mdash; 2.3%, EU Commission &mdash; 3.5%, OECD &mdash; 2.9%, the IMF &mdash; 3%, AIB &mdash; 2.5%, Bank of Ireland &mdash; 4%, Friends First &mdash; 3%, Bloxham Stockbrokers &mdash; 3%, Goodbody Stockbrokers &mdash; 2.3%, National Irish Bank &mdash; 3.9% and Ulster Bank &mdash; 2.1%.  Basically, these are predictions based on certain assumptions such as whether downside risks are realised, to what extent the current problem in the United States deteriorates, for how long that will happen and its impact.  It is not correct to suggest that everybody is on the button in this matter.  I predicted in my Budget Statement, despite setting out downside risks, a GDP growth rate of 3% for this year and GNP growth of 2.8%.  Those predictions are broadly in line with the market consensus.  They are not exactly what Davy Stockbrokers predict but there are other predictions that are even more optimistic.  We took the median position, which was fair.  Who will be right at the end of the day will depend on many things between now and next December.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the Minister about the difference in forecast between the Minister and the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s forecast was half a point below the Minister&rsquo;s when he spoke recently to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce.  Bearing in mind the steepest declines in tax revenues since the early 1990s, the highest increases in unemployment since the 1980s and the fact that we are now facing a budget deficit, does the Minister have any proposals to address this, particularly the 26,000 additional people who will become unemployed?  Most of them will be men losing jobs in the construction industry or from long-term employment in factories and traditional industries in areas throughout the country.  There will be between 600 and 700 job losses in Arnotts in Dublin, for example.  During the election campaign the Minister said he would keep the boom going, but the boom is gone.  Does the Minister have any strategies for addressing the fall-out for people now facing unemployment? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have just explained that I reject the Deputy&rsquo;s contention that we are working off the same base as 1980.  We are in a far different position.  There will be rising unemployment but there will also be rising unemployment in the European and global economies.  There will be lower growth rates.  We are transitioning to lower medium and long-term growth rates than was the case in the halcyon days of the Celtic tiger.  Everybody knew and understood that before, during and after the election.  The issue is who is most capable of managing the situation.  The Deputy suggests that my fiscal stance is too expansionary.  She does not agree with the impetus I have put into the economy of approximately&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The budgetary stance I took, taking into account all of the downside risks, was to provide an impetus into the economy of approximately 1.5% of GNP.  I have increased the capital programme by 12% but the Deputy obviously believes that is too much.  I await the list of the Deputy&rsquo;s proposals for cutting it and day to day spending.  Otherwise, she does not have credibility.</P>

        <Quest>  if he has set any target for the number of civil servants and State agency employees who will move to decentralised locations during 2008; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[8061/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>A progress report by the decentralisation implementation group, DIG, was submitted to me and published on 8 October last.  The group reported that implementation of the Civil Service element of the decentralisation programme is progressing.  From the announcement of the programme in December 2003, the focus has been on detailed planning and organisation of the property, staffing and business aspects.  The DIG has considered it essential that all organisations take the necessary time to prepare this groundwork well in order to ensure effective implementation of a programme of this scale and complexity.  In short, its focus has not been on how speedily the programme can be achieved but how well.  It is important to remember that the programme is not just about moving public services.  It fundamentally impacts on the staff in those organisations, on their career choices and their expectations.</P>
        <P>At the end of 2007, decentralising organisations had a presence in 33 towns.  Approximately 4,000 staff had been assigned to decentralising posts and over 2,000 of these are currently in their new locations, while the remainder are being trained in advance of decentralisation to a new location, as soon as accommodation becomes available.  Taking account of both posts moved and assignments, almost 50% of the Civil Service general service posts have already moved or have staff in place with a commitment to move.  The comparable figure for the Civil Service professional and technical staff is 25% and current indications are that it is in the order of 20% for the State agency sector.</P>
        <P>Property or sites have been acquired or are well advanced in a total of 38 locations.  In addition, the OPW have been very efficient in securing suitable advance or temporary accommodation in over 20 locations to facilitate the early phasing of the transfer of business units.  The October DIG report provides an update of the OPW timeframes for the expected completion of permanent accommodation.  The OPW conducts a review of the property timeframes for permanent accommodation on an ongoing basis and is keeping these timeframes under review based on its experience to date in relation to property selection and acquisition, brief and design issues, tendering periods, planning issues and contractual arrangements.</P>
        <P>I remain confident that the public service will deliver this programme in a considered, sensible and sensitive manner.  The Government is anxious to ensure that the momentum of the programme is maintained and developed and in that context Secretaries General of decentralising Departments have been asked to review these timeframes in association with the OPW and the DIG to assess where earlier progress could be made either in relation to <Col N="191"/>permanent accommodation or advance accommodation.  The Government has asked the DIG to examine the position in relation to progressing the relocation of the State agencies, with a view to providing a report, including target timescales, by the end of July 2008.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste has not answered the question of how many will be decentralised during 2008.  This is yet another example of the Government making a political decision, like setting up the HSE.  Decentralisation was nothing more than a political decision, made in December 2003 for budget 2004.  The Government is now hiving responsibility over to an unaccountable body, the implementation group.  Does the T&aacute;naiste take responsibility for decentralisation?  Does he agree that, as it currently stands, it is a shambles?  More than 14 months after the deadline his Government set, of 31 December 2006, we find that less than 20% of civil servants have been decentralised, only 50% of whom were based in Dublin.  Furthermore, we find that there are 26 locations to which the Government has yet to decentralise.  I note from his comments that in many of those cases, the Government has yet to acquire sites or properties.  Is decentralisation the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s responsibility?  What measures will he put in place to ensure that decentralisation takes place over a reasonable period?  What targets has he set and, as the original question asked, how many will be decentralised in 2008?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept whatsoever the assertion the Deputy makes on the progress being made on this programme.  He might, if he has not already done so, read the decentralisation implementation group reports which have been published since it was first set up, which contain a number of revised timescales as a result of the work it has been doing.  All of those reports have been accepted by the Government.  It is clear that initial ambitions regarding the substantive programme we hope to see in this area have been altered as a result of the decentralisation implementation group&rsquo;s assessments, based on working with unions and management.  </P>
        <P>We are committed to this programme.  The Department of Finance has the job of co-ordinating the decentralisation programme and I take on that responsibility willingly.  Good progress is being made.  The continuous talking out of both sides of the mouth from the Opposition is I am sure noted in many localities.  On the one hand, they are criticising the fact that we have a programme at all, while on the other there are parliamentary questions coming to my Department on a weekly basis from Fine Gael backbenchers asking when it is going down to their little area.  It is back to the old story.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>In any event, the real position is that 2,000 people are already in position.  Another 2,000 have committed to moving.  The rate at which they will move during the course of this year will depend on the progress made in finalising the building programme and so forth.  Considerable progress has been made and it is very early in the year yet to give a definitive answer as to where we will end up at the end of the year.</P>

        <Quest>  his views on the need to change policy in the face of vulnerabilities exposed in EU and IMF assessments of the Irish economy.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[8062/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>In my budget last December I indicated that the outlook was for a moderation in the rate of economic expansion this year.  These forecasts took into account the transition to a more sustainable level of output in the new housing sector while more modest growth in some of our major trading partners was also built into the projections.  In addition, I identified that there are risks to this outlook, including a less benign international economic climate and a possible continuation of financial market difficulties.  As provision for a downturn was already built into my Department&rsquo;s economic forecasts, these have not changed from those published on budget day, when GDP growth of 3% was projected for this year, with GNP growth of 2.8%. </P>
        <P>The European Commission recently published its annual assessment of the Irish stability programme update.  The assessment highlighted the overall strong position of the public finances and pointed out that the fundamentals of the Irish economy remain sound.  It referred to challenges in the transition to lower growth, mainly linked to a return to more sustainable output in the housing sector.  This assessment is consistent with the view outlined in my recent budget.</P>
        <P>The latest IMF forecast for Ireland was published in September last year, when it forecast GDP growth of 3% for 2008.  Recently, the IMF published a paper entitled Spillovers to Ireland, which referred to Ireland&rsquo;s exposure to developments in the US economy.  In this working paper, the IMF postulated that a 1% decline in US GDP growth would negatively impact by 1.75% on Irish growth.  This analysis, which others dispute, does not take into account other factors such as lower import growth and, as such, I do not share its view of the severity of the impact on Ireland of any downturn in the US economy.  However, as a small trading nation we are vulnerable to downturns elsewhere and as I have already outlined, slower growth in our trading partners has been factored into the budget day economic projections.</P><Col N="194"/>
        <P>Ireland is meeting these challenges from a position of strength.  The fundamentals of the Irish economy remain sound.</P>
    
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P el="0">Moreover, fiscal policy is playing a key role in terms of providing support for the economy as we enter this period of lower growth.  Current spending is projected to rise by about 8% this year while tax revenues are expected to grow by around 3.5%.</P>
        <P>Capital spending is expected to grow by around 12% this year as full implementation of the national development plan continues apace. Even allowing for all this, only a modest budgetary deficit is in prospect for 2008.</P>
  </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste agree that he was seriously wrong in 2005 and 2006, when he said the building boom was based on sound economic fundamentals?  Does he agree that he was also wrong to introduce expansionary measures in every one of his four budgets?  Does he agree that the boom he cheered on has resulted in the loss of competitiveness that he rightly says is damaging our exports?  Does he accept that the situation which we now have, whereby outstanding debt in the property area is 30 times the outstanding debt in manufacturing, is not the basis for sustainable progress in this economy?  Against that background, does the T&aacute;naiste accept the EU&rsquo;s assertion that it is now time to change policy?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The European Commission gave a very balanced view of where the Irish economy is going and the downside risks mentioned in my budget were replicated in its assessment.  Regarding the building industry, it is clear we are adjusting to a more sustainable rate of growth having sought to meet an economic demand that exceeded supply.  In the adjustment process, we have been able to put in place plans for a significant capital investment programme, which will assist our competitiveness greatly, and to ensure a competitive workforce through capital programmes and investments envisaged for science, technology, innovation, reskilling and upskilling.  If we manage our position in the coming years, we can come out the other side with renewed growth in the economy.  For these reasons, the European Commission&rsquo;s assessment is not one with which I am in fundamental disagreement.</P>
        <P>In terms of trying to maintain an overall fiscally responsible budgetary policy, our commitment to implement the capital investment programme will require of us a budgetary balance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste not agree that those who examine the public spending patterns of the Government and who see waste, complacency and self-indulgence are not the ones who are blind?  The Government, which seems to surround itself in the belief that everything is all right in the garden and that it is correct, is deceiving itself.  Does the T&aacute;naiste not accept that we must confront Government waste, which is notably widespread in health and other areas, and reform a range of uncompetitive markets, which the Government has manifestly failed to do, and that we need effective preparation for major strategic challenges such as climate change?  Yesterday, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, had the grace to admit that the Government&rsquo;s climate change strategy was hopelessly wrong.  Does the T&aacute;naiste not agree that a little more honesty from himself concerning preparedness to deal with tougher times would serve the economy better than the stuff he keeps churning out?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know how this could be &ldquo;churning out&rdquo; stuff.  I seek to defend myself and the Government&rsquo;s position from what I regard in some cases as the talking down of the economy.  Notwithstanding that my Budget Statement mentioned the serious challenges facing the economy, anyone who knows anything about the economy knows this to be the case.</P>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>  if the Revenue Commissioners have an estimate of the amount of unclaimed taxes; and if he has satisfied himself that the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; statement of strategy sets no specific targets in this area.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[8064/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have made the point a number of times that Revenue can only allow tax credits and reliefs on the basis of the information known to it.  There is no accurate method to estimate the amount of unclaimed taxes.  The Revenue Commissioners have been making every effort to ensure that all taxpayers are fully aware of their entitlements.  The self-employed must fill in an annual return form on which there are prompts to claim all available reliefs.  In recent years, Revenue has taken several initiatives to inform PAYE taxpayers of their entitlements and to encourage them to claim.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that their ongoing efforts to inform taxpayers of their entitlements are having the desired effect, as demonstrated in the substantial increase in the number of PAYE taxpayers seeking reviews of their tax liabilities in the context of claiming additional tax credits and reliefs.  The number of PAYE reviews processed in 2006 was 1.14 million compared to 552,000 in 2005.  The figure for 2007 reviews is comparable to the 2006 figure and will be published in the Revenue annual report due out in April.</P>
        <P>Revenue&rsquo;s new statement of strategy, which I recently approved, sets out the directions and priorities for the next three years.  One of its strategies for the achievement of this goal is to help customers pay the right amount and to get their entitlements.  The inclusion of this additional goal underlines Revenue&rsquo;s commitment and determination to help its customers, both individuals and businesses, to receive their due entitlements and to pay only the right amount of tax.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Once again the T&aacute;naiste has not answered my question.  I asked for an estimate of the amount of unclaimed taxes.  When the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s Department rang me in this regard, I told it which specifics I was looking for.</P>
        <P>The point I am making is straightforward.  In 2007, there were refunds in the order of &euro;530 million.  I have with me the strategy to help customers in paying the correct amount and getting their entitlements, but I cannot see a specific strategy to enable people to claim their correct credit entitlements or to collect the correct refunds.  Is the T&aacute;naiste responsible for the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners?  Will he instruct the latter to put the same effort into informing people of their entitlements so that they can claim their credits?  Many credits &mdash; medical expenses, college fees, bin charges, trade union memberships, medical insurance at source, the old age tax credit, rent relief, rent-a-room relief, the dependant relative allowance and DIRT exemptions in the case of over 65 year olds &mdash; can be claimed if people are aware of them.  However, many people are unaware of them.</P>
        <P>Now that the tax credit certificates have issued, will the T&aacute;naiste instruct the Revenue Commissioners to engage in a high-profile media campaign, by way of television, the T&aacute;naiste <Col N="197"/>himself or otherwise, to inform people of the situation and allow them to claim their correct refunds from the preceding four years and their correct credits for this year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Revenue is proactive in this matter.  On Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, we outlined the extent to which the ongoing campaign has been improved and enhanced.  In the House, credit was given to Revenue for its work in this regard.  It may even have been mentioned in a constructive manner on Committee Stage.</P>

	<P>Revenue has undertaken several major initiatives, including an intensive high-profile campaign during August, September and October of 2006 involving advertisements on radio and in bus shelters, the DART and Luas encouraging taxpayers to claim their tax credits and reliefs.  During the summer and early autumn, a leaflet giving details of how to access and use Revenue&rsquo;s self-service Internet facility for PAYE taxpayers was sent to each taxpayer.  The facility allows each PAYE customer to claim the most commonly used tax credits, apply for a tax refund, claim medical expenses, request a tax review, reallocate tax credits between spouses and update personal information.  It is a totally secure on-line service and each taxpayer has his or her own unique PIN to log in.  Revenue has just completed the posting of this year&rsquo;s tax credit certificates to 2.2 million PAYE taxpayers.  Accompanying each certificate was a creatively designed leaflet that focused on informing people of their entitlements to tax credits and reliefs and gave them details of the various contact channels to make claims.  A further publicity campaign is planned.</P>
        <P>There is a great deal of proactivity in this matter, which has been raised a number of times in the House.  When I took it up with Revenue, it responded.  The take-up of some reliefs has increased.  It remains the ultimate responsibility of the taxpayer to claim reliefs, but we can try to ensure they are aware of the reliefs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a question of the level of refunds involved.  We have devised estimates based on spending patterns identified by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and the figure relating to unclaimed medical expenses in 2007 was in the region of &euro;500 million, &euro;250 million was unclaimed in rent payments and &euro;300 million in bin charges.  Many people, including the elderly, may be uncomfortable with the form involved in making claims.  Many credits do not require a return to be filed and can easily be brought up on the system but people may not know how to do this.</P>
        <P>Revenue runs very high profile campaigns on television every year relating to P35 forms and Form 11, which relates to income tax returns.  There is not a similar campaign when tax credit certificates issue and I ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, to instruct the Revenue Commissioners to run such a campaign through television and radio media now as tax certificates are issuing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said in my earlier reply, a further publicity campaign is planned.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Now is the time it should happen as the tax certificates are issuing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is free to ask questions and it is fine if he does not like the answers but progress is being made, activities are going on and people are not unmindful of the efforts that must be made in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>People are entitled to refunds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>People claim their entitlements.  There are also arrangements on tax relief at source where mortgage relief and medical insurance relief are provided at source through the taxpayer obtaining a reduction in repayments or premiums equivalent to the tax relief.  Recurring reliefs, such as those for trade union subscriptions or bin charges, once claimed are allowed on an ongoing basis and reappear each year in the taxpayer&rsquo;s certificate of tax credits.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Why do we have &euro;530 million of refunds?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the Deputy&rsquo;s estimate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is &euro;530 million of refunds and that is a matter of record with the Revenue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Revenue is engaged in an ongoing programme to secure information from third parties that will enable it to grant certain credits and reliefs automatically and, in certain situations, make refunds.  The computer system now contains date of birth details and, as a result, age-related credits are now granted automatically.  Much is being done regarding area credits.</P>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>  if his attention has been drawn to the recently published European Commission assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s Stability and Convergence Programme; his views on same and its assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary situation; if he will undertake corrective action to improve that situation; if he will introduce further reforms to the pension system in line with its recommendations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[7747/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the European Commission&rsquo;s assessment of the Irish economy.  The assessment represents a reasonable view of the Irish economy and acknowledges the overall strong position of the public finances.  The assessment refers to challenges in the &ldquo;transition to a period of lower economic growth, mainly linked to a return to more sustainable levels of activity in the housing sector&rdquo;.  This is consistent with the position as outlined in budget 2008. </P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the fact that the Irish economy is currently facing into one of its most difficult and challenging periods for some time, with domestic and external factors likely to restrain growth prospects in the short term, it is important to recognise that our overall growth performance is still impressive by international standards.  Indeed in the press release <Col N="199"/>accompanying the assessment, the commission notes that Ireland is adjusting to &ldquo;more normal, but still very healthy, economic growth levels&rdquo;.</P>

        <P>On a general Government basis, we have recorded surpluses in ten of the past eleven years and we also have one of the lowest levels of public debt in the EU.</P>
        <P>Fiscal policy is playing a key role in terms of providing support for the economy as we enter this period of lower growth.  Current spending is projected to rise by about 8% this year while tax revenues are expected to grow by around 3.5%.  It is acknowledged that in the medium term we cannot continue to have expenditure growth rates well in excess of resources.  Reflecting this, more moderate levels of increase in current expenditure are planned.  This will be done in a phased and responsible manner.  A measured deceleration in current expenditure growth is what is required as we enter this period of below trend growth.</P>
        <P>Capital spending is expected to grow by approximately 12% this year as full implementation of the national development plan continues at pace.  Even allowing for all this, only a modest deficit is in prospect for 2008.  As I said at budget time, we are borrowing modestly to invest ambitiously.</P>
        <P>The Government accepts that there can be no unnecessary loosening of fiscal policy and, in that context, the implementation of the national development plan remains a key priority.  It will help boost the productive capacity of the economy and lay the foundations for future growth.</P>
        <P>In the area of pensions, the Government is committed to putting in place a system that is financially, economically and socially sustainable.  The recent Green Paper sets out a range of measures that could help in this respect and the consultation process currently under way provides an opportunity for all to consider and to provide their views in that context.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Given what the T&aacute;naiste said about maintaining capital growth and the national development plan, is he concerned about recent probes by the Garda and the Competition Authority into a &euro;2.5 billion fraud on the taxpayer relating to capital contracts, including those procured through the Office of Public Works, OPW?  While the T&aacute;naiste shouted about the Opposition&rsquo;s alternative policies, I tried to suggest that the way to address some of the current problems may be to cut down on this kind of waste and inefficiency that sees the taxpayer overcharged and, it seems, massively defrauded.  Has the T&aacute;naiste taken an interest in this as it relates to his Department?  Has he received reports on this and will he do anything about it?</P>
        <P>Around the country the Health Service Executive is effectively proposing severe budget cuts, particularly on the operational side, allied to fairly crude bans on recruitment.  At the same time the HSE&rsquo;s administrative budget is continuing to expand.  Is the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance advising line Ministers and bodies like the HSE on making spending more effective and efficient?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The question relates to the report on the stability and convergence programme and reform of the pension system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy broadened the scope of the question somewhat.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>She broadened it slightly.  The Competition Authority exists to ensure anti-competitive practices are exposed and dealt with.  If a probe is taking place at the moment we will see what its outcome is as there is always a fear that such fraud may occur, despite the best efforts of the OPW, which works on these matters in good faith.</P><Col N="200"/>
        <P>The purpose of these health reforms is to recognise that the current situation is not sustainable in terms of the country&rsquo;s demographics.  There is a need to reorganise services and the commitment in our social partnership programmes is to deconstruct current services and reconstruct them around the requirements of citizens.  The challenge to social partnership in this regard is great and I welcome the health forum as the means by which this can be addressed in the spirit of social partnership.  I hope that the work that has begun will show fruit quickly.</P>
        <P>One of the health service&rsquo;s problems is its ability to work within the budgets allocated to it.  Under the law it is required to devise service plans consistent with the allocation it has received.  We know from the areas of health, education and social welfare that people find what they believe are good ways of spending large budgets.  As a former Minister for Health and Children, I can say that, in the interests of a sustainable reformed health service that meets the basic requirements of our people, we need budgetary discipline in this area, perhaps more than any other.  The alternative is the possible dislocation of services, due to a failure to work within allocated budgets, that displaces future expenditure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The EU indicated the current fiscal stance could be out of line with the Stability and Growth Pact in 2009.  The Minister for Finance was asked what measures would be taken to ensure current spending can be contained below nominal GNP.  The record shows that this year it is 70% ahead of nominal growth and last year it was 60% ahead of nominal growth.  Does the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance have an answer to the question posed by the EU?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the T&aacute;naiste been briefed on the story of a &euro;2.5 billion fraud?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must stay within the scope of the original question.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>If the economy is to get back on track we cannot afford to allow contracts to be rigged, as this story suggests.  The investment in the national development plan is the centrepiece of future growth towards competitiveness.  We cannot afford to have up to 110 construction firms involved in ripping off the taxpayer by inflating contract prices.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>No doubt that could be the subject of an excellent further parliamentary question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s point, obviously I plan my budget on the basis of remaining compliant with the terms of the stability pact.  The issue raised is a normal budget day matter.  I included a contingency provision of 0.4% of GDP in 2009 and 0.8% of GDP in 2010.  The inclusion of a contingency is a prudent way of conducting the public finances.  As specified in the budget documentation, a contingency provision is made against factors outside the control of Government which may impact on the budget but which cannot be foreseen at this stage.  Examples are variability and tax buoyancy and exceptional costs arising in areas of public expenditure.  As such variations could be both positive and negative, it is considered appropriate to allow in the projections for a negative net impact on the Government balance and the Exchequer balance. </P>

        <Quest>  the revenues collected from excise duties and VAT from motor fuels and other oils each year from 2004 to 2007; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the amounts of tax revenue collected from mineral oil tax and VAT on motor fuels and other oils for the years 2004 to 2007 are as follows.  In summary, in the case of mineral oil tax, or excise duty, a total of approximately &euro;1,963 million was collected in 2004; &euro;2,048 million in 2005; &euro;2,144 million in 2006; and &euro;2,212 million in 2007 on motor fuels and other oils.  In 2007, for example, excise on petrol and auto-diesel accounted for over 96% of the total yield.</P>
        <P>In the case of VAT on motor fuels and other oils, it is estimated that some &euro;491 million was collected in 2004; &euro;586 million in 2005; &euro;658 million in 2006; and &euro;682 million in 2007.  In 2007, petrol accounted for 68% of the VAT yield on motor fuels and other oils.  The VAT yield on auto-diesel is relatively low as VAT on auto-diesel is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system.</P>
        <P>Excise rates on petrol and auto-diesel have not been increased since December 2003 with the aim of contributing to easing inflationary pressures and our excise rates are in and around the EU average.  Indeed the excise rate on kerosene, which is the primary home heating oil, was reduced to zero over the 2006 and 2007 budgets.</P>
        <P>The yield from excise duty on motor fuels and other oils increased by some 12.7% between 2004 and 2007, broadly in line with the use of such fuels.  The yield for VAT on motor fuels and other oils has increased by some 39% between 2004 and 2007, reflecting both the increase in the use and price of such fuels.</P>
        <P>The yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase.  On the other hand, the yield from VAT, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.  However, in this regard it should be borne in mind that to the extent that spending in the economy is reallocated to petrol and other oil products, and away from other VAT liable spending, and to the extent that the overall level of economic activity is reduced by higher oil prices, there may be little or no net gain to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>A more detailed breakdown of the excise and VAT yields I have outlined are set out in the following tables.</P>

	<P>What does the Minister expect will be the impact of the Government&rsquo;s proposals in regard to the use of bio-fuels and does he consider, in the context of UN and other reports, the movement to bio-fuels, in many cases, is resulting in hoarding and huge price rises for commodities such as wheat and other foodstuffs?  Is the Minister satisfied that Government policy in this area continues to be the best policy in light of what we now know about the impact of bio-fuels on commodity prices for food and on some of the poorest people on the earth?  What does the Minister propose in regard to the percentage of bio-fuels that he envisages being included in this mix?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a technical and statistical question.  In regard to the bio-fuels issue, we are firmly committed to the development of bio-fuels generally.  In the Finance Act 2006 we provided a significant tax measure to promote bio-fuels and the scheme which received the necessary EU state approval commenced in November 2006.  It will provide for excise reliefs of up to 163 million litres per year.  It will cost more than &euro;200 million over five years.  When fully operational it will result in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> savings of more than 0.25 million tonnes per year.  It will contribute towards meeting the target of 5.75% transport fuel market penetration by bio-fuels by 2009.  It will help reduce our dependency on conventional fossil fuels and will stimulate activity in the agricultural sector.  These fiscal incentives were designed to kickstart the domestic bio-fuels industry and evidence suggests that it is happening.</P>
        <P>Long-term general excise reliefs are not anticipated.  There are additional non-fiscal measures that can be used to promote bio-fuels and to provide further market certainty and encourage projects of scale.  The Government has signalled its intention to move to a bio-fuels obligation by 2009 which will require all fuel suppliers to ensure that bio-fuels represent a certain percentage of their annual sales.  The obligation will fall under the remit of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister concerned that the growing scarcity of and demand for bio-fuels, in the way he has outlined, is expected to lead to very significant increases in the cost of foods in Ireland and in other EU countries and particularly for poor people in the developing world?  Has the Minister had an opportunity to look at some of the assessments of the impact of bio-fuels both on inflation and on economies, particularly developing economies?  Has he called for any reassessment of the impact, bearing in mind that our petrol prices are in the mid <Col N="203"/>range in the EU, and that our public transport alternatives are strictly limited compared to most of our EU competitors?  Will we face massive food price rises because of the changing strategy in regard to bio-fuels?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>On bio-fuels generally, the deflection of grain, for example, in the US and elsewhere to the bio-fuel industry creates its own economics in terms of the food industry and the agri food industry in regard to demand and the cost of supplying raw material to the food industry as a result.  Certainly there has been an increase in commodity prices.  For European producers that has been against a background of a quite deflated market environment for some considerable time as against the large increase in inputs that has resulted in the meantime.  It is only becoming a more attractive option now.  Certainly grain growers have been in better spirits in the past year or two than would have been the case for the previous decade.  In regard to the impact it would have on our situation here, domestically I would say the bio-fuels industry is in its infancy.  We are kickstarting it and trying to get penetration of less than 5.75% in the transport fuel market.  Hopefully that will work because it would be a further source of income for farmers.  I do not think it will necessarily impact on the supply of grain to the food business because we have a well developed food industry here.  Given our type of land and agriculture our intensive grain production should enable us to meet both markets.  I do not see one at the expense of the other although I acknowledge that the overall global situation for world commodity food prices is on the up.</P>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>  if his attention has been drawn to reports of under-claiming by tenants of rent relief and under-returning by landlords; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[7814/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>On the question of under-claiming by tenants of rent relief, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have taken a number of initiatives to encourage taxpayers to claim their full entitlements.  Extensive advertising took place in 2006 and 2007 covering the most common tax credits, which specifically included rent relief.  There was also a targeted advertising campaign in autumn 2007 to encourage the uptake of rent relief.  Revenue is including an information leaflet with the 2008 tax credit certificates, which are currently being issued to some 2.2 million PAYE taxpayers.  This leaflet gives information on the most common credits available, including rent relief, and encourages the making of claims where due.</P>
        <P>As regards reports of under-returning of rental income by landlords, the position is that all taxpayers, including landlords, are obliged to make accurate returns under the self-assessment system and are liable to Revenue audit in the normal way.  I am assured by Revenue that the audit of landlords is an ongoing aspect of its work.  For example, in 2006, the latest year for which full data are available, audits were concluded in 527 cases where rental income was the main source of income returned.  The yield from these cases was &euro;4.7 million in tax, interest and penalties.  Cases where rental income is a secondary source are, of course, also included in Revenue audit programmes.  Cases are selected for audit on the basis of perceived risk including, in the case of landlords, consideration of information from tenants or third parties where this has been successfully matched.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that this risk-based audit approach, combined with information matching wherever possible, is the appropriate strategy for tackling under-reporting of income by landlords.  I also point out that since 2006 relief for interest payable on borrowed money applied in the purchase, improvement or repair of rented residential premises is conditional on compliance with the registration requirements of the Private Residential Ten<Col N="204"/>ancies Board.  Furthermore, tenants must identify their landlord when claiming rent relief.  These measures should help to ensure compliance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister aware that the Revenue Commissioners have recently admitted to the Committee of Public Accounts that they are not aware whether tax has been paid on some &euro;200 million paid by the State to landlords under rent supplement and they admit to significant gaps in their information on payments by the State to landlords, let alone payments made where the State is not involved in any way in the transaction?  Is he aware that the Revenue Commissioners estimate rent relief will be claimed this year on 120,000 premises but the CSO calculates there are approximately 250,000 rented properties?  If this is the case, it suggests as many as half of rented properties are not providing relief to the tenants &mdash; while I admit some of those might be on rent supplement, the figure is not anything close to 120,000.  Will the Minister ask the Revenue Commissioners, the CSO and the Department of Social and Family Affairs to undertake a serious examination of the position of both tenants and landlords so we can have confidence that taxpayers are getting fair refunds and that landlords are paying their fair share?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated in my initial reply, there have been some moves in that respect.  Regarding the number availing of rent relief, the figure I have for last year was 215,786.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the figure issued by Revenue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>In any event, I can have that checked for the Deputy.  It is important to bear in mind that some of those taxpayers who request an end-of-year review of their tax liability prefer to claim the rent relief as part of that process.  Accordingly, as there is a four-year rule for requesting such reviews, final figures for the years from 2004 onwards will not be available until that time limit has expired.  It is expected that when final figures are available, the numbers claiming rent relief will increase substantially.  Approximately 98% of those claiming the relief are aged under 55.  I will check the point made by the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister agree to introduce a system whereby all landlords who receive rent payments from the State must supply a full PPS and tax number and that this tax number is made available to the Revenue Commissioners, that landlords who are obliged to register with the Private Residential Tenancies Board should also have to include a tax number on their registration, as they are meant to do, and that those tax numbers would be made available to the Revenue Commissioners?  This would ensure that all landlords who are liable to pay tax on their earnings would be made to pay it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I undertake to take up the point raised by the Deputy with Revenue to ascertain its views on it.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In the debate on the motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach last September, the T&aacute;naiste made great play of political loyalty and how important it is to him.  That loyalty led the T&aacute;naiste and his colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il to support Deputy Bertie Ahern as Taoiseach in September, despite the evidence that he had received large amounts of money for personal use, that he had not been co-operative with the Mahon tribunal and that he had not given a credible explanation for the source of these funds.  Since September, the tribunal&rsquo;s work has continued, despite criticism from Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers and an attack from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s legal team.</P>
        <P>Last Thursday, as the T&aacute;naiste is aware, more dramatic facts emerged from the tribunal.  Fact &mdash; more accounts with more lodgements were revealed and assurances given to the D&aacute;il and on RTE that the Taoiseach had disclosed all accounts and all lodgements were shown to be false.  Fact &mdash; the Taoiseach admitted to getting a gift of money when Minister for Finance and not declaring it to the Revenue Commissioners or paying tax on it.  Fact &mdash; &pound;30,000 donated or collected by Fianna F&aacute;il personnel for the Fianna F&aacute;il Party was used for the purchase of a house.  Fact &mdash; this money was only refunded after the tribunal had uncovered its existence.  These are not tribunal conclusions; these are facts contained in the transcripts of the tribunal.  They are set out in black and white for anybody to read.</P>
        <P>Given that the assurances given by the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, to the nation prior to the general election that he had no tax issues, that the source of all these monies could be explained and that no further donation revelations were due have been demonstrated to be patently false, I want to know from the T&aacute;naiste, as deputy leader of the Government and Minister for Finance, what action he proposes to rectify the situation and remove the paralysis from Government.</P>

	<P>A couple of weeks ago, the House urged the Mahon tribunal to complete its work on the basis of the confidence we had in it to fulfil its mandate.  It goes without saying that such confidence is based on the expectation that <Col N="206"/>the tribunal will operate fairly and with full regard to the rights of all relevant parties.  It is in the nature of tribunals of inquiry to structure evidence and to examine witnesses on a sequential basis.  In the absence of normal <i>sub judice</i> rules, each isolated exchange can be commented on and pored over publicly and the most outrageous and implausible construction put on it.  Deputy Kenny has decided in the context of his job to take over the role of the Revenue Commissioners, he has decided that people are not tax compliant and he has made these decisions when they are not in accordance with the facts.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach is meeting the requirements of the Standards in Public Office Act &mdash; we know this to be the case.  We know his evidence continues.  We know he is entitled to a fair hearing.  This House, in the terms of reference that were adopted for the tribunal of inquiry, appointed people to come to conclusions on these matters in the round when they have heard all the evidence and everything has been tested.  Deputy Kenny has decided, as his political tactic, to come to the House on a weekly, if possible hourly, basis to put his version of events, or that of his self-appointed spokesman, on the record of this House in trying to brandish assertion as fact.  With all due respect to Deputy Kenny, we will await the outcome of the tribunal of inquiry.  We will await its hearing of all the evidence.  I do not need lectures from Deputy Kenny on my standards.  My standards relate to fair play and the hearing of the evidence.  They certainly do not relate to people being guilty before being proven innocent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I referred strictly to facts and not conclusions of the tribunal &mdash; facts as outlined from the mouth of the Taoiseach himself in the tribunal.</P>
        <P>There is a time for bluster and a time for quiet truth.  I find the answer the T&aacute;naiste has given pathetic.  I also find it pathetic that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance stands over all these matters.  What the T&aacute;naiste said actually makes him an accomplice to the deceit disseminating from Dublin Castle.  That is what the T&aacute;naiste is saying now.</P>

	<P>It has emerged in recent days at the tribunal &mdash; the evidence is very clear &mdash; that what is happening now in the Ahern era is very akin to what happened in the Haughey era.  I refer to large sums of money for personal use, non-payment of taxes and money belonging to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party misappropriated for private use.  That is the standard.  It is now perfectly obvious that what happened in the Haughey era is being replicated in the Ahern era.  The sins of the master are replicated by the pupil.</P>
        <P>I have listened to a lot of rhetoric and lectures from the T&aacute;naiste to the Green Party and everybody else about clearing things up, how the old ways are gone, never to return, and things are as they should be.  If that is the case, as the anointed successor to the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, unassailable in the betting office, the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s hour has come.  An opportunity now presents itself to remove this paralysis from Government and deal with it with a sense of leadership and courage instead of collusion and weakness.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste is the deputy leader of the Government.  It is his responsibility to deal with the situation, where he can say enough is enough, that we do not want to continue with a situation where the people of Ireland have to sit and endure the sad spectacle of the Taoiseach of the land being decimated by his own words in front of a tribunal of inquiry set up by this House.  Now is the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s opportunity to demonstrate that political loyalty is fine and well but there is a time when public duty and the good of the people have to be put <Col N="207"/>first.  The choice is the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s.  If he does nothing, he condones these standards and he becomes an accomplice.  His leadership would then be epitomised by weakness and collusion instead of leadership and courage.</P>
        <P>In the interests of the Irish people, before the next avalanche of damning evidence comes from this tribunal, I urge the T&aacute;naiste to go to the Taoiseach on his return and tell him that the time has come for him to move on, and for the T&aacute;naiste, if he is the one who is chosen by his party, to restore a Government that is concentrating on working in the interests of the people and the challenges our nation faces.  I would like to hear the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s response as to what he intends to do.</P>

The Taoiseach was so poor even on a ministerial salary that there had to be whip-arounds in a pub and in Manchester for him.  At the same time we now know that there were accounts, some of which were controlled by some of the dig-out men, from which a loan for a house could be granted.  The tribunal said the lodgements made to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s account was in dollars but he said he has a banker who can prove it was not dollars but when the tribunal came looking for the evidence, the Taoiseach went to court to stop them getting the calculations on which he based his claim.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach came before the House and stated he is tax compliant.  He told the people in a television interview that he had paid all his taxes but he cannot get a tax clearance certificate.  We can all stretch our credulity only so far.  We could say that maybe some of these stories are true but not all of them.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s position regarding public credibility and political authority is untenable.  Clearly he will not go voluntarily but intends to brazen it out.  As we saw in the motion of no confidence, the Opposition does not have the numbers to force him to resign.  The Green Party will not exercise whatever political position it has to cause that to happen.  It falls to the T&aacute;naiste and I am not naive enough to expect the T&aacute;naiste to tell us he will go to the Taoiseach, bring him the bad news and advise him about what he must do.  However I expect him to do so and I expect to be able to interpret the answer he gives here as some signal that he will do it.</P>
        <P>This cannot go on forever.  Politics in this country and the business of government must be enabled to return to the issues of the people.  As long as the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, is before the tribunal giving these kinds of unbelievable explanations, we are in &ldquo;the dog ate my homework&rdquo; territory.  We need some firm leadership and the only person who can provide that is the T&aacute;naiste.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I disagree with Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s suggestion that the Taoiseach, in giving his evidence, has compromised his position to lead this country.  The issues under consideration by the tribunal relate to a two-year period after his separation from his wife and the settling of his family affairs.  As Deputy Gilmore suggested, he did not have a bank account at that time. <Col N="210"/> There was the question of the &euro;22,500, the &euro;16,500 and the &euro;8,000, and he has given explanations about those, which have been corroborated by people who have gone into the tribunal to confirm the nature of those amounts.  If the question is that this was obtained, as Mr. Tom Gilmartin suggested, from Mr. Owen O&rsquo;Callaghan, the Taoiseach is adamant that he did not receive one cent, penny or euro from Mr. O&rsquo;Callaghan.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not discuss fees.  That is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s position.  While this is a painstaking and drawn-out process, the Taoiseach is adamant that this is the position.  No material has been provided to the contrary.  Deputy Gilmore has consistently been of the view that the tribunal should get on with its business and we should get on with ours.  He reiterated that here today and I agree with him.  However, his contention is that we are not capable of getting on with our business on the basis of the present situation whereby the tribunal is not completed.  In his view the Taoiseach should leave office, but we do not agree with that.</P>
        <P>The Government is doing its work.  It had its Cabinet meeting, made its decisions and is getting on with its business.  The problem is that a policy-bankrupt Opposition wants to discuss this issue every day as if it is the only matter going on in this country.  The Government is functioning in making its decisions and will continue to do so under the Taoiseach&rsquo;s leadership.  We will continue to deal with the serious issues the people expect us to deal with regarding the economy, social conditions, the international financial situation and the responsibilities of the line Ministers&rsquo; Departments.  We have a good budgetary situation despite the challenges we face, which we discussed here for an hour previously.  That is the real political situation.</P>
        <P>The issue manufactured by Deputy Kenny is that he will tell us what the outcome of the evidence is and we will listen to him and his cohorts for the interpretation or meaning of events.</P>

	<P>That is why we established the tribunals.  The problem with the tribunal is that it has gone on for so long.  That is because we do not have <i>sub judice</i> rules and because of the inadequacy of the legislative framework under which they operate, the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921, which people in this House have consistently debated and highlighted in the past ten years.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach, as has been suggested, is not entitled to go to the courts to maintain and protect his good name in respect of procedures or issues of law, as he sees it, that arise.  Deputy Gilmore was incomplete in his suggestion that the Taoiseach would not be prepared to provide documentation which is part of the privileged relationship he and his clients and representatives have with their advisers.  He is entitled to seek a judicial review on that matter as he does not have the information the tribunal people have on their bogus dollar claim and how they came up with their theory.  The problem is that a series of conjectures can be put before us and turned into fact by Deputy Kenny on the basis that he sees some political capital emerge for him, whereas it is simply consistent with the philosophy that has informed his party since its foundation.</P>

	<P>I agree that the holding of political office has nothing to do with guilt or innocence.  The tribunal, in its own good time, will reach its conclusions on whether the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, received a corrupt payment.  The Revenue Commissioners, in its own good time, will reach its conclusions on his tax compliance.  Holding political office is not about guilt or innocence but about confidence.</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Confidence in the Taoiseach cannot continue when he has given the most incredible of explanations to the tribunal.  Deputy Kenny, my predecessor and I did not invent this.  When these issues arose in the public domain we took the view, for which we were criticised, that the Taoiseach would give his evidence to the tribunal.   He said he wanted to go to Dublin Castle and explain all this.  He said he had an explanation for it and had supplied all the documents.</P>
        <P>When he got to Dublin Castle we discovered a couple of facts.  We discovered he was not quite as fulsome in co-operating with the tribunal as he had claimed.  It had been writing to him for a year and a half to extract information from him.  Over a series of appearances in Dublin Castle he has given the most cock-eyed of explanations for various matters.  As I said, you can buy one of these stories but, given the contradictions emerging between one and another, buying them all is unbelievable.  It will continue and that is not good for the country.  It is bad for politics, the way we do our business and the attention which requires to be given to the issues of the people.</P>
        <P>Yesterday on television the T&aacute;naiste said it was not his practice to talk to the Taoiseach about his evidence at the tribunal before he gave it, and I accept that, I would not expect him to have that kind of conversation with him.  However, earlier this year the Taoiseach designated Deputy Cowen as his successor.  Has Deputy Cowen had any conversation with the Taoiseach about when that succession will take place?  Whatever about my believing that the T&aacute;naiste did <Col N="212"/>not talk to the Taoiseach about his evidence at the tribunal, I cannot believe he has not had that conversation with him.  I will not have the opportunity to ask a second supplementary question to this so in case the T&aacute;naiste tells us this is none of our business, that the leadership of Fianna F&aacute;il is its business and it will decide in its own time, I remind Deputy Cowen that this House elects the Taoiseach.  We now have a set of circumstances where the current occupant of that office has said he will resign at some stage and will pass on the mantle to the T&aacute;naiste.  When is that going to happen?  While the Taoiseach is brazening out his political difficulties with the tribunal, this country is getting increasingly scandalised by it all and it must end.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Again I do not agree with the Deputy&rsquo;s assertions.  He said that the Taoiseach does not enjoy the confidence of this House, but in fact he does.</P>

	<P>The confidence in people who hold elected office in this republic is determined in this House.  This is the democratic assembly, as people next to the Deputy often remind me.  Deputy Gilmore is making an assertion and that is his view.  He was defeated in making that view known in a recent electoral contest, and he was defeated in this House last October.  I suspect he would be defeated again were he to try, as he suggests himself.  The Taoiseach has the confidence of this assembly, so the Deputy&rsquo;s assertion that he does not is incorrect.</P>
        <P>There are no designated successors in this or any other party.  The Taoiseach candidly revealed his personal preference, but he said that it is a matter for everyone in this party to decide the next leader.  I will not make any such presumption on the identity of the next leader.  While he holds the leadership of this party and enjoys the confidence of the House and this party, he will lead this party.</P>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="SeanConnick"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Connick</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Bill.  I congratulate the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, on the initiative he is taking in bringing about changes to the VRT regulations for greener and more fuel-efficient cars.  His initiative will, over time, bring about a considerable change in the attitude of the public towards energy efficient motoring and eventually will have a similar impact, but on a much larger scale, to the plastic bag levy introduced by his predecessor as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government a number of years ago.  However, the proposed VRT changes contain a number of anomalies which I hope the Minister will consider before finalising his proposals.</P>
        <P>My background is in the motor trade.  My late father had a Fiat Lancia main dealership which we ran from 1974 to 1987.  In 1981, after leaving school, I worked in the business for seven years.  The late 1970s and early 1980s were a good time in the motor industry.  However, the industry then suffered from the penal duties placed on motor vehicles.  The only political march on which I went was the &ldquo;axe the tax&rdquo; campaign in 1981 when the motor industry began to kick back at the level of punitive tax applied to it.</P>
        <P>In the mid-1980s and the late 1980s we saw sales of between 50,000 and 60,000 new cars every year.  In recent times, we achieved those figures in the month of January alone.  I have a number of concerns about the introduction of this Bill and I hope amendments will be made during its passage through the Houses.</P>
        <P>My brother and other family members still work in the industry and I am aware of the impact this Bill will have on car sales.  The first aspect I question is the timing of the scheme.  It would be much better to introduce it on 1 January.  The motor industry changed considerably due to the changes made to the number plate.  Many people purchase their car based on the incoming year&rsquo;s plate.  Decisions on car purchase are made between September and December.  This year, January car sales figures increased by 3.9%.  For the first two weeks of February, car sales decreased by 18.5% and major concern exists that people will hold off on the purchase of cars until 1 July.  The industry is also concerned that people will further put off purchases until January 2009.  This will have an impact on the revenue due to the Government.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s intention is to influence the future buying habits of Irish motorists.  All cars registered after 1 July will be taxed under the new regime.  However, an individual who bought a fuel efficient car before now or who buys one between now and 1 July will still be taxed under the old system.  Effectively, we will penalise those who cared for the environment before the Government decided to reward people for it.</P>
        <P>In contrast, someone who imports a used car from England and registers it after 1 July will be taxed under the new system.  This means that the same make, model and year of car will be taxed at two separate rates depending on whether it was originally bought in Ireland or imported from England and registered in Ireland after 1 July 2008.  For example, an individual who purchased a new Volkswagen Golf diesel car in Ireland in 2006 will pay annual road tax of &euro;560.  However, someone who imports the same car from England after 1 July will pay only &euro;150 per annum.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the people who will be penalised under this anomaly will be those Irish motorists who cared enough for the environment to buy a lower emissions car before the introduction of this new standard.  Not only will these motorists pay a higher rate of road tax each year, but the value of their cars may fall considerably relative to the value of imported <Col N="219"/>cars and new cars registered after 1 July.  This is a poor way of recognising motorists who bought cars on an environmental basis before it became profitable to do so.  I hope that over the coming years we can address this issue and find a way to level the pitch.</P>
        <P>The benefit in kind scheme which exists at present is mileage based.  This is not very green when one considers that people are encouraged to reach a certain mileage and if they do not reach it they drive around the countryside to do so.  This needs attention and the matter should be addressed.</P>
        <P>In my home town of New Ross, the first biodiesel plant in the country is due to open its doors in the coming months.  The targets for the use of biodiesel are between 3.5% and 5%.  However, we have an opportunity to increase this dramatically through the use of biodiesel by commercial road transport fleets.  I know of a number of fleet users in the UK which work on a 50-50 scheme whereby 50% biodiesel and 50% diesel are used.  It seems to work well and we have a major opportunity to gain a green advantage through exploring such a system.</P>
        <P>How accurate are measurements of engine emissions?  Are we dependent on information given to us by motor manufacturers or do we have a way of measuring them ourselves?  My understanding from the industry is that not all the measurements are accurate as there are different ways of testing emission levels.  This is an area that could be examined on remaining Stages.</P>
        <P>A myth exists that the smaller engine is the more economic one.  This may not always be the case.  In my motor trade days, I was always puzzled when people went for the 1.4 litre car as opposed to the 1.6 litre.  Due to the power-to-weight ratio, the 1.6 litre was always more fuel efficient.  Explaining that to a customer was nigh on impossible.  When comparing a 1.4 litre petrol car to its 1.9 litre diesel model, people would be in for a pleasant surprise in that the larger engine will have a greener lean burn.</P>
        <P>Last October when I changed my car, I bought a diesel one for the first time.  I had always been a petrol-head for many years.  Like Jeremy Clarkson on &ldquo;Top Gear&rdquo;, I dreaded diesel, believing tractors were the only vehicles that should run on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Tractors are not the only vehicles to run on diesel.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanConnick"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Connick</NameTxt>
	<P>This time when I changed, I went green.  I am delighted with my choice as diesel engines have become very fuel efficient.  To anyone considering changing their car, I recommend they choose the diesel option.</P>
        <P>As well as penalising the environmentally conscious motorist, we are also creating problems for the motor industry.  It will be difficult to sell new lower emission cars between now and 1 July 2008.  The second-hand car market will suffer adverse effects for the next five years because it will be more advantageous for customers to purchase second-hand cars in England, import them to Ireland and then register them.</P>
        <P>While I recognise the intentions behind the Minister&rsquo;s proposals and commend him on taking this initiative, I hope he will consider the impact this anomaly will have on both environmentally responsible motorists and on the motor industry.  The most efficient way to overcome this anomaly would be to allow cars to be road taxed at the new environmental rates on renewal, provided these rates are lower than the current rates and that the CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> data was recorded by the State at the time of registration.</P>
        <P>A recent study undertaken on behalf of the Society of the Irish Motor Industry has shown the cost of making this change would come to &euro;26.8 million.  However, the study also showed that a decline of 1.5% in new car sales this year as a result of this anomaly could cost the Exchequer &euro;27.8 million in lost VRT and VAT.  These figures show the cost of implementing <Col N="220"/>this proposal to rectify the loophole in the new regulations would be less than the potential lost revenue to the State than if allowed to stand.  I urge the Minister to make this small amendment and allow all lower emission cars, irrespective of when they were first registered, to come under the new VRT regime.</P>
        <P>The disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme allows for the repayment of VRT and VAT on the purchase of a vehicle and the repayment of VAT on the adapting of a motor vehicle for use by a disabled driver or disabled passenger.  It aims to offset some of the considerable costs involved in providing suitable transport for people with disabilities.  The vehicles must have an engine size less than 2,000cc for a disabled driver and less than 4,000cc for a disabled passenger.  The costs of VRT and VAT relating to purchasing and adapting the vehicle will be repaid up to a maximum of &euro;9,525 for a disabled driver and &euro;15,875 for a disabled passenger.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, these maximum repayment rates were set over 20 years ago and have not been increased since.  The increase in the cost of motoring in that time means these rates no longer reflect the costs involved in purchasing a car and adapting it for use by a disabled driver or disabled passenger.  The maximum engine size of 2,000cc for a disabled driver and 4,000cc for a disabled passenger places strong limitations on the ability of people with disabilities to choose a vehicle suitable to their needs.</P>
        <P>I strongly urge the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance to make considerable changes to the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme before the next budget.  He should increase the maximum repayments rates for the first time in over 20 years, index link them in future, remove the maximum engine size of a vehicle that can be considered under this scheme and revise the medical criteria for applicants.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, on introducing a new environmentally-based system of motor taxation.  His proposals will have a profound impact on the motoring public in the years ahead.  However, he must consider a small change to his proposals to end the anomaly which appears in his scheme.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Connick for sharing his time.  I commend him on the detail of his speech.  It is clear he has a background in the motor industry and speaks with great knowledge on it.</P>
        <P>I wish to address the motor tax increases, approved on 5 December 2007, and the new carbon budget and its linkage to motor tax with the move away from the old motor tax system determined on a vehicle&rsquo;s engine size.</P>
        <P>While no Member would welcome a tax increase, the increases in the motor tax rate must be considered in their context.  The increases will be ring-fenced for the local government fund which will improve the services provided by local authorities.  These are also the first increases since 2004, the first in four years.</P>
        <P>The Minister has proposed a 9.5% increase for cars below 2.2 litre engine size and 11% for cars with an engine size above this threshold.  When communities see the benefit of the revenue generated by the local government fund, most reasonable people will understand it is worth paying the extra money.  Recently, the Minister for Transport announced the regional and local roads programme for 2008, setting out an overall expenditure of &euro;618 million.  Funding for this will come from the local government fund.  Motor tax proceeds in 2008 are anticipated to be &euro;1.08 billion, a significant figure which will directly finance improvements to local government services and investment in roads.</P><Col N="221"/>
        <P>I welcome some of the projects the fund has facilitated in the Cork South Central constituency, particularly the investment of &euro;500,000 in the Carrigaline western relief road, &euro;100,000 in the proposed Clarke&rsquo;s Hill-Moneygourney road improvement scheme and over &euro;500,000 on the R610, Rochestown to Passage West road.  I refer to these specific local projects because it is important for people to see the benefit of the motor tax they are paying.  While it is easy to complain about an increase in motor tax rates, we also want to see improvements to the road network.  If we can deliver those improvements in a timely and efficient manner, the majority will not be too critical of paying these increases.</P>
        <P>Recently at the Joint Committee on Transport, the chief executive officer of the Road Safety Authority, Noel Brett, and the Garda Commissioner, Fachtna Murphy, went into some detail on road safety issues.  They explained as 94% of the road network is constituted by local and regional roads, we need to continue to invest in the network to make it as safe as possible.  The Minister&rsquo;s announcement of funding from the local government fund is particularly important in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Bill&rsquo;s fundamental provision links motor taxation rates for new vehicles to CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions rather than engine size from 1 July.  Engine size historically has been the determinant of motor tax but if we consider the purpose of what we are trying to achieve, it is quite a crude measure because it is CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> that is the problem in terms of pollution and its contribution to global environmental issues such as climate change.  If we consider that road transport generates 20% of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions in the EU, with passenger cars representing more than half of this, we can begin to understand the contribution made by road-related transport to climate change.  The carbon budget announced by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the day following the budget in December, which is now being implemented through this Bill, will represent our contribution to solving this problem.  Although this is a small country, we must play a leadership role in terms of addressing climate change.  Given the contribution of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions from road transport to environmental problems, it is important that we do this.</P>
        <P>There has been some criticism of the Minister&rsquo;s decision to apply the new motor taxation system to new and pre-owned imported cars registered on or after 1 July 2008, and I note Deputy Connick&rsquo;s comments on linking VRT to CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions from that date and the potential impact on motor vehicle sales in 2008.  It will balance out.  We may well see a reduction in sales in the first half of the year compared to last year, but it is to be hoped that the second half of the year will compensate for this.  There is of course a fear that some people will hold off on buying a new car until 2009, but when a fundamental change such as this is introduced, some anomalies will always be created, which will be washed out through the system over a period of time.  The important thing is that we subscribe to the principle of what the Minister, Deputy Gormley, is seeking to achieve here: that as a country, we play a leading role in tackling climate change, particularly by linking motor taxation and VRT to carbon emissions rather than engine size.  From 1 July motor tax for the most efficient new cars registered will start at &euro;100, while under the current system the lowest motor tax rate is &euro;165.  Thus, there is a direct incentive for people who want to act responsibly and play their parts in tackling climate change.  By buying a vehicle that is carbon efficient, people will earn a direct financial benefit.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the new labelling system being introduced by the Minister from 1 July.  It is particularly important that consumer-friendly information is available and is presented in a uniform and consistent manner to enable people to make conscious and informed decisions on the implications of this Bill for their buying patterns.  I commend the Minister and thank the Ceann Comhairle for this time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Stanton.</P><Col N="222"/>
        <P>I refer to the issue raised by Deputy Connick regarding the disabled drivers&rsquo; scheme.  While it may not be directly relevant to the Bill, it is important that we use the opportunity to highlight it once again.  Deputy Connick mentioned the sizes of vehicles that are covered under the scheme.  I wish to raise the specific issue of qualification for the scheme.  There are many cases in my constituency of people who are in dire need of the disabled driver&rsquo;s allowance but are not allowed to enter the scheme.  Although the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, is not directly involved with this scheme, he does have Cabinet responsibility for making sure that such issues are rectified.  The scheme should be made usable, and it should be ensured that those who currently do not meet the regulations of having a disability such as having lost an arm or a leg but are still unable to drive without structural changes to their cars can avail of the scheme.  I urge the Minister to act on this.</P>
        <P>The Bill is just another means of fundraising.  We can talk about technicalities such as the fact that the money raised goes to local government, but the Minister is giving with one hand and taking with the other.  It is another form of taxation.  The only reason it has been increased this year is that extra revenue was required.  There is no point in trying to cover it up.</P>
        <P>The previous speaker referred to a difficult issue.  Many elderly people drive smaller cars because they are more suitable for them and because they suit their budgets.  Under the new regime, there will be an anomaly straight away whereby somebody who buys a car with the lowest level of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions and so on will get away with paying &euro;100 of tax per year, while his or her colleague who happens to have the same car but bought earlier this year, or five or ten years ago, will pay &euro;165.  I do not think it would make a major difference to the overall budget to change the regulations, from 1 July or whatever date the Minister chooses, so that cars that are already in the system can be brought into the new system, at both the lower and higher tax levels.  We must remember that those who want to buck the system &mdash; I do not apologise for using that word &mdash; by buying gas-guzzlers that will contribute to the destruction of the environment have from now until July to do that, and they are guaranteed not to have to pay the new rate of tax.  Thus, it works both ways.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this.</P>
        <P>Deputy Connick referred to the fact he had just bought a diesel car.  For the record, I have been driving a diesel car as long as I can remember, because I thought it was a better system.  It has now been proven beyond doubt that it is better to drive a diesel car.  People have used all sorts of public gimmicks to make out that they were in favour of this.  I started driving a diesel car in the early 1980s &mdash; 1981 or 1982 at the latest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;when I became involved in farm organisation and was doing more than 40,000 miles per year.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred in his speech to supplementing the annual Exchequer fund towards roads.  Currently local government is funded not just by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, but by charging for water.  The Minister said recently that we are paying only a nominal rate compared to some other European countries, but we have increased that by charging for both water in and water out.  This has caused serious problems for industry.  There is also the issue of capital charges.  In a town in my county, the allocation of a significant amount of money for a sewerage scheme was recently announced.  I will not give any names to avoid causing difficulties for the company concerned.  Everybody thought this was a Government grant, but they later found out that the Government&rsquo;s contribution was a small percentage of the total and that industry and others would have to pay massive capital sums towards the project.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this before too much damage is <Col N="223"/>done.  If the sum of which I heard has to be paid by one company, it may mean the company, which employs large numbers of people in the town, will no longer be there.  We must ensure that a balance is struck.</P>
        <P>As one who lives on a regional road I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s comments on funding regional and county roads.  I refer to the spatial strategy and regional development.  In recent months the Minister announced that in parts of County Monaghan one cannot build unless one has owned land for the past ten years.  The Minister should think that over again if his statement on spatial strategy is to mean anything.  County Monaghan has the lowest increase in population in Ireland, yet impositions are made without any thought.  This has serious implications and I ask the Minister to re-examine it.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to the increase in prices.  While there was no increase in taxation over the past few years, there was an enormous increase in the number of vehicles.  The funding increased without the price increasing.</P>
        <P>I refer to changes in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>.  As one who lives within a few miles of the Border, in an area where much of our business is done across the Border, I am more conscious than most of how these regulations work.  I warn the Minister that, unless he changes some of the systems in July, it will encourage people to buy second-hand cars north of the Border, in England or elsewhere.  Someone buying a car that has been taxed before 1 July in the South will find that the car will be burdened with a high level of road tax for the rest of its life.  Buying a similar car north of the Border or elsewhere in Europe is not in the interests of the economy in the long term.  I appreciate it any time the Minister tries to do something positive.  Fine Gael has pushed for recognition of lower levels of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.  I urge the Minister to re-examine this matter.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael is in favour of the changes in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions but opposes this structure, which will cause difficulty for second-hand cars.  If we cannot sell our cars to garages because they cannot get rid of them, it will increase the cost indirectly.  There are implications and I encourage the Minister to re-examine this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the legislation and support any environmentally friendly effort to reduce CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.  I encourage the Minister along this road, if Members will pardon the pun, because much needs to be done in this area.</P>
        <P>Ireland is becoming car dependent.  When I and the Minister were growing up, that was not the case.  People cycled and walked much more.  It is now part of our culture in that we are inclined to rush from A to B.  People do not seem to have time, they want to drop their children at the door of the school and park as close as possible to the shop door.</P>
        <P>This is a welcome first step, encouraging people to purchase cars with low emissions.  There are a number of anomalies in this Bill, which my colleagues have pointed out, regarding importing cars.  I hope the Minister will deal with those anomalies on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
        <P>I travel by public transport when I can and I enjoy it.  I had to drive today from Cork to Dublin.  It was fine until I encountered serious traffic congestion in Dublin, which has improved.  I noticed the number of single occupants in large cars.  We must encourage people to car share.</P>
        <P>We must encourage children to cycle to school.  One of the issues is that the roads are dangerous and parents are afraid of allowing children to cycle.  A related issue is the weight of school bags, which is appalling.  I have a child of 12 years of age and I can hardly lift the bag.  Putting that on the back of a bicycle is dangerous.  Another reason children do not cycle is because of the amount of gear they have, with PE gear and school bags.  If he wants children to cycle to school, the Minister should speak with the Minister for Education and Science and <Col N="224"/>ask her to talk to publishers about reducing the size of books.  When I was in school we had a book for every year.  Nowadays, there are three in one tome, massive encyclopedias that youngsters carry around.  This discourages children from cycling or walking.</P>
        <P>In years to come, we could see the Department with responsibility for education before the courts.  Adults may claim that their backs were damaged because they were forced to carry heavy bags to school as children.  We had cases of army deafness.  I served for 25 years in the FCA.  At one stage I was told not to wear ear muffs because they were not issued to me.  I did not claim anything but many others did.  In 15 or 20 years time adults may approach the State and claim that they were forced, through the Department of Education and Science, to carry heavy books to school as children and that the State did nothing to protect them.  They may also claim they were unable to cycle because of it.  I know the Minister is genuine about this matter and I want him to speak to the Minister for Education and Science because she will not listen to me.</P>
        <P>In rural areas, many landowners do not cut their hedgerows.  I do not know if responsibility for this matter lies with the Department of Transport or the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  If hedgerows are not cut, it is dangerous to walk or cycle on roads.  It is a simple issue but we do not seem to have clear lines of responsibility.  Local authorities should be instructed by the Minister in charge to ensure hedgerows are cut back so that pedestrians and cyclists can see where they are going.  This will encourage more people to walk and cycle and cut emissions, which is the aim of this Bill.</P>
        <P>People are driving too fast on rural roads and speed limits need to be reduced.  Road signs in many areas are absolutely filthy.  This may be within the Minister&rsquo;s remit and is slightly off the point of this Bill.  However, whichever Minister is responsible should tell the local authorities to wash the blasted signs.  It gives a bad indication to visitors and locals.  Road signs are covered with red algae or they are black and dirty.  Washing them is a simple thing and I do not know why it cannot be done.</P>
        <P>Some people must have large, powerful vehicles because of the work they do.  Is there a danger that they may be penalised unfairly?  I refer to those who work on the land or in forestry and need large vehicles to pull heavy loads.  The Minister might respond to that matter.</P>
        <P>The other issue I wish to raise is non-nationals bringing cars to this country and the enforcement of vehicle registration of imported cars.  A large number of cars are brought into this country.  Under the legislation they must be registered within one year but there are difficulties with registration and insurance.  The fact that many of the cars are left-hand drive is also a problem.  Overtaking is not easy when driving a left-hand drive car due to the visibility problem.  We must ensure that these foreign registered vehicles are re-registered in this country and made liable for Irish motor tax and insurance.  This might have to be done at European level.  The emissions from these cars are also an issue because some of them are quite old.  How is that to be dealt with?  It is not safe to have too many left-hand drive cars in the country.  The Minister should deal with this.</P>
        <P>I welcome any initiative that will reduce CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions and encourage people to walk, cycle and buy smaller cars.  Perhaps the table of charges should be more graduated to promote the use of smaller cars.  People should be encouraged to share cars.  However, the issue of people who require large vehicles for their business or employment must be examined.  Other speakers have mentioned the condition of minor roads, a matter that is probably under the remit of the Department of Transport but affects motor vehicles.  If those roads are in very bad condition, as many of them are with potholes and so forth, it will damage cars.  I urge the Government and local authorities to ensure that these roads are maintained to a high standard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to this debate and, in particular, I welcome the broad support for the move to an emissions based approach to motor tax.  I have listened carefully to the points raise by Deputies and I will address them as far as possible in these remarks.  In my contribution on Second Stage last Wednesday, I made it clear that the sole reason for increasing motor tax rates in respect of the existing fleet was to fund local government.  I made no bones about that.  The increases in motor tax rates, at 9.5% for the majority of the fleet, are well below the rate of inflation since the last increase in rates in 2004.  The increases for 95% of the car fleet are between 27 cent and 98 cent per week.</P>
        <P>All motor tax receipts go into the local government fund.  The fund plays a significant role in financing local government and there is a need to maintain it.  Motor tax receipts represent some 60% of the local government fund, which is ring-fenced exclusively for local government; it cannot be used for any other purpose.  The increase in motor tax rates is about local government.  It is about ensuring that local government is well resourced and is in a position adequately to perform its functions and to provide quality public services across its wide range of activities.  Deputies cannot have it both ways.  Failure to raise funding through increased motor tax rates would have resulted in significantly reduced allocations to local authorities for 2008 for general purpose funding and for regional and local roads.</P>
        <P>Total funding for the local government fund for 2008 is estimated at &euro;1.6 billion, which represents approximately 30% of local authority current funding requirements.  The motor tax increases have enabled me to provide for substantial increases in the record levels of funding provided to local authorities in 2007 for general purpose funding and for regional and local roads.  In 2008, I have allocated &euro;999 million in general purpose grants to local authorities while &euro;565 million is being provided from the local government fund towards the development and maintenance of the regional and local road network.  I am determined that local government will prosper and to ensure that local government remains meaningful and effective in supporting social and economic development across the country.  It is for this reason that I have increased motor tax rates.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputies have referred to the importance of addressing climate change.  Climate change is profound in its implications for the planet and its inhabitants and represents a significant challenge to society.  It cuts to the core of modern living and commercial activity.  While, in global terms, Ireland&rsquo;s emissions may be relatively small, it is essential that we address the challenge of adapting to a low carbon society. With our EU colleagues, we were to the forefront in bringing the Kyoto Protocol into force.  Our efforts to secure global agreement on deep cuts in emissions must be backed up by a commensurate level of ambition at home.  The programme for Government and the carbon budget which I delivered last December make it clear that we are up for that challenge.</P>
        <P>The move to an emissions based approach to motor tax, which I announced in my carbon budget, gives effect to the commitment in the programme for Government to introduce measures to rebalance motor tax in favour of cars with lower CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.  It complements the new CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> based VRT system which is provided for in the Finance Bill.  I listened carefully to the points raised by Deputies regarding the introduction of the new motor tax system.  They raised issues relating to the starting date for the new system and the possible implications of second-hand imports for the existing fleet.  I have examined many of the issues raised and, while some of the proposals put forward would result in certain anomalies, I am giving further consideration to them.  I believe there is some scope to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage to address some of the concerns expressed by the Deputies.</P><Col N="226"/>
        <P>I have always said I will listen to good ideas from the Opposition.  I thank Deputy Stanton and Deputy Crawford for their constructive remarks.  Deputy Stanton was correct in identifying some of the problems that lead to greater car dependency.  Clearly, there is a problem with speeding on the roads.  I have visited rural areas often and while I consider the cities dangerous enough for cyclists, the rural roads are lethal for them and pedestrians.  People drive like rally drivers on many of them.  This must be addressed.  Deputy Stanton also correctly identified the problem of the weight of schoolbags which is preventing many children from walking and cycling to school.  Indeed, I notice many children no longer carry bags on their backs but, as if they are travelling abroad, use wheeled cases for their books.  I agree it is preventing children from walking or cycling to school but we must, in the first instance, make it safer for children to cycle to school.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is giving a great deal of consideration to that in the context of his new sustainable transport plan.</P>
        <P>Deputy Lynch queried the likely impact of the new motor tax regime on carbon emissions.  The national climate change strategy includes the quantified effects of a range of measures in the various sectors.  A combined annual saving of 50,000 tonnes<b> </b>is attributed to the rebalancing of motor tax and vehicle registration tax and the introduction of an enhanced vehicle label.  This saving is based on indicative calculations contained in a study prepared by Sustainable Energy Ireland and referenced in a report on greenhouse gas emissions projections prepared for my Department in 2006.</P>
        <P>As it would not have been possible for the study to assess the impacts of the actual motor tax and VRT changes announced in budget 2008, it is necessary to update the estimate of the saving from these changes.  Factors which will be taken into account include the significant increase in car ownership in recent years, the average annual mileage of vehicles in Ireland, the rate of fleet renewal and the projected impact of the tax changes on purchasing patterns.  I have indicated that I will present updated figures where appropriate for relevant measures in the context of my annual report to the Oireachtas on the implementation of the national climate change strategy.  I envisage that this report will be ready by the end of April.</P>
        <P>I thank Deputies for their thoughtful and considered views and I look forward to further consideration of the issues on Committee Stage.</P>

        <P Just="Left">T&aacute; an-&aacute;thas agam an Bille seo a chur os comhair an T&iacute;.  The purpose of this legislation is to provide for the making of student grants to enable students to attend higher and further education courses.  The principal objective of the Bill is to create a more coherent system for the administration of these grants, which will facilitate consistency of application and improved client accessibility.  In brief, it will enable the development of an awards system that can deliver grants on time to those who need them most.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides the basis for more streamlined administrative procedures for the management of the student grant awarding process, following through on the commitment in the last programme for Government that the payment of maintenance grants would be provided for through a unified grants payment scheme.</P>
        <P>This Bill is essentially enabling legislation.  It provides for the structures around which an efficient and customer-friendly student grants process can be built, as well as providing the general basis on which students will, in future, be eligible for a grant to attend courses of higher and further education.</P>
        <P>The Bill is the cornerstone of a broader programme of legislative and administrative reform of student grants currently being undertaken by the Department of Education and Science.  In the first major modernisation of the grant schemes in this country since the introduction of the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act in 1968, this Bill paves the way for more modern and efficient arrangements, ensuring that students who apply for a grant will have their applications considered within an appropriate timeframe and that those students who are deemed eligible for support will receive payment in an efficient and timely manner.  The needs of students and their parents have been central to my Department&rsquo;s consideration in drafting this legislation.</P>
        <P>The Bill is the foundation stone for increased clarity, certainty and accessibility for students, their parents and for educational institutions.  It will support my overall objective of introducing service level improvements in the administration of the student grant schemes.  These will include guaranteed timeframes for more timely payment of grants and more efficient arrangements for handling applications and making payments.</P>
        <P>The publication of this Bill marks an important milestone in this process and will make a significant contribution to promoting greater equity of access to participation in further and higher education.  The student grant schemes are a central plank of our national strategy for equity of access to further and higher education and are currently supporting more than 56,000 students who attend further and higher education.  Eligible students who are attending approved full-time third level courses or approved post leaving certificate courses and who satisfy the prescribed conditions of the schemes with regard to age, residence, nationality, means and previous academic attainment are awarded grants.</P><Col N="228"/>
        <P>Student grants represent an important strategic investment in people, enabling individuals to achieve their full potential and thereby support a socially inclusive society, which enables us to substantially increase the pool of highly skilled and qualified graduates that this country needs to maintain its competitiveness and sustain its economic success.</P>
<?oasys _cl13.5- ?>
        <P>Major improvements have been made by the Government in both the income limits for eligibility and the actual grant levels for third level student support.  This includes the introduction of the special rate of maintenance grant.  For the current academic year 2007-08 the reckonable income limits for ordinary maintenance grants was increased by 3.5%.  This increase exceeds the increase in the average industrial wage for the September to September reference period.  The top limit for grant eligibility where there are less than four dependent children has been increased from &euro;46,700 to &euro;48,355, ensuring that a significantly higher number of students from households with moderate incomes will not have to pay the student service charge of &euro;825.  In addition, more than 13,300 students in receipt of the special rate of maintenance grant are benefiting from an even more substantial increase of over 14%. The higher rate of this grant is now at a record level of &euro;6,690 for the 2007-08 academic year, compared with just over &euro;2,000 in 1996-97.</P>
        <P>Financial barriers have long being recognised as a major disincentive for many students who wish to access third level education.  The significant increases in the ordinary rate of maintenance grant over recent years have made the third level option more affordable for a broad range of students and their families.  In approving even higher increases in the special rate of maintenance grant, we continue to further target that support at those most in need to encourage access to further and higher education for everyone.</P>
        <P>The ESF-aided student assistance fund, the fund for students with disabilities and the millennium partnership fund provide additional supports to students and have also contributed to greater levels of participation, as well as supporting retention in further and higher education.  In addition, the funding provided to institutions for access through core funding and, in recent times, through the strategic innovation fund, continue to support participation, retention and completion of studies by those groups who heretofore were under-represented at third level.</P>
        <P>The establishment of a dedicated office, the national office for equity of access to higher education, within the Higher Education Authority, HEA, was an important development in this area, giving it the profile it deserves.  This office, together with the access and disability officers in the third level institutions, local partnerships, community groups and student grant-awarding authorities, plays a vital role in ensuring the widest possible participation in further and higher education.</P>
        <P>The key objective of further and third level access programmes and initiatives is to encourage more young people and adults from disadvantaged schools and areas, mature students and students with disabilities to continue or re-engage with education.  However, research has shown in recent years that there can be knowledge deficits for many students, prospective students and their families regarding the maintenance grant schemes and associated financial support programmes.  My Department has undertaken a number of initiatives in recent years to raise awareness about student support.  I recently launched the <i>www.studentfinance.ie</i>  website, a comprehensive, user-friendly guide to student grants and supports in further and higher education.  The website, which is funded by my Department, is an initiative of the national access office of the HEA and provides information on the full range of student supports, including maintenance grants, the fund for students with disabilities, the back to education allowance and the student assistance fund.  This website, together with my plans to reform student grants, should make the financial support schemes more accessible to students and their parents.</P><Col N="229"/>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to supporting high rates of participation in third level education at all levels of society will ensure that Ireland continues to attract and maintain investment in high quality jobs and that the fruits of the economy can be enjoyed by all.</P>
        <P>Recent years have seen a remarkable improvement in the widening of participation, particularly at third level.  If we compare the educational profile of today&rsquo;s graduates to that of their grandparents, among the older generation, half of the population finished their education at primary level and two thirds had finished by intermediate certificate.  Only one in three completed the leaving certificate and as few as one in ten progressed to higher education.</P>
        <P>The introduction of free second level education by my predecessor, Deputy Donogh O&rsquo;Malley, in 1967 unlocked a huge appetite for learning within the Irish population and by the 1990s, the number of leaving certificate candidates had quadrupled.  This rapid expansion of second level opportunities was followed up with substantial investment in the development and expansion of higher education.</P>
        <P>The very substantial increase in the number of places at third level in the past 20 years was one of the critical cornerstones of our overall national economic strategy.  The availability and supply of substantial numbers of highly qualified graduates contributed significantly to Ireland&rsquo;s much improved economic circumstances.  This steady expansion in higher education opportunities is clearly reflected in the improving educational profile of our population over recent decades.  Full-time enrolments have grown from under 41,000 in 1980 to almost 140,000 today.  The entry rate to higher education has grown from 20% of 17 to 18 year olds in 1980 to a current rate of approximately 55%.</P>
        <P>The national development plan acknowledges that student grants are a major factor in encouraging these record levels of participation in higher education and, on that basis, encourages the development of a quality, user-friendly application and payment service for student grants.</P>
        <P>In planning the development of this important programme of legislative and administrative reform, my Department engaged in extensive consultations with key stakeholders.  These included the Union of Students in Ireland, the National Parents Council, the Irish Vocational Education Association, the County and City Managers Association, various social partners and Departments.  These consultations provided a basis for the development of the most logical and effective arrangements for the future structure and administration of the student grant schemes.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="5" />
      
        <P>The existing arrangements for administration of the grant schemes reflect the incremental and sector-based growth of higher and further education in Ireland.  Provision for local council-based scholarships goes back to the Irish Universities Act 1908, while the VEC-based schemes reflect the subsequent evolution of the technological and post-leaving certificate sectors.</P>
        <P>The case has been made for reform of the student grants system over a number of years.  In 2003, my Department published Supporting Equity of Access to Higher Education, which argued that the system needed to be overhauled because, due to the multiplicity of agents involved, it had become administratively inefficient and open to abuse.  It concluded that the system led to customer confusion and inconsistency of application, resulting regularly in the late payment of grants.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">The Bill provides a single statutory basis for all student grants, facilitating the development of a unified system of student support that will consolidate the four schemes for students attending both higher education and post leaving certificate courses into one simplified scheme.  The Bill gives effect to my decision to give sole responsibility for the administration of student grants to the VEC sector by designating the 33 VECs as the awarding authorities.  This will have the effect of halving the number of grant awarding authorities from 66 to 33.  The unification of the existing four schemes and the consolidation of the administration within the VEC sector will significantly simplify the range of <Col N="230"/>different grants and awarding authorities with which students must negotiate to apply for a grant.  At the same time, it will maintain a county-based approach through the network of VEC offices at local level.</P>
        <P>Experience has shown that students and parents benefit significantly from one-to-one assistance, particularly where they have difficulty completing application forms and securing the necessary supporting documentation.  While we aim to move progressively towards an on-line applications facility, the accessibility and support provided by staff in local VEC offices will continue to underpin equity of access to higher education.</P>
        <P>Given the need for efficiency of service and for consistency of delivery across all 33 VECs, I am pleased to say that the sector is actively engaging with my Department in developing corporate responses to particular areas of service provision, including computer systems development.  The VEC sector brings with it a distinct and rich educational tradition and a valuable experience in administering three of the four existing student grant schemes.  I am confident that the Bill will provide a sound basis on which it can ensure the efficient delivery of a fair and equitable grants system.</P>
        <P>The local authority sector, which has played a critical role over the years in giving thousands of young people the opportunity to pursue higher education through the higher education grants scheme, will continue to play an essential part during a transition period for those students in receipt of grants under the scheme.  While section 7 of the Bill will repeal the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, it provides for the continuation of grants awarded under the existing schemes until the grant holders have completed their current courses of study.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for the funding of awarding authorities and sets out the functions of the VECs in this regard.  The Bill also provides the VECs with the necessary legislative framework to enable them to carry out their functions in an effective manner and to ensure that the appropriate mechanisms are in place to ensure that student grants go to those who need them, as well as providing for a robustness in the system to guard against fraudulent claims.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for periodic audits and inspections of awarding authorities to ensure that they are carrying out their functions effectively.  It also provides the power to transfer the functions of an awarding authority in circumstances where a VEC is not performing its duties in an effective and appropriate manner.  The Bill provides for the making of regulations in respect of applications, which will include requirements to give notice of decisions within a prescribed period.  This will increase clarity, accessibility and certainty for students and support measurable service level improvements in the administration of the grants.  This will enable guaranteed timeframes for the earlier payment of grants and more efficient arrangements for handling applications and making payments.</P>
        <P>To protect the taxpayer and students whose need is genuine and who qualify for the grant, the Bill proposes a strengthening of the process whereby fraudulent claims can now be vigorously pursued by awarding authorities.  It will give them a specific power of inquiry that provides a firm basis to pursue those who have provided false or incomplete information to qualify for a grant.  It also provides for substantial offences and penalties and enables the recovery of debt in such circumstances.</P>
        <P>Given the important data protection issues inherent in a system that requires means testing of applicants, the Bill provides for the sharing of personal information on a specific basis to verify details supplied as part of the application process and related matters.  The Bill also sets out certain responsibilities for students and their parents or spouses.  It requires applications to be made within specified timeframes.  It provides that the awarding authority may require <Col N="231"/>applicants to produce evidence and information in a form acceptable to the awarding authority in order to enable it to make a decision on a grant.  The Bill imposes a duty on applicants to notify an awarding authority of a change in circumstances and provides the awarding authority with the power to seek such information as it considers appropriate for the purposes of establishing whether a student remains eligible for a grant.</P>
        <P>My Department is actively engaged with the VEC sector through a number of technical working groups with a view to streamlining the application process.  The aim is to make the process more user friendly and easier to understand, enabling applicants to meet their obligations to facilitate prompt processing of their grant applications.</P>
        <P>Section 8 sets out a number of educational institutions that are deemed to be approved institutions for the purposes of the grant scheme.  It deems publicly funded institutions outside the State, but within the EU, to be approved institutions.  It allows the Minister to prescribe higher education institutions within the State to be approved institutions and sets out a number of matters the Minister will have regard to in making such a determination, including the availability of resources.  The Bill empowers the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to prescribe additional third level institutions in the State, subject to principles and policies set down in the Bill.  While these principles and policies do not necessarily preclude consideration of private commercial colleges, it is not envisaged at this point that the schemes will be extended to such institutions.</P>
        <P>Section 9 provides that, for a course to be deemed an approved course, it must be full-time and take place in an approved institution.  The Bill sets out the matters to which the Minister shall have regard for the purposes of prescribing a course, including the nature and level of the qualification to be awarded to the student on completion of the course, the educational institution that provides the course and whether it leads to a higher education and training award or a further education and training award.  Included in the factors that can be considered in making a decision to approve a course is whether it is recognised through the national framework of qualifications.  This will support the principle of progression and encourage institutions to have adequate recognition procedures in place.</P>
        <P>While the Bill limits the approval of postgraduate courses to courses within the State, it enables me to maintain the existing supports for postgraduate students studying in Northern Ireland where I am satisfied that this is necessary and has regard to the relevant purposes set out in the Bill.</P>
        <P>In setting out the general residence requirement for a maintenance grant, the Bill will provide for a more demanding residence requirement within the State of three out of the past five years.  The current residence requirement is one year.  This significant increase is designed to ensure that those applying for a maintenance grant will have a more established linkage with and integration into the State, a concept recognised in EU law.  The increase in the residence requirement is also designed to obviate the risk of &ldquo;grant tourism&rdquo;.  Ireland&rsquo;s current one-year residence requirement is one of the most liberal in Europe.  University courses provided in English are particularly attractive and our near neighbours in England, Scotland and the North impose a three-year residence requirement.</P>
        <P>In addition, the residence requirement will now need to be met by students in all cases.  Currently in the case of dependent students, only the parents are required to meet the residence requirement.  This requirement provides a reasonable approach, requiring the student to demonstrate a genuine link or degree of integration into Irish society in order to qualify for assistance for maintenance costs.  However, the requirement for three of the past five years takes cognisance of students who may wish to take time out to travel or work outside the State.  These students can still meet the residency requirement if they have not been outside the State <Col N="232"/>for more than two years, allowing a reasonable degree of flexibility.  The Bill provides for temporary absences for the purposes of study or postgraduate research in the EU in certain circumstances.</P>
        <P>The new arrangements will simplify matters for students who change addresses within the State.  Deputies will be aware that the requirement for prior residence in the administrative area of an awarding authority has given rise to much confusion.  It has resulted in a cumbersome process of transferring application forms between awarding authorities, losing valuable processing time.  This situation will be alleviated in the new arrangement.</P>
        <P>The Bill also sets out the nationality requirements that students must meet in order to qualify for a grant.  It sets out certain categories of persons who are entitled to benefit from student grants, subject to the other terms and conditions of the schemes.  It provides the Minister with the power to prescribe other categories of non-nationals that will be eligible for student support.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of a scheme of grants that will be set out by the Minister by way of regulation, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The regulations for the scheme will govern the classes of grants, the categories of applicants and a range of eligibility criteria, including income.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for the making of regulations for different categories of student, enabling the continuation of the recognition currently given to mature students.  It also provides for the making of regulations in relation to independent students.  This will enable me to address in regulations, if resources permit and if there are compelling reasons for doing so, the current situation whereby all students who are under 23 years of age must be assessed with reference to their parents&rsquo; income, although they may have been living independently, have their own spouse or families and have been self-supporting for a number of years.</P>
        <P>Deputies will be aware that a significant number of third level students move out of their homes to go to college and continue to be supported by their parents.  The purpose of the student grant schemes is to provide additional assistance where parental income is below a certain threshold or, in the case of independent mature students, where the level of income of the student and his or her spouse warrants additional assistance by way of a grant.</P>
        <P>Therefore, any extension of the provision of assessment as an independent student will have to be carefully considered to ensure it is highly targeted to very specific circumstances where students can demonstrate that they have been genuinely self-supporting and living independently for a number of years.  The Deputies will appreciate that it would be untenable to have a situation whereby all students could simply move out of their parental homes and be deemed to be independent for grants purposes.  This would have very significant implications for the student grants budget and would further disadvantage those who need the grant most.</P>
        <P>The Bill breaks new ground in providing for the introduction of an independent appeals board.  This will bring greater transparency into the grant-awarding process and provide students, for the first time, with a formal and independent avenue of appeal.  The Bill also provides for an internal appeal in the first instance within the VEC and sets out maximum timeframes within which appeals must be processed.</P>
<?oasys _cl13.5- ?>
        <P>The Bill further affirms and supports the Government&rsquo;s policy to increase access to further and higher education for under represented groups by requiring the preparation and implementation of access plans and equality policies in approved institutions in the State, where these plans and policies are not already required under other legislation.</P><Col N="233"/>
        <P>Given the extent and importance of the student grant schemes, it is vital to ensure that the transition to a new unified scheme and system of administration is carefully planned and executed to ensure that the receipt of over &euro;240 million in grants by over 56,000 students is not compromised or unduly delayed.  Obviously, the changes in the eligibility requirements and the new administrative arrangements will only apply to new entrants to the grant scheme following the commencement of the Act.</P>
        <P>It is currently estimated that commencement may allow for the new scheme to come into operation for the 2009-2010 academic year.  However, my primary objective is to ensure that the transition is properly effected with the minimum of disruption for students.  The Department is currently developing an overall project implementation plan in consultation with the stakeholders.</P>
        <P>In order to ensure adequate notice to potential applicants, my officials will be working with the National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education, at national level, and with the VECs, at local level, to develop a targeted information campaign that will be rolled out with the introduction of the new scheme.</P>
        <P>I want to ensure a smooth transition to the new arrangements and, in this regard, I intend to continue the existing arrangements for the 2008-2009 academic year.  This will involve the continued co-operation of the local authorities in processing applications under the higher education grants scheme.  It will also allow some time for the development of the necessary infrastructure in the VEC sector with a view to implementing a fully integrated scheme under the Act in the following year without significant disruption to students.</P>
        <P>Although 2008 and 2009 will be a transition period in which the existing arrangements will continue to apply, I hope to be in a position very shortly to announce more immediate service level improvements by publishing the student grant schemes for the coming academic year some months ahead of their publication in previous years.  I am pleased to advise that the application forms for the 2008-2009 academic year are available on the Department&rsquo;s website for information purposes and hard copies will be available in local authorities and VECs within the next week.</P>
        <P>My core objective in implementing change is to enable improvements in the services provided to the 56,000 students in receipt of grants and to those potential students, currently at second level or mature students, who are considering their future options.  I know the Deputies will agree with me regarding the very positive aspects of this Bill and I look forward to listening to the views of the Members of the House and debating the various provisions of the Bill.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker><!--Fix-->
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Members on this side of the House welcome the publication of this Bill, although it is fair to say it has been a long time in the offing.  By my account, 17 specific promises relating to this publication were given by the Minister in advance of the last general election and there was an expectation that, had the Bill been enacted earlier, the new measures the Minister is proposing could have applied to this academic year.  She has now confirmed to the House that there is, effectively, no chance that these new arrangements will be in place until the 2009-2010 academic year, at the earliest, and this is a great pity.  The real losers are students.</P>
        <P>I am a member of the Joint Committee on Education and Science and I will ask, before we approach Committee Stage, that it take hearings from all of the interested parties the Minister has met.  I appreciate the fact that she has held these consultations but I think such hearings would be useful, for the committee, to ensure we are all in agreement.  This will be our only chance to get this matter right for the years ahead so it is right and proper that the views of all interested bodies, including student bodies and so on, be on the record.  They should submit <Col N="234"/>their views to the committee in advance of Committee Stage to let us know if deficiencies exist in the Bill and whether certain amendments will be needed.  This Bill is long overdue but we have an opportunity to make it work.</P>
        <P>The current system is shambolic because, as the Minister rightly told the House, there are four separate schemes operated by 66 different bodies, which makes a mockery of the system.  I was interested to read comments made last year by Aontas asserting that 24% of the complaints it received related to adult learners trying to access information and clarity on grants.  A great deal of work needs to be done to streamline this process, make it clearer for all and ensure that responsibility to deliver the new grants structure in an open and transparent way rests with the VEC sector.</P>
        <P>Applying for a student&rsquo;s grant is a notorious form-filling exercise and one would need an award in solving Rubik&rsquo;s cubes to understand all aspects of the area.  Parents and students have found the constant filling of forms to be a real issue in recent years because one would need a PhD to understand them in some cases.  I understand that these schemes are income related and that there must be accuracy in this regard, but we must streamline the process and this starts with the publication of this Bill.</P>
        <P>A big problem facing students is the late payment of the third level maintenance grant, although the Minister is not at fault in this respect.  That a student can receive payment of a grant three months after applying for it with his or her local authority is completely unacceptable.  Many such students are in poor financial straits and should not receive such service.  I was glad to hear the Minister say she will publish service level agreements so we will know exactly where we stand and the responsibilities of the new bodies that will make these payments.</P>
        <P>It is fair to say there has been an attitude abroad that anything will do for students &mdash; they were seen as the last part of dealing with customers in terms of a local authority.  That has to change.  People should not underestimate the importance of these grants, particularly for students from low-income backgrounds.  These grants are the reason many of those students can go to and sustain themselves in college.  It is fair to say that in recent years there has been an improvement in the total amount allocated to student participation and to student support in college.  However, we must do more because our grants are very low in comparison to other EU countries and it is a matter to which students regularly allude.</P>
        <P>I will give some examples of the difficulties students face in trying to access existing grants.  In the course of her contribution, the Minister put one on the record.  There is the nonsensical idea that if one is 23 years of age, one is ultimately a dependant of one&rsquo;s mother and father, despite the fact that one could have a child or two or be in employment.  This appears absolutely ridiculous to many young parents who want to access and remain in college, yet they are viewed solely as a dependant in terms of their parents&rsquo; income.  I welcome what the Minister said about that today, that there is greater flexibility in the Bill to deal with that issue, because this matter needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>A great scandal is the case I came across in my constituency only the other evening.  A young student in first year in UCD has just got a bill for &euro;6,500 because his parents have come to Ireland but have not been granted leave to remain.  That student is not an Irish citizen.  While the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is attempting to resolve his status here and the status of his parents, we will not recognise the payment of tuition fees to that student and so he is being lumbered with a bill for &euro;6,500 that he and his family will have to pay, plus the fact that he cannot obtain a third level grant through the maintenance grants structure.  That issue needs to be addressed in the Bill.</P><Col N="235"/>
        <P>If an Irish student is effectively having his or her residency determined over a long period, he or she goes through post-primary education, is here for a number of years and ends up in college.  At the very least we should be able to deliver for that student the same support and fees enjoyed by everyone else.  I do not blame the Department of Education and Science because the problem lies with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and its failure to rectify the situation for that particular student.  Such cases are becoming a real issue.  Some of the brightest young people here are going to college and finding their path to education frustrated by the failure of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to regularise their situation and that of their parents.  Ultimately, the Department of Education and Science has to pick it up.</P>
        <P>Desperate poverty traps exist within the system of top-up grants for adult learners, a situation that was brought to my attention and that of Deputy Quinn at a recent Aontas conference.  A student who went back to college could not get the top-up grant because he was working in the previous year.  However, had that same individual been unemployed, or left work, he would have been entitled to a top-up grant.  The whole system is chaotic and riddled by the type of poverty traps many of us know from the social welfare system that need to be rectified, if not in this Bill, certainly in a codified way in terms of dealing with social welfare and the Department of Education and Science.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that we are moving to the 30 or so separate bodies, the VECs, which will deliver the third level maintenance grant and the other three grants to which the Minister referred.  It is crucially important that we get consistency across the VEC sector.  That is why I welcome the fact that the Minister will soon publish the service level agreements.  It is important there is a unified system and that it is enforced consistently across every VEC.  I do not want one VEC taking a progressive position and others refusing to implement the spirit of the law.  When the Act is in place, following improvements on Committee and Report Stages, it is crucial that the House and the Department are prepared to monitor performance to ensure that consistency.</P>
        <P>The VEC sector has experience and personnel to deal with such issues.  It deals with a whole range of educational issues from post-primary education to adult education, and soon primary education in the context of the Minister&rsquo;s new announcements in Dublin.  The VECs have a range of experience which will help them.  Will the Minister say whether it is the intention of the VEC to employ new staff, because these will be vastly increased units, or will existing staff from local authorities move to the VECs to take up the new positions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>That is two hopes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Bob Hope is one of them.  What is the position?  The Minister needs to put that on the record because we will be asking the VECs to take up the cudgel and enforce the new grants, but will we give them the funding required to deal with delivering the letter and the spirit of the Bill?</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is proposing an independent appeals board.  This is a matter that can be teased out on Committee Stage.   We need student involvement on those appeal boards.  If there are to be local appeal boards in place and if they have to adjudicate on applications which are grey, it is crucial that students, through the Union of Students in Ireland, be part and parcel of that process because they bring a perspective and an urgency that does not exist.  If the Minister is modelling the new appeals system on, say, the social welfare appeals system, I would hope there would be clear commitments within the appeal boards on the minimum period within which each individual application would have to be determined.  That is really important.</P><Col N="236"/>
        <P>One section of the Bill deals with access plans by colleges.  This is one area where colleges have done very little in terms of encouraging children from disadvantaged backgrounds into college.  There is no consistency in this regard.  Some of the most prominent third level institutions have given scant regard to access plans as a means of encouraging and helping children from disadvantaged backgrounds into college and higher education.  We should almost make it conditional for funding from the State that the third level sector and specifically colleges within that sector would have much higher regard for access plans for students in that area.  That is an issue to which we need to return.</P>
        <P>I have said on numerous occasions since I got this job that one of the great scandals is that if one is of an age where one leaves school and does not go on to higher education, but takes up particular jobs in the labour force, and one decides at some stage in the future to go to college, barriers are put in one&rsquo;s way.  There is no policy for helping those who want to go to third level.  I have long held the view that every citizen in the Republic should have at his or her disposal an opportunity to access higher level education at any time in their life, be they 20, 40 or 60.  We have to get away from the notion that education is for people between five and 21 years of age.  If one does not fit into that category at present, barriers are put in one&rsquo;s way.  As I said recently at the Aontas conference, it is crucial that we are prepared to make that shift in policy to introduce, effectively, an education credit for every citizen that they can tap into and use at some point in their life if the opportunity exists.</P>
        <P>It is also fair to say that the student support system we have in place makes a huge difference to whether people stay in college.  The Minister is aware of the dropout rate that exists within colleges &mdash; I have heard her mention it on numerous occasions.  One of the ways to address the issue is by having proper supports and financial packages within the system to encourage students to remain in college.</P>
        <P>The Minister is correct when she suggests one of the key drivers of our economy in the past 15 years or so has been the increased participation rates in higher level education, in which we should all take great pride.  She is also correct in stating there has been an increase in participation in all of the income groups.  However, the kernel is that among lower income groups and disadvantaged sections of our society we still have not seen that modal shift in terms of providing increasing access and participation in college, a matter to which we must return.  The number of people going to college is increasing exponentially, which is fantastic, but the growth rate is among middle and higher income earners, not among people from lower income backgrounds.  One of the ways we can deal with this issue is through proper student support.  Until we do so, we will not have reached the potential that exists for everyone in this society.</P>
        <P>Student support is one of the ways to achieve this but the other aspect is a mentoring programme and actual help.  One of the sorriest cases I dealt with in my constituency clinic involved a young lady from a very difficult part of the constituency, who told me the reason she was dropping out of college was not related to money or support or fees, but to the fact that her friends had begun to ignore her because they were not in college and she was.  One of the great ways to encourage people to go to college and remain there is not just through family expectation, but through peer group expectation and a support system for students, which is often as important as the financial supports we put in place.  We must proof every proposal, idea and decision we make with regard to third level education in terms of looking at it from the perspective of a young person from a disadvantaged background, and we must ask whether they have the supports they need to remain there.  These are the important reasons people go to and remain in higher level education.</P>
        <P>With those words in mind, I welcome the Bill, although I wish it had been introduced earlier.  I will work with the Minister and other colleagues to ensure we improve the Bill on Committee <Col N="237"/>Stage and Report Stage so the new legislation that is put in place will last for a considerable period.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise to the House and the Minister for not being present when the Bill arrived a bit sooner than all of us had anticipated.  I was at another meeting at the time.</P>
        <P>While the Bill is clearly overdue, it is nonetheless very welcome and is particularly to be welcomed by the people who will be directly affected by it, the 56,000 students and their parents and families.  In many cases, they have had to carry the burden of subsidising or providing bridging loans or advance cash payments because of the delay in the way the system functions.</P>
        <P>At the outset I wish to put some matters in context.  The Minister very generously, courageously and correctly recognised the wisdom and foresight of Donough O&rsquo;Malley in abolishing second level fees in 1967, without reference, it should be said, to the Department of Finance, as the history now shows.  She could have continued that spirit of generosity in recognising a former constituency colleague of hers, Niamh Bhreathnach, who did precisely the same for third level fees, but this time with the full support and enthusiastic encouragement of the then Minister for Finance, who happened to be myself.</P>
        <P>The Minister may recall the measure was criticised at the time as not being equitable and one which would not improve access to universities.  The Minister&rsquo;s figures indicate this is not the case.  Equity in access to third level education probably begins at pre-school level.  All the indications suggest that children getting those two or three extra years from age three to five, and then getting a supportive environment at home, where learning to read transforms itself into reading to learn and takes off from the age of 12 or so, will perform better.</P>
        <P>This morning I attended the conference which the Minister attended this afternoon.  The presentations from the National Education Welfare Board indicated that by the time many students get to transition year and have gone through the junior certificate, their path in terms of participation in third level education is pretty well determined.  The consensus of the excellent and professional contributions made by a Canadian and two English contributors were that Ireland&rsquo;s 20% dropout rate, or rate of failure to continue to participate, is, on the scale of the PISA analysis, a reasonably acceptable one.  It is not acceptable to us as we can all do better but in comparison to many other countries with a longer tradition and a stronger economy going back in history, our position is quite good.</P>
        <P>With a 20% dropout rate occurring in second year or third year, the issue of free fees for third level students was never about access in the first instance but about equity, given that some parents could fiddle their accounts and get grants, or afford to pay fees in one way or another, or leverage their independent wealth or wealth from the family business or farm, and ensure they could afford the fees for their children to go to college and the support required after that.  Secondary school fees were, by today&rsquo;s standards, a fraction of what they are now for those 56 schools that still have them because the Christian Brothers and the teaching orders, male and female, by and large gave us free management, time and 24-7 cover in the schools, which the Department of Finance and the Department of Education and Science never factored in.  This is one of the reasons the voluntary free sector is now having difficulties in regard to its financing.</P>
        <P>Before we move on to discuss the grants support system for third level students who qualify, it is essential from my perspective that the role of the Labour Party, in particular Niamh Bhreathnach, would be recognised in the same spirit as that of Donough O&rsquo;Malley.</P>
        <P>The Bill has been a long time coming.  From reading it and listening to the Minister&rsquo;s exposition, it reeks of a God almighty turf war between the Department of Education and Science, the local authorities and the VECs, and a certain belt and braces approach with regard to giving herself a double-barrel shotgun if some VECs do not perform.  The Bill proposes a <Col N="238"/>unified grants system and elimination of the three different types of grants for various courses.  It also proposes that the number of awarding bodies be halved from 66 to 33, which is still an enormous figure for a country this size.  When one considers these bodies are related to counties and not divided by the population, this means there is one awarding body for the whole of County Leitrim and all its 28,000 souls.  How many of them will qualify to go to third level education and how many will apply for grants, although I suppose in the old days they all would have applied for grants?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is actually one of the highest in the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, and there is a good historical reason as to why that is the case.  I will come back to some of the points made by Deputy Brian Hayes with regard to the dropout rates among people coming from backgrounds where there is no culture of third level education.  In the smallest of farms in the most barren places of the west and rural Ireland, there was a value put on and a sustained support for education because it was recognised for what it was, and people were sustained in staying in college no matter how alien it might have appeared to somebody coming from a rural area 15 or 20 years ago.  Coming from the centre of Ringsend, it is much more frightening to travel the 3 km to UCD than it is to travel 65 km to Galway, Sligo or wherever else.</P>
        <P>As I said, the number of bodies has been reduced to 33.  The VECs will take over the awarding of all grants while the local authorities lose the role they hitherto had in administering the scheme.  Has some section of this non-joined up Government calculated the impact of this measure in terms of the staff release to the local authorities and what will be the bonus and benefit of this measure?  Effectively, the Minister is now reducing the administrative staff by 50% to administer in principle the same number of grants.</P>
        <P>Another provision of the Bill is the quality control check.  The Minister can order a review of an awarding authority&rsquo;s performance in terms of effectively issuing grants or implementing other parts of the Act.  The Minister can also order an awarding authority to lose its power to issue grants for two years as punishment.  God love the person who wrote that.  If the same degree of courage is exercised by civil servants in regard to performance-related pay awards at middle management level in the Civil Service, as displayed in regard to this issue, we will never see a VEC sanctioned or punished for failure to perform.  The backbenchers in Fianna F&aacute;il or of whatever party is in office will be the first to say one cannot take these powers away from the local VEC and that they could not afford to lose it.  I recall the kind of political muscle exercised by the VECs in regard to the Education Bill 1996 that became the Education Act 1998.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle might have some memories of that battle himself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I could not possibly comment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that students must have been resident in Ireland for three of the past five years.  There is a flexibility and a practicality in that regard.  I question, however, why this provision has to be put into primary legislation.  There is much rigidity in administrative terms in this legislation, which we will get to in some detail on Committee Stage.  Perhaps the Minister can reflect on this aspect.  By all means she can assert the principle in the primary legislation, because it is right to do so, and I endorse the reference made by the Minister.  However, some flexibility would be welcome, such as the power to vary that with the belt and braces of having to bring the regulation before the House for it to be specifically voted upon.  The Minister knows how difficult it is to get legislation to the floor of this House or to get it passed and it is perhaps unwise for her to lock herself so tightly into a statutory system in this manner.</P><Col N="239"/>
        <P>When means testing candidates, a distinction between &ldquo;independent&rdquo; and &ldquo;dependent&rdquo; students is made in terms of assessing incomes.  That is to be welcomed.  I got married at 23 years of age, albeit perhaps on my third salary cheque, which was not the wisest investment at one level.  There are so many people on different scales.  The 23 year cut-off point is rightly being replaced with the distinction between dependent and independent.</P>
        <P>In the context of the Good Friday or the Belfast Agreement I welcome the recognition of the Northern Irish dimension.  Would that we could recognise qualified Northern Irish school teachers who come from the Unionist tradition and do not have the facility to learn honours Irish, but that is sc&eacute;al fada for another day.  The logic of recognising that and moving in this direction is that somebody from Banbridge, or from Dr. Paisley&rsquo;s home town of Ballymena from the Unionist side, could in fact aspire to, without having to learn Irish which they would find difficult, becoming a permanent and pensionable INTO teacher just like anybody else, especially somebody coming from the Irish nationalist tradition.</P>
        <P>The Bill standardises the information required on an application form for a grant to all awarding authorities.  I welcome the introduction of fines and imprisonment as penalties for falsified grant applications.  The benefits of the Bill are as follows.  A large reduction in the number of authorities issuing grants and a general streamlining of administration will come if the Bill is enacted in its current form.  Thus, within each county division, students will experience less confusion regarding where to apply and for what grant.  The creation of one grant rather than three and a standardised application form will also reduce confusion.</P>
        <P>The establishment of an appeals process for applicants refused a grant ensures transparency and accountability for the individual student.  I support the observation made by Deputy Brian Hayes in regard to engaging and involving students in this process.  The demand for student representation on governing boards of universities in the heyday of the 1960s gave rise to the fear that the pillars of Earlsfort Terrace would collapse with such a radical move.  Sadly, most of the student representatives who subsequently went on to the governing boards&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Became the pillars.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;were more conservative than the older people around the table.  That is something which perhaps we can discuss on another day.  Students are responsible people who make lifestyle decisions of one kind or another and it is a proper way to integrate people into the system who get involved in active student politics and student union representation so they can take responsibility for their own age group and peer group, some of whom if they go through this process and have gone off-side will be seen to have done so.</P>
        <P>There are some problems with the Bill which I will outline.  The Minister may consider responding to these points at the end of Second Stage or on Committee Stage as, in many cases, amendments will be tabled in regard to them.</P>
        <P>Further streamlining of the grants system is possible.  While the actual schemes for the various grants will be unified into one, the same cannot be said for the number of authorities issuing them.  A reduction from 66 authorities to 33 is a rationalisation, albeit a conservative one.  The Bill specifically &ldquo;requires attendance by a student on a full-time basis&rdquo; in section 9(1)(<i>b</i>).  This rules out any possibility of the grant system being applied to part-time students in higher education.  Why does the Minister have to bolt that door so tightly closed in primary legislation?  I invite her to consider the possibility of varying her approach.</P>
        <P>I accept the Department of Finance would probably not let the Minister change it on her own but she could leave it for a successor of hers to have the possibility of doing that with the agreement of both Houses by way of a motion brought before the House so that it has democratic scrutiny and we do not lock in a rigidity we do not need.  I accept that the Minister has indicated the money is not there for the abolition of part-time fees for students.</P><Col N="240"/>
        <P>Both the Minister and her predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, are on record as saying they would have liked to see the reintroduction of fees but they realised that their political popularity is such that it would not be possible.  I do not hold my breath over the implementation of the abolition of part-time fees and the provision of grants for part-time students but another day may come and another Administration may be in office when we want or need to have that flexibility.  Therefore, since we are unlikely to be around this block again for a long time, it would be sensible and prudent to provide for setting the standards that are set out in the Bill &mdash; I do not challenge them as they reflect the political reality of today &mdash; but some degree of creative flexibility with democratic safeguards for both Houses could enable a successor of the Minister&rsquo;s to examine the possibility of providing grants in some shape or form for students doing some part-time courses.  We may very well need it in terms of labour market flexibility to encourage people to move sideways from one sector of a declining economy into a sector that is growing or developing to facilitate that movement to enable the cost of their upskilling and upgrading to be facilitated by the provision of grants on top of redundancy payments and other entitlements.</P>
        <P>I previously referred to the more demanding residency requirement in the Bill but I accept the harmonisation that is proposed, given the cultural proximity of the four nations on these two islands.  Harmonisation to avoid tourism shopping, to which the Minister referred, is something that should be examined on a continuous basis.  Again, flexibility in the drafting of the legislation should be examined.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In concert with what Deputy Brian Hayes stated, the appeals procedure must produce a speedy outcome, particularly as the beginning of college for students each year is an especially costly and stressful period.  Section 15(7) should include a limit on the time an awarding authority has to inform an applicant that his or her claim has been turned down.  We are in some ways caught by the sequence of the sitting of the leaving certificate examination, the outcome of the results in August and then the first round of CAO offers followed by the second round of offers.  Some colleges start in September and some people do not know whether they will get into college until very close to the commencement of the courses, which can give rise to cash flow problems.  This problem should not be aggravated by an interminable period for decisions in the first instance followed by appeals.  However, I recognise the practical constraints there.  I support the system the Minister is putting in place and the possibility for the appeals board.</P>
        <P>In terms of analysis, this Bill is a progressive reform of the grants system and for that it is to be welcomed.  Yet in several respects it does not go far enough to overcome many of the problems from which the system suffers.  The rationalisation of the grants system from 66 bodies to 33 is a step in the right direction but leaves several unresolved issues.  The 2003 report, Supporting Equity in Higher Education stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The introduction of a unified scheme will require reform of the current arrangements involving administration of the existing schemes by 33 local authorities and 33 Vocational Education Committees.  It is considered that administering the grants schemes through such a large number of individual agencies results in unnecessary duplication, client confusion and a greater administrative burden for the Department of Education and Science.  Given the need to consolidate the schemes, to introduce more sophisticated means testing arrangements and to ensure consistency of application and client accessibility, the most appropriate delivery structure for student supports now needs to be determined.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Student Support Bill, while addressing this issue, only does so in a half-hearted manner.  Having some 33 bodies managing the grants system is fraught with danger and the Minister has recognised that in her Bill by taking out a provision to bring them into line if they go offside.</P><Col N="241"/>
        <P>Inconsistency in the payment of grants is a major flaw in the system.  Some authorities pay out quickly, while others do not.  It is not essential for there to be an awarding authority in every county, but students who rely on grants to fund their education need a swift and efficient response from the bureaucracy which manages it.  This should be the overwhelming priority with the Student Support Bill.  Grants are first and foremost a public service, one which needs to be flexible and responsive.  Due to the degree of similarity with the <i>status quo</i>, one wonders if the efficiency of the service will improve considerably under this Bill.  That may be in part behind the delay in the drafting of this piece of legislation.  Clearly it is the product of much debate in the Department.</P>
        <P>It is pertinent to note that the Labour Party&rsquo;s official stance in the last general election and in our manifesto was support for complete centralisation of the grants system within the Department of Social and Family affairs.  This is the best option if one takes the logic of rationalisation to its ultimate conclusion.  The USI supports this proposition.  This must have been debated within the Department and I would be interested on Committee Stage to hear the rationale for the decision the Minister and her Department made in this area.  It has the added advantage that the Department of Social and Family Affairs is equipped with the staff and data to assess, means test and examine the identification and verification of family circumstances, etc.  One wonders why we are moving to compromise by changing from 66 bodies to an uneven 33 while a good, user-friendly system is in place across the country.  It has been reformed over many years by successive Ministers and by decentralisation, which has helped make the system more user-friendly and effective.  One wonders why this existing, up and running, first class system of administration is being ignored while the Minister&rsquo;s legislation recognises some VECs are not up to the mark in efficiency of administration.  We would like the Minister to examine this area.  Rather than reaching this conclusion of centralisation, the Department of Education and Science is relying on the, admittedly powerful, threat of removing an awarding authority&rsquo;s power to issue grants as a tool to ensure greater efficiency.  As I said earlier, the Bill continues to exclude part-time students from availing of the grant system.  Given that the Government has already spoken about this, I wonder why the Minister is putting this into primary legislation in such a hard way.</P>
        <P>Means testing has been debated in the past and while there must be a grant system related to household income because it is focused and targeted, there is great dissatisfaction with it in many parts of the country.  Former Deputy John Ryan from North Tipperary described how PAYE workers in creameries in the county of the Minister&rsquo;s origin and birth watched farmers&rsquo; children getting grants to go to university for which they could not qualify because they were over the so-called limit.  While they were over the taxpayers&rsquo; limit in terms of a verifiable PAYE income, farmers with creative accountants, to whom we have had access recently in various fora around the country, were able to manipulate and control their income so that a student qualified for a college grant.  I am not saying farmers were rich.  We know they were not and that the majority of them have income difficulties.  However, they had the discretion to manipulate their incomes through accountants in such a way that it was never seriously challenged by the local authorities or the political infrastructure.</P>
        <P>I do not know whether the setting of the mechanism for means testing, as distinct from the volume of the grant, is part of the Minister&rsquo;s remit.  She will establish the threshold whereby a person in a household with a number of dependants will be deemed to qualify for a grant either in whole or in part.  Not just farmers but the self-employed with small businesses and professionals had the same capacity to manipulate their household income to qualify for the grant.  Now is the time to deal with that legacy from a different time.  When the Minister replies to this debate she might speak about that if she is in a position to do so.  Access to the grant system should be equitable.  In my travels around the country I have encountered anger in small towns where lifestyles were known if not guessed at and there was a perception of <Col N="242"/>inequity between one person who got a college grant and one down the road who did not.  That fuels an anger and lack of social cohesion in a society which we need.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Before I move the adjournment I will refer to the Minister&rsquo;s reference to access and a comment I made earlier.  Part of ensuring students who get grants stay in college is a welfare mentoring supportive system, which some colleges do well and others do not.  There is an uneven attitude to it in the various colleges of the HEA and we have yet to examine the way the new institutes of technology under the umbrella of the HEA look after this aspect of education.  It is a well-established statistical figure that many students who go to the seven universities, the institutes of technology or NCAD come from families or backgrounds where there has been an experience of third level education or their school friends go with them so they do not have the kind of example to which Deputy Hayes referred.  When Professor Tom Collins was director of Dundalk Institute of Technology, he talked about the fall-out rate of students who were brilliant in the classroom but floundered socially because they were outside the support mechanism and system of a third level college where people had to be independent, think for themselves and take responsibility for their courses.  It was not part of the family experience.  In some cases they were the first in their families to go to a third level college and their parents did not have the experience to support it.  In her reply, the Minister might look at the overall support for universities and suggest a requirement that they recognise the wider social gap and deal with it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Some time ago Fine Gael decided to commit Private Members&rsquo; business this week to debating the importance of making high speed broadband available across the country and the challenge to the Government of making that happen.  The vital importance and potential of an advanced broadband infrastructure in Ireland is underestimated by many, including some politicians and policy makers.  If we do nothing else this week, I hope we can instil an increased sense of urgency to the broadband debate and a recognition that what is needed now are definitive actions from the Government to facilitate, encourage and where appropriate force the pace of rolling out what has become known as next generation broadband in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I had hoped to be able to achieve a consensus with the Government parties on this motion.  It would have been a strong and positive signal from this House if we could have agreed a clear wording on the importance and urgency of creating a modern broadband infrastructure, and an agreed set of initial actions to achieve that aim.  That is exactly what my motion is trying to do.  It would have been a particularly strong statement of intent, considering the kind of partisan politics that has recently been forced on this House by the actions and statements of the Taoiseach.  However, the Minister and his Department have decided not to go down the road less travelled,  presumably out of a fear of conceding that problems exist and of committing to set achievable targets on broadband penetration, price and speed in Ireland.</P>
        <P>This Fine Gael motion is a little long, but that is because there are many strands to the issue.  The text and proposed actions are not particularly controversial, they are not party political at all, and they are not even directly critical of the Government&rsquo;s performance &mdash; and God knows there is no shortage of ammunition to do that.  This motion is simply a factual assessment of where Ireland is at in terms of broadband infrastructure.  It is a recognition of the vital need for high-speed affordable connectivity and it contains, most importantly, a set of proposed defined actions to move us in the right direction.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to reconsider the Government&rsquo;s approach.  Anybody who knows anything about the broadband challenge that we face could not stand over the Government&rsquo;s amendment as a fair reflection of the current state of play and what needs to be done to improve things.  The Minister&rsquo;s amendment simply slaps the Government on the back in a self-congratulatory way for its performance and foresight on the issue, focusing on a few positives while totally ignoring all of the serious deficits that exist in Ireland&rsquo;s telecommunications infrastructure.  The Minister should at least have the honesty to admit that all is not well and that a new ambitious approach is needed.</P>
        <P>There is not one positive specific action proposed in the Government&rsquo;s amendment.  Instead we have the promise of a new policy paper on next generation broadband at some undefined <Col N="245"/>date in the future, following consultation with another forum on broadband and following further consultation with the stakeholders after that.  The Government&rsquo;s approach is to congratulate itself for all the great work done to date on MANS, on regulation, on increased subscriber figures, and to continue a consultation process indefinitely on next generation broadband.  This will not inspire confidence in those looking to the Government for leadership and urgency on this issue and it certainly will not inspire confidence in people across the country who cannot access any form of broadband service.  There are many such people, some of whom are in the Visitors Gallery.</P>
        <P>What is most disappointing is that this response is coming from a Minister who regularly calls for real debate and cross-party co-operation on issues of fundamental importance to Ireland.  This is the man who wants to keep party politics out of vital policy debates, the man who wants a Tallaght strategy on climate change policy, and I agree with him on that.  However, this response to our motion either shows that he has not got the courage of his convictions or he is simply not being allowed by his civil servants to work with us on this.  Perhaps the thought of agreeing with a Fine Gael motion simply was not palatable to his Fianna F&aacute;il partners in Government.</P>
        <P>Whatever the reason, the Minister is playing politics with a motion that could have been amended and a compromise agreed, which he chose not to do.  Instead he continues with the consultation process on next generation broadband for concrete action sometime in the future.  All the while Ireland falls further behind our neighbouring and competing countries in almost all of the measurable performance indicators relating to broadband.  The four main performance indicators that measure our performance on broadband are penetration, which measures the percentage of people subscribing to a broadband service in a country; speed, the non-technical term related to bandwidth which describes the speed that information or data can be uploaded or downloaded though a broadband connection; availability, related to the ability for consumers or businesses to access a broadband service at all; and price, the cost of using a broadband product or service.</P>
        <P>In terms of penetration, figures released yesterday by the European Competitive Telecommunications Association place us 12th out of the 15 original EU countries.  Our penetration rate is 16.8% compared to an average of 19.9% throughout the EU.  Most significantly we are well below our immediate neighbours and competitors.  The UK and Belgium have a 25% penetration figure, Finland and Sweden are on 30%, Holland and Denmark are on 34%.  These countries have a similar spread to Ireland of urban and rural people.  The Minister will say these figures do not include mobile broadband subscribers and that mobile broadband has been a real growth area in recent years.  That is true, but the figures do not include mobile broadband due to the risk of double counting, as many people with a fixed broadband service also have a mobile subscription.  It is commonplace for people who rely heavily on broadband to have a fixed line in their office and mobile broadband as they travel around or at home.  We should not be double counting.  However, our penetration rate even including mobile connections is still below the EU 25 average for fixed-line-only penetration.  The Fine Gael motion recognises that the numbers of subscribers have increased dramatically in the last 12 months, but we still have a lot of catching up to do.</P>
        <P>The figures on broadband speed are even more worrying.  The latest OECD figures from October 2007 put us at 33rd out of 35 OECD countries for average advertised download speeds, ahead of only Mexico and Turkey.  Ireland&rsquo;s figure is three megabits per second compared to the OECD average of 13.7 megabits per second.  The figures for the United Kingdom, Finland, Sweden and France are 10.6, 13, 21.4 and 44 megabits per second, respectively.  On the other side of the globe, South Korea and Japan, two countries with which we must compete, have <Col N="246"/>average speeds of 43 and 94 megabits per second, respectively.  Although these figures refer to advertised speeds as opposed to actual speeds &mdash; some in the industry have a concern in this regard &mdash; they give a good guide as to what is universally accepted to be Ireland&rsquo;s disastrous position in terms of the broadband speeds available to the vast majority of businesses and consumers.</P>
        <P>Availability is a major problem, particularly in rural areas.  The Government concedes that at least 10% of the population has no access to a broadband service of any kind.  However, as this figure is derived from asking broadband companies, rather than consumers, what is the position, many people suspect the actual figure is much higher.  For example, a reliable survey by Leitrim County Council found that 50% of the 1,000 people interviewed had no access to a broadband service.  The Government has established the national broadband scheme to address the issue but ComReg has conceded it will not achieve 100% coverage.  It is very likely that due to substantial problems with competition law, coverage may not even come close to that figure.</P>
        <P>Price is also an issue of major concern and figures from Forf&aacute;s indicate that the fastest connections available to businesses cost four to five times more than much faster connections in competitor countries.  While progress has been made on improving backhaul infrastructure and unbundling local loops through regulation, we are certainly not at a stage where we can sit back and presume no further work is required.  We need to ensure competition in the wholesale provision of infrastructure delivers keen pricing and sufficient capacity and bandwidth.</P>
        <P>It is also necessary to consider improving our international broadband connectivity.  The global crossing project, which was controversial at the time of construction, has proven to be a great success and needs to be built on.  We need to consider establishing a similar project to create substantial international connectivity via a cable coming ashore outside the Dublin area for the purpose of attracting data centres and similar businesses reliant on such key infrastructure.</P>
        <P>The broadband debate is essentially about two fundamental issues, namely, availability and access for everybody and speeds.  In contrast to the Minister&rsquo;s amendment, which does not call for action but focuses on having more consultation, I call on the Government to commit to specific, achievable steps that will impact on the availability and speed of broadband.</P>
        <P>The centrepiece of the Fine Gael Party plan is ducting, a type of pipe that houses fibre optic cable and constitutes a large part of the cost of installing high speed connection throughout the country.  My party calls for new regulations to require ducting to be installed in all new buildings to ensure future homes and businesses are fibre enabled and, where appropriate, in road developments to ensure backbone infrastructure is constantly upgraded in a cost effective manner, with minimal need for expensive digging work.  Most important, we call for a series of actions to ensure the roll-out of new ducting in areas where it can have most impact in subsidising the private sector&rsquo;s installation costs for fibre optic cable.  In this regard, Fine Gael calls for an immediate audit of all broadband telecommunications infrastructure under public and private ownership in order that we identify what infrastructure is available.  This audit must focus specifically on what ducting is available.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael Party wants, through regulation, to achieve open access to all ducting to enable competition between infrastructure providers at wholesale level, as has been done in France with considerable success.  We also want a broadband roll-out management company established to manage on behalf of the State, negotiate with the private sector and invest moneys from the budget committed under the national development plan in new infrastructure, as required.</P><Col N="247"/>
        <P>The motion sets targets because the Government has repeatedly shown itself incapable of meeting targets in many areas, including e-government projects and the White Paper on Energy within the Minister&rsquo;s brief.  It is for this reason that the motion is insistent on setting targets and holding the Minister to account by providing that he report every six months to the Oireachtas committee on his achievements.</P>
        <P>The motion calls for the future-proofing of the national broadband scheme to ensure we do not cement the urban-rural divide on broadband by failing to provide for sufficient speeds.  It also proposes a number of measures to promote the demand side of IT and broadband by targeting schools, public transport and the elderly.  While this list of demands will not solve all problems, it makes a good start.  I commend the motion to the House and urge the Minister to support it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to support my colleague, Deputy Coveney, on this important motion.  Some years ago &mdash; I believe it was in the context of planning for the digital hub &mdash; I heard the Taoiseach refer to his ambition to see Ireland become the e-commerce centre of the world.  Even at the time, I considered his words to be hyperbole, although I admired them for showing vision and ambition.  I have a sense that such ambition is absent and has been replaced by complacency, a slipping of concern and resignation that Ireland will remain not only second best, but will lag behind all those nations with which we must compete.</P>
        <P>With regard to the availability, speed and quality of broadband, our position has dropped to a level reminiscent of that which pertained in respect of our telephone system in the 1970s.  While the Minister is too young to remember those times, I vividly remember that one could not obtain a telephone unless one knew the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, which ruled out members of the Fine Gael Party.  Sometimes, if one was particularly lucky, one would receive a present of a black telephone without a connection.  Those days are gone.  That was the old Ireland and we have moved on and become a much more open, rich country that makes a net contribution to the European Union.  In this case, however, the EU will not intervene and save us and it is for the Government to do the work.</P>
        <P>As the Minister is aware, I am a believer in the market.  However, markets sometimes fail and Government intervention is required not to replace the private sector, but to facilitate, assist and regulate it and, in this case, to ensure infrastructure does not fall into the hands of a monopolist.  It must intervene to force the pace of change in the roll-out of broadband access.</P>
        <P>Last summer, the nation was in a frenzy about the loss of the Shannon to Heathrow route because we know the economic importance of connections to other parts of the world.  Virtual connections are even more important, especially in the area of tourism, on which I am my party&rsquo;s spokesperson.  The arrival of the Internet has had a revolutionary impact on the tourism industry.  People browse the Internet to select holiday destinations, book flights and obtain information about their holiday.</P>
        <P>Small businesses worldwide have been empowered by the Internet, which provides all businesses with a platform to compete on a global scale that they could not have imagined hitherto and to market themselves to every customer in every corner of the world.  Unfortunately, Irish small and medium size enterprises cannot compete, especially in the tourism industry, if they do not have access to broadband or have poor capacity broadband.  Relative to almost all our competitors, we are disadvantaged in trying to attract tourists.  There is no point in F&aacute;ilte Ireland or Tourism Ireland spending millions of euro trying to attract tourists if our practitioners &mdash; service providers, hoteliers and tour operators &mdash; cannot close the deal.  Tragically, broadband access is worst in the areas where dependence on tourism is greatest, namely, out<Col N="248"/>side the capital and other cities.  How can SMEs in the tourism sector, whether in Clare or the midlands, promote themselves with video-marketing tools which require high-speed capacity?  How can they provide interactive booking opportunities or other applications to their customers when they do not even have a dial-up connection?  How can we discuss providing a conference facility in the mid-west and seriously expect to attract high-end, high-tech and high-spending business tourists if they cannot access high-speed internet connections when they are here?  They need video-conferencing to contact not only their own offices but also other offices in other parts of the world.  This is a basic requirement of business people and if the Government is serious about boosting tourism and extending the tourism year by providing conference centres then high-speed broadband must come with it.</P>
        <P>Apart from business tourists, almost everybody travelling for pleasure, family reasons or business brings their laptops with them and expects to be able to stay in touch with family and the workplace.  We must be serious about tourism now that the building industry is in decline.  The Minister must take on board the contents of this motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Deputy Frank Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this motion.  Is the Minister satisfied that broadband penetration has been a success throughout the country?  Broadband is three times slower but far more expensive here than in other EU states.  I live three miles from the nearest centre and accessing broadband through a landline was costing me almost &euro;200 per month.  Eventually, I got mobile broadband and the cost is down to &euro;25 per month.  This is welcome but I know that every day all of my colleagues are asked by constituents when they will have broadband.</P>
        <P>If one lives in a major population centre one is rich with infrastructure.  However, if one comes from a rural area it costs ten times more and one is not able to carry on one&rsquo;s business.  This Government speaks about having small industries throughout the country.  However, with regard to broadband the country is divided between haves and have nots.  I welcome some of the measures taken by the Minister with regard to broadband but in the past ten years not bloody much has been done.</P>
        <P>In County Roscommon we have a metropolitan area network and it was great to see broadband coming to the area.  To date, 27 cities and towns, including Roscommon and Carrick on Shannon, have been included in this programme.  The Government has plans to roll out a further 90 projects throughout the country in the second phase.  We always hear about this second phase but it has not happened.  Businesses will not come to the smaller towns in my constituency because they want metropolitan area network broadband.</P>
        <P>Perhaps I should address my next question to the man sitting beside the Minister, namely, Deputy Killeen.  With regard to finalising the roll out of the second phase, it was decided a value for money and policy review project would be carried out in my area.  Why in God&rsquo;s name was this decided when the smaller towns there desperately need broadband?  I believe this money was diverted to Clare because of the Shannon debacle.  Will the Minister investigate this?  This is what is coming out of the Department.  Those in Castlerea and Boyle are certain this money was diverted to Shannon, which is wrong of the Government and is anti small rural areas.  Will Deputy Killeen answer this question?  He will not be able to answer it because it is the truth.</P>

	<P>The time has come for the State to actively pursue the issue of broadband services.  I listen to the Government proclaim how our economy has changed and how we must <Col N="249"/>position ourselves for the future.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment often speaks of our future as a knowledge economy and one of our larger exports is software.</P>
        <P>If this is the case and we wish to position ourselves internationally in this manner, it is of critical importance that the Government addresses the issues outlined in this Fine Gael motion.  The large international corporations we hope to attract will not wait a number of years for the private sector to provide what is essentially a vital piece of public infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Historically, the State has intervened and actively promoted projects of national strategic importance.  In the 1920s our first Government worked with Siemens of Germany to construct the hydroelectric power generating station at Ardnacrusha in my constituency.  At the time this idea was laughed at and it was thought that Ardnacrusha would provide too much electricity.  Today, Ardnacrusha provides less than 2% of the national grid&rsquo;s requirements.  The rural electrification scheme is often referred to as the &ldquo;quiet revolution&rdquo; in that it brought about major change to this country.</P>
        <P>The point about both of these projects is that the Governments involved were innovative, visionary and committed enough to see through and be actively involved in projects which were of enormous benefit to the State.  In contrast to this, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in response to a parliamentary question I put down last July stated the role of Government is to implement regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high-quality telecommunications services by competing private sector service providers in a fully liberalised market.</P>
        <P>The Minister washed his hands in this reply.  This bridesmaid-type role is not good enough and will never allow us progress to the standards to which we aspire.  This motion calls on the Government to take a more active hands-on role.  The motion seeks clear political commitment to the provision of broadband services, allowing our economy to develop and prosper in the future.</P>
        <P>E-Teams is a company based in Scariff in east Clare.  This small town has a population of 800.  E-Teams provides a worldwide translation service, and provided official translation services during both the Irish and UK Presidencies of the Council of the European Union.  The issue of quality broadband is critical for this company and access to a group broadband scheme has enabled it to employ 27 people.  Unfortunately, if one lives in the countryside that surrounds Scariff one does not have access to broadband and one cannot work from home.</P>
        <P>The potential for the development of our economy with regard to access to broadband is threefold, through large international corporations, small and medium enterprises such as E-Teams, and the possibility for the individual of working from home.</P>
        <P>I welcome the progress made on the metropolitan area network in Kilrush but it is frustratingly slow.  The infrastructure is now in the ground but the scheme is still not operational even though it was announced in 2004.  The exclusion of Ennis and Shannon from the metropolitan area network programme is astonishing.  It is incredible that these two towns were never included in the initial 88 towns announced in 2004.  Ennis is supposed to be the information age town but large areas around Ennis do not have broadband and broadband speeds vary significantly throughout the town.</P>
        <P>While I welcome the establishment of a number of group broadband schemes in County Clare the significant variance in cost and speed must be pointed out.  Participants on the Kilfenora scheme pay up to &euro;36 per month whereas in Corofin, less than 10 miles away, they pay &euro;15 per month.  Vast areas throughout County Clare have no broadband and little chance of getting it.  If the Government is serious about broadband and this country&rsquo;s future then it must at the very least set clear targets on average speeds, availability and penetration rates.  These <Col N="250"/>targets must be achieved within set timeframes.  The Minister must move beyond his regulatory and facilitative role and for this reason I support the motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to address this positive motion.  This side of the House has long been lectured, in particular by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, who today stated Fine Gael is &ldquo;policy bankrupt&rdquo;.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I will not go over the figures quoted already but 17% penetration is extremely poor.  This motion has a target of 100% penetration at 3 megabytes.  This would be a major benefit for our economy.</P>
        <P>Our economy&rsquo;s survival depends on competitiveness, which we need to align with a knowledge-based economy.  In the past our corporation tax rate was a major benefit.  Our low wage base was sufficient in attracting foreign direct investment.  Now, however, we have high wage structures and our corporation tax is less attractive.  Many of our economic competitors are not Third World countries but European, such as Austria and Switzerland.  Switzerland offers a zero rate of corporation tax to multinational companies willing to locate there.  Compared to what is available in this State, we are a long way behind.</P>
        <P>When these difficulties with higher wage structures and declining corporation tax benefits are aligned with poor broadband services, Ireland becomes a less attractive location for multinational companies and foreign direct investment.</P>
        <P>Deputies Joe Carey and Feighan referred to the MANs, the second phase of which the Minister must re-examine.  Some 88 towns were to be connected under this phase.  County Wexford, one of the largest counties in the State, with 140,000 inhabitants, will only have one town connected in this phase.  Gorey, Enniscorthy and New Ross, three towns with over 10,000 inhabitants, will have no connection to the MANs.  Will the Minister and his officials examine what has gone wrong with the scheme?  Why do Ennis, Enniscorthy, Gorey and many other large towns not have the opportunity to attract investment in companies, such as call centres, through the MANs scheme?</P>
        <P>Many press reports have referred to chief executive officers of multinational companies being embarrassed by Ireland&rsquo;s lack of broadband availability and speeds, particularly the experience of E-Bay&rsquo;s chief executive officer.  I was informed by the chief executive officer of a County Wexford company, which employs 200 people, that whenever an e-mail comes into his company, he gets a telephone call and he then must go to an Internet cafe to download it.  This company pays corporation tax, PRSI and other taxes and brings much benefit to the county.  The Minister must recognise this is not good enough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Deputy Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>This debate concerns the lack of investment and planning in broadband services.  The four key areas in the provision of broadband are penetration, speed, access and cost.  A 2007 Forf&aacute;s report showed Ireland was below the EU average in the provision of broadband services and behind our competitors.  Last week&rsquo;s European Competitive Telecommunications Association report showed Ireland was in the bottom four of EU broadband performance.  Being below average is simply not good enough.</P>
        <P>We have identified ourselves as a knowledge-based economy.  We need to encourage entrepreneurship and regional development and attract foreign direct investment.  To match these aspirations, we need a first-class telecommunications infrastructure.  Instead terms such as &ldquo;embarrassing&rdquo; have been used to describe our broadband services.  The Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, has described them as a joke.  I would describe it as serious if we are to have ambitions for the economy to grow.  We must provide the basic broadband infrastructure for businesses to carry on.</P><Col N="251"/>
        <P>Unless high-speed broadband capacity is provided for in the regions, people will not move out of Dublin, a point made clearly by businesses.  The Minister has promised another forum on broadband services.  Instead of forums we need action to ensure we achieve our ambition to develop a knowledge-based economy and encourage entrepreneurship.  Without the necessary broadband penetration, speed and access, we will go nowhere.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to take on board Deputy Coveney&rsquo;s proposals which are practical and realistic ambitions that can be fulfilled and will get us to the same level as our competitors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Broadband service improvements are essential for Ireland&rsquo;s economic future and are being neglected.  Yesterday&rsquo;s report from the European Competitive Telecommunications Association put Ireland 12th out of 15 European countries in the provision of broadband.  Ireland lags behind other countries in broadband penetration.  The number of people who have it is still exceptionally low.  Even countries as vast as Australia perform better than us; we are 30th out of 34 countries in the OECD broadband per household report.</P>
        <P>One key issue from an enterprise development perspective is the limited range and speed of broadband services available and their comparatively higher cost.  For example, an Irish business would pay over &euro;2,000 per annum for a six megabits per second package, while in Germany, a company would pay approximately &euro;500 for treble that speed.</P>
        <P>Recently in Golden, County Tipperary, I undertook a petition for the provision of quality reliable broadband in the area.  Within three days over 200 people in this small village signed it.  Such experience could be resonated in every village throughout the country.  In Cashel, County Tipperary, a television programme took approximately one minute to download using broadband in my office.  On dial-up in Golden, four miles away, the same programme took 27 minutes.  This is the reality of the sketchy broadband services available.</P>
        <P>In response to a recent parliamentary question on making Tipperary town a Wi-Fi hot-spot, the Minister replied that external private companies were dealing with broadband and he would welcome any developments.  Why is the Government letting it all happen as if there were no problem?</P>
        <P>The Government needs to incentivise improvements in the supply, speed and reliability of broadband services.  It must make installation of telecommunications ducting on all national road upgrades mandatory, an idea put forward by Forf&aacute;s.  The contract terms of the national broadband scheme must be revised to stipulate higher speeds than current ones and spend the money allocated to the scheme.</P>
        <P>The Government has wasted public finances on projects such as PPARs.  Broadband has not been taken seriously and no amount of press releases and statements by the Minister will change this fact.  Broadband is essential.  People want it; Ireland wants it.  I heard the Minister talking about this on these benches some months ago.  However, he has allowed the situation to continue without improvement and, in fact, it has become worse.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">I welcome the opportunity to debate this crucial area of our economic and social development and I thank Deputy Coveney for putting down this motion.  For certain reasons I decided to put down a counter-motion from the Government, which I will return to later in my speech.  However, this in no way indicates a lack of ambition or sense of importance on this side of the House with regard to the development of this crucial infrastructure for the benefit of our society.</P>
        <P>It is crucial for us, in this fast-evolving digital economy, that we have the best available infrastructure to allow Irish enterprise to compete, export and provide services here.  It is important, as this new digital economy develops, that we do not leave sections of our economy behind and that we do not have a social or regional divide in accessing services to establish such businesses.  It is crucial that the development of the new economy is not just in the private sector but also involves the State, whether it be in the provision of health care, education or other Government services.  We can realise major efficiencies and competitive advantages in the provision of public as well as private services where we provide the right infrastructure to allow people to carry such digital services.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Coveney mentioned in his opening remarks with regard to environmental issues, society will need to undergo a complete turnaround.  The development of an efficient digital system for doing business and providing services is a crucial element in the radical about-turn that will be achieved in our society during our necessary rapid retreat in the use of fossil fuels.  For all these reasons, the development of a broadband infrastructure is important and deserves to be centre stage in the consideration of this House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I appreciate Deputy Carey&rsquo;s point about setting out the role of Government in providing broadband services.  The world has changed since the 1970s and things are different.  Unfortunately, my constituency colleague, Deputy Mitchell, is wrong &mdash; I am long enough in the tooth to remember those times when one would have to wait forever and a day for the provision of a telephone line from a centralised State service.  We are now in a more competitive market with a range of private sector operators.  The world has changed.  The role of Government naturally moves towards establishing the appropriate regulatory system to ensure that we have an effective and competitive market, providing, where necessary, the backup infrastructure to support such development.  That is an outline of what the Government is doing.</P>
        <P>The debate tonight and tomorrow night is beneficial because it helps us to establish some facts.  The area of broadband is complex and fast-moving.  It is an industry in which the technology changes almost every year, so that what prevailed a year ago quickly becomes out of date.  In the Joint Committee on Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources two years ago, where I was on the Opposition benches, the debate revolved around the fact that there was not enough demand for broadband services.  That has changed completely over the last year.  This is why it is important for us to know exactly what is going on.</P><Col N="254"/>
        <P>There is clear recognition that we are not all happy.  Deputies on both sides of the House are unhappy with progress in the area of broadband.  In addition, there is reasonably widespread recognition that one of the main reasons we are not at the top of the league &mdash; in fact, we are only catching up &mdash; is the delay in 2002 to 2004 due to changes in our incumbent telecommunications provider and the lack of competitiveness in the market.  This did not encourage investment in the area of broadband.  We must now catch up with and then overtake our international competitors.</P>
        <P>Any rational analysis of what has taken place in the last year would recognise that changes have been occurring.  There has been progress.  There is now broadband availability in roughly 85% of the country.  It is changing, and there are areas in which&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is actually 85% of the population.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, 85% of the population.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>There are large rural areas that do not have broadband availability.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are such areas, and we intend to address this issue.  There is a range of DSL platforms from fixed-line operators, as well as innovative wireless operators that have provided solutions because the market was not delivering.  We have taken steps with new technologies that provide solutions.  There is a whole range of operators &mdash; cable operators, fibre-optic operators, mobile operators and so on &mdash; providing services that were not being provided two, three or four years ago when other countries were ahead of us.</P>
        <P>With regard to the catch-up process, we could get into a war of statistics, but there are certain simple statistics that give an indication of where we are going.  In the third quarter of 2007, which is the latest period for which figures are available, 793,000 Irish homes subscribed to broadband services.  This is a significant change, by any measure, from the case 12 months previously.  There was 81% growth over 12 months.  This is not an international comparison but a fairly straight figure we can use as one measure of our progress.  An 81% increase in one year is not insignificant.</P>
        <P>The statistics commonly used as international measures by the OECD are more complex.  I will explain in a while why I see them as being complex and difficult to understand.  However, if we apply these as a standard to measure our progress, it can be seen that access to broadband has increased significantly in a relatively short time.  In early 2005, according to the OECD statistics, there were three broadband subscribers per 100 of our population, while in early 2007 there were seven per 100.  However, according to the latest statistics, by the end of 2007 there were 18.4 subscribers per 100.  To go from three to seven to 18.4 per 100 in two years is progress.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Does that include mobile services?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, the OECD&rsquo;s figures do not include mobile services.  I will go into further detail about the OECD figures, but one of the difficulties with them is that they do not include the whole range of technologies, some of which represent major progress.  The OECD figures show that we are, in the last year, the fastest growing country in terms of pick-up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course we are.  We are coming from the lowest base.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true, but we are the fastest growing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister suggesting he is happy with how things are going?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="255"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>When we are close to doubling the numbers of subscribers in a year, that is not insignificant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the first point in our motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will give some more OECD statistics to illustrate the extent of our catch-up.  In the third quarter of 2006, when the average OECD figure was some 15.6 broadband subscribers per 100, we had 10.3 users per 100.  In the third quarter of 2007, the average OECD figure was 18.8 subscribers per 100, and our figure was 18.4 per 100.  Even though the Deputy is saying that we were coming from a low base, he cannot ignore that this represents a catch-up.  Our levels are now similar to the OECD average.  That is not to say we should be self-satisfied about it, but it is a recognition of the reality.</P>
        <P>The OECD statistics are difficult not just because they do not take into account certain technologies in which we tend to be further advanced &mdash; in fact, in which we are definitely further advanced than the other leading industrialised countries &mdash; but also because they are slightly skewed by the basis of the statistical analysis.  By taking the number of subscribers from different households and then equating this to a number <i>per capita</i>, this method ignores that fact that different countries have different average household sizes.  Denmark, referred to by Deputy Coveney, is a good example of a country with fast broadband access but the <i>per capita</i> size in that country is completely different.  I must find the precise figures before tomorrow night but families in Denmark are smaller than in Ireland.  One is not comparing like with like and the Deputy must be careful when using statistics.  To give a further example&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The debate is not about statistics, it is about what the Minister needs to do to progress the marketplace.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will come to that but statistics are important because the debate has been framed by statistics in a simple analysis that has not provided real clarity about what is happening in good times and in bad.</P>
        <P>Deputy Coveney referred to Denmark and I will comment on broadband speed there.  Whatever about advertised speed in Denmark, one of the countries of best practice, figures from ComReg show that 3% of Danish consumers take services of more than 10 megabytes per second.  In the United States, a leading economy in this digital area&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Not in all states, although it is in California.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;of the next generation network of high speed broadband areas, 1% of the population were using such high speed connections last July.  Whatever about advertised speeds, that is the figure for what people were using.  Deputy Coveney referred to the UK speeds, a country that we need to be ahead of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is about preparing for the future, what it will be in five years&rsquo; time, not what it was last year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which is 10.6 megabytes per second.  Data from BT shows that less than 5% of customers use such speeds.  A debate is useful in getting a sense of what we must do and what we must change.  The reality is that we are not there yet but we have improved.  We have a similar level of penetration to our colleagues in the northern part of this island.  The OECD statistics, which do not take into account different technology and growth since then, show that 40% of Irish households have broadband connection.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Close to 50% of Irish houses have a broadband connection.  We must remember that 40% of Irish houses do not have a computer.  We must increase that figure so we can increase penetration in the home, which is only one of the issues, albeit a crucial one.  We need broadband in other areas of our life, such as workplaces, schools and hospitals.  I agree with Deputy Coveney that we should not get hung up on statistics.</P>
        <P>What will the Government do in response to this statistical analysis?  Success occurs when one has competitive markets, which is why Denmark and Britain are successful in this area.  Last May the House passed the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Act 2007, which gives the regulator strong powers, where necessary, to provide for a competitive market and fast services.  There are strong sanctions for inappropriate behaviour, ranging from 10% of turnover to &euro;5 million fines.  It is a crucially important development so that we have the right regulatory system and the best international practice.  That includes a regulator who has powers comparable to the Competition Authority to ensure anti-competitive behaviour does not take place and that abuse of dominance by any provider is not a possibility.  In my experience, our regulators are developing the experience, powers and analysis to carry out their functions in a timely and effective manner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is important, because this is a competitive market and a strong regulatory system can provide for the Irish people.</P>
        <P>Things change quickly in this area and an important development in the past year is the local loop unbundling, where one opens exchanges to allow competing companies access to the network to provide services.  The competing companies can buy the services on a wholesale basis.  Local loop unbundling has been one of the best drivers in terms of the delivery of wider access broadband at faster speeds and cheaper prices.  It was delayed in Ireland and we had difficulties in getting the right regulatory system in place.  Last May I welcomed that the industry, the incumbent provider and the regulator could address this with a greater sense of urgency and possibility.  In September they agreed a new local loop unbundling package that provides real opportunities for the incumbent and the competitors.</P>
        <P>This market has opportunities for everyone.  I can think of no other business where the levels of growth are increasing so dramatically.  It is not a case of setting one company against another but believing that there remain opportunities for every company to have a successful business plan because the speed of the development of this digital economy is such that it provides for wholesale and retail operators&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister take on board any of the actions we suggest?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will come to that if I can, Deputy Coveney.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has four minutes left.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="257"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have four minutes, I have 30 minutes left.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I will decide how much time is left.  Some 14 minutes remain.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I assumed Deputy Mattie McGrath was speaking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  As a result of local loop unbundling we are starting to see change.  One operator is providing ADSL, a fixed line service, with speeds of between 2 megabytes and 15 megabytes per second on 37 exchanges.  That serves the possibility of 500,000 lines.  Another provider is providing ADSL technology with speeds up to 8 megabytes per second on 22 exchanges, with the potential of 330,000 lines availing of that speed.  The regulatory system has made positive changes and work is continuing in that regard.</P>
        <P>In infrastructure the Government has a crucial role.  The international advisory forum we set up is meeting tonight and includes experts from all over the world, East and West, Europe, Asia and America.  It includes those with conviction and expertise in fixed line fibre optic solutions, mobile solutions, the European regulatory system and the Irish regulatory system.  It is a useful forum or focus group that we use in politics because they work.  It is good to get independent advice to tell one what to think about what one is doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should remember what he said about focus groups when he was on this side of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will cite an example of why consulting with international experts who have no vested interest in our plans is exactly the policy we should follow.  A previous international forum was set up in 1999 and its recommendation was for the State to invest in a global crossing connection, costing &euro;77 million.  It has proved successful in reducing our international connectivity prices to among the lowest in the OECD.  That is the type of investment that the State is best doing, when the market is not delivering.  It came from a similar forum in the past.</P>
        <P>Our commitment to investing, where appropriate, is set out in the National Development Plan 2007-2013 and includes a potential budget of &euro;435 million over that period.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In 2007, we spent &euro;35 million and in 2008 we are committed to a budget of approximately &euro;53 million, primarily for metropolitan area networks and the national broadband scheme.  With regard to the metropolitan area networks, Deputy Coveney will recall when we shared the Opposition benches in 2003 that there was clear market failure and nothing was happening.  It was agreed by the committee, which produced a report on it, that MANs was the right development and a way to kick-start the process.  Where the market was not investing in what was an obvious and crucial development, it was right for the State to step in.  We cannot afford to lag behind and for the market not to deliver in those areas.  We invested in these high speed, open access networks, with co-location centres so all operators can use the networks on an open access basis.  That was the right and proper decision and will prove to be a successful long-term investment for the people of the State.  Such digital, high quality, fibre optic ducting is a crucial part of a modern infrastructure.</P>
        <P>The first phase of 27 MANs has been built and established, with the company e-Net, the management services entity, operating to provide open access to all operators in the industry on an equal access basis.  A total of 66 additional towns have already started construction in phase II of the programme.  They will be managed under a second new management services entity.  This is a fast-changing technological area so we were aware there were difficulties in terms of how to provide connections from such metropolitan fibre networks to the rest of the network in the backhaul and to the home.  It does not provide a fibre cable connection through <Col N="258"/>to the house.  Partly due to those concerns, the Department commissioned a value for money review.  It will be published in the coming weeks and we will take it into account.</P>
        <P>Given the value for money review and the fact that we are examining this entire area on a proper policy assessment basis, including our international advisory forum, I considered it appropriate, as was announced in the D&aacute;il a number of months ago, to delay signing the contracts for new projects within phase II or phase III, which is already set, to reconsider what our investment strategy should be in the context of the difficulties and opportunities that still exist in providing such fibre ducting.  This is something I look forward to debating in more detail with the Opposition as we move towards public discussion of policy, which is appropriate but which cannot be done in one Private Member&rsquo;s debate, as much as I welcome it.</P>
        <P>In further investment by the State, the school broadband programme began in 2005.  A sum of &euro;18 million was committed by both industry and the Government to a three year programme.  It has resulted in 99% of schools having a broadband connection.  We are working on the last 1% and on a second phase development of the schools broadband programme.  This statistic probably does not jump out from the percentage coverage in OECD lists and so forth but it is crucial that we provide the highest quality broadband connectivity to our schools and colleges.  It offers a huge opportunity for all parts of our society.  One classroom with a high broadband connection allows the 20 or 30 students in the classroom to connect to the worldwide web and all the information it contains.  That will not feature in a statistic and will not change an international measure of where we are positioned but it might well change the lives of those students.  It is something we must progress with great speed.</P>
        <P>The group broadband scheme was another intervention by the State in terms of providing for rural areas where there was no market response to provide broadband connectivity, possibly due to the demographics of the area.  Some 127 projects were promoted and progressed under the scheme but ultimately there was a recognition that it was a better solution to provide a complete, ubiquitous broadband availability across the country.  For that reason it was decided to opt for a national broadband scheme rather than a group broadband scheme, which was dealing with the issue on an individual project basis.</P>
        <P>We must have an honest debate based on reality.  Broadband is getting to 1 million households; soon over 1 million Irish households will be connected.  There are now six very effective competing platforms and that provides competition between DSL providers, wireless cable companies, mobile telephony companies, satellite companies and fibre optic connections.  A range of technological solutions is being developed.  In this fast-changing area, where technologies and the speeds that can come from technologies are almost doubling every year to 18 months, the availability of a wide variety of technologies will see progress.  Five years ago there were 4,000 broadband customers; today it is almost 1 million.  Five years ago we had two mobile telephony providers, today we have five.  Three of them are operating in the mobile broadband area, which is not included in the international statistics.  However, it is taking off like a rocket in this country because people like that mobility and like the service they can get.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is also because they cannot get fixed broadband, which is the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Local loop unbundling is in place.  Eircom is advancing plans, which I welcome, to upgrade its network so it can provide higher speeds.  Similarly, the cable company UPC announced it intends to spend &euro;300 million upgrading its network, which will help to provide a competitive environment.  We have a regulator with real powers and we are starting to see prices come down.  Overall, telecommunications prices have come down by 15% since <Col N="259"/>1997 whereas the CPI has gone up by 45%.  That will and should continue because competition should be able to drive prices down.  As we use more digital services, as more people go on-line and with integration between communications technologies and the various services provided through them, it is appropriate that competitive pressures should assist in bringing speeds up and prices down.</P>
        <P>It is crucial that we be able to get to the real debate, which is what our bandwidth speeds and pricing should be.  We need to get beyond the problem of certain parts of the country not having broadband availability.  For that reason I am keen to progress, with urgency, the national broadband scheme which provides a mechanism whereby the State can work with industry to ensure service is provided in particular areas where the market is unable to deliver it.  We are in the middle of a competitive process, and that is one of the sensitivities in terms of what we can discuss in the debate.  We must be careful when we have a competitive auctioning system.  Four candidate companies pre-qualified and three companies &mdash; Eircom, BT and Hutchinson 3G &mdash; are engaged in a competitive tendering process.  Basic standards are set out which the company must provide, for example, 1Mbps broadband connection with 48:1 contention ratio.</P>
        <P>However, this is not a fixed competitive tendering process.  We are looking to companies to ramp up what they can do and be ambitious about what they can provide in future upgrades.  That process is due to be completed with a contract signed at the end of June, and the company rolling it out after that.  If any areas are not covered, we will return to the issue.  Our process is to set out a map of the country, accepting that it can change and that areas may or may not have service depending on whether operators do what they said would do.  If an area is not covered by 1 July, it will be included in the scheme.  We must have ubiquitous coverage so no part of the country is left behind.  Then we will move on to the future challenges.</P>
        <P>Future challenges are also opportunities.  There is an opportunity to develop new services, such as voice over Internet, telephone services via broadband, video on demand, gaming and a range of public services.  We must move towards a new generation network telecommunications system that can provide those services and to do it in a way where supply of bandwidth is ahead of demand.  It is difficult to be exact about what speed will be required.  The international experience is that it is far from clear which market demand applications will come and in what time that will make the commercial case for broadband speeds.  Our broad aim should be to ensure that we at least do not have a restriction on the roll-out of the application.  That will require us to have much faster speeds across the country on a wide range basis and in all areas of our society, not just in the areas where people can commercially afford it.</P>
        <P>I have no problem with the various measures set out for providing proper ducting.  Our policy formulation sets out exactly what are those measures.  I disagree with Deputy Coveney who said the motion might be too long; if anything we could go further.  However, we cannot set out a complete strategy here within the confines of a Private Member&rsquo;s motion.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The process we are engaging in, which is recognising the reality, having real ambition and engaging in detailed, properly thought-out policy analysis is the right way to go.  In the past we have jumped at rash solutions here, maybe often for political gain, but they did not prove to be the right investment decisions.  We must, in a fast-changing and complex market, make sure we make the right investments and ensure that the regulatory system is working.  There is no lack of ambition on my part.  I will work very much on a co-operative basis when it comes down to the specifics of making decisions.  I am open to any criticisms or suggestions in terms of how we can do it better.  Our amendment simply says that we must recognise what has happened and that we are engaged in a consultative process, this very night, <Col N="260"/>in the international advisory forum.  We will then go to public forum, where the paper will be published and it will change and evolve, because this is a fast-moving area.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why I am looking for support for it.  I look forward to listening to the debate and hearing other Members&rsquo; views on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Martin Ferris tonight, and with Deputies Se&aacute;n Sherlock and Thomas P. Broughan tomorrow night, with the agreement of the House.</P>
        <P>I listened with great interest to the Minister but it seems he has not quite got the point of the Fine Gael motion.  I commend Fine Gael on working out a very clear approach to the issue of broadband.  It is an old ploy that when one wants to reject something, one says it does not go far enough.  That is a chestnut, really.  The proposals in the motion are very clear cut.  They deal with a range of issues, including setting out targets, ensuring those targets are met, reporting back to the committee, as well as with practical issues like ducting and so forth.  It is a comparatively long motion and it is most regrettable that the Minister could not have taken it in the spirit in which it was presented, accepted it and worked in a real spirit of co-operation.</P>
        <P>There is absolutely no doubt that broadband is now part of essential infrastructure and is required in any advanced, successful society.  Quite apart from its importance in ensuring our economic future, and there has been much emphasis on that tonight, the provision or lack of broadband is an indicator of progress across a range of social, community, educational and health care developments.  The fact that we are debating broadband provision in itself is a sorry indicator of a sorry Government record.  We pride ourselves as a nation in having a successful and advanced economy but at the same time, the official record is one of a failure to manage the simple roll-out of broadband nationally.</P>
        <P>At a time of growing economic pressures and indeed, with a change of Minister, the expectation has been that renewed effort on the part of the Government would bring about a sea change in this area.  Had it done so, we would now be talking about next generation networks and how we can keep ahead of our competitors across Europe and the world.  Instead, we are still trying to catch up while other countries forge ahead of us.</P>
        <P>In 2004, the Government was bragging about Ireland becoming one of the top ten of the OECD states.  Today, we lie in 22nd place out of 30 countries and are still talking about the most basic broadband provision.  Everybody understands and is delighted to see the increase in take-up.  That is very welcome but we still have an enormous gap to make up.  We are still foundering, essentially, around the bottom of the EU broadband league.  While there has been a steady growth in the penetration of broadband to 16.8% here, a figure from the European league, that is only about half the penetration of Denmark, the Netherlands or the United Kingdom and frankly, it is laughable to hear the Minister claiming that the fact that families in Denmark are smaller explains the difference.  That is almost quaint in its approach but it does not convince.</P>
        <P>Another statement from the Minister which did not convince was made on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; two weeks ago when he said that in many instances, we are actually ahead of Northern Ireland.  That is hardly the case when one considers that in January 2006, Northern Ireland <Col N="261"/>announced it had achieved 100% broadband penetration.  Its population is broadly similar to ours.  While I accept that the service may be at low speed, at least it is available.</P>
        <P>While access to broadband in Ireland is growing, albeit belatedly, many other countries are pulling far ahead of us.  The issue is not simply about access either.  It is also about the quality of the service provided, as well as its cost.  The problem that we have, which has been raised in this debate, was articulated clearly by the CEO of Forf&aacute;s, Mr. Martin Cronin, recently, when he said:</P>
        <P LI="1">We continue to lag other countries in terms of the range of services available and investment in next generation broadband.  Ireland needs to future-proof its telecoms infrastructure so that we can deploy Next Generation Networks in a timely fashion, which will mean far greater bandwidth capacity, more efficient networks, lower costs for operators and a wider range of advanced services for enterprise.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is the challenge.  He also went on to warn that we have a very narrow window of opportunity, but one does not detect a sense of urgency from the Minister.  In some ways, though, it is a bit difficult because the Minister is making one speech, while his poor old civil servants have put a lot into writing another speech.  Sometimes, they do combine but &mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>They are one and the same.  Always united.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Actually, they are not, but I am not complaining.  It makes life interesting but it also complicates matters somewhat.  It means that there is quite a lot in the speech that does not go on to the D&aacute;il record.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was Deputy McManus&rsquo;s interventions which threw me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry I do not have much time now.  I would be delighted to talk to the Minister further some other time but not just now, in the Chamber.</P>
        <P>I have concerns about the Minister&rsquo;s approach in setting up a consultative body.  It is very easy to set up bodies in order to delay decisions being made.  We now have an international advisory forum.  One does not get the sense that this is a &ldquo;can-do&rdquo; Minister, who understands that the window of opportunity is narrow, that it is a very competitive climate in which he is operating and that he must focus and get the job done in ways indicated to him by the Fine Gael motion.</P>
        <P>We are very far off the goals set out by Forf&aacute;s.  We are still wrestling with the deficiencies of this generation&rsquo;s networks.  Despite the pressing need, I recall that the Minister cheerfully hijacked &euro;10 million out of the broadband budget and spent it on insulation and wood pellets, saying that the money would not get spent anyway.  Why would it not get spent?  That is the question.  Surely when the need is so great, there should not have been any money left over in the kitty at the end of the year.</P>
        <P>The Minister cannot be unaware of the current problems, difficulties and deficiencies.  I represent a mixed, but largely rural, constituency and am receiving a steady little stream of complaints about either lack of access or poor quality service when access is achieved.  One of the most heartfelt complaints came from the village of Shillelagh, where there is a Cheshire Home for people with disabilities.  I quote from correspondence I received:</P>
        <P LI="1">The internet connection is a life line, not only for leisure, but for work.  Most times the internet connection just cuts off for no apparent reason.  It is frustrating to see so much <Col N="262"/>advertising for broadband services but when you ring them it is like hitting a brick wall.  The service is not always there to acquire.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I presumed this problem was a rural one until I met a woman from Finglas who told me that broadband basically closes down at 6 p.m. because the system becomes overloaded when people come home from work.</P>
        <P>There is an issue in terms of people being simply unable to get access at all.  In that context, I welcome the national broadband scheme which should provide for those people who are currently completely out of the loop.  However, the scheme is based on the Department&rsquo;s coverage map.  According to that map, areas marked in red have broadband connection, but that is not always the case.  Anecdotal evidence from around the country of people being unable to access broadband services, even in these red areas, is very real and quite considerable.  That is also evident in the parliamentary questions that are being asked of the Minister.  Deputy Simon Coveney pinpointed the reason this information is not being reflected by the Department because it is asking the companies rather than the customers.  The Minister&rsquo;s answer is always the same, namely, that the provision of broadband services is primarily a matter for the private sector, that broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, and that those parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision will be addressed by the national broadband scheme.</P>
        <P>What constitutes quality broadband varies wildly across the country.  As to the promised national broadband scheme, I take it it will be set at 1 megabit.  However, this represents a fraction of the speeds available elsewhere and a project Eircom is trying in Dublin is far ahead of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has one minute remaining.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I wanted to make further points, but I will refer to the matter of the universal service obligation operated by ComReg in terms of narrowband and telephone lines.  It seems clear that we need the same type of universal obligation in respect of broadband.  I hope it will be possible to ensure the principle of a right of access to good quality broadband is established.  Otherwise, our society will constantly have a two-tiered nature and people in particular parts of the country will be at a disadvantage because they will not be able to access broadband as people elsewhere can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the motion, which addresses an increasingly important part of the essential infrastructure of a modern society.  While I accept it is the wish and will of every party in the House, it is regrettable that the Government found it necessary not to support the motion as it stands.  There is no doubt that broadband connectivity is an essential element in economic success and not just in respect of those areas dependent on high-technology.</P>
        <P>The motion is correct in identifying that this country has a relatively poor rate in terms of broadband access internationally.  It is a timely reference given that a report issued last week by the European Competitive Telecommunications Association found that Ireland lies 12th of the 15 EU states surveyed in terms of broadband penetration.  Only Italy, Portugal and Greece, all of which have much larger land areas and arguably more difficult and mountainous terrain, are behind us.  Ireland has a penetration rate of just under 17%, which compares to an average of 20% among the other 15 states included in the study.  Unfortunately, this compares to a rate <Col N="263"/>of 34% in Denmark and 25% in Britain.  It is important, therefore, in respect of economic growth that the position is improved upon as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>There are a number of bright spots identified in the report.  For example, our ranking improved from 14th last year and Ireland has recently enjoyed the third largest growth rate of the 15 states, although a good proportion of this related to the growth of broadband access through mobile telephone providers rather than the provision of home and business access.  Mobile access is not considered by the OECD as an important factor in promoting economic development and most of those with access will at any rate be living in parts of the country with existing access provision.</P>
        <P>Another concern highlighted by the ECTA report was the increasing market dominance of the major broadband suppliers.  This relates mainly to the fact that, like large private corporations with few competitors, there will be a tendency to use market strength to impose higher costs on consumers, which is a serious concern.  There is also the danger that a small number of dominant suppliers will have little incentive to ensure that broadband access is rolled out to those areas in which it is more difficult or costly to supply and access.</P>
        <P>Last night in Tralee, I attended a meeting of the Irish Rural Dwellers Association, IRDA.  It was attended by people from Clare and other parts of the west coast, but mainly from Kerry.  Significant issues that arose during the meeting were depopulation, lack of employment and the decline of traditional industries in rural areas.  More alarmingly, it was mentioned that much of the young population is leaving rural Ireland.  This would obviously have implications for countries with large rural populations, particularly given that rural penetration by broadband is still low in relative terms.  This makes it all the more essential that the State adopts a proactive role in ensuring, as the Government is committed to, that the necessary infrastructure is in place to meet the target of making broadband available to every person.</P>
        <P>I return to the matter of access in rural areas.  In many parts of my county &mdash; north, south and west Kerry &mdash; there is no access to broadband, although there may be in the larger built-up areas.  This is a significant disincentive to anyone of an entrepreneurial spirit who wishes to become involved in business.  I have no doubt that the failure to provide broadband in many parts of the country has been a factor in the failure to attract new investment and in the closure of existing enterprises.  For several years, I have been highlighting the failure of the IDA to attract new investment to Kerry to compensate for a steady series of closures and staff lay-offs.  In particular, I have pointed to its failure to persuade companies in the technology sector to locate in the county despite the presence in Tralee of an institute of technology and a technology park, two fabulous institutions located in a built-up area in the south-west corner of the country that are not being exploited for the benefit of the people.  The delay in the roll-out of broadband to rural and isolated areas is a contributing factor.</P>
        <P>While broadband access is available in Tralee and other towns, there are still large parts of the county where this is not the case.  Undoubtedly, it has had a negative impact on development in rural Kerry, but has also had a knock on effect on the county overall.  I suggest an intimate connection between Kerry having one of the highest unemployment rates in the country and one of the lowest levels of broadband penetration.  Some 3,200 people in Tralee are unemployed and nearly 14% of the county&rsquo;s population is unemployed, which is nearly three times the national average.  One can make the strong argument that a contributing factor is the lack of the required level of broadband penetration.</P>
        <P>It is particularly important that, where small businesses in the more remote and coastal localities need to compensate for their physical location by ease of communications, broadband is made available.  It would certainly apply in counties like Kerry, Donegal, Clare, Galway, Mayo and the rest of the western seaboard where newer business enterprises are required to <Col N="264"/>compensate for the loss of more traditional manufacturing.  Where surveys were conducted in the United States, Britain and elsewhere, the lack of broadband access was identified as a key drawback to rural businesses.  A rural business person I know stated that, without adequate broadband access, it is simply impossible for rural businesses to compete and survive.  This statement says it all.</P>
        <P>If we are serious about genuine decentralisation and addressing the increasingly lopsided nature of development and the tendency towards urbanisation, rural broadband access must be made a priority as part of the current national broadband scheme.  I would like to believe that much of what the Minister referred to will be implemented via the roll-out of broadband, as it would be a considerable statement to people of rural Ireland to the effect that they can maintain their traditional way of life and live in their rural communities.  Broadband access is essential and I urge the Minister to pursue it proactively so it will be available to the most isolated areas, those that are most discriminated against in terms of employment creation, making it a little easier for people to survive and compete in their communities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important issue.</P>
        <P>At present there is a crisis relating to home help provision in County Roscommon.  Emergency cases are being denied home help hours due to a ban on the recruitment of home help staff by the Health Service Executive, HSE, though it has no difficulty in recruiting additional home help managers.  The crisis has also been caused by a HSE management directive issued in the past week that states home help hours for needy patients are not to be increased and new clients are not to be provided with a home help service.  In addition, the HSE has instructed that home help staff, even if sanctioned, cannot be appointed unless they go through a formal, 12-week recruitment process.  So much for dealing with emergency and vulnerable cases.</P>
        <P>This is extremely frustrating as there is plenty of money available to provide home help hours because less money has been spent in the first two months of this year than was provided for in the service plan.  So much for the Minister for Health and Children&rsquo;s commitment that there would be the same level of service in 2008 as 2007.</P>
        <P>A similar situation has arisen with the much sought after home care packages due to the same policy direction.  For an individual to avail of such a package a person currently in receipt of such a package must pass away.  Why should families be forced to monitor the death notices to see whether they will receive a service?  This is a national disgrace.</P>
        <P>The Government-supported HSE policy is having a disastrous impact on the quality of life of the elderly and disabled and their families.  John is 80 years of age and is in an acute hospital <Col N="265"/>bed but medical staff can do no more for him.  He requires care 24 hours a day and seven days a week.  He is doubly incontinent, 6 ft., 4 ins. tall and is completely bed-bound.  He wants to spend his final days in his own home and will rely on his only child, who has three young children between four and seven years of age, to provide the necessary care.  He has no other support.  The HSE is prepared to give over &euro;350 per week for a nursing home but it is not prepared to sanction even one hour per week to help this man live with dignity in his own home.  So much for the Minister for Health and Children&rsquo;s commitment to a fair deal for the elderly.</P>
        <P>Mary suffers from Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, has three young children and is in receipt of home help hours.  She cannot peel potatoes for her children&rsquo;s dinner yet she cares for her father-in-law.  All she wants is home help for one night each week to allow her one decent night&rsquo;s sleep.</P>
        <P>Bridie has just been released from hospital and has been granted four hours home help per day but the individual who is to provide that help has only one hour free each day.  As a result, Bridie is using her State old-age pension to provide private home help.</P>
        <P>The HSE is not using its full budget in County Roscommon and other counties; the money is there and that is not the problem.  The problem lies in the policy direction issued by the HSE with the Government&rsquo;s blessing.  We have been told time after time in this House that the Government has nothing to do with the day-to-day running of the health service but deals with policy issues.  This is a policy issue that is having a direct impact on the elderly and the most vulnerable people in my county and throughout the country.  The situation is very frustrating because funding is available.  The HSE can appoint managers to supervise the existing home help staff but cannot provide home help staff for much-needed emergency services in my community and throughout the country.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I will be taking the Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</P>
        <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue as it provides me with an opportunity to reaffirm the Government&rsquo;s commitment to services for older people generally and, in particular, to the importance attached to developing home help services locally.</P>
        <P>Government policy on older people is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  When this is not feasible, the health service supports access to quality long-term residential care, where this is appropriate.  This policy approach is renewed and developed in the latest partnership agreement, Towards 2016.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s objective of continued development of community-based services for older persons is reflected in the funding given to the system in recent times and I am glad the Deputy acknowledged this.  In the budgets of 2006 and 2007 over &euro;400 million was provided to enhance service developments across the sector.  Of this, just over &euro;190 million was for community-based services over the two years.</P>
        <P>Arising from budget 2008, a full-year package of &euro;22 million has been allocated for new services for older people.  This gives a total funding of over &euro;422 million for new services for older people over the past three years.</P>
        <P>Regarding the specific area of home help services, an additional &euro;33 million was given in 2006, which funded an extra 1.75 million home help hours.  This was augmented by a further &euro;18 million in 2007 that resulted in 780,000 extra hours coming on-stream.</P><Col N="266"/>
        <P>In 2007 the highlights of community-based services for older persons provided by the HSE nationally included the following: over 12.3 million home help hours; nearly 55,000 people had availed of home help services by the end of the year; over 4,000 home care packages assisted some 10,500 clients during the course of the year and these packages included an important home help element in many cases; and the use of over 21,000 day centre and respite places.</P>
        <P>The new funding package of &euro;22 million provided in the recent budget is designed to enhance important community initiatives, including &euro;4.6 million additional expenditure by the HSE for 200,000 extra home help hours this year.  The HSE expects to provide about 11.98 million home help hours nationally in 2008.</P>
        <P>The new services coming on-stream will improve the service delivery thresholds that the Government already had in place.  In this context, nearly &euro;56 million has been provided in the last three years for new home help services, thus expanding the service nationally by nearly 2.75 million hours over this period.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services, including the operational details relating to home help for the Roscommon area.</P>
        <P>The HSE has provided the following information.  The total number of clients in receipt of home help services in County Roscommon in January was 808, while the number of new applications for the month was 108.  The total number of home help hours provided for this period was 19,990.  With regard to the most recent local demand, the HSE indicates that 14 clients are waiting to start the service and 25 existing clients await increased hours.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>This situation is being addressed by the HSE in the context of the ongoing delivery of the service to individual clients.</P>
        <P>It is clear from the measures I have outlined that the Government has made considerable improvements nationally to home help provision and other community-based services for older people generally.  It is our intention that such services, including the home help initiative, will be improved incrementally in the coming years, in line with Government policies envisaged for the sector.  There is no doubt that demand can at times exceed service resources and that this problem can manifest itself in particular at local level.  However, it is a matter for the HSE to deliver services both nationally and locally in the context of its evolving priorities and overall resources.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Kathleen Lynch.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State is before us in the House I ask her to explain the actions she will take to address the substandard gynaecological services provided by Cork University Maternity Hospital.  Is the Minister of State aware of local general practitioners&rsquo; concerns that delays in the provision of gynaecological services are likely to result in delayed prognoses, creating a situation in which the health of women in the Cork area will be put in further danger.</P>
        <P>Patients with cancer, and those suspected of having cancer, are enduring undue suffering and unnecessary risk due to the current situation.  Correspondence I have received from a GP in the Cork area states that in a very short time some patient will suffer the terrible consequences of delayed diagnosis of cancer with a worse prognosis because of the inadequacy of the service, as currently delivered.</P><Col N="267"/>
        <P>There is a problem in Cork at present.  The problem is not in seeing the consultant which is the standard difficulty with the health service; a consultant can be seen in a short time in this area.  The problem is getting the tests and whatever procedures are necessary carried out.  Two theatres which are set up are lying idle.  The machinery and the equipment are in place.  Women are waiting at the doors of these theatres and cannot get in.</P>
        <P>In the Minister&rsquo;s response I do not want to hear words such as commitment, moving forward and budgetary expenditure, rather an explanation of how we have arrived at a situation where women&rsquo;s lives are in danger while two theatres are lying idle, although fully equipped.  Does she think this is acceptable?  What timeframe will she put in place to rectify this matter?  This is an ongoing problem with the HSE where project management is not being delivered.  We have seen it with the maternity hospital where a state-of-the-art facility was created and lay idle for more than a year because the Department could not get the agency operational.  That the same is happening in this department is unacceptable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch for sharing time.  From a position of having had three maternity hospitals, we now have one maternity hospital in Cork.  It is about time the Minister for Health and Children came into the House and took responsibility for what is happening in our health services.  I know what the Minister of State will say when she stands up.  </P>
        <P>One does not have a choice in Cork.  There is one maternity facility which is, by any standard, probably one of the most modern in Europe.  However, the difficulty is that what is available in that hospital is not available to the public.  On 22 November 2007 I tabled a series of parliamentary questions about this issue.  In every instance, the replies I received were about how good was the hospital, the number of theatres and the number of gynaecologists but what the Minister and the HSE did not say was that there are two theatres in that new facility which are chained.  There are chains on the doors of the fully equipped facility but there are no staff.  Neither was I told the number of women awaiting procedures.</P>
        <P>When a GP has to write to politicians to tell them their patients&rsquo; lives are being put at risk, it is a sad state of affairs.  At the Joint Committee on Health and Children today I listened once again to news of a delayed inquiry into awful things that happened in our health service.  Are we looking at another possible misdiagnosis in the whole area of women&rsquo;s health and is that what the Minister is prepared to stand over?</P>
        <P>I have heard the Minister say on numerous occasions that this facility is one of the best hospitals in the country.  Would the staff of any hotel go out and tell the outside world that the hotel was not working properly?  The answer, of course, is no.  We are not talking about bed and breakfast here but people&rsquo;s lives.  The Minister has to take responsibility for the fact that the taxpayers have put in place a state-of-the-art facility.  It is her job to staff it and ensure patients get the best treatment possible.</P>
        <P>One of other answers I got in regard to the da Vinci robot was that the first procedure was carried out in September.  This particular robot will continue to give a service which will ensure that patients will have very little scarring, very little invasion and will spend less time in hospitals.  Is this not the way forward?  What that reply did not tell us was that robot has yet to come into operation.  It was an insult to be told that the consultants in this area are putting together a cohort of patients to be treated by this robot.  The patients are queueing down the road.  There is no need to put a cohort of patients in place, they are waiting for this treatment.  The Minister has to take responsibility.  It is an absolute scandal.</P>

        <P>The Government is committed to the provision of high quality gynaecological services throughout the country, including in the Cork region.

	<P>There are three operating theatres in Cork University Maternity Hospital &mdash; one  obstetric and two gynaecological theatres.  The obstetric theatre is fully staffed and the hospital is currently recruiting senior nursing staff to open and lead the gynaecology theatre service.  In the interim, the gynaecology procedures continue to be carried out in the main theatres in Cork University Hospital.</P>
        <P>The HSE advises that preparations are under way for the phased opening of the gynaecology theatres in the maternity hospital.  It is planned that some minor surgical procedures will be carried out there on a trial basis on Thursday, 27 March with the aim of expanding the gynaecology from the first week in April.  The ultimate aim is to have the gynaecology theatre open on a five days per week basis.  These developments illustrate that gynaecological services continue to be improved in Cork University Hospital.</P>
        <P>In regard to the wider issue of cancer care, the HSE has designated Cork University Hospital as one of two cancer centres in the managed cancer control network for the HSE South.  The decisions of the HSE on four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased bais.  The delivery of cancer services on a programmatic basis will ensure equity of access to services and equality of patient outcome irrespective of geography.  Professor Tom Keane took up his position as interim director of the national cancer control programme last November.  Professor Keane will be engaging in detailed planning to facilitate the progressive, gradual and carefully managed transfer of services between locations over the next two years or so.</P><Col N="269"/>
        <P>A decision on the location of gynaecological cancer services for the HSE South cancer control network will be made by Professor Keane and the national cancer control programme.  The development of cancer services, and the continuing emphasis on improving cancer care, underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment &mdash; which I am glad to have the opportunity to put on the record &mdash; to providing accessible and safe services for patients in the southern region.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter.  This issue came to light when Limerick youth services contacted me a short time ago.  Since June 2006 more than 14 lone parents involved in F&Aacute;S-funded community training schemes, including leaving certificate applied and FETAC programmes, have left these two-year courses which are designed to enable participants to assimilate into the workforce.  Under this scheme, up to June 2006, a child care allowance was provided for the full duration of the course.  In early 2006 the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment instructed F&Aacute;S to carry out a review of the scheme and further instructed it to reduce the period of payment for the child care allowance to 52 weeks.  It is ludicrous that F&Aacute;S community training schemes must be for a period of two years but those taking them cannot continue, as they only receive the child care allowance for 52 weeks.  To make matters more ludicrous, a person who began the course in May 2006 will receive the payment for 104 weeks but someone who began in July 2006 only received it for 52 weeks.</P>
        <P>There are approximately 119 people undertaking the leaving certificate applied and FETAC programmes which come under Limerick youth services which do fantastic work.  Since June 2006 14 people have left the programme, while another three are hanging on by their fingertips and have family members and friends minding their children in an effort to stay on the programme.  There is no consistency of care for their children and they find it is impossible to continue on the course.</P>
        <P>The Minister must as a matter of urgency reverse the decision made in 2006.  It was not made as part of any budget measure.  It was done by stealth by the Department without full public knowledge of what was happening.  The allowance is &euro;63.50 per child attending day care and &euro;37.50 per child attending part-time day care because the child is attending primary school.  As a matter of urgency the Minister must reinstate the child care allowance for these F&Aacute;S-funded community training schemes, including leaving certificate applied and FETAC programmes, in order that the allowance is paid for the duration of the course &mdash; two years &mdash; rather than imposing a penal 52-week cap.  The purpose of the training schemes is to encourage people to enter the workforce.  In one way, they are being encouraged to take a course but in another the Government is pulling the rug from under them by reducing the duration of the allowance from 104 weeks to 52.  I want this decision reversed and await the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand F&Aacute;S provides support for the child care costs of persons who wish to undertake F&Aacute;S vocational training programmes.  The rates paid are a contribution towards the costs of child care and payment is made on the basis of the child care costs incurred by the person as a result of attending the F&Aacute;S training programme.</P>
        <P>The following categories are eligible for payment of the child care allowance: unemployed persons, those returning to work, early school leavers, refugees, members of the Traveller community, people with disabilities and lone parents.  The contribution is to be paid to those in the above categories who have been unemployed, unoccupied or working in the home for <Col N="270"/>at least six months prior to commencing the F&Aacute;S training programmes.  A primary carer of a child or children who needs child care in order to take up a training opportunity with F&Aacute;S is also eligible for the allowance.  A primary carer is &ldquo;a person who is not employed outside the home, not attending an educational or training course or not engaged in community or voluntary work for more than 15 hours per week&rdquo;.  Workers who have been made redundant may also receive the child care contribution on commencing a F&Aacute;S training course.</P>
        <P>Eligible training is restricted to specific training schemes, namely, bridging training programmes, specific skills training, traineeships, community training, return to work programmes, community training workshops and linked work experience.  Eligible children include children up to five years of age who have not started school and children attending primary school up to 13 years of age and who are in after-school care, with the allowance applying for the hours the recipient is on the F&Aacute;S training programme.  No payment will be made for the hours the child is at school.  However, if a child is still attending primary school after the age of 13 years and a trainee provides documentation to support this claim, the trainee can continue to receive the child care allowance.</P>
        <P>In 2001, having received approval to proceed with the payment of child care support for trainees, F&Aacute;S was directed to make the payment to the providers of child care rather than the trainees individually.  This requirement was based on the principle that the F&Aacute;S scheme should be as similar to that already in place within the Department of Education and Science.  F&Aacute;S reviewed the effectiveness of the child care payment in terms of the progression of trainees in 2003 and at the same time reviewed the internal procedural aspects of the payment.  A fundamental recommendation by F&Aacute;S staff and management from this review was that payments should be made directly to the trainee in place of it being made to providers of child care.  In June 2004 the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment responded that they were willing to consider payment directly to the trainee if F&Aacute;S tightened the payment procedure further and if any new arrangements or schemes had a sufficiently tight auditing system to prevent exploitation.  To this aim, the maximum number of weeks for which F&Aacute;S will contribute to child care payments has been capped at 52 weeks.</P>
        <P>My Department is willing to examine the situation regarding the 52-week cap with provisos on the need to consider the numbers and costs involved, and the impact of certain issues, including the potential ripple effect in terms of monetary and other impacts.  In order to progress this, F&Aacute;S is gathering the following information: the number potentially affected by the cap; the names of specific programmes or target groups, for example, specialist training providers and community training centres, and also the duration of relevant programmes; the additional costs if the cap was extended &mdash; a <i>pro rata</i> formula based on numbers could be applied; the potential impact this would have, for example, if F&Aacute;S extends this for particular groups, whether other groups would also be entitled to the same, or, if F&Aacute;S extended it to other groups, whether it would have budgetary implications; and any other issues or concerns.</P>
        <P>I understand that once this information is to hand, F&Aacute;S will present it to my Department outlining the historic context and the reasons for this condition to be reconsidered.  There is an undertaking by the Department to review the matter.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter, namely, the urgent need for the Minister for Education and Science to indicate her plans for the provision of a new community school in Glenamaddy, County Galway.  The frustration felt <Col N="271"/>by the board of management, parents, students and teachers has reached a level I have never before witnessed on an issue such as this.  For the past seven years all of the partners in education in Glenamaddy have co-operated fully with the Minister and the Department in order to achieve an amalgamation of Col&aacute;iste Seosaimh and St. Benin&rsquo;s vocational school in the town.  All of the community supported this move from the beginning and were promised a new school in return.  The Department has denied a rural community the opportunity to survive.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Glenamaddy is located in a CL&Aacute;R area.  Will the Minister and the Department further disadvantage the area by denying construction of the school?  Planning for a new school was processed quickly when a site was identified and secured.  The tendering process finally identified a contractor who was ready to start construction immediately.  Five years have passed and the patience of the board of management, parents, teachers and students has been exhausted.  What other community would tolerate a divided campus for a school?  One section of the school is a mile away on the other side of the village which presents a serious danger from traffic for students who travel from one part of the school to the other.  Educationally, students are losing out on classroom time and teacher contact.</P>
        <P>The school has one science laboratory and six science teachers.  So much for the Department&rsquo;s commitment to the improvement of science teaching in schools.  The school has one home economics room and three home economics teachers.  Construction studies are held one mile away from the main school.  PE facilities are totally inadequate.  The list goes on.  Is that satisfactory in the eyes of the Minister?  Are these facilities good enough for a school in County Galway?  Why are students in Glenamaddy disadvantaged in this way?  It is unacceptable that students currently in the school have to receive an education without proper facilities for all their second level education in this school, while others in leafy south Dublin, for example, have a state-of-the-art school with proper facilities.  Is this equity in education?</P>
        <P>It is of little use for the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, to tell me tonight of the resources that are being spent by the Government on the construction of new schools.  Nearly all the expenditure for 2008 will be spent in the Dublin and east coast area that was prioritised.  According to the Minister:</P>
        <P LI="1">Approximately &euro;600 million be spent this year on school buildings.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment...This investment will facilitate the provision of new schools and extensions in developing areas and the improvement of existing schools...The progression of all large-scale building projects from initial design stage through to construction phase is considered on an ongoing basis...[The] Department is committed to providing a new community school for Glenamaddy at the earliest possible date.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We have heard this jargon coming from the Department time and again.  What we want to hear tonight is a date when the new school will commence.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to immediately sanction the funding for this school so that the work can begin on the much-needed facilities.  Planning permission for the original school will run out in approximately six months&rsquo; time.  The Minister should honour the promises that were given at the time the amalgamation agreement was made seven years ago.  The priority that has been given solely to the east coast must be spread to the rest of the country.  I hope that Glenamaddy will be prioritised at this stage.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Because of the song, everybody has a fondness in their heart for Glenamaddy.  I apologise for the Minister&rsquo;s absence.  I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to outline to the House the Department&rsquo;s position regarding the provision of a new community school for Glenamaddy, County Galway.</P><Col N="272"/>
        <P>It is proposed to build a new community school in Glenamaddy with a floor area of approximately 5,200 m<?oasys _cf7- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> to cater for a long-term projected enrolment of 550 pupils.  This new school is to cater for the amalgamation of St. Joseph&rsquo;s convent school and the vocational school.  The amalgamated school is currently housed on the site of St. Joseph&rsquo;s convent school in a mixture of temporary and permanent accommodation.</P>
        <P>Tenders were originally received for the proposed new school in 2004.  However, due to delays in acquiring the site under the redress scheme it was not possible to accept a tender at that time.  The project was re-tendered in 2007 and a tender report for the project is currently under examination by the Department.  The contract for the project has not yet been awarded.</P>
        <P>Under the lifetime of the national development plan approximately &euro;4.5 billion will be invested in schools.  Approximately &euro;600 million will be spent this year on school buildings.</P>

	<P>This is a fact and it is important that we put it on record.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post-primary schools.  This investment will facilitate the provision of new schools and extensions in developing areas and the improvement of existing schools through the provision of replacement schools, extensions or large-scale refurbishments in the coming years.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large-scale building projects from initial design stage through to construction phase is considered on an ongoing basis in the context of the national development plan and the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.  The project referred to by the Deputy will likewise be considered in that context.  I reassure the Deputy that the Minister and her Department are committed to providing a new community school for Glenamaddy at the earliest possible date.</P>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> his views on reducing the rate of VAT charged on non-oral contraceptives to the minimum 5% rate in line with the EU VAT directive; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[7733/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the Finance Bill introduces an amendment to the VAT Act 1972 that will reduce the VAT rate applicable to non oral contraceptive products from 21% to 13.5%.  This is a significant reduction in itself which will take effect from the passing of the Finance Bill. It is hoped that this measure will address concerns raised by the various health bodies.</P>
        <P>In relation to the scope for further reduction of the VAT rate applicable to such products, the position is that the scope for reducing or removing the VAT rate applicable to any good or service is determined under EU VAT law, with which Irish law must comply. Under EU VAT law, it is not possible to introduce new zero rates of VAT, as we can only retain the zero rating that was in existence on 1 January 1991. As non oral contraceptive products were not subject to the zero rate on 1 January 1991 it would not be possible to apply the zero rate of VAT to condoms.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy suggests Member States may have up to two reduced VAT rates of not less than 5 per cent for a specified number of goods or services which are set out in Annex III of the EU VAT Directive. Contraceptive products are included in Annex III. Ireland in common with the vast majority of EU Member States operates a single reduced rate.</P>
        <P>Even though EU law does provide for the introduction of a second lower reduced rate of 5%, such a move would have major structural implications for the VAT system and I do not propose to radically change our VAT system structure for this purpose.</P><Col N="274"/>
        <P>Those calling for reduced consumption taxes, should be aware of the numerous determinants of price that explain the price variances across the EU. The level of VAT in practice only plays a small part in determining the price of such products in each Member State. Notwithstanding the above it is hoped that the VAT reduction introduced in the Finance Bill will lead to lower prices, and I hope that the retailer groups which were part of the campaign for the reduced prices will both reduce prices in line with the VAT reduction and look at their own pricing structures.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The premise on which this question is based appears to be that businesses should receive specific compensation through the tax system for the loss of business which they consider they have experienced or will experience as a result of works carried out by local authorities and others. I do not consider the tax system to be the appropriate mechanism through which to deal with matters of this kind. </P>
        <P>In the normal way, the tax system already provides relief to companies and businesses, generally, in relation to losses suffered by them in the course of their trade.  Trading losses can be set off against profits in the same accounting period. Such losses can also be set off against profits of the preceding accounting period, if the company or business carried on the trade in that period. Finally, trading losses can be set off against future profits of the same trade, unless the losses have been otherwise utilised.</P>

	<P>I want to assure the Deputy that the Government&rsquo;s position on our corporate tax regime is unambiguous. It is clearly stated in the Programme for Government that the 12 &frac12;% rate of corporation tax will remain.</P>
        <P>That commitment is protected, in an EU context, by the principle of unanimity in taxation matters. The draft Reform Treaty confirms that position.</P>
        <P>Although the Deputy does not specify what threats to the Irish corporate tax regime he has in mind, he may be referring to the Commission&rsquo;s technical work on a common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB) which has been the subject of much recent discussion.</P>
        <P>It is important to note there has been no political decision taken on the CCCTB at the level of the Council of Ministers. The Commission is carrying out technical work on various aspects of a CCCTB but has not yet made a formal proposal.</P>
        <P>As there has not been a formal proposal, it is very difficult to assess the impact of a CCCTB on Ireland and the EU overall. The Irish position on the CCCTB is well known and I will continue to highlight the difficulties I believe such a proposal could cause for individual Member States and overall EU competitiveness. There is, I believe, increasing scepticism among Member States as the Commission&rsquo;s technical work continues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposals published by the Commission begin the process which will lead to an agreement on the contributions of individual Member States towards meeting the EU targets agreed at the 2007 Spring Council. The Commission proposes that Ireland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020, based on 2005 emissions figures, and achieve an overall target of 16% of final energy consumption from renewable energy by 2020.</P>
        <P>The proposals set out by the Commission are complex and far reaching. They require detailed analysis and discussion at EU and domestic level and my Department will be central to this process. The cost in budgetary terms and the economic impact will depend on the methods used to achieve whatever target is finally set. Obviously, we will try to be as fiscally neutral as possible.</P>
        <P>The Government fully supports the objectives agreed at the Spring Council last year and the leadership shown by the EU&rsquo;s ambitions in this area of climate change. It is important that national circumstances and competitiveness impacts are considered in the context of finalising the EU&rsquo;s measures. In this regard, it is essential to ensure that the Irish situation in relation to the large difference between our Gross Domestic Product and Gross National Income, our infrastructural deficit, our recent and projected levels of population growth, and the relatively large size of Irish agriculture and its global competitiveness are all taken into account.</P>
        <P>It is important however, that we look positively on the challenge and not just dwell on the negatives. To the extent, for example, that extra capital spending generates fuel and other efficiencies in using natural resources this will be to our overall economic and fiscal benefit. The proposals for the Emissions Trading Scheme also involves new revenue streams for national Governments which will also form part of the policy mix.</P>
        <P>As I said in my Budget Speech this is a challenge for all citizens not just the Government and will involve choices being made and changes in behaviour to realise the ambition of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
        <P>The Government has been acting over recent years to begin to address the challenge of climate change and we will continue to work towards reducing emissions.  However, as I said before, these are Commission proposals and there is still some way to go before they become agreed policy.</P>

        <Quest> if he is satisfied with the progress being made to find a satisfactory system for deposit protection in credit unions. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) has since 1989, operated a savings protection scheme (SPS) for credit unions. The SPS aims to protect the individual savings of members by ensuring that credit unions are financially and administratively sound and provides for savings protection for each individual credit union member. </P>
        <P>It is important to note that under the SPS regime no member of a credit union has experienced any loss of shares and deposits and no credit union has become insolvent. The SPS has only been called upon in a very limited number of cases and it has never been necessary to make savings protection payments to individual credit union members. It is also important to note that sound prudential supervision by the Registrar of Credit Unions under the Credit Union Act, 1997 in ensuring the continuing solvency and liquidity of credit unions safeguards the interests of credit union savers.</P><Col N="276"/>
        <P>Section 46 of the Credit Union Act 1997 provides for approval of savings protection schemes by the Registrar of Credit Unions as the delegate of the Regulatory Authority. Once an approved scheme is in place under the Act it would be incumbent on all credit unions to participate. This highlights the importance of ensuring that an approved savings protection arrangement is consistent with the requirements of the credit union movement as a whole.</P>
        <P>In line with changes in the regulatory environment for financial services generally the need for modernisation of the credit union SPS has become evident over time. Proposals for reform of the SPS were the subject of discussions in 2007 between the Registrar and ILCU resulting in the submission of detailed proposals for the reform of SPS in November 2007. I have written to the Chairman of the Financial Regulator confirming my view that an approved savings protection scheme for all credit unions should be in place as soon as possible. In this respect the Chairman of the Financial Regulator has recently advised me that it is the intention of the Financial Regulator to deal with outstanding issues on SPS as quickly as possible. I will be continuing to monitor progress towards this objective in the coming weeks.</P>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> if in view of the decision of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the UK to increase the level of the deposit protection scheme for deposit holders to &pound;50,000, he will take steps to increase the deposit protection scheme here to a similar amount; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish deposit protection scheme complies with harmonised arrangements set out in the EU Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive 94/19/EC. The Directive currently provides for a level of protection of 90% of the loss incurred by a depositor when a credit institution cannot repay funds, subject to a maximum payment of &euro;20,000. The Exchequer or the CBFSAI do not fund the scheme; it is funded by a levy of 0.2% on bank deposits.</P>
        <P>In the wake of the recent turmoil in the global financial markets, the Ecofin Council of 9 October 2007 requested the Commission and the Financial Services Committee (FSC) to consider possible enhancements of the EU deposit guarantee scheme and to report back to the Council by mid-2008. Ireland is participating in this review and the parameters of the Irish deposit guarantee scheme will be reconsidered in the light of the outcome of the current review. In the meantime I consider it would not be appropriate to bring forward any changes to our scheme pending the outcome of that review.</P>
        <P>I think it is also well to bear in mind that while a good deposit protection scheme can help to support confidence in the banking system, the best safeguard of the financial system is the existence of and the effective operation of a sound regulatory and supervisory regime. I am glad to say that Ireland has been positively assessed by the IMF in that regard as recently as September 2007.</P>

	<P>In my role as the Minister for Finance I have responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial <Col N="277"/>regulation. The day-to-day responsibility for the supervision of financial institutions is a matter for the Financial Regulator. </P>
        <P>The Pensions Board is responsible for the regulation of occupational pension schemes and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts in Ireland as part of its statutory role to monitor and supervise the operation of the Pensions Act.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that pensions are long-term investments. While it is inevitable that the assets in which such funds have invested will experience periods of market volatility, professionally managed pension funds are generally able to ride out such volatility over time.</P>
        <P>In the Irish pension system, trustees have important responsibilities to ensure that investment choices are prudent and responsible and strike an appropriate balance between return and the risk inherent in all investments.</P>
        <P>In terms of public policy, short-term movements in financial markets have limited effects on wider economic trends.  Of course, any deterioration in financial market conditions sustained over a prolonged period of time could, potentially, spill over into economic developments.  In this regard, it is important to remember that the fundamentals of the Irish economy remain strong and that the economy has responded quickly and effectively to changing economic conditions in the past.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 36 together.</P>
        <P>As I have informed the House on previous occasions, the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 already allows the Standards in Public Office Commission to carry out investigations on its own initiative, where it considers it appropriate to do so, on breaches of the provisions of the Ethics legislation, by persons in the Commission&rsquo;s area of responsibility, and as provided for by the legislation.</P>
        <P>The Deputies will, of course, be aware that issues concerning a non-office-holding member of the Oireachtas would, in the first instance, be a matter for the Select Committee on Member&rsquo;s Interests of the relevant House.</P>
        <P>As regards the other changes to the Ethics legislation recommended by the Standards Commission in its last Annual Report, I do not propose to amend the definition of the term &ldquo;specified act&rdquo; used in the legislation, or to legislate for a complaint concerning failure to abide by certain defined ethical standards.  The existing definition of &ldquo;specified act&rdquo; aims to strike a fair balance, and there are already Codes of Conduct to guide the ethical behaviour of Oireachtas members, office-holders and civil servants in their day-to-day business and these codes can be taken into account by the Standards Commission in an investigation of an alleged breach of the legislation.</P><Col N="278"/>
        <P>As regards inquiry officers, again I have informed the House previously that I have no plans to amend the law to enable the Standards Commission to appoint an inquiry officer without having received a complaint. It is reasonable that a complaint to the Standards Commission should be required to commence the inquiry process, which, in itself, can carry serious consequences for the person who is to be the subject of it.  Numerous categories of persons, including members of the public and any public representative, are entitled to make a complaint against the persons and office holders against whom complaints can be made to the Commission.</P>
        <P>The other Standards Commission amendments are technical.  One of them &mdash; about the furnishing of &ldquo;nil&rdquo; statements &mdash; is already provided for in the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007.  Another concerns statutory declarations of tax compliance under the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, and relates to extending the period within which proceedings can be taken in relation to false or misleading declarations.  Section 34 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006, about to be taken at Report Stage in this House, would extend that period in relation to statutory declarations generally, including those required under the Standards in Public Office Act 2001.</P>
        <P>I aim to circulate amendments to cater for the remainder of the Standards Commission&rsquo;s recommendations in advance of the Committee Stage debate on the Bill when it is being taken in the House.  My intention, assuming agreement among the Whips, is that the Bill should be taken in the current session.</P>

	<P>On Budget day, my Department projected a GDP growth rate of 3 per cent for this year and a GNP growth rate of 2.8 per cent. While lower than in recent years this is still a robust rate of economic growth given the prevailing international conditions. </P>
        <P>A General Government deficit of -0.9 per cent of GDP in 2008 and a General Government debt level of around 26 per cent of GDP at end-2008 were projected in Budget 2008.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the 2005 income tax year was the first year for which it was possible to capture the number of returns of income and gains made by persons not domiciled in the State.  The number of individuals that show they are not domiciled in the State on their 2005 return of income is 4,955.  In addition, the 2005 returns show 2,239 spouses as non-domicile.  Returns for 2006 were due to be filed by 31st October 2007 or, in the case of returns made on ROS (Revenue&rsquo;s online system), by 15 November 2007.  The data capture of information of these returns is currently under way and when completed will facilitate the compilation of statistics for 2006. </P>
        <P>I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that inquiries relating to residence are a feature of the risk-based programmes operated by Revenue. The procedures adopted in relation to validating non-resident status depend on the circumstances in each case and, as with other procedures, they are reviewed by Revenue on a regular basis.  The administration of the validation procedures is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners and the methods used to verify claims to non-residence include a range of tests and an intelligence dimension which, for obvious reasons, they do not publicise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, within the implementation of the overall legislative framework, private sector credit growth and debt levels are, in the first instance, a matter for the Central Bank and the Financial Services Authority of Ireland (CBFSAI). This follows from its role as part of the European System of Central Banks and its functions, as the Financial Regulator, in relation to the prudential supervision of financial institutions and the protection of the consumers of those firms.</P>
        <P>The CBFSAI reported in its December 2007 Monthly Statistics that demand for credit in 2007 was moderate compared to 2006 and previous years. The rate of increase in private-sector credit in December on a year-on-year basis at 17% was the lowest in five years, while borrowing by households for house purchase was subdued in 2007, compared with the previous two years.</P>
        <P>It is important that the increase in personal indebtedness in Ireland over recent years is seen in the context of the strong economic performance, the achievement of record employment levels and sustained increases in after-tax incomes. Low levels of interest rates reflecting Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the eurozone, the household sector&rsquo;s overall net worth, and the prospect of the continuation of robust economic growth in the Irish economy by international standards support the sustainability of current levels of personal indebtedness. The strong state of Ireland&rsquo;s public finances and the overall balance sheet position of Irish households where there has been significant accumulation of assets over recent years also highlight the extent to which the Irish economy continues to be well-positioned to respond to changes in the overall financial environment. It is, of course, important to continue to enhance the competitiveness of the Irish economy through moderation in growth in pay costs, increases in productivity and through the continued adoption of prudent and responsible budgetary policies in order to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s economic growth remains in line with its underlying potential.</P>
        <P>As far as safeguarding the interests of individual borrowers is concerned, the function of Government is to provide an appropriate legislative framework for effective and efficient regulation of the financial services sector, one that is both comprehensive and robust. I am satisfied <Col N="280"/>that on foot of the progress made over recent years, through such measures as the establishment of the Financial Regulator with a statutory consumer protection mandate and the Financial Services Ombudsman we have such a framework in place in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In this context, the introduction of the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code last year represents a major step in promoting the interests of consumers.  The Code places obligations on regulated entities that provide credit which includes the requirement to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests to seek appropriate information about the consumer and ensure that the products and services provided are suitable to the consumer. They must also treat their customers fairly and have adequate procedures in place to handle complaints and arrears.  These obligations are additional to the statutory prior information and warnings required under the Consumer Credit Act, 1995.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator has also drawn attention to the need for consumers to choose the right type of loan for their needs and has developed a number of specific initiatives to help consumers make informed choices in terms of the financial products they choose, the amount of risk they take on and the cost of financial products. These initiatives include publishing consumer guides on credit products, fact sheets, cost surveys on personal loans and other retail financial products, all of which are intended to assist borrowers in making the most appropriate credit decisions given their circumstances.</P>
        <P>In my role as Minister for Finance, I have consistently highlighted the need for responsible behaviour by both borrowers and lenders and in particular the need to factor into their financial decision making the effects of potential future changes in economic and financial conditions.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to note that anyone experiencing difficulty in repaying a loan of any kind should discuss the matter with the loan provider and seek appropriate advice without delay. The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) which falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, is a national, free, confidential and independent service for people in debt, or in danger of getting into debt.  MABS offices, throughout the country, work with people in order to assist them with their financial planning and budgeting for the future.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 92 together.</P>
        <P>The Government approved some 90 formal Value for Money Reviews to be carried out for the period 2006-2008.  This programme of reviews focuses on significant areas of expenditure and major policy issues.</P>
        <P>Value for Money and Policy Reviews are part of a package of changes that I have introduced to the Estimates and Budget processes in recent years to move resource allocation policy away from a narrow focus on financial inputs, on to a broader consideration of performance and the delivery of outputs and outcomes.</P><Col N="281"/>
        <P>To date, 49 reviews are complete or almost complete under the 2006-2008 round.  Responsibility for carrying out each of the reviews and for publishing them and submitting them to the Select Committees rests with the individual Departments and Offices and details of any individual review should be sought from the relevant Minister.</P>
        <P>The reviews when completed will normally be published and submitted to the relevant Select Oireachtas Committee for consideration and in this regard consideration of Value for Money and Policy Reviews is now included in the Orders of Reference for the Select Committees.  I have also written to the Select Committee Chairpersons earlier this month to encourage them to ensure that time is scheduled to consider the reviews in detail, and where appropriate, to discuss the reviews and their conclusions and recommendations with the relevant Departments and Offices.</P>
        <P>In respect of the reviews under my own Department and the Offices for which I have responsibility the following is the position:</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Value for Money and Policy Review of the Grant-in-Aid payment to the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) contained five recommendations, all of which are in the process of being implemented. The recommendations are intended to improve the overall value for money for the grant-in-aid. Among other things, they are directed at relating funding to outputs; benchmarking the ESRI with comparable institutes in other EU member states, and periodically reviewing the policy relevance of the Institute&rsquo;s research. The level of the grant in aid has not changed significantly as a result of the review.</P>
        <P>The Information Society Fund terminated at the end of 2005 in line with its intended lifespan. As a result, an annual allocation for the fund is no longer required. The Fund was focused on initiatives in the areas of Electronic Government and Electronic Commerce.</P>
        <P>The focus of the Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSI) Review was largely on policy aspects relating to the payment of the grant-in-aid and several of the recommendations should contribute to the efficiency of the organisation and reduce not only the direct Exchequer grant, but also the payments for services made to the organisation by both the public and private sector. One of the recommendations of this Review was that responsibility for Ordnance Survey Ireland should move to the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. This change took effect from 1st January, 2008. The DCENR will be better placed to comment on further progress achieved as the other recommendations of the Review are implemented.</P>
        <P>With regard to the reviews of Procurement Management within the Department, Construction Procurement Reform Initiative (formerly Procurement Management Reform) and the Civil Service Childcare Initiative, it is not possible to anticipate the consequences of these reports until their findings are finalised, considered and implemented.</P>

	<P>As I have previously indicated, the responsibility for undertaking project appraisals rests in the first instance with the individual Departments and Agencies. They are prepared to facilitate and inform the internal decision making process.  It has not been the practice to publish these appraisals as they generally contain commercially sensitive information, the publication of which could be prejudicial to the State&rsquo;s capacity to get best value for money in procurement of capital projects. In these circumstances, I would not consider it appropriate to require that details of appraisals of NDP projects be published as a matter of course.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to examine the scope for reducing the VAT rate on environmental goods and services from the standard VAT rate of 21 per cent to the reduced rate of 13.5 per cent. I should mention that this is just one of a number of initiatives in the Programme aimed at delivering a cleaner environment. </P>
        <P>When considering a change in the VAT treatment of a good or service, it is important to bear in mind that the scope for such change is derived from EU law with which Irish VAT law must comply. In this regard, the rate of VAT that applies to a particular good or service is determined by the nature of the good or service, and not by the environmental impact of the good or service. There is no provision in European VAT law that would allow the application of a reduced VAT rate on supplies of goods or services based on their environmental impact per se.</P>
        <P>As I announced in the Budget, the VAT rate on the supply of Mischantus rhizomes, seeds bulbs and similar inputs used for the agricultural production of biofuels is being reduced from 21% to 13.5% with effect from 1 March 2008. This measure will assist in the development of agricultural production of such fuels.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>As of December 2007, there were 12 Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects with a capital value of over &euro;20 million operational in three sectors: four in the roads sector, three in the education sector, and five in the environmental services sector. Fuller information on these is provided by the relevant sponsoring Department/Agency and is available at www.ppp.gov.ie</P>
        <P>In general, under the Capital Appraisal Guidelines and the system of delegated capital sanction, the appraisal and management of PPP projects is a matter for the Accounting Officer in <Col N="283"/>the Department/Agency sponsoring the project.  Where specialist agencies are in place in particular sectors, such as the National Roads Authority and the Railway Procurement Agency, it would be a matter for these agencies in the first instance to assess the success of individual projects.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out in reporting on PPPs, however, it will take some time to assess the full value for money of particular PPPs.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the PPP mechanism, in general, is a viable option for the delivery of infrastructural projects.  Some have been notable successes in bringing in projects ahead of time; some others less so.  PPPs will continue to be used where justified.</P>
        <P>For this reason, medium term targets for the use of PPP procurement are contained in the Multi-Annual Capital Investment Framework 2008 to 2012.  The total PPP target for the period 2008 to 2012 is &euro;7.7bn which represents over 13% of the envelope overall.  This target relates to projects remunerated over the long term (typically 25-30 years) by unitary payments from Department/Agencies&rsquo; Votes.  In addition, a target of &euro;1.6bn has been set for PPP projects remunerated by user charges which brings the overall target for PPP funded capital investment to approximately 16% of the envelope overall.  These targets illustrate the important role that PPP procurement will play in the delivery of public infrastructure and services.</P>

	<P>Budget 2008 was published on 5 December last year. It contains forecasts for all the main macroeconomic variables in 2008, including the forecast rate of unemployment and the growth rate in employment. </P>
        <P>These forecasts of the main macroeconomic variables were taken into account by my Department when producing estimates of expenditure and tax revenue for 2008.</P>
        <P>The economic projections assume a modest rise in unemployment, as measured on the internationally recognised basis &mdash; the labour force survey, to average 5.6 per cent this year, from an estimated outturn of 4.6 per cent in 2007. At the same time employment is forecast to continue to show net gains of some 24,000 or a 1.1 per cent increase. However, this is not expected to fully absorb the projected increase in the labour force, so that a modest rise in unemployment is expected. The Budget 2008 tax revenue forecasts, which assume an increase in revenue of 3.5 per cent, have not been revised.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 53, 113 and 114 together.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government states that the Government will continue to move ahead with decentralisation and ensure that no public servant is obliged to accept decentralisation against their wishes and that promotion opportunities remain available.</P>
        <P>A progress report by the Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG) was submitted to me and published on 8th October last. The Group reported that implementation of the civil service element of the Decentralisation Programme is progressing satisfactorily.</P>
        <P>Over eleven thousand civil and public servants have applied to relocate under the Programme. Of these, over 6,000 or 55% are currently based in Dublin. The Central Applications Facility (CAF) remains open and continues to receive applications.</P>
        <P>At the end of 2007, decentralising organisations had a presence in 33 towns.  Approximately four thousand staff had been assigned to decentralising posts and over 2,000 of these are currently in their new locations, while the remainder are being trained in advance of decentralisation to a new location, as soon as accommodation becomes available.  Taking account of both posts moved and assignments, 48% of the civil service general service posts have already moved or have staff in place with a commitment to move. The comparable figure for the civil service professional &amp; technical staff is 25% and present indications are that it is in the order of 20% for the State Agency sector.</P>
        <P>From the announcement of the Programme in December 2003, the focus has been on detailed planning and organisation of the property, staffing and business aspects.  The DIG has considered it essential that all organisations take the necessary time to prepare this groundwork well in order to ensure effective implementation of a programme of this scale and complexity. In short, its focus has not been on how speedily the programme can be achieved but how well. It is important to remember that the programme is not just about moving public services. It fundamentally impacts on the staff in those organisations, on their career choices and their expectations.</P><Col N="285"/>
        <P>Property or sites have been acquired or their acquisition is well advanced in a total of 38 locations.  In addition, the OPW have been very efficient in securing suitable advance or temporary accommodation in over 20 locations to facilitate early phasing of business units.</P>
        <P>The October DIG report provides an update of the OPW timeframes for the expected completion of permanent accommodation. The OPW conducts a review of the property timeframes for permanent accommodation on an ongoing basis and is keeping these timeframes under review based on its experience to date in relation to property selection and acquisition, brief and design issues, tendering periods, planning issues and contractual arrangements.</P>
        <P>I remain confident that the public service will deliver this programme in a considered, sensible and sensitive manner. The Government is anxious to ensure that the momentum of the programme is maintained and developed and in that context Secretaries General of decentralising Departments have been asked to review these timeframes in association with the OPW and the DIG to assess where earlier progress could be made either in relation to permanent accommodation or advance accommodation.</P>
        <P>There are, however, a number of challenges remaining, which have been identified by the DIG in its latest report. My Department and the wider management of the public service will continue to work closely with staff representatives to seek appropriate solutions to address the concerns of the professional &amp; technical staff in the civil service and those employed in state agencies, while also ensuring the delivery of the Government programme.</P>
        <P>With regard to the State Agencies, the DIG has noted, in its most recent report that the pace of progress in relation to the State Agency part of the programme continues to be slow.  It expects that all Agencies should now, at a minimum, have initiated HR recruitment policies to support the programme, have begun to put phased timeframes in place and be actively securing advance and/or permanent accommodation solutions in the decentralised location. It also continues to emphasise the central role of the Board and management in each Agency in driving forward the implementation of the programme.</P>
        <P>The Government has always recognised that the State Agency aspect of the programme presents different challenges from that of the Civil Service but is determined to make progress towards the objective of moving all the State Agency posts as announced in December 2003. I anticipate considerable progress on this element of the programme over the lifetime of this Government.  With a view to advancing this aspect of the programme, the DIG is currently engaging in a round of meetings with each Agency&rsquo;s CEO and the Secretary General of the parent Department in each case.</P>
        <P>The Labour Court recommendation in relation to the dispute between F&Aacute;S and SIPTU provides a renewed opportunity for both unions and management to address the relevant issues.  My Department has been in contact with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to establish how progress can be made on this aspect of the Labour Court recommendation and I remain confident that through dialogue and negotiation, progress can be advanced.</P>
        <P>The estimated gross cost of the property aspects of the original decentralisation programme was &euro;900m at the outset of the programme (2004 prices).  This was based on provision of accommodation for 10,300 staff outside of Dublin.</P>
        <P>The overall number of staff for which accommodation is required has increased since the announcement of the programme due to additional bodies and locations being added to the programme, changes to business functions of certain organisations, additional space required for work-sharing staff, planned future expansion etc. and consolidation of certain existing regional offices into new buildings.  Based on the costs incurred to date, the OPW anticipates <Col N="286"/>that the direct cost of providing accommodation for this increased number of staff will be contained within the overall envelope.</P>
        <P>While the majority of posts have not yet moved from Dublin, the OPW has been able to dispose of property in Dublin being held for future needs because the announcement of the decentralisation programme clarified that most of the future expansion of Civil Service accommodation would not be in central Dublin.  Total income from such property disposed of between January 2004 and December 2007 was &euro;387.5m.  In addition property valued at &euro;75 million was transferred to the Affordable Homes Partnership.  In addition OPW has agreed joint venture redevelopment schemes with a minimum value of circa &euro;125m up to the end of 2007 and further ongoing large property disposals are planned having regard to progress with staff moves.</P>
        <P>As expected, non-property costs have been increasing since the beginning of 2007 as more advance accommodation is in place, staff training has increased and actual moves have taken place.  At end June 2007, the total non-property costs incurred amount to approximately &euro;9m. This reflects the significant rate of progress across decentralising organisations this year in furthering their implementation arrangements. Figures for the remainder of the year are being collated at present.</P>

	<P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the recommendations concerning VAT made by Forf&aacute;s in their &ldquo;Review of the European Single Market&rdquo; of January 2008. In this regard, Forf&aacute;s calls for new VAT rules for cross-border business to be introduced which would shift the place of taxation to where services are consumed, to replace the existing rules based on the location of the supplier.  </P>
        <P>The position is that the new rules providing for the shift in taxation to the place of consumption for cross-border services were adopted by the EU Council for Economic and Financial Affairs (ECOFIN) at its meeting on 12 February 2008. The new rules which cover business-to-business (B2B) and certain business-to-consumer (B2C) services were agreed as part of a package of VAT measures designed to streamline and simplify the VAT system for cross-border traders. The measures also include new procedures enabling cross-border traders to apply online through their home Member State for VAT refunds due from other Member States. This change from the existing paper-based system should make for a more efficient service to traders.</P>
        <P>The new rules for cross-border B2B transactions will be introduced on 1 January 2010. The new B2C rules, which will cover telecommunications, broadcasting services and electronic services, will be brought into force on 1 January 2015. A &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo; facility will support the new B2C arrangements allowing service providers to fulfil their VAT registration and declaration obligations online in respect of the Member States where they conduct business.</P>
        <P>Ireland was supportive of the new VAT measures for cross-border services which, in line with Government policy, should reduce the administrative burden on business and thereby deliver a more attractive environment for traders operating across the Internal Market.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 74 together.</P>
        <P>I would note that although various technical work has been taking place, the Commission has not yet made any formal proposal in relation to the common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB) proposition, and I would hope that the Commission will reflect on the considerable scepticism and opposition to the proposition among Member States before deciding whether to make any such proposal.</P>
        <P>It is important also to remember that there have been no political decisions taken on the CCCTB at the level of the Council of Ministers.</P>
        <P>Considering that the Commission has not yet brought forward a proposal it is very difficult for us or any other Member State to estimate its impact with any precision. However, it seems very likely that if, theoretically, such a system were to be introduced, it could give rise to considerable disruption of foreign direct investment activities, could create a disincentive for the location of such investment within the EU, could reduce the ability of Governments, especially in smaller and faster developing member states, to manage their own fiscal affairs, and would be divisive in Europe.</P>

	<P>As I have indicated in previous responses, the Programme for Government is a five year programme in which a number of guiding principles in relation to economic and budgetary matters have been set out.</P>
        <P>In October 2007 I published the Pre-Budget Outlook which set out the cost of providing for the existing level of services over the medium term. As the Deputy is aware, the first instalment of the delivery of the Programme for Government &mdash; Budget 2008 &mdash; was published in December. Budget 2008 announced all new spending and taxation measures in a single, unified way and was a significant reform providing for greater transparency.</P>
        <P>Budget 2008 also sets out the latest budgetary and economic assessment for the coming three years with forecast General Government deficits of &minus;0.9 per cent of GDP in 2008, &minus;1.1 per cent of GDP in 2009 and &minus;1.0 per cent of GDP in 2010. This fiscal position is predicated on a somewhat weaker economic outlook than was generally anticipated at the time the Programme for Government was agreed in the summer of 2007.</P>
        <P>The current assessment, as set out in the Budget, that GDP growth will average 3&frac12; per cent over the period 2008-2010 has not been revised. As was noted at Budget time, there are risks, both internal and external, to the economic forecasts and my Department will continue to monitor the situation closely.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the proposed scheme of accelerated capital allowances for expenditure on specified energy-efficient equipment, companies will have the benefit of writing-off the full cost of such equipment against their taxable income in the year the expenditure is incurred. Under existing arrangements, companies benefit from wear and tear allowances on the cost of such equipment at a rate of 12.5% per annum over a period of 8 years where the equipment qualifies as plant and machinery. </P>
        <P>The additional cost to the Exchequer in terms of tax revenue foregone arising from this incentive will depend on the extent to which it encourages more companies to invest in the specified energy-efficient equipment than would do so in the absence of the accelerated allowances. As this will depend on the take-up of the incentive, it is not feasible to provide a precise estimate of this cost. By way of illustration, however, if as a result of this incentive 5,000 additional items of qualifying energy-efficient equipment were purchased than would otherwise be the case under each class of technology, then assuming expenditure at the minimum qualifying amount for the equipment in each class, the additional cost in tax foregone would amount to about &euro;6 million over the proposed lifetime of the incentive. In order to contain Exchequer costs, however, this incentive will only be available to the corporate business sector and it will operate for a period of three years.</P><Col N="289"/>
        <P>It should be borne in mind that there will also be benefits and savings to investing companies as well as the economy and the environment generally, from the increased use of energy-efficient equipment.  Putting a monetary value on these benefits is not a simple matter, but this incentive should be viewed in the nature of a &ldquo;pump priming&rdquo; exercise which will operate over three years. It is hoped that over time companies and business will see the ongoing value of investing in energy-efficient equipment in terms of the improved economic returns to themselves as well as the environmental benefits to society, generally.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>At the outset, I would point out to the Deputy that the Government have taken steps last October in Section 19 of the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2007, which amended Part V of the Central Bank Act 1997, to provide for an appropriate system of authorisation and supervision of retail credit firms engaged in specialist or so-called sub-prime lending and home reversion providers not previously subject to financial regulation in respect of lending activities. The primary purpose of this amendment was to extend to customers of these firms the benefit of the consumer protections provided for in the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code. This regulatory system came into effect on 1 February last.</P>
        <P>Non-traditional or specialist mortgages, sometimes referred to as sub-prime mortgages, are estimated to account for about 1% to 2 % of the Irish mortgage market, compared to about 15 % in the US. In Ireland, these products have provided a new mortgage mechanism for customers who might previously have experienced difficulty obtaining a mortgage from a mainstream lender because, for example, of the nature of their work, they are new to Ireland, or they have impaired credit histories. It is important to note that specialist lenders have provided access to credit for these individuals and households who are then in a position to build up or restore a credit record in order to re-finance with mainstream commercial financial service providers. The CBFSAI in its Financial Stability Report 2007 found that the Irish banking <Col N="290"/>sector has a minimal level of involvement in the Irish residential mortgage market for these non-traditional customers. The Report states that the Irish market is characterised by limited mainstream banks&rsquo; involvement in the market, the relatively very small size of the market and generally modest average loan-to-value ratios.</P>
        <P>At the EU level, there is a co-ordinated response to financial stability arrangements and the ability of authorities to respond to market developments, largely set out in the set of common principles and a roadmap of further actions published at the conclusion of the ECOFIN Ministers&rsquo; meeting on 9 October, 2007. Ireland is participating fully in this work to ensure there is an effective EU-wide system to maintain financial stability taking into account the important cross-border linkages that now exist in EU financial markets.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the steps taken at national level and the work underway at EU level represent an appropriate response to the need to safeguard financial stability.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54, 80 and 89 together.</P>
        <P>I announced the establishment of a Commission on Taxation on Thursday 14 February 2008. I also announced the terms of reference of the Commission. They state that the Commission is requested to report on the results of its examination and consideration and to make such recommendations as, and when, it thinks fit to the Minister for Finance but not later than 30 September 2009.</P>
        <P>I reject the assertion that the membership of the Commission on Taxation is not balanced. The membership of the Commission consists of representatives from the Social Partners &mdash; representing the business, trade union, farming and voluntary sectors &mdash; the accounting and tax advisory sectors that advise private sector business, both small and large, and includes economic expertise and people who have wide experience in central and local government. As I said when I announced the membership of the Commission, I believe that the wide range of skills and knowledge of the members of the Commission will help ensure that we get a report that can help shape future policy in a positive manner.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 62 together. </P>
        <P>The European Commission&rsquo;s assessment represents a reasonable view of the Irish economy. While it refers to the challenges of a &ldquo;transition to a period of lower economic growth, mainly linked to a return to more sustainable activity in the housing sector&rdquo;, it also acknowledges the overall strong position of the public finances.</P>
        <P>Ireland is in full compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact requirements and the Government is committed to respecting the terms of the Pact as the economy adjusts to a period of slower growth.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the challenges, we must not lose sight of the fact that our overall growth performance of the order of 3 per cent for this year is still impressive by international standards. Furthermore, those that have produced forecasts for 2009 and 2010, expect our growth prospects to pick up in these years.</P>
        <P>The Government accepts that there can be no unnecessary loosening of fiscal policy and, in that context, the implementation of the National Development Plan remains a key priority. It will help boost the productive capacity of the economy and lay the foundations for future growth.</P>
        <P>Ireland has recorded surpluses on the public finances in ten of the last eleven years and we have one of the lowest levels of public debt in the EU. The maintenance of stable public finances remains the cornerstone of Irish economic policy supported by a tax system which will remain conducive to enterprise and investment.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s objective in entering talks on the Social Partnership Agreement is to achieve a sustainable agreement compatible with improving competitiveness and productivity.</P>
        <P>Towards 2016 is a ten-year framework social partnership agreement covering the period 2006 to 2016. The current national pay deal &mdash; the first pay agreement under Towards 2016 &mdash; expires at various dates in the private sector and at the end of September 2008 in the public service. Talks on a new pay agreement are expected to commence in April.</P>
        <P>Public Service pay must develop in a manner that is consistent with competitiveness, price stability and budgetary policy. Government policy on public service pay is that the public service should be in a position to attract and retain its fair share of good quality staff at all levels. It should neither lead the market not trail it.</P><Col N="293"/>
        <P>Pay developments in the period immediately ahead must reflect the more challenging economic and competitiveness scenario that we now face and be more directly linked to changes in productivity.</P>
        <P>It is crucial that wage expectations are kept in line with the rapidly changing economic environment in which we are operating. Over the last number of years, wage increases have exceeded productivity growth, with a resulting loss in competitiveness. Regaining market share will require an approach to wage determination which takes greater account of productivity developments as well as labour cost developments in our major trading partners.</P>
        <P>One of the core strengths of Social Partnership has been its strong foundation in realism regarding the nature of the competitive challenge for Ireland. It is important that all of us in the public service continue to work to ensure that the services we provide are the best possible, within available resources. The structures we have put in place in the public service pay agreements are an important mechanism to help ensure that we achieve that goal. We need to build on that base in what is agreed in the coming negotiations.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Revenue has no solid basis on which to estimate the numbers entitled to refunds of DIRT in excess of those who annually seek and are granted tax refunds.</P>
        <P>A refund of deposit interest retention tax is provided for in very limited circumstances only, viz. an individual who is not liable or fully liable to income tax and is over 65 years of age at some time during the tax year or is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental/physical infirmity from maintaining himself or herself. (Bodies qualifying for &lsquo;charitable&rsquo; status and companies are also entitled to refund of DIRT). The taxpayer must advise Revenue that he or she meets the legislative requirements and the amount of the retention tax suffered. With deposit interest rates being relatively low in recent years, the quantum of the interest earned and tax retained would be very small in many cases and it may be considered uneconomic to reclaim.</P>
        <P>However, the number of people claiming refunds and the amounts for the years 2002-2007 is summarised in the table hereunder.  This may not include some taxpayers whose DIRT refunds were processed as part of a self-assessment tax return.</P>

        <P FLI="0">In Section 34 of the Finance Act 2007, I introduced a new scheme to allow the operation of DIRT exempt savings accounts subject to two conditions: (1) the account holder must be aged 65 years of age or over or be permanently incapacitated; and (2) their total income must not <Col N="294"/>exceed the relevant exemption threshold, i.e. &euro;19,000 (for an individual) or &euro;38,000 (for a married couple).</P>
        <P>Provisional figures show that in 2007 some 47,218 such accounts were operated. These figures will increase as the remaining financial institutions file returns for 2007.</P>
        <P>In 2007, Revenue widely publicised these changes. An Information Leaflet (DE1) giving comprehensive information for qualifying taxpayers on how to have interest credited to their savings accounts without deduction of DIRT was made available at Revenue offices. Information on DIRT exemption was also included on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie.</P>
        <P>Application forms and information leaflets were also made available at most financial institutions. Revenue also arranged for an information leaflet to be issued to social welfare customers in receipt of state and other pensions. Approximately 100,000 leaflets were issued in this way. Information on the DIRT exemption was also included in Age Action&rsquo;s monthly magazine &ldquo;Ageing Matters&rdquo; in June 2007.</P>
        <P>During 2008, Revenue will continue to examine a range of channels or means to target the over 65s and it plans to publicise the facility offered by the accounts, including posters in local offices, contact with representative bodies, financial institutions, other Government Departments and agencies, and relevant advertising.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the impact of the decline in the construction sector on the economy; if he is satisfied that the budgetary framework of revenues and expenditures set out by him in Budget 2008 remains viable in view of the changed international financial environment and the revised downward projection of housing construction and GNP growth here for 2008; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>At Budget time, my Department estimated that new house completions in 2008 would be around 55,000 units. This is below the level experienced in recent years and will exert a drag on economic growth this year. Activity in other areas of the construction sector, including the National Development Plan, is expected to remain reasonably healthy.  Thus, in overall terms, GNP growth of 2.8 per cent for this year was forecast at Budget time. While lower than that seen in recent years this is still a robust rate of growth given the prevailing international conditions. </P>
        <P>Of course, as was noted at Budget time, there are risks, both internal and external, to these economic forecasts and my Department will, as always, continue to monitor the situation closely.</P>
        <P>It is important to remember that the fundamentals of the Irish economy remain strong and that the economy has responded quickly and effectively to changing economic conditions in the past. Short-term movements in financial markets have limited effects on wider economic trends. Of course, any sustained deterioration in financial market conditions could, potentially, spill over into economic developments.</P>
        <P>As regards the projections for tax and expenditure it is still very early in the year and the budgetary forecasts have not been changed. Overall, current spending is budgeted to increase by approximately &euro;4 billion or around 8 per cent, capital spending by approximately &euro;1 billion or around 12 per cent and tax revenues by just over &euro;1.6 billion or 3&frac12; per cent in 2008. The General Government debt level is projected to be around 26 per cent of GDP at end 2008, one of the lowest levels in the euro area.</P><Col N="295"/>
        <P>As with economic developments, my Department monitors tax receipts and expenditure on an ongoing basis and as more data becomes available during the year, any significant changes to the expected Exchequer position in 2008, will be signalled and presented at the end of each quarter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The role and functions of the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO) in dealing with consumer complaints complements that of the Financial Regulator in protecting the interests of consumers of financial services as a whole. During the passage of the FSO legislation through the Oireachtas in 2004 it was stated, on behalf of the Minister for Finance, that the Ombudsman&rsquo;s remit essentially is to deal with individual complaints from customers of financial institutions and it is the responsibility of the Consumer Director in the Financial Regulator to deal with general issues relating to the protection of consumers. </P>
        <P>The relevant legislation provides for co-operation between the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Financial Regulator on general issues relating to the protection of consumers. A Memorandum of Understanding has been concluded between the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Financial Regulator to ensure the efficient and effective handling of complaints.  An issue drawing attention to a general breach affecting consumers can be referred by the Financial Services Ombudsman to the Financial Regulator. Such issues can then be examined by the Financial Regulator to consider if there are any suspected breaches of the relevant regulatory requirements including the Consumer Protection Code. The Financial Regulator can, as part of its administrative sanctions regime, seek to mediate or take regulatory action in relation to a firm including an order to make refunds to a firm&rsquo;s customers where appropriate.</P>
        <P>In response to a Parliamentary question on this issue last November I advised that I would ask the FSO and the Financial Regulator to review their current co-operation arrangements to ensure that these work smoothly where a finding of the FSO in an individual case may have implications for a broader group of customers of a financial services firm. The Ombudsman and the Financial Regulator have reviewed their current co-operation arrangements as requested and have advised in a joint submission to the Department that the Memorandum of Understanding is operating as intended and that co-operation between both offices is highly satisfactory and allows issues to evolve. They have also advised that where a pricing error occurs after the 1 July 2007 the provider is required under the Consumer Protection Code to speedily, efficiently and fairly correct such an error.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be aware that a High Court judgement in October 2008 confirmed that the Financial Services Ombudsman&rsquo;s power of direction, except in relation to a change in general practice, may only relate to an individual claimant and does not extend to payment of compensation for other consumers in relation to similar conduct of the financial service provider. I have asked the Advisory Forum on Financial Legislation to review the implications of this High Court decision in conjunction with the joint submission of the Financial Regulator and the FSO. The Financial Services Ombudsman when he appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service on the 13 February 2008 reported that the company in question has since reviewed its policies and issued a press statement to the effect that it had refunded &euro;300,000 going back 16 years to customers.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, there are two forms of accounting in the public service. The accounts of Government Departments and Offices are prepared on a cash basis while Local Authorities and Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies, for example, prepare their accounts on an accrual basis which includes the charging of depreciation.</P>
        <P>The Appropriation Accounts for central Government Departments and Offices are required under legislation to be prepared on a cash basis. In a cash accounting environment, the value of a capital resource is recognised and charged fully to the account in the year of acquisition. In addition, in cash-based accounts, the planning for the cost of replacement of capital items is done on a requirements basis and submitted for Vote approval. It should be noted that cash accounting does not provide the scope to build up a fund of money for future spends either current or capital.</P>
        <P>Under the Management Information Framework (MIF) Project new accruals-based accounting systems were rolled out across the civil service over the last four years.  It is now possible for all Departments and Offices to capture more detailed information for the better management of spending programmes and to improve the scope of financial reporting.  Drawing on the information available under the MIF, an information note in the Appropriation Account reports on the capital assets position and presents the position of Net Assets (original cost less accumulated depreciation).  In addition, all Departments and Offices must now present an Annual Output Statement to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann which sets out the target outputs of Departments and Agencies for the resources provided and reports progress on performance as compared with targets for the following year. These initiatives significantly improve the efficiency of resource use in Departments and Offices.	</P>

	<P>The Government is firmly committed to the development of biofuels generally in Ireland.  While the promotion of biofuel is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that in Finance Act 2006 I provided for significant tax measures to promote biofuels in Ireland.  </P>
        <P>This scheme, which received the necessary EU State Aid approval, commenced in November 2006 and will:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />provide for excise relief on up to 163 million litres of biofuels per annum;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />cost over &euro;200m over 5 years;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />when fully operational, result in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> savings of over 250,000 tonnes per annum;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />contribute towards meeting a target of 5.75% transport fuel market penetration by biofuels by 2009;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />help reduce our dependency on conventional fossil fuels; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />stimulate activity in the agricultural sector.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The overall level of excise relief available for biofuels is regarded as a level which is sufficient to match Ireland&rsquo;s output potential in relation to renewable energy crops for motor fuels over the coming years. These fiscal incentives were designed to kickstart the domestic biofuels industry and evidence suggests that this is happening.</P>
        <P>Long-term general excise reliefs are not anticipated.  In this regard the Deputy might wish to note that there are additional non-fiscal measures that can be used to promote biofuels. To provide further market certainty and encourage projects of scale, the Government has signalled its intention to move to a Biofuels Obligation by 2009 which will require all fuel suppliers to ensure that biofuels represent a certain percentage of their annual sales. The &lsquo;obligation&rsquo; will fall under the remit of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</P>
        <P>In addition to the incentive provided in the Biofuels Excise Relief Schemes, in Budget 2007, I provided funding for a national top-up of the EU energy crop payment from &euro;45 per hectare to &euro;80 per hectare. This payment is operated by the Department of Agriculture and Food and provides farmers with a further incentive to grow energy crops.</P>

	<P>The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General to which the Deputy refers was submitted to me by the Comptroller and Auditor General in June 2007 and laid by me before D&aacute;il Eireann. This examination looked at all the areas of activity of the Financial Regulator since its establishment. It focused in particular on:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />how the Financial Regulator sets standards and provides guidance to financial service providers, particularly in relation to promulgation of EU single market measures</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the operational measures undertaken by the Financial Regulator to monitor compliance by financial service providers with standards</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />how the Financial Regulator co-operates with other regulators to efficiently and effectively monitor cross-border financial service providers how the Financial Regulator protects and informs the users of financial services in Ireland</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the costs of regulation.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The report presents a favourable and positive picture of the financial services regulatory environment in Ireland. It recognises the significant changes in the market and regulatory environment that have impacted on the operation of the Financial Regulator since it was established in 2003 and the organisational developments introduced within the Financial Regulator to respond to required changes. The report includes many positive findings including:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Financial Regulator has generally been prompt in issuing rules and guidance for financial services providers</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />In developing standards, regulatory policies and administrative procedures, the Financial Regulator systematically consults with stakeholders and publishes related documentation on its website.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Since its establishment, the Financial Regulator has devoted considerable effort to developing a formal risk-rating model, and significant progress in achieving risk-based supervision has been made.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Financial Regulator has been developing its capacity to assess the relative costs and benefits of new regulation where it has discretion in how legislation is to be implemented.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Value for Money examination also highlighted a number of areas where the Financial Regulator could improve in efficiency. Many of these recommendations are being addressed as part of the Financial Regulators Strategic Plan for 2007-2009. These include a re-development of the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s corporate website and the enhanced use of electronic reporting and IT systems generally to support the operations of the Financial Regulator. The Financial Regulator constantly monitors progress against the objectives in the Strategic Plan and reports on that progress in its Annual Report, which is provided to me and laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P><Col N="299"/>
        <P>In addition, the Financial Regulator has advised me that it has commenced a systematic review of its business processes.  This project will include a benchmarking of the Financial Regulator against comparator financial regulators and other similar businesses, domestically and abroad, and an assessment of areas of work currently undertaken by the Financial Regulator that might be suitable for outsourcing.  The purpose of the project is to ensure that the Financial Regulator is delivering value for money in its business processes, is operating at relevant and appropriate best practice and that clearly defined and measurable benefits accrue from any changes proposed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the report and findings of the C&amp;AG&rsquo;s value for money report on the Financial Regulator.  This report is an important part of the accountability framework within which the Financial Regulator operates, while maintaining its appropriate day to day independence.</P>

	<P>Payments systems deal with the transfer of money (funds) between bank accounts. While each Member State has effective payments systems at national level, the integration of the single market in financial services has been hindered by the lack of cross-border interoperability between national payments systems. For some years now the payments industry has been working to improve the dynamics of cross-border business activity by developing a pan-European electronic payments system for payments in euro. It is called SEPA (the single euro payments area). The project is being delivered by the banking industry via the European Payments Council (EPC).</P>
        <P Just="Left">SEPA will be an area where consumers, companies etc can make and receive electronic payments in euro in Europe &mdash; whether between or within national boundaries, under the same basic conditions regardless of location. The key components of SEPA are the new payments systems for</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Credit transfers, that is, making payments electronically from or into bank accounts, including the use of internet or telephone banking. For example, they include making salary or pension payments into bank accounts.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Debit systems and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The SEPA Cards Framework.</P>
 <P FLI="0" el="5">I should mention that SEPA will not provide clearing for paper-based payments such as cheques.</P>
        <P>The SEPA Credit Transfers System, the first of the new SEPA payment instruments, was formally launched on 28 January 2008. The SEPA Direct Debit Scheme will be launched in late 2009, after all Member States have transposed the Payments Services Directive which is needed to give it legal underpinning. Cards compliant with the SEPA Cards Framework will be available at a later date.</P>
        <P>While the main focus of SEPA is on euro area Member States, SEPA will also apply to euro payments to and from Member States outside the euro area.</P>
        <P>As I have already mentioned, the Payment Services Directive (PSD) is needed to provide legal underpinning for the SEPA project, especially the debit card element. The deadline for <Col N="300"/>transposition is 1 November 2009. Work to transpose the PSD is already underway in my Department and consultations with relevant stakeholders have been initiated.</P>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> the number of incidents and value of overcharging of customers by banks and financial institutions each year during the period 2002 to 2007; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The issues raised by the Deputy fall within the remit of the Financial Regulator. I understand that the majority of overcharging issues actually predate the establishment of the Financial Regulator in 2003 and, accordingly, statistics are not available in exactly the format requested by the Deputy. </P>
        <P>Following a request for similar statistics in PQ No. 2351/08 (on 30 January, 2008), my Department sought the information from the Financial Regulator and had in the meantime provided information in answering that PQ which was the most up to date available at that time pending the response from the Financial Regulator. I can now say that previously unpublished information recently provided in response to my Department&rsquo;s request by the Financial Regulator indicates that the amount of &euro;167 million (this amount is unchanged) relating to overcharging issues dating from the early 1990s identified in the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Annual Report for 2006 related to 38 financial service providers and 624 individual charging issues. Approximately 80 per cent of the &euro;167 million has been refunded or paid to charity as appropriate. I have arranged for a copy of the information supplied by the Financial Regulator to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>This area has been a major focus of the work of the Financial Regulator since its establishment in 2003. In responding to these issues, the main priority has been to ensure that all affected customers receive full and speedy refunds and systems and controls are put in place to deal with the issues that led to overcharging so that future errors may be eliminated or minimised. This has been reflected in the substantial progress made in the reimbursement programmes and a decline in the number of new charging issues reported to the Financial Regulator, as financial service providers have adopted a much more rigorous approach to their internal controls, IT system processes and compliance procedures.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator is closely monitoring the reimbursement programmes to confirm that they are carried out fully in line with the general principles established by the Financial Regulator in 2005.  These ensure that financial service providers make all reasonable efforts to make refunds, with appropriate interest, to all customers who have been affected by overcharging and that the financial institution concerned cannot benefit in any way from amounts that cannot be repaid.  Details of the main reimbursement programmes are published in the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Annual Reports.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that the high number of overcharging issues identified is largely due to system reviews and allocation of additional compliance resources by credit institutions and insurers following the establishment of the Financial Regulator in 2003 as well as the reviews initiated by the Financial Regulator and the commencement of its customer-oriented on site inspections at that time.</P>
        <P>In addition, under the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code, which came into full effect on 1 July 2007, regulated entities must speedily, efficiently and fairly correct any charging or pricing errors and notify affected consumers of any charging or pricing errors that may have a negative impact on the cost of a service or the value of a product provided.</P><Col N="301"/>
        <P>The whole regulatory structure for Irish financial services was reformed with the establishment of the Financial Regulator, with its statutory consumer protection mandate, in 2003.  The progress made on this issue is therefore a reflection of the work of the Financial Regulator in implementing a strong principles-based supervisory approach, in fostering a compliance culture in the financial services industry and in promoting and safeguarding the interests of consumers.</P>

	<P>Under the revised VRT system, the VRT rate applicable to both new and used imported cars registered on or after 1 July 2008 will be determined by the CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emission rating of the car and will no longer be related to engine size.</P>
        <P>As outlined in Annex D to the Summary of 2008 Budget Measures, in respect of pre-owned used cars imported after 1 July 2008, the CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions will have to be declared to the Revenue Commissioners on form VRT4 (declaration for registration of a used vehicle) by the person registering the vehicle.</P>
        <P>The declaration will be required to be supported by documentary evidence of the CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions. Acceptable documentary evidence (provided the CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions is shown) will include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a certificate of conformity for the particular model, (since 2001, EU law requires CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emission levels to be recited in this document), or</P>

<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a certificate from the manufacturer or distributor, or</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a certificate from an organisation approved by the Revenue Commissioners to provide such certificates.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Where a certificate or a measurement confirming CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> levels for a vehicle is not available or does not satisfy the Revenue Commissioners, VRT will be charged on registration at the maximum rate allowable i.e. 36%. Such a VRT rating would be open to appeal through the VRT appeals system.</P>
        <P>Legislative provision for the revised VRT system is included in the Finance Bill and further details regarding registration procedures and requirements will be set out in a Statutory Instrument.</P>

	<P>As Minister of Finance, my role is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions.  The Registrar of Credit Unions is responsible for administering the system of regulation and supervision of credit unions provided under the Credit Union Act, 1997 with a view to the protection by each credit union of the funds of its members, and the maintenance of the financial stability and well-being of credit unions generally.</P>
        <P>Under the legislative framework set out in the Credit Union Act the primary function of credit unions is to offer savings and loans services to its members.  In view of the very significant growth in credit union savings over recent years reflecting such factors as strong economic and incomes growth overall and the success of the SSIA initiative, the funding position of credit unions is very strong.  This has also led, against the backdrop of a significantly greater competition and product choice in the lending market, to significant growth in shares and deposits in many credit unions over and above what is required for their lending activities.  These resources are available for investment by credit unions to generate a return for members.  The Board of Directors of each individual credit union is responsible for ensuring that its investment policy is prudent and responsible and conforms to what is legally permissible under the Credit Union Act.</P>
        <P>In order to assist Boards in effectively discharging this important function, in October 2006 the Registrar of Credit Unions issued a detailed Guidance Note on Investments to help safeguard the risk profile of credit union investments and ensure that members&rsquo; savings continue to be protected.  This provides a solid framework which enables the monitoring of the investment activities of credit unions by the Registrar.  Following the recent shift in financial market conditions for investments evident since August last, the Registrar of Credit Unions has recently initiated a process including consultation with stakeholders with a view to revising the existing investment framework.  This review will be informed by such factors as recent market developments and an assessment of the investment activities of credit unions overall. My Department is liaising closely with the Registrar of Credit Unions in relation to this work and will advise me on progress in this area.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Because of the operation of tax credits, many taxpayers who are nominally liable at the higher rate of tax pay tax at no more than the standard rate of tax. This is due to their higher rate liability for tax being fully offset by the value of their personal credits, as explained in pages C23 to C28 of the 2007 Budget booklet.  The above data allows for this effect.</P>
        <P>What matters to earners is the amount of their earnings that they keep in their pockets.  For all income earners, whether single or married, the position is that their take home pay has increased very significantly in real terms over the last number of years.</P>

<P el="0">The figures are estimates from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2004 adjusted as necessary for income and employment growth for the year in question. They are therefore provisional and likely to be revised. It should be noted that a married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit. Figures in the table are rounded to the nearest hundred and any apparent discrepancies in totals are due to this.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will appreciate that reports relating to court proceedings for property repossessions need to be interpreted with caution, given the variety of circumstances that give rise to such cases and the fact that not all of the proceedings relate to residential property.  It should also be noted that even where such orders are secured some are not enforced.  The number of orders granted by the High Court is a very small proportion &mdash; representing less than 0.2% &mdash; of the number of new mortgages issued in the same year.  As such, care needs to be exercised in drawing any particular conclusions regarding the property market or public policy overall. </P>
        <P>The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Financial Regulator (FR), speaking to the 30 January 2008 meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, pointed out that there are no indicators emerging as yet that there is a significant increase in default or arrears levels.</P>
        <P>The FR&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code requires regulated entities to undertake suitability assessments before offering a product or service to consumers.  In addition, the Code sets out the requirement that a regulated entity must contact the consumer as soon as it becomes aware that a mortgage account is in arrears and that it must have in place a procedure for handling accounts in arrears.  The CEO, also at the 30 January Joint Committee meeting, pointed out that the FR considers this to include a requirement that lenders agree a remedial action plan with a borrower where it detects arrears starting to emerge and to try to assist the borrower to manage his or her financial commitments and not allow the situation to worsen.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Section 19 of the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 2007 introduced a system of regulation of non-deposit taking lenders, including specialist or so-called sub-prime lenders, with a view to extending the Consumer Protection Code to their activities.  This system is currently being rolled out by the Financial Regulator.</P>
        <P>Anyone experiencing difficulty in repaying a mortgage or other loan should discuss the matter with the loan provider and seek appropriate advice without delay.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), which falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, is a national, free, confidential and independent service for people in debt, or in danger of getting into debt.  MABS offices, throughout the country, work with people in order to assist them with their financial planning and budgeting for the future.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Finance, I have consistently highlighted the need for responsible behaviour by both borrowers and lenders and, in particular, the need to factor into their financial decision making the effects of potential future changes in economic and financial conditions.</P><Col N="305"/>
        <P>In overall terms, housing affordability in Ireland is supported by relatively low loan-to-value ratios, income growth, interest rates that are relatively low in historic terms and increases in mortgage interest relief available in particular to first-time buyers. Unfortunately, a small minority of borrowers develop debt problems but house repossession is generally a last resort for lenders.  I understand that member institutions of the Irish Banking Federation (IBF) have voluntarily adopted a Code of Practice on Mortgage Arrears and a Code of Practice for Personal Customers.  These include provisions for helping customers in financial difficulty.	</P>

	<P>I assume the observations referred to are those contained in the recent Recommendation for a Council Opinion on the updated stability programme for Ireland, 2007 &mdash; 2010, where the European Commission commented on the recent deterioration in our export competitiveness. This deterioration has primarily been brought about by productivity growth here not keeping pace with price developments.  </P>
        <P>The Government recognises that, in a small open economy such as Ireland&rsquo;s, it is imperative that sustainable export growth is maintained. Such growth can only be realised through ensuring that our economy and exports, in particular, remain competitive.</P>
        <P>In this regard, this Government has been pursuing, and will continue to pursue, a number of policies which will underpin the future competitiveness and growth of our economy, including a firm commitment to responsible budgetary policies. Successive Governments, building on the strength of Social Partnership, have implemented policies which are aimed at rewarding both work and enterprise through maintaining a low tax burden on capital and labour. Furthermore, the continued rollout of the National Development Plan (NDP) remains a key priority for both myself and the Government as a whole. The investment in capital provided for in the NDP is <Col N="306"/>helping to eliminate infrastructural bottlenecks, which hinder economic efficiency, and is also enhancing competitiveness.</P>

        <Quest> his views on amending the legislation relating to approved retirement funds with respect to the taxation of the 3% imputed distribution from the age of 60 onwards to ensure that a pensioner&rsquo;s income stream from the age of 65 is not undermined during the five years immediately preceding turning 65; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The 2006 Budget and Finance Act introduced an imputed or notional distribution of 3% of the value of the assets of an Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) on 31 December each year, where the notional amount will be taxed at the ARF owner&rsquo;s marginal income tax rate. Funds actually drawndown by ARF owners will be credited against the imputed distribution in that year to arrive at a net imputed amount, if any, for the year.</P>
        <P>The imputed distribution measure was introduced because the internal review of tax relief for pensions provision undertaken by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners in 2005 (and which was published in early 2006) found that the ARF option was largely not being used as intended to fund an income stream in retirement, but instead was being used to build up funds in a tax-free environment over the long-term.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a transitional measure, the 3% rate is being phased in over the period 2007 to 2009, with 1% applying in 2007, 2% in 2008 and the full 3% in 2009 and each subsequent year. The new regime applies to ARFs created on or after 6 April 2000 where the ARF holder is 60 years of age or over for the whole of a tax year. The new provisions do not impact on Approved Minimum Retirement Funds (AMRFs), although funds drawn from an individual&rsquo;s AMRF can also be credited against the that individual&rsquo;s imputed ARF distribution.</P>
        <P>The imputed distribution measure will encourage the use of ARFs as intended, as funds actually drawn down by ARF owners will be credited against the imputed distribution to arrive at a net imputed amount, if any. This measure restricts the capacity of individuals to use ARFs purely as long-term tax-exempt vehicles.  I have no plans at this time to amend the legislation as proposed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that the VAT regime and indeed the rating of all goods and services are subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Whilst it would not be possible to provide a detailed breakdown of the complex rules and regulations governing VAT, the following summary addresses the specific points raised by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>Under the EU VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services. This means that since 1 January 1991 no additional goods or services can have the zero VAT rate applied to them. However, it is possible to move existing zero rated items, <Col N="307"/>as appropriate, to either the reduced rate which in Ireland is 13.5% or the standard rate which is 21%. However, once moved, it would not be possible to revert them to the zero rate.</P>
        <P>Member States may have up to two reduced VAT rates of not less than 5 per cent for a specified number of goods or services which are set out in Annex III of the EU VAT Directive. The goods and services in Annex III include certain foods, non-oral medicines, supply, construction and alteration of housing provided as part of a social policy, and newspapers and periodicals. Goods and services at the reduced rate may be moved to the standard rate, but only those listed in Annex III may be reverted from the standard rate to the reduced rate. Ireland, in common with the vast majority of Member States, only operates one reduced VAT rate.</P>
        <P>In addition, Member States have the option of maintaining, at a reduced rate of not less than 12 per cent, any items not listed in Annex III, provided they carried the reduced rate on 1 January 1991. These items are considered to be &lsquo;parked&rsquo; and Ireland&rsquo;s parked rate is the same as our reduced rate of 13.5%. Domestic fuels, restaurant services and labour intensive services are examples of &ldquo;parked&rdquo; items.</P>
        <P>Member States must apply a standard VAT rate of not less than 15% to goods and services that are not subject to VAT at the zero rate, are not &lsquo;parked&rsquo; and which are not listed in Annex III of the EU VAT Directive.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>My role as Minister for Finance is to ensure that there is an appropriate and robust legislative framework for the regulation of the financial services sector.  I am satisfied that following the reform of the institutional framework for financial regulation, the establishment of the Financial Regulator with its statutory consumer protection mandate and the Financial Services Ombudsman and the subsequent achievements of these bodies we have such a framework in place. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Under this framework, I have no function in relation to the level of interest rates charged by financial institutions to their customers.  As the Deputy will be aware, this is inherently a commercial matter for the financial institution concerned and will reflect a broad range of factors including the cost of funding, official interest rates, competitive market conditions and the risk profile of borrowers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In this context, the Deputy may wish to note that when addressing the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service on 30 January, 2008, the Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Regulator pointed out that the cost of funds in the interbank market is increasing.  However, as banks spread sources of funding, they will compete more actively in the market, also resulting in an increase in interest rates for depositors.</P>
        <P>Interest rates in Ireland, in fact, remain low by historic standards.  This reflects the current low level of official ECB rates.  The Deputy may wish to note that increased competition in the Irish financial services sector over recent years, reflecting such factors as new entrants and the introduction of a switching code for both personal customers and now for the business sector, has benefited consumers in Ireland significantly through increased choice, new products, lower prices and better services.</P><Col N="308"/>
        <P>The Financial Regulator regularly publishes surveys on its website www.itsyourmoney.ie comparing the costs of various financial products and services provided by various financial service providers in the State.  These surveys provide consumers with the information they require to make informed choices as customers of financial institutions.  The Deputy will appreciate that on account of such factors as differences in retail market structures, consumer preferences and charging structures, international cost comparisons must be interpreted carefully.  However, comparative international information available for Ireland indicates that in overall terms the cost of personal or small business banking compare favourably with other developed countries.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) from 28 January 2008 should also be a factor that promotes greater competition in the market for payment services across Europe, and, potentially, yield to Irish consumers the benefits of participating in a market with much larger economies of scale.  SEPA will enable citizens, companies and other economic entities to make and receive payments in euros, within Europe, whether between or within national boundaries under the same basic conditions, rights and obligations, regardless of their location.</P>

        <P>In relation to the returns for January, there was an Exchequer surplus of &euro;630 million at end-January. This was generally in line with expectations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In overall terms, January&rsquo;s tax receipts were slightly above target. Income tax was ahead of target at end-January but this excess was offset by a similar shortfall on VAT. Each of the other main tax-heads &mdash; excise duty, corporation tax, capital gains tax and stamp duty &mdash; were in line with expectations. However, taxes were down almost 3 per cent year-on-year, due mainly to slowing receipts from stamp duty and capital gains tax. Total net voted expenditure at end-January was slightly below profile.</P>

        <Quest> if he is satisfied that the Financial Services Regulator has sufficient powers to deal with banks and credit institutions operating here and that such institutions are sufficiently vetting mortgages and other loans to minimise financial risk to borrowers, particularly those with a weak financial history; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>A comprehensive system of banking supervision is in place under both EU and domestic law to ensure that credit institutions do not put customers&rsquo; deposits at risk through imprudent lending practices.  Banking supervision encompasses the authorisation of banks and building societies, their prudential supervision on an ongoing basis and the development of supervisory guidance and requirements for their operation. Prudential supervision involves monitoring the business of banks and building societies and how it is planned, managed, and controlled and checking compliance with statutory and non-statutory requirements.  This system of prudential regulation is administered in Ireland by the Financial Regulator, which has extensive powers of inspection, review and enforcement under the relevant legislation. </P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator adopts a risk-based and principles-based approach to its work. This model places responsibility for the proper management and control of a financial service provider, and the integrity of its systems, on the board of directors and its senior management. The financial services industry is expected by the Financial Regulator to adhere to ethical leadership standards, grounded on robust fitness and probity, good governance, and good risk management, relevant public disclosure, proper planning and most importantly, a commitment to protect customers.</P>
        <P>All consumer credit, including mortgage credit, is also regulated in Ireland under the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  The Act makes detailed provision for the form and content of loan agreements and for advertising of consumer credit.  The Financial Regulator has powers of investigation, review and enforcement in relation to matters covered by the Act.  Consumer complaints about the performance of creditors with respect to their obligations under the Act also fall within the remit of the Financial Services Ombudsman.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator&rsquo;s supervisory guidance for the credit institutions that it regulates includes guidance on the manner in which banks assess the ability of their customers to support higher repayment burdens, should interest rates increase. At present in cases where the guidance applies home mortgage applications should be assessed at an interest rate at least 2.75% above the prevailing European Central Bank rate.</P>
        <P>As regards non-deposit taking lenders in the domestic market, Section 19 of the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2007 amended Part V of the Central Bank Act 1997 to provide for an appropriate system of authorisation and regulation of retail credit firms and home reversion providers.  The primary purpose of this amendment was to extend to customers of these firms the benefit of the additional consumer protections provided for in the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code (CPC).</P>
        <P>Under the CPC there is an obligation on financial service providers to act in a fair and transparent manner in their dealings with consumers.  Before providing a product or service including advice to a consumer, the financial service provider must gather and record sufficient information from the consumer to allow it to provide an appropriate recommendation to that consumer and must supply the consumer with a copy of its written statement setting out the reasons why the product or service offered is considered suitable for that consumer.  For example, reasons must be stated as to why the recommended loan is considered as suitable to the consumer having regard to the facts disclosed by him/her.  Regulated financial service providers who are in breach of the CPC may be subject to financial and other sanctions.</P>
        <P>My function, as Minister for Finance, is to provide an appropriate and robust framework for regulation of the financial services sector with a particular focus on the consumer.  I am satisfied that, since the establishment of the Financial Regulator and the Financial Services Ombudsman, and on the basis of enhancements, such as the introduction of the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code, we have such a framework in place.</P>

	<P>The position is that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Under the VAT Directive Member States may only apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT Directive. As Annex III does not include the supply of road safety products, the only rate that can apply to such products is the standard VAT rate which in Ireland is 21%. </P>
        <P>In relation to amending Annex III of the VAT Directive, the Deputy will be aware that this could only be done in the context of an overall review at Community level of reduced rates. Whilst the Commission launched a debate on reduced rates in July 2007, as yet, no specific Commission proposals have been brought forward. Generally, any significant review of the application of VAT across the different EU Member States can be complex.</P>

        <P>In Section 34 of the Finance Act 2007 I introduced a new scheme to allow the operation of DIRT exempt savings accounts subject to two conditions: (1) the account holder must be aged 65 years of age or over or be permanently incapacitated; and (2) the account holder&rsquo;s total income must not exceed the relevant exemption threshold, i.e. &euro;19,000 (for an individual) or &euro;38,000 (for a married couple).</P>
        <P>Provisional figures show that in 2007 some 47,218 such accounts were operated. These figures will increase as the remaining financial institutions file returns for 2007.</P>
        <P>In 2007, Revenue widely publicised these changes. An Information Leaflet (DE1) giving comprehensive information for qualifying taxpayers on how to have interest credited to their savings accounts without deduction of DIRT was made available at Revenue offices. Information on DIRT exemption was also included on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie. Application forms and information leaflets were also made available at most financial institutions. Revenue also arranged for an information leaflet to be issued to social welfare customers in receipt of state and other pensions. Approximately 100,000 leaflets were issued in this way. Information on the DIRT exemption was also included in Age Action&rsquo;s monthly magazine &ldquo;Ageing Matters&rdquo; in June 2007.</P>
        <P>During 2008, Revenue will continue to examine a range of channels or means to target the over 65s and it plans to publicise the facility offered by the accounts, including posters in local offices, contact with representative bodies, financial institutions, other Government Departments and agencies, and relevant advertising.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, based on information derived from personal income tax returns for the tax year 2005 (the latest year for which the most complete data is available), some 4,450 individuals returned rental income of &euro;56 million from foreign properties. This figure of &euro;56 million was the profit rent, net of allowable expenses such as interest, repairs, insurance, etc.</P>
        <P>I am advised that Revenue cannot identify the amount of income tax specifically attributable to income from foreign property, because this will depend on the particular circumstances in each case, including the amount of double taxation relief to be credited for any tax paid in the other jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>Revenue is also not in a position to estimate the number of instances of non-payment of Irish tax on income from foreign property or the amount of tax expected to be foregone through such non-payment.  As with all categories of undeclared income, estimating the scale of non-declaration is very difficult; this is particularly so where foreign sources are involved.</P>
        <P>However, Revenue has set up a specialist Offshore Assets Group and one of the objectives of this unit is to develop systems to identify persons who use or have used offshore properties as a means of evading tax.  So far, the Unit has identified more than 2,000 Irish owners of foreign properties.  This has been done through the exchange of information with foreign tax administrations; by monitoring advertisements and websites; by registering with foreign land registries; and by looking at returns of foreign bank information under the EU Savings Directive.  All of these cases are referred for examination to ensure that there is no Irish tax evasion involved either in relation to the source of the purchase money or any income being generated from renting the property.</P>
        <P>Section 126 of the Finance Bill 2008 (as initiated) extends the Revenue reporting obligations of agents to include rent from foreign property; previously, this obligation was confined to Irish property.  It is hoped that this will contribute to the identification of non-payment of tax on foreign property income, but the impact of this new measure will not be known until the first returns are submitted.</P>

        <Quest> if he will estimate the Exchequer income for the years 2008, 2009 and 2010 from the electricity tax proposed in the Finance Bill 2008; if this tax is expected to impact on consumption patterns; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P Just="Left">The Finance Bill provides for the introduction of an excise duty on electricity, called electricity tax, as required under the EU Energy Tax Directive. The tax will be charged to the operator who supplies electricity to the consumer. It will apply to supplies of electricity made on or after 1 October 2008. The rates of tax are being set at the minimum rates specified in the Directive; that is 50 cent per megawatt hour &mdash; which is 1,000 units &mdash; for business use, and &euro;1 per megawatt hour for non-business use.</P><Col N="313"/>
        <P>However, electricity used by households will be exempt from the new tax as will electricity produced from renewables and combined heat and power generation. Energy products and electricity used to produce electricity are also being exempted from excise taxation.</P>
        <P>The tax will be paid over to the Revenue Commissioners in arrears, and consequently there should be no yield in 2008. It is estimated that while the electricity tax will have a gross yield of around &euro;7m per annum thereafter, when the exemption from excise taxation of energy products and electricity used to produce electricity is taken into account the net Exchequer yield is estimated at under &euro;1m per annum.  The overall cost and impact of the measure on electricity prices and consumption patterns will be marginal.</P>

	<P>The position is that in matters relating to the VAT rating of goods and services, I am constrained by the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. In this regard, I would point out that the <Col N="315"/>rate of VAT that applies to a particular good or service depends on the nature of the good or service and not on the status of the consumer. Accordingly, there is no provision in EU law that would permit the removal or reduction of VAT based on the social or economic status of the consumer or community group.</P>
        <P>In relation to the VAT rate that applies to defibrillators, the position is that under the VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services. The zero VAT rate cannot therefore be applied to defibrillators which are subject to the standard rate.</P>
        <P>In addition, Member States may only apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT Directive. While Annex III does include the supply of medical equipment for the exclusive personal use of a disabled person, it does not include defibrillators for general use. The reduced rate cannot be applied to the supply of defibrillators.  Therefore the only rate of VAT that can apply to the supply of defibrillators is the standard VAT rate which in Ireland is 21%.</P>

A pre-feasibility Flood Study, to be funded by OPW, is being undertaken to identify options/solutions that would remove or alleviate the flood risk.  It is hoped that the Flood Study report will be available by summer 2008.  Provided the study identifies that economically and environmentally sustainable solutions are feasible, then works will commence as soon as possible thereafter.  This may take the form of a programme of works to be carried out by Donegal County Council with funding and engineering advice and assistance from OPW.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the introduction of tax incentives for start-up food companies in regions where traditional food industries have gone into decline with a view to developing a critical mass of such companies in an area with major natural advantages and a strong scientific infrastructure; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The most significant tax incentive for all companies, whether large or small and across all sectors, is our low rate of corporation tax of 12.5% on trading income and our relatively low rates of tax on other income as compared with other countries. A broad tax base is the price that must be paid to keep tax rates low and low tax rates benefit businesses generally. Any proposal for new tax incentives has to be considered in this context. Moreover, the introduction of specific tax incentives favouring one sector of industry over another would, quite apart from other difficulties, have State-Aid implications which would bring Ireland into conflict with EU law. For these reasons, I have no plans at this time to introduce an additional tax incentive for start-up food companies as suggested by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>But I should mention that I am, however, aware of the particular difficulties facing small and start-up companies and I have made a number of changes to the tax system in recent Budgets to improve the position of such companies.</P>
        <P>The Business Expansion Scheme (BES) and Seed Capital Scheme (SCS) have been considerably enhanced in recent years. In the case of the BES, individual investors are provided with tax relief at their marginal tax rate in respect of investments of up to &euro;150,000 per annum in certain qualifying companies. The SCS was introduced in 1993 as an incentive to encourage individuals to start up new businesses. Where the individual has complied with certain conditions, the scheme provides a refund of tax paid in the previous six years to employees who leave employment and start their own business. There is an upper limit in any one year of the tax paid on income of &euro;100,000.</P>
        <P>In Budget 2007, I increased the corporation tax liability threshold for treatment as a small company in relation to the payment of preliminary corporation tax, from &euro;50,000 to &euro;150,000. This means that companies with a corporation tax liability of &euro;150,000 or less can opt to pay preliminary tax on the lower of 90% of the final liability of the current accounting period or 100% of the liability of the previous accounting period. This measure gives the vast bulk of Irish companies the benefit of a simpler and more straightforward system of payment in respect of preliminary corporation tax.</P>
        <P>I also introduced a new measure for start-up companies in Budget 2007 under which new start-up companies with a corporation tax liability of &euro;150,000 or less for their first accounting period do not have to pay preliminary corporation tax for that first accounting period and instead are required to pay their final corporation tax liability when they submit their tax returns (9 months after the end of the accounting period). In Budget 2008, I increased the liability threshold for both of the measures detailed above from &euro;150,000 to &euro;200,000.</P>
        <P>The Deputy makes reference to scientific infrastructure and, in this context, I would refer to the R&amp;D tax credit scheme which was introduced in 2004 which enables a company to write-off a tax credit against its corporation tax liability equivalent to 20% of the additional or incremental qualifying R&amp;D expenditure incurred by it in a particular year compared to<?oasys _jy ?>R&amp;D expenditure in a base year. In Budget 2008, the base year for expenditure which is used to calculate the qualifying incremental expenditure on R&amp;D under the tax credit scheme was fixed at 2003 for a further 4 years to 2013. The change provides an additional incentive for <Col N="317"/>increased expenditure on R&amp;D in future years and it offers more certainty to industry in relation to the tax credit scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>In this year&rsquo;s Finance Bill, I have introduced new tax provisions in relation to profits derived from petroleum exploration and production activities. A new tax called a &ldquo;profit resource rent tax&rdquo; will apply at rates of 5%, 10% or 15% in addition to the corporation tax rate of 25% that currently applies to profits <Col N="319"/>from petroleum activities.  It will apply when profits exceed certain defined levels.  This will be worked out by a formula that relates the profits from a petroleum field to the capital investment in the field. The new tax provisions give effect to the Government Decision of 30 July 2007 that a new regime would apply in relation to petroleum profits from discoveries made from 2007 onwards.</P>
        <P>In addition to the new profit resource rent tax, the Government also agreed last year that the tax relief in relation to expenditure on activities relating to exploration, development and abandonment should continue on the basis that it is ring-fenced to such petroleum &ndash;related activities undertaken by the companies concerned and it should continue to be allowed on a 100% first year basis.</P>
        <P>The Government Decision of last year and the Finance Bill 2008 provisions arise from the recommendations of an external review of Ireland&rsquo;s petroleum exploration and production licensing terms which was carried out by Indecon International Economic consultants. That review, in arriving at its conclusions and recommendations, examined the fiscal regimes for oil and gas exploration and production in other countries, including the UK and Norway. I understand that the report of the review entitled &ldquo;Expert Advice on Review of Irish Petroleum<?oasys _jy ?>E&amp;P Licensing Terms&rdquo; is available on the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources&rsquo; website.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a compelling case for increasing the tax-take in the future from more profitable oil and gas fields. Internationally, licensing terms are being amended in favour of national governments in light of increasing oil prices and fewer prospect areas available for exploration. The overall objective of the Finance Bill changes being proposed is to ensure that the State will get a higher return in the case of more profitable oil and gas fields while continuing to encourage the industry to invest in exploration for oil and gas offshore Ireland. There is a balance to be struck in revising the taxation policy as it applies to these activities. This balance must ensure, on the one hand, that Ireland gets an appropriate return for the exploitation of its resources while, on the other, giving sufficient encouragement to those who would search out and extract those resources. I think that the revised arrangements achieve that balance.</P>

	<P>The Government is firmly committed to the development of biofuels generally in Ireland. While the promotion of biofuel is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that in Finance Act 2006 I provided for significant tax measures to promote biofuels in Ireland.</P>
        <P>This scheme, which received the necessary EU State Aid approval, commenced in November 2006 and will:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />provide for excise relief on up to 163 million litres of biofuels per annum;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />cost over &euro;200m over 5 years;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />when fully operational, result in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> savings of over 250,000 tonnes per annum;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />contribute towards meeting a target of 5.75% transport fuel market penetration by biofuels by 2009;</P><Col N="320"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />help reduce our dependency on conventional fossil fuels, and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />stimulate activity in the agricultural sector.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The overall level of excise relief available for biofuels is regarded as a level which is sufficient to match Ireland&rsquo;s output potential in relation to renewable energy crops for motor fuels over the coming years. These fiscal incentives were designed to kick-start the domestic biofuels industry and evidence suggests that this is happening.</P>
        <P>Long-term general excise reliefs are not anticipated.  In this regard the Deputy might wish to note that there are additional non-fiscal measures that can be used to promote biofuels. To provide further market certainty and encourage projects of scale, the Government has signalled its intention to move to a Biofuels Obligation by 2009 which will require all fuel suppliers to ensure that biofuels represent a certain percentage of their annual sales. The &lsquo;obligation&rsquo; will fall under the remit of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</P>
        <P>In addition to the incentive provided in the Biofuels Excise Relief Schemes, in Budget 2007, I provided funding for a national top-up of the EU energy crop payment from &euro;45 per hectare to &euro;80 per hectare. This payment is operated by the Department of Agriculture and Food and provides farmers with a further incentive to grow energy crops.</P>

	<P>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is designed to measure the change in the average level of the prices paid by consumers for goods and services.  It measures in index form the monthly changes in the cost of purchasing a representative basket of consumer goods and services. The Director General of the Central Statistics Office has sole responsibility for, and is independent in, deciding the statistical methodology and professional standards to be used in compiling the CPI.</P>
        <P>Maintaining a moderate rate of inflation remains a key priority of economic policy because of its importance in restoring competitiveness. We have no control over some of the factors influencing competitiveness, such as the exchange rate and oil prices. However, we must always seek to ensure that our domestic cost base does not undermine competitiveness. Regarding wage costs, the Government remains focused, through the partnership process, on securing a pay settlement that supports competitiveness. In this context, it is important to maintain low inflation, pursue a sensible incomes policy and keep public spending growth at sustainable levels in the medium term. This will allow us to keep the burden of taxation low, thus helping to maintain competitiveness, and to maximise our economic potential.</P>

	<P>I assume the comments referred to are those contained in the recent Recommendation for a Council Opinion on the updated <Col N="321"/>stability programme for Ireland, 2007 &mdash; 2010, where the European Commission commented on the recent deterioration in our export competitiveness. This deterioration has primarily been brought about by productivity growth here not keeping pace with price developments.</P>
        <P>The Government recognises that, in a small open economy such as Ireland&rsquo;s, it is imperative that sustainable export growth is maintained. Such growth can only be realised through ensuring that our economy and exports, in particular, remain competitive.</P>
        <P>In this regard, this Government has been pursuing, and will continue to pursue, a number of policies which will underpin the future competitiveness and growth of our economy, including a firm commitment to responsible budgetary policies. Successive Governments, building on the strength of Social Partnership, have implemented policies which are aimed at rewarding both work and enterprise through maintaining a low tax burden on capital and labour. Furthermore, the continued roll out of the National Development Plan (NDP) remains a key priority for both myself and the Government as a whole. The investment in capital provided for in the NDP is helping to eliminate infrastructural bottlenecks, which hinder economic efficiency, and is also enhancing competitiveness.</P>

        <P>At the outset, I would point out to the Deputy that as far as the national position is concerned, the Government have taken steps last October under Section 19 of the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 2007, which amended Part V of the Central Bank Act, 1997, to provide for an appropriate system of authorisation and supervision of retail credit firms engaged in specialist or so-called sub-prime lending and home reversion providers not previously subject to financial regulation in respect of lending activities.  The primary purpose of this amendment was to extend to customers of these firms the benefit of the consumer protections provided for in the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.  This regulatory regime is in place since 1 February.</P>
        <P>Non-traditional or specialist mortgages, sometimes referred to as sub-prime mortgages, are estimated to account for about 1% to 2% of the Irish residential mortgage lending market, compared to about 15% in the US.  In Ireland, these products have provided a new mortgage mechanism for customers who might previously have experienced difficulty obtaining a mortgage from a mainstream lender because, for example, of the nature of their work, they are new to Ireland, or they have impaired credit histories.  The CBFSAI in its Financial Stability Report 2007 found that the Irish banking sector has a minimal level of involvement in the Irish residential mortgage market for these non-traditional customers.  The Report states that the Irish market is characterised by limited mainstream banks&rsquo; involvement in the market, the relatively very small size of the market and generally modest average loan-to-value ratios.</P><Col N="322"/>
        <P>It is very important to be clear, therefore, that the very significant system-wide difficulties that have emerged in relation to sub-prime lending practices are an issue that have arisen in the US mortgage market.  The substantial write-downs of investments that have occurred for some European financial institutions arise from their investments in securities whose value depend on the credit quality of US sub-prime mortgages.  The CBFSAI states in its Financial Stability Report 2007 that our credit institutions do not have significant exposures to the sub-prime market, either directly or indirectly.  The current market dislocation began with concerns globally, from mid-2007 onwards, about investors&rsquo; exposures to mounting losses in the US sub-prime mortgage market.   Further information on the background and the approach to Financial Stability in the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland are set out in the address of the Governor to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service on 30 January 2008.</P>
        <P>At the EU level, there is a co-ordinated response to financial stability arrangements and the ability of authorities to respond to market developments, largely set out in the set of common principles and a roadmap of further actions published at the conclusion of the ECOFIN Ministers&rsquo; meeting on 9 October, 2007.   Ireland is participating fully in this work to ensure there is an effective EU-wide system to maintain financial stability taking into account the important cross-border linkages that now exist in EU financial markets.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the steps taken at national level and the work underway at EU level represent an appropriate response to the need to safeguard financial stability.</P>

	<P>The primary responsibility for managing a bank and for preventing fraud or inappropriate working practices in that bank lies with the management of that institution. No regulatory authority can put in place a supervisory regime to ensure that a financial institution can never be a victim of fraudulent or reckless trading activity from within. It is up to management to have appropriate controls to prevent or detect such activity.</P>
        <P>As regards our own financial regulatory system, I am glad to advise the Deputy that a recent IMF examination has confirmed that it reflects best international practice.</P>
        <P>There may well be lessons for legislators to be learned from recent adverse experiences in other Member States. The EU Commission is currently addressing a range of issues set out in roadmaps handed down by the Ecofin Councils in October and December 2007. When the Commission reports back on these issues, the question as to whether any further regulatory action would be appropriate can then be considered.</P>

	<P>There is already an extensive body of harmonised EU financial regulation in operation across the Union. This regulatory regime reflects best practice globally and this is reflected by the fact that EU financial regulation standards are now being followed by countries outside the Union.</P>
        <P>Recent discussions at EU Councils of Ministers have focused on the broad issue of international financial market turmoil and on its implications for financial stability and economic growth. Given the comprehensive regulatory framework already in place across all Member States, no regulatory response is contemplated at this time. However, the EU Commission has been asked to look into a number of issues and to report back to Council over the coming months.</P>
        <P>As regards financial regulation in Ireland, I am glad to say that our regulatory arrangements have been positively assessed by the IMF as recently as last September.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 150 together.</P>
        <P>Under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition, through the Long Term Illness Scheme (LTI).  The LTI does not cover GP fees or hospital co-payments. The conditions are: mental handicap, mental illness (for people under 16 only), phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, Parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia.  There are currently no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions.</P>
        <P>Products which are necessary for the management of the specified illness are available to LTI patients.  Other products are available according to the patient&rsquo;s eligibility.</P>
        <P>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.</P>
        <P>Non-medical card holders and people whose illness is not covered by the LTI can use the Drug Payment Scheme, which protects against excessive medicines costs.  Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;90 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, non-reimbursed medical expenses above a set threshold may be offset against tax.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117, 193, 194 and 195 together.</P>
        <P>The National Disability Strategy, which was launched in September 2004, provides for a framework of new supports for people with disabilities.  The Strategy builds on a strong equality framework, which is reflected in several pieces of equality legislation. The main elements of the Strategy are:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Disability Act 2005;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Six Outline Sectoral Plans published by Government Departments;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Citizens Information Act 2007.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Multi-Annual Investment Package as committed to by Government has been put in place to support the National Disability Strategy.</P>
<P el="10"><i>The Disability Act 2005</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Disability Act 2005 is a central element of the National Disability Strategy. The Act is a positive measure designed to advance and underpin participation by people with disabilities in everyday life.</P>
        <P>One of the most important aspects of the Department of Health and Children&rsquo;s Sectoral Plan is the arrangements for commencing Part 2 of the Disability Act, 2005. Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 commenced for children aged under 5 years with effect from 1 June, 2007.  This prioritisation reflects the importance of intervention early in life, which can have a significant impact on the disabling effects of a condition or impairment.</P>
        <P>In particular Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 provides people with disabilities with an entitlement to:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />An independent assessment of health and education needs;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A statement of the services (Service Statement) which it is proposed to provide;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Pursue a complaint through the Health Service Executive complaints process if necessary;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Make an appeal to the independent Disability Appeals Officer.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">With regard to the Deputy Stanton&rsquo;s query on the number of applications for assessments made under Section 9, the assessment of need process is a matter for the Health Service Executive and I have referred this matter to the Health Service Executive who will be in a position to provide information in terms of the numbers involved.</P>
        <P>Section 13 of Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 requires that specific information, as listed in Section 13 paragraph 2, is contained in a report that will be compiled by the Health Service Executive and submitted to the Minister, within six months after the end of each year, indicat<Col N="326"/>ing what additional services are required to meet identified needs, what the ideal timeframe for delivery of such services would be and the estimated costs involved.  The Health Service Executive will submit the first Annual Report to the Minister for Health and Children by the 30 June, 2008, and annually thereafter. The Disability Act 2005 requires that the report be published by the Health Service Executive within one month of its submission to the Minister.</P>
        <P>It is proposed that Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 will be commenced in respect of children aged 5-18 in tandem with the implementation of the EPSEN Act 2004. The Department of Education and Science has informed the Department that it is envisaged that all sections of the EPSEN Act 2004 will be implemented over a five year timeframe, with the assessment process as provided for in the EPSEN Act 2004 due to commence in 2010. In preparation for its implementation, health related support services for children aged 5 to 18 and adults will continue to be enhanced to enable the Health Service Executive to meet needs identified for this group.</P>
        <P>The statutory requirements of Part 2 of the Disability Act will be extended to adults as soon as possible but no later than 2011.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive has undertaken the first of three annual reviews of progress on the Sectoral Plan, and this first review which was published in December 2007, is available on the Department&rsquo;s website. Further targets have also been identified, specifically in relation to planning for the parallel commencement of the Disability Act 2005 and the EPSEN Act 2004 for 5-18 year olds and adults.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 provides a clear legal framework to repay recoverable health charges for publicly funded long term residential care.  All those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged and are alive will have their charges repaid in full.  The estates of all those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged for publicly funded long term residential care and died since 9 December 1998 will have the charges repaid in full.  The scheme does not allow for repayments to the estates of those who died prior to that date.  Recoverable health charges are charges which were imposed on persons with full eligibility under the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) Regulations 1976 as amended in 1987 or charges for in-patient services only, raised under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954 as amended in 1965.</P>
        <P>The scheme does not apply to individuals who have entered long term residential care under the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme.  In the case of private nursing home care the contract is between the individual and the private nursing home owner. It is not my intention to extend the parameters of the health repayment scheme.</P>

	<P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005, the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card, would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P>
        <P>The assessment of eligibility to medical cards and GP visit cards is statutorily a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE) and, with the exception of persons aged over 70, who have an automatic entitlement to a medical card, is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants.</P>

	<P>The provision of the appropriate infrastructure to facilitate the delivery of primary care services is being considered by the HSE <Col N="328"/>having regard to a number of factors.  These include the type and configuration of the services involved, the mixed public/private nature of our health system, the suitability of existing infrastructure and the capital requirements of the health services generally over the coming years.  I understand that in December 2007 the HSE sought expressions of interest from the private sector for the provision of the Primary Care Team infrastructure, with the HSE proposing to enter into fixed term leases with such providers.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for Primary Care services, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular matters raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>The Home Help service  nationally is a well established and successful component of this Government&rsquo;s strategy to provide a range of services to enable older people to remain in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. While the service is subject to on-going monitoring by my Department and the Health Service Executive, no specific review of funding is planned or underway.</P>
        <P>In this context, and in order to address increasing demands in the specific area of Home Helps in recent years, approximately &euro;56 million additional funding has been provided for the service over the three years 2006-8 inclusive. This has enabled the provision of 11.3 million Home Help hours by the Health Service Executive in 2006 and 11.7 million hours in 2007.</P>
        <P>Budget 2008 provided significant additional current funding of &euro;22 million to cover a range of new community-based initiatives for Older People. This includes a sum of &euro;5 million for this year towards 200,000 extra Home Help hours. This will bring the expected number of Home Help hours nationally to some 11.98 million in 2008.</P>
        <P>Bearing in mind all the circumstances, I am satisfied that the prioritised funding I have made available this year will assist the HSE in meeting increasing demands on its Home Help service. I will, of course, in conjunction with the HSE continue to monitor the service to ensure that provision is maximised across the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 139 and 203 together.</P>
        <P>I would like to reiterate that the revised pharmaceutical pricing arrangements for wholesale delivery were arrived at following a detailed consultation process accompanied by independent economic analysis. This process involved direct discussion with wholesaler companies and a call for public submissions, published on 20th December 2006, in response to which a total of 161 submissions (including 143 from community pharmacy contractors) were received.</P>
        <P>Following the completion of public consultation, and informed by the independent economic analysis, carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants, new reimbursement arrangements were announced by the HSE on 17th September 2007. The report by Indecon was published by the HSE on 13 November 2007. All aspects of the Indecon report were considered by the HSE in making its determination.</P>
        <P>The Government is firm in its view that the wholesale mark-up paid on the price of drugs should be reduced to a level that is fair to both taxpayers and wholesalers. The existing mark-up in the range of 15-17.6% is neither reasonable nor sustainable. The decision to pay an 8% mark-up from 1 March, and 7% from 1 January 2009, will go ahead.</P><Col N="333"/>
        <P>However, I am concerned, in particular, to support pharmacies which have a high proportion of medical card patients and where a dispensing fee of &euro;3.27 applies for most transactions.  Many of these pharmacies are in rural or inner city areas and provide an important social and health service. With my support, the HSE has indicated it is prepared to offer a higher fee, of no less than &euro;5 per item dispensed, to community pharmacists, on the basis of an interim contract which would be essentially the same as the existing contract.</P>
        <P>I met with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union recently and heard their point that there should be an independent assessment of the fees offered. In the light of this, I have established an Independent Body to begin work immediately to assess an interim, fair community pharmacy dispensing fee of at least &euro;5 to be paid for the medical card scheme, the Drugs Payment Scheme and other community drug schemes.</P>
        <P>This Body is being chaired by Se&aacute;n Dorgan, former Head of IDA Ireland. It will take submissions from all sides and will carry out its own analysis. It has been asked to make its recommendations by the end of May 2008. Its recommended fee level, subject to Government approval, will be backdated to 1 March 2008.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference of the Independent Body are:</P>
<P LI="1">To advise the Minister for Health and Children on the appropriate level of dispensing fee to be paid to community pharmacists for existing services provided under the GMS and community drug schemes having regard to:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="is0p4" />(i) <Miles com="ix" />the overall public interest including the issues of patient safety and continuity of supply;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="is0p2" />(ii) <Miles com="ix" />the fee of &euro;5 per item which has already been offered;</P>
<P el="5">(iii) <Miles com="ix" />the reasonable costs incurred by pharmacists in providing services under the schemes and the value of the professional service of dispensing; and</P>
<P el="5">(iv) <Miles com="ix" />the statutory obligation on the HSE to use the resources available to it in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public;</P>
<P el="5" FLI="0" Just="Left">and to submit a report on the matter to the Minister for Health and Children. The Independent Body held its first meeting on 25th February 2008.</P>
        <P>Both the HSE as the contracting body and the IPU as the representative organisation for community pharmacists, along with other stakeholders, will be entitled to make submissions to the Independent Body addressing whatever factors and issues are of concern to them.</P>
        <P>The Independent Body will also be entitled to engage whatever outside expertise it requires to assist it with its task. Based on its consideration of submissions received and its own independent evaluation, the body will recommend an appropriate dispensing fee that would, in its view, represent a fair and reasonable price to be paid for the pharmaceutical service currently being provided by community pharmacists to the HSE under the GMS and community drug schemes.</P>
        <P>Each pharmacist will have three options: to avail of the interim contract as outlined by the HSE letter of 2 January 2008 immediately; to accept the interim contract upon the report of the Independent Body; or to stay with the existing retail fee structure until the agreement of a substantive new contract.</P>
        <P>I believe this provides all concerned with a reasonable way to make the transition to a fair and transparent method of payment for present services and, I hope, greatly developed pharmacy services in the near future.</P><Col N="334"/>
        <P>In response to a request to all 1600 community pharmacy contractors from the HSE, two community pharmacists have confirmed their intention to withdraw services under the present pharmacy contract. There are no changes planned to the operation of services under the GMS and community drugs schemes and all patients continue to receive their entitlements in the normal way.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 148 and 201 together.</P>
        <P>The Primary Care Strategy aims to increase health service capacity through the development of services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of  general practitioners, nurses, home helps, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and others.</P>
        <P>It has been estimated that up to 95% of people&rsquo;s health and social services needs can be properly met within a primary care setting and the establishment of new Primary Care Teams can contribute greatly to enhancing community based health services.  The provision of the appropriate infrastructure to facilitate the delivery of primary care services is being considered by the HSE, having regard to a number of factors.  These include the type and configuration of the services involved, the mixed public/private nature of our health system, the suitability of existing infrastructure and the capital requirements of the health services generally over the coming years.  I understand that in December 2007 the HSE sought expressions of interest from the private sector for the provision of the Primary Care Team infrastructure, with the HSE proposing to enter into fixed term leases with such providers.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for Primary Care services, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular matters raised by the Deputies.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have these matters investigated and to have replies issued directly to the Deputies.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 159 and 162 together.  </P>
        <P>I have identified the enhancement of services to persons with cystic fibrosis as a key priority over recent years.  Development funding of &euro;6.78m has been allocated to the Health Service Executive since 2006 to facilitate the recruitment of specialist staff in this area.</P>
        <P>The detailed application of this funding across the various hospital networks is a matter for the Executive and accordingly, my Department has asked the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to reply directly to the Deputy with regard to the services in the Mid-Western Region.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest> her plans to initiate legislation to govern presumed organ donations to replace the current voluntary system; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Two systems that can be used to ascertain an individual&rsquo;s wishes on organ donation are the opt-in system and the opt-out system.  The former system (which operates in this country) requires the specific consent of the donor <Col N="340"/>or, where he or she is deceased, their relatives, before organs or tissues are removed.  The opt-out system presumes that all deceased persons consent to donation unless they have specifically expressed a wish to the contrary.  My Department is advised that even where opt-out/presumed consent systems are in operation the relatives of the deceased may be approached as part of the donor screening process to seek a medical history of any high-risk behaviour.  In these circumstances the relatives can register an objection to the donation. </P>
        <P>The practice in this country is that, even when a deceased person had indicated his or her willingness to donate organs, the consent of the next-of-kin is always sought.  There are differing views as to the appropriateness and effectiveness of a change to the existing arrangements covering the question of consent.</P>
        <P>My Department is formulating proposals on human tissue legislation to meet the key recommendation of the Madden Report on Post Mortem Practice and Procedures.  The scope of the Bill will cover the removal, retention, storage, use and disposal of human tissue from deceased persons, and related matters.</P>
        <P>A Consultative Forum on the development of the legislative proposals was held in June 2007 followed by a public invitation for written submissions.  One of the matters that has been raised in this context is the issue of consent for the donation of tissue and organs for transplantation.  Discussions are ongoing with the major stakeholders on issues identified from the submissions.  It is expected that proposals will be submitted to Government this Spring seeking approval to draft Heads of a Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>At present, medical cards are granted primarily on the basis of means and individual circumstances.  Under the Health Act, 2004, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  Persons aged seventy years and over are automatically entitled to a medical card, irrespective of means.  Under Section 45 of the Health Act 1970, medical cards are provided for persons who, in the opinion of the HSE, are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants. </P><Col N="341"/>
        <P>This provision also entitles qualifying dependants to avail of a medical card.  The HSE may also grant a person full eligibility for a particular service where the person would be unable, without undue hardship, to provide that service for themselves or their dependants.</P>
        <P>In assessing an application for a medical card on behalf of a child, the HSE uses guidelines based on the means of the child&rsquo;s parent(s)/guardian(s), which includes their income after tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, childcare and travel to work.  The assessment process also takes account of other factors, such as medical or social need, which may impact on their ability to meet the cost of GP services.  The HSE has discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to provide for the granting of medical cards to any particular group as a whole.  However, my Department is currently reviewing all legislation relating to eligibility for health and personal social services with a view to making the system as fair and transparent as possible.  As part of this general review, a review of the eligibility criteria for medical cards in the context of economic / financial, medical and social need is being undertaken with a view to clarifying entitlement to a medical card, and is expected to be completed by Autumn, 2008.</P>

	<P>In May 2006, the Government formally approved the development of a new national forensic mental health facility at Thornton Hall, Co Dublin, adjacent to the new prison.  The new hospital facility will provide a therapeutic, forensic psychiatric service to the highest international standards, in a state-of&ndash;the-art building.  This decision was consistent with  &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; &mdash; the report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, which recommended that the Central Mental Hospital (CMH) should be replaced or remodelled to allow it to provide care and treatment in a modern, up-to-date humane setting and that the capacity of the CMH should be maximised.</P>
        <P>The redevelopment of the CMH will constitute a separate capital development project independent of the prison complex to replace Mountjoy Prison, and will be owned and managed by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The development of the new CMH is the responsibility of the HSE and at present, a project team is progressing the development of the new hospital.  The new hospital will be built on its own campus and will retain its identity as a distinct therapeutic health facility with a separate entrance and address to the prison complex.</P>

	<P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services.  In 2005, the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card, would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP. </P>
        <P>The assessment of eligibility to medical cards and GP visit cards is statutorily a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE) and, with the exception of persons aged over 70, who have an automatic entitlement to a medical card, is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.

        <P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has designated University College Hospital Galway and Limerick Regional Hospital as the two cancer centres in the Managed Cancer Control Network for the HSE Western Region, which includes Mayo.  The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while at the same time allowing local access to services, where appropriate.  Where diagnosis and treatment planning is directed and managed by multi-disciplinary teams based at the cancer centres, then much of the treatment (other than surgery) can be delivered in local hospitals, such as Mayo General Hospital.  The decisions of the HSE in relation to four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  Prof. Keane is currently engaging in detailed planning to facilitate the orderly phased transfer of services between locations.  The specific questions in relation to the transfer of services and meetings which have taken place in this regard relate to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, <Col N="344"/>which are the responsibility of the HSE under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department  has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this regard.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 and 212 together.</P>
        <P>BreastCheck commenced roll-out in the Western Region last May and in the Southern Region last October.  I officially opened the BreastCheck clinical static units in Cork and Galway last December.  The screening sequence for roll out to individual counties will be dictated by BreastCheck&rsquo;s management and operational considerations such as maximising uptake, most efficient use of mobile and static units and radiographic personnel.  The Programme is designed to offer repeat screening within an interval of 21-27 months.</P>
        <P>The Deputies specific questions in relation to timeframes for roll-out of the Programme are the responsibility of the National Cancer Screening Service.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Chief Executive Officer of the Service to respond directly to the Deputies in relation to the matters raised.</P>

	<P>The Primary Care Strategy aims to support and promote the health and well-being of the population by developing multi-disciplinary teams of professionals, including general practitioners, which enable the vast majority of people&rsquo;s health and social care needs to be met in their local community.  I recognise that in order to support and facilitate this model of care, general practitioners need to have access to appropriate diagnostic services.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has, I understand, undertaken a number of measures to enhance access for GPs to diagnostic services for patients.  As the Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for Primary Care services, it is the appropriate body to provide more detailed information in this regard.

        <Quest>   the reason the Irish Blood Transfusion Service provided live personal data of donors to a third party; if other agencies under the authority of her Department have employed a similar practice; the steps being taken to protect these blood donors from fraud or other abuses of their personal data; if the IBTS or the third party authorised a staff member to remove the date from the secure facility; and if she will make a statement on the matter.   </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish Blood Transfusion Service (IBTS) entered into an Agreement with the New York Blood Centre Inc (NYBC) for the provision of a data query tool on 23 October 2007.  The purpose of the data warehousing and reporting tool is to improve the existing IBTS blood banking system computer system, Progesa, in order to provide a better service to its donors and clients.  Under the terms of that agreement, the IBTS exported data on CD from its Progesa system.  The data was encrypted using a 256 bit key encryption, prior to export on a CD. </P>
        <P>The IBTS is very conscious of its obligations under the Data Protection Acts to take appropriate security measures against unauthorised access to, or unauthorised alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.  In this instance, the IBTS is confident that it has complied with these obligations by virtue of the robust security measures which have been taken by the Service and NYBC and consider that the risk of any person being in a position to bypass password controls and decrypt the data is extremely remote.  The IBTS informed the Data Protection Commissioner as quickly as possible of the details of the case and the Commissioner has been in regular contact with the IBTS on the matter.  The Commissioner has noted publicly that the IBTS had a legitimate reason to send the data out of the country, that it had taken its responsibilities to donors and clients seriously and that the information had been securely encrypted.</P>
        <P>The IBTS is writing to each donor affected to reassure them and to advise them of the possibility, however remote, that their personal data might be accessed.  It is also writing to GPs and hospitals who will in turn contact the patients concerned.  An information line has been set up for anyone with concerns.  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive has direct responsibility for the planning and management of health sector developments for both the HSE itself and the majority of other health agencies.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy in relation to the HSE and those agencies.</P>
        <P>In relation to other health agencies which are directly funded through my Department, arrangements are being made to have the required details collated. The information will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as this exercise is completed.</P>

	<P>Almost 130,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government&rsquo;s ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future. </P>

	<P><b>&ldquo;</b>A Vision for Change&rdquo; the Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, which was launched in January 2006, has been accepted by Government as the basis for the future development of our mental health services.  The vision embodied in this policy is to create a mental health system that addresses the needs of the population through a focus on the requirements of the individual.  The Report recommends inter alia that a plan to bring about the closure of all mental hospitals should be drawn up and implemented, and that the resources released by these closures should be protected for reinvestment in the mental health service.  The Health Service Executive has primary responsibility for implementing this recommendation. </P>
        <P>&ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; is very clear on this issue and recommends that resources, both capital and revenue, should be retained in the mental health service, with the reconfigured mental health services having priority in their disposal. It also recommends that the full economic value of psychiatric hospital buildings and lands should be professionally assessed towards identifying appropriate future use and maximum value and benefit.  The value of these assets significantly counter balances the capital cost of the new mental health services infrastructure requirement.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, has also made it clear to the HSE in the context of their Service Plan for 2008 that there can be no question of diverting capital or development funds to meet expenditure pressures arising in relation to core services.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Talks between health service employers and the Irish Hospital Consultants Association (IHCA) on new contractual arrangements for medical consultants came to a successful conclusion on 24th January 2008. Agreement was reached on the terms and conditions from which an employment contract for consultants will now be drafted.</P>
        <P>While the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) withdrew from the talks on 22 January 2008, it engaged in subsequent dialogue with Mr. Mark Connaughton SC, who had facilitated the agreement.  Mr. Connaughton issued his final document on 1 February 2008 setting out the agreed position with the IHCA and his recommendations on a number of issues. His final document also reflects his dialogue with the IMO, with the exception of pay.</P>
        <P>The degree to which consultants may engage in private practice will depend on contract type.  Under the proposed new contractual arrangements: type A consultants will be paid a public salary (&euro;220,000 &mdash; &euro;240,000) and will not have any private fee income from patients;  type B consultants (&euro;205,000 &mdash; &euro;220,000) may have private fee income for work done on the public hospital campus (including in a co-located hospital) but at least 80% of their clinical/patient <Col N="355"/>output must be public patients; type C (&euro;160,000 &mdash; &euro;175,000) will apply only in exceptional situations, where there is a demonstrable benefit to the public health system, and will allow the appointee to treat private patients outside the public hospital campus.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some of the other key features of the agreement include: the working week will be 37 hours; an extended working day (8am &mdash; 8pm), Monday to Friday; consultants may be required to work up to 5 hours structured overtime on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays; the appointment of Clinical Directors to manage clinical services, budgets and lead the development of services for patients; consultants will work in teams to deliver consultant-provided rather than consultant-led services to patients; and there will be a &ldquo;one for all&rdquo; access to outpatient diagnostic services based solely on medical need.</P>
        <P>Talks have taken place during recent weeks between health service employers and the medical organisations for the purpose of clarifying certain matters within the context of the framework proposed by Mr. Mark Connaughton SC.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Comparative figures across EU member states are not readily available but the 2007 OECD publication &ldquo;Health at a Glance&rdquo; indicates a relatively low level of suicide in Ireland.  The overall Irish rate is below the EU average and is the 7th lowest in the 27 OECD countries.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;Reach Out&rdquo; &mdash; a National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention, 2005-2014 provides a policy framework for suicide prevention activities in Ireland.  The strategy calls for a multi-sectoral approach to the prevention of suicidal behaviour in order to foster cooperation between health, education, community, voluntary and private sector agencies. The HSE, through the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP), oversees the implementation of the strategy.</P>
        <P>Initiatives funded by the National Office for Suicide Prevention include developing and implementing national training programmes, completing the availability of self-harm services in A&amp;E departments, developing mental health awareness campaigns, implementing recommendations arising from a review of bereavement services, eleven dedicated suicide officers and supporting voluntary organisations working in the field of suicide prevention.  A wide range of other expenditure on mental health services generally is of importance in measures to help prevent suicide.  A total of some &euro;1 billion is now spent on mental health services, including consultant psychiatry and psychiatric nursing.  These services and other services such as Primary Care play a vital role in the drive to reduce the incidence of suicide, and should be taken into account when examining the level of total public expenditure devoted to suicide prevention.</P>

	<P>All persons who drive taxis, wheelchair accessible taxis, hackneys and limousines, including those who also hold licences in respect of the operation of such vehicles, must hold a small public service vehicle driver licence.  The grant of those licences is currently the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner.  Licences are granted for a five-year period and applicants must have a current driving licence without endorsement/penalty points, have a tax clearance certificate issued by Revenue, give a statement showing the nature of employment during the previous three years and give a specific undertaking in writing in relation to driving hours.  An applicant must also satisfy the Garda&iacute; that s/he is a fit and proper person to hold a licence and has not been convicted of an offence that would render him/her unsuitable to hold such a licence, has adequate knowledge of general traffic regulations, the area where services are being made available and the regulations relating to small public service vehicles.  The processing of individual driver licence applications and decisions on such applications are matters for the Garda&iacute;.</P>

	<P>My Department engaged independent consultants Booz, Allen and Hamilton to review the proposal from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that the Broadstone alignment be used for suburban rail services. I received the report of the independent consultants in recent weeks.</P>
        <P>Having considered the report I wrote to both the RPA and CIE on the 4th of February indicating that I was minded to mandate the RPA to proceed with planning the delivery of Luas Line using the old Broadstone Railway alignment.  I gave both agencies the opportunity to make written submissions to me before I finalise my decision.  I expect to conclude my consideration of this matter in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>As I have stated previously Dublin City Council is currently undertaking an examination of revised traffic management arrangements in the city centre, which will be required for the delivery of the Luas city centre link (line BX), Luas line D to Liffey junction and Metro North.</P>
        <P>In addition, the RPA is considering ways of streamlining and combining construction works on these projects in order to minimise the impact on the city centre.</P>
        <P>Following completion of further detailed design work and subject to a satisfactory outcome to the city centre traffic management planning work, the RPA plans to submit a Railway Order <Col N="359"/>application for Luas Line BX to An Bord Plean&aacute;la later this year.

	<P>The day-to-day management of DART and suburban rail services is a matter for Iarnr&oacute;d Eireann. Over the period since 2000 a number of major upgrade projects have been completed on the DART services which have increased peak hour capacity on the DART from 14,000 in 2000 to 27,000 now and have also delivered a higher level of service to DART passengers, including accessible stations, air-conditioned DART cars and better reliability of services.  </P>
        <P>Over the same period, there has also been significant investment in new diesel railcars which have replaced the old intercity type rolling stock and expanded capacity. The Northern line in particular has benefited from this investment.</P>
        <P>As regards new developments, the city centre re-signalling project, planning for which has commenced, will support 17 trains per hour instead of the current 12 and this is expected to be completed in 2011.</P>
        <P>In addition, by 2015, when the Interconnector project and electrification has been completed, this line will see new high frequency services with trains up to every 5 minutes at peak time.</P>

	<P>I am informed by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that specially arranged alternative bus transfers are routinely offered to longer distance rail commuters whenever services are unavailable due to line closure, and that this was the case from Dundalk and Drogheda when the northern line was closed due to the freight train derailment.   From nearer distance stations such as from stations between Balbriggan and Dublin, passengers were directed to scheduled Dublin Bus services and their rail tickets were accepted to these services. </P>
        <P>I am aware that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is currently conducting an internal investigation into the incident and that the Company is already making arrangements to implement initial recommendations from that investigation.</P>
        <P>As required under the Railway Safety Act 2005, the Investigation Unit of the Railway Safety Commission is also conducting an independent investigation of the incident.  The report of this <Col N="361"/>investigation may also contain recommendations for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, and this report will be published in due course.</P>

        <Quest> if following the all-party resolution of the D&aacute;il on 4 December 2007, in support of free and fair elections in Zimbabwe, the Government has asked the EU to contact the South African Development Community in order to encourage SADC election monitoring of the Zimbabwean elections on 29 March 2008; if the Government will contact Zambia directly in order to encourage SADC election monitoring of the Zimbabwean elections on 29 March 2008; and if the Government will raise the issue of free and fair elections in Zimbabwe at the March meeting of the EU&rsquo;s General Affairs and External and External Relations Council. </Quest>

	<P>The situation in Zimbabwe is a matter of deep concern, and I am deeply disappointed and saddened by the way it continues to deteriorate. </P>
        <P>Ireland and the EU have supported the process of dialogue between the Zimbabwean Government and the opposition, facilitated by South Africa under a mandate from the Southern African Development Community (SADC). The talks have not formally concluded, but with the elections drawing nearer, there is no longer enough time to implement any agreement, which would have to include tackling repressive security laws, freedom of assembly, restrictive media laws and state violence, in time to ensure that these elections take place in appropriate conditions. The European Union will, however, continue to press for free and fair elections right up until 29 March. I will raise the situation in Zimbabwe at the next General Affairs and External Relations Council on 10 March.</P>
        <P>I continue to believe that we must work closely with Zimbabwe&rsquo;s neighbours, who are in the best position to influence the situation. Given that the Zimbabwean authorities have made it absolutely clear that they will not invite any EU or UN election observation mission, I believe that monitoring by regional groups is more important than ever. Ireland has proposed to EU partners that we explore with SADC what it plans to do in this regard, and how the EU can best support it. I have also asked our Embassy in Lusaka to raise this question directly with the Zambian Government, which is currently Chair of SADC.</P>

	<P>In accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 253 of 1968, which imposed mandatory sanctions on the illegal regime in what was then Southern Rhodesia, new passports, or the renewal of existing ones, were not processed in the period 29 May 1968 to 21 December 1979 to Irish citizens for emigration to Southern Rhodesia nor to those of our citizens residing in Southern Rhodesia whose activities furthered or encouraged the unlawful actions of the regime. Since those restrictions were lifted, people who were affected have been able to avail of Irish passport facilities in the same way as Irish citizens generally. </P>
        <P>In the time available, it has not been possible to research the records for the period in question. This will be done as soon as possible, and I will communicate directly with the Deputy. In the meantime, if the Deputy has a particular case in mind, I will be happy to have this checked out in the first instance.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 239 to 242, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs has always sought to be of assistance to Members of the Oireachtas, including in relation to passport applications, and I believe this is widely appreciated.</P>
        <P>The background to the special facility for passport applications submitted through Oireachtas Members and/or their Offices is that in the mid 1990s, and at a time when there were long queues outside the Passport Office, the Department&rsquo;s assistance with such passport applications was put on a more structured basis. At the same time, the focus of the Passport Office remained very firmly on ensuring the entitlement of applicants to passports, and the accuracy and integrity of the issuing process. Details of the submitting Members and/or their Offices were a secondary consideration. In this regard, records of the submitting Members and/ or their Offices were recorded manually, and were primarily of use to the section in question in responding to follow-up queries. This often meant that names of contact points in particular offices were recorded rather than the actual name of the Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>I would wish to continue to be of assistance to Members on this issue. However, in the light of the recent focus on it, I have asked the Secretary General of the Department to undertake a review of all aspects of the facility, including whether it should be continued in place. I would of course welcome the input of Members into this review.</P>
        <P>Against the background set out in the first paragraph above, I am satisfied that the information conveyed in my previous answers set out the position as accurately as possible. As regards other applications, some 29 applications have been recorded in 2007 as being forwarded through the Health Service Executive. In addition, the Passport Office indicates that applications over the years have been dealt with which were submitted by Health Boards, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces, the Department of Foreign Affairs and other Government Departments, NGOs working in developing countries and Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly</P>
        <P>Finally, the Deputy will be aware that, following a major investment, Ireland has now one of the most secure passports in the world, and a service to the public that is second to none.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), adopted in the year 2000 as part of the commitments undertaken by Heads of Government at the Millennium Summit, represent a framework for international economic and social development up to the year 2015. As such they are at the heart of the Government&rsquo;s work in our development cooperation programme. Irish Aid&rsquo;s focus on reducing poverty and supporting the provision of basic services to the poorest people is wholly consistent with the MDGs. </P>
        <P>The latest MDG progress report, issued in July 2007, gave us a snapshot of the progress achieved at the midpoint of the 2015 MDG target date, broken down by goal and by region. Overall, there has been good progress on some targets, but the geographical disparities are large. While there has been progress towards the goals globally since 2000, largely due to advances in China and other Asian countries, Africa is lagging behind on most indicators. This is attributed to a combination of institutional weakness, civil and international conflict, and funding shortfalls.</P>
        <P>In recognition of these problems Ireland continues to focus around 85 percent of its bilateral country assistance on sub-Saharan Africa and Irish Aid will continue to expand its assistance to the region as our aid programme grows. Much of this funding is devoted to areas which are key to achieving the MDGs. These include combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other communicable diseases, assisting countries in emergency situations and in reconstruction following conflict, and continuing our programme of support to education, basic health services, water and sanitation in the countries where we have established cooperation programmes. We also provide substantial support to the work of Irish non-governmental organisations in the development field, as well as through the major UN bodies such as UNICEF, UNDP and the High Commission for Refugees.</P>
        <P>Ireland is supportive of all international initiatives which address these geographical disparities, such as the MDG Africa Steering Group convened by the UN Secretary General last September. This brought together high level representatives of the African Union, European Union, African Development Bank, Islamic Development Bank, IMF and World Bank, who will meet regularly to examine how to strengthen Africa&rsquo;s efforts to meet the Goals.</P>
        <P>A further initiative aimed at measuring progress towards the MDGs has been taken by the British Prime Minister Gordon Brown who has proposed that a Heads of State/Government meeting take place at the UN in September 2008 to revitalise the pledges made in 2000 and provide the impetus for more intensive efforts in the period up to 2015. The Prime Minister wrote to the Taoiseach about his proposal and the Taoiseach has replied indicating Ireland&rsquo;s strong support.</P>
        <P>Ireland participates fully in efforts to achieve the MDGs. As set out in the White Paper on Irish Aid, the Millennium Development Goals are the overarching framework for our overseas aid programme. By delivering on the commitment to reach the 0.7% UN target for development funding by 2012, Ireland is also seen as being at the forefront of their implementation internationally.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest> the steps he has taken or proposes to take, directly or in consort with his EU colleagues to <Col N="365"/>ensure the ongoing competitiveness of this and other European economies, having particular regard to ongoing job relocation to lower cost economies; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be entirely misleading to suggest that plant relocation or company restructuring giving rise to job losses, whether due to individual firm or sector challenges, indicate that whole economies are uncompetitive. Companies allocate their resources and plant location strategies for many practical and business reasons such as to be closer to key customers, to have access to specialist skills, to address market needs or customer relationship requirements. Firms do not necessarily relocate because of cost issues alone.</P>
        <P>One feature of a competitive economy is the growth and flexibility it shows in creating new employment to replace jobs that are lost. The economy is dynamic and jobs will inevitably be lost as sectors decline, new products replace older ones and competition changes how business is done. Ireland clearly is meeting this aspect of competitiveness.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless the international operating environment for business is not as benign as it has been over the past few years. This increases the importance of driving productivity growth to counteract the numerous external pressures that are emerging in important areas such as financial and commodity markets. In addition to broad, pro enterprise policies, my Department has given a strong mandate to its development agencies to deliver a wide range of measures to help strengthen their clients capacity to undertake more and better innovation, research, technology acquisition and skills development. These are the competitive characteristics on which Ireland will grow. They will be consistently improved and developed to match the changing needs of business.</P>
        <P>In key aspects Ireland remains a strong competitive and efficient location for many sectors. Our competitiveness is robust in the new enterprise sectors on which we are building a growing international reputation. This is borne out by the successful pipeline of R&amp;D projects that IDA Ireland is winning in the face of exceptional competition from other developed countries.</P>
        <P>To address inflation and with a view to keeping costs for enterprises under control, the Government and the Social Partners have agreed to intensify co-operation in responding to inflationary pressures within the framework of the pay agreement, and especially through the work of the Anti-Inflation Group and the High Level Group on Manufacturing.</P>
        <P>On 25th February, 2008 I attended the EU Competitiveness Council held in Brussels. The Ministers rededicated themselves to fully implementing the Lisbon strategy by progressing the remaining reforms in their National Reform Programmes (NRPs). The Ministers identified four particular areas of concentration, namely investing in people and modernising labour markets, unlocking the business potential, especially of SMEs, investing in knowledge and innovation and energy and climate change. The achievement of the Lisbon objectives also depends on the creation of an effective single market.  Coupled with those aims is the commitment to developing and improving education at all levels and to making lifelong learning, in particular, a factor in building the knowledge society.</P>
        <P>In general, from Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, the Commission&rsquo;s recent strategic Report on the implementation of the Lisbon strategy reported that Ireland continues to make very good progress in the implementation of our NRP and good progress on most of the commitments made by the Spring European Council.  Progress was also good over the full 2005-2007 period with regard to the implementation of policies to address micro-economic challenges, notably improving competitiveness, infrastructure, regulation and social inclusion, increasing R&amp;D <Col N="366"/>investment and efficiency, encouraging greater innovation and entrepreneurship and sustainable development.</P>
        <P>In preparation for the Spring Council, 2008 the Member States and the Commission are currently drafting the new Community Lisbon Programme (CLP) for the period 2008-2010, setting out the key Community-level measures. The proposal for a new Community Lisbon programme is based on the integrated guidelines and sets out ten ambitious but realistic priorities that should be achieved at the Community level by 2010.</P>
        <P>This new cycle of the Lisbon Strategy presents the EU with renewed vigour to implement this strategy, despite the new uncertainties in financial markets that are now a cause for concern.  Active implementation of Lisbon has shown how much it can contribute to extending national and European competitiveness.  The importance of science, R&amp;D, innovation, skills and training policies and better regulation are paramount.  I believe that the road to meeting the wider environmental challenges of climate change and energy as well as the trade and development issues have most chance of success if managed collaboratively at EU level.</P>

A further 5 inspectors are due to commence on the 3rd of March 2008 and appointment of inspectors to fill the 4 remaining posts is progressing. Due to success in recent internal Departmental competitions and internal Departmental transfers, 5 of the original 31 inspectors posts are now vacant and therefore, currently, there are 76 inspectors employed in the National Employment Rights Authority.</P>
        <P>As part of the Government decentralisation programme, NERA established its headquarters in Carlow at the end of July 2007. The Social Partnership Agreement Towards 2016 also pro<Col N="367"/>vided that NERA, would be established on a regional basis and in this regard, a new regional structure of NERA has been put in place.</P>
        <P>In addition to inspectors located in NERA headquarters in Carlow, (which covers the counties of Carlow, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Offaly, Wexford, Westmeath and Wicklow), inspectors are located in regional offices now established in Dublin (which covers counties Cavan, Dublin, Meath, Louth and Monaghan), Cork (which covers counties Cork, Kerry, Waterford and South Tipperary), Shannon (which covers counties Clare, Galway, Limerick and North Tipperary) and in Sligo (which covers counties Sligo, Donegal, Leitrim, Longford, Mayo and Roscommon).</P>
        <P>Finally, in the year 2007, twenty-eight cases were referred for prosecution following inspections by NERA inspectors. To date, 11 have resulted in conviction</P>

	<P>The Government is committed to delivering the key package of measures agreed under the chapter dealing with Employment Rights and Compliance in Towards 2016 and in this regard and as part of the Government decentralisation programme, the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) established its headquarters in Carlow at the end of July 2007.</P>
        <P>NERA&rsquo;s regional inspection services office for the Midlands and South East Region, which is co-located with NERA&rsquo;s headquarters in Carlow, covers the counties of Carlow, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Offaly, Wexford, Westmeath and Wicklow. While the twenty-two inspectors working from that regional office are assigned to cases throughout that region they may, as the need arises and at short notice, be deployed to specific areas.</P>
        <P>147 and 377 employment rights inspections were undertaken in County Kildare in 2006 and 2007 respectively. These inspections resulted in the initiation of three prosecutions the proceedings in respect of which are still ongoing.</P>
        <P>The primary objective of the NERA Inspection Services, where breaches of employment law are detected, is to seek compliance and rectification of any breaches identified, including redress for the individual/s concerned and payment of any arrears due to employees. In this regard the NERA Inspection Services recovered arrears amounting to almost &euro;1.4 million in the year 2006 and &euro;2.5 million in the year 2007.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 248 and 249 together.</P><Col N="368"/>
        <P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions.  The marketing of individual areas for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency.  While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Industrial Development Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</P>
        <P>Since the announcement of the closure of NEC, IDA Ireland has promoted Ballivor as a priority location within the Eastern Region.  The Agency continues to work closely with both Enterprise Ireland and Meath County Council with a view to securing a new project for the NEC site and developing initiatives to market Meath, as a whole. Indeed, I am glad to say that a significant number of former NEC employees have found alternative employment with IDA supported industries in the Midlands and East.</P>
        <P>As Ireland competes for investments at the highest end of the value chain the concept of scale is crucial to our economic destiny.  Leading corporations require a significant population of highly qualified talent, effective physical and digital infrastructure coupled with availability of sophisticated professional support services.  If we are to continue being successful in realizing a large proportion of our investments outside of the larger cities, all economic and social stakeholders will need to adhere to the framework on which the NSS is constructed.  Future thinking and action must have a regional rather than a local bias and this requires a significant change in mindset.</P>
        <P>Although the Agency introduced 3 potential investors to the NEC management in Ballivor during 2006, there have been no site visits to the area by potential investors in the past 12 months.  Decisions as to where to visit are ultimately a matter for the investor.</P>
        <P>As regards the NEC site, this property is still in the hands of NEC and the Company has not approached IDA in relation to IDA taking over the facility in Ballivor.  In Meath, IDA Ireland has 28 hectares (70 acres) of serviced industrial lands available at IDA Navan Business Park, where six IDA projects are located.  In addition, there is a new 24 hectares (60 acre) Business Park under development at Drogheda though located technically in Co. Meath.  The Agency is also developing a Business &amp; Technology Park in Mullingar.  All of these sites are within commuting distance of Ballivor.</P>

	<P>In 2007 the National Employment Rights Authority carried out 1,942 inspections/visits in relation to the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000.  The majority of the inspections/visits undertaken were part of a focused employment rights compliance inspection campaign in sectors covered by the National Minimum Wage. </P>
        <P>In 192 cases, breaches were detected for offences such as failure to pay the appropriate rate/training rate under the Act, failure to keep records to show compliance with the Act, failure to keep records for 3 years as required by the Act.

        <P>As stated in my response to Parliamentary Question Number 118 of 12 February 2008, referred to by the Deputy, I am anxious that, during the period of repair and redevelopment <Col N="371"/>of the Natural History Museum, the public should not be deprived of the opportunity to view the exhibits held by the Museum.</P>
        <P>As pointed out by the Deputy, I did not refer in my response to that Parliamentary Question to the possibility of establishing a temporary Seanad Chamber in the Natural History Museum.  The position is that the Office of Public Works advised my Department in the late afternoon of 12 February 2008 that it would be making a presentation to the Commission of the Houses of the Oireachtas in relation to a proposal to carry out structural repairs/improvements to the Seanad and to establish a temporary Seanad Chamber in the ground floor of the Natural History Museum.  This information was conveyed to me later that afternoon, and after I had answered the parliamentary question.  I understand that the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges are discussing a number of options with the OPW.</P>
        <P>The management of the National Museum of Ireland is already developing a plan for the dismounting, documenting and storing of exhibits and is also considering the possibility of displaying a selection of exhibits elsewhere during the period of refurbishment.</P>

The Executive must satisfy itself also that the applicant has a genuine accommodation need for which he or she cannot provide, that a bona fide tenancy arrangement exists between the applicant and the landlord and that the property being rented is suitable to his or her needs.</P>
        <P>In determining whether the accommodation is suited to the person&rsquo;s accommodation needs, the Executive must establish the household composition, the size of the accommodation unit and identify any special needs that the person may have.  As part of this process, the Executive may carry out a visit to the residential premises in question.  This home visit may also be used to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s residence at the address in question.</P>
        <P>The Executive may consider that a property is not suited to the applicant&rsquo;s needs if the accommodation does not comply with housing regulations.  Enforcement of such regulations is <Col N="373"/>a matter for Local Authorities rather than the Community Welfare Service and Community Welfare Officers are not qualified to undertake this work.  However, payment of rent supplement may be withheld where the Executive has been notified by a housing authority regarding non-compliance with housing standards.</P>
        <P>Where a notification is received from a housing authority in respect of an existing tenant, the Executive would normally discuss the situation with the tenant and take whatever action it decides is necessary in the best interests of the tenant.  The objective is to ensure that substandard accommodation does not come within rent supplementation.</P>
        <P>The Executive has provided data to local authorities in relation to all long-term recipients of rent supplement as part of the implementation of RAS.  Over 30,000 cases have been notified to date. The local authorities inspect all such accommodation before accepting it into RAS to ensure it conforms to the relevant standards.</P>
        <P>In relation to landlord taxation matters, it is the tenant, not the landlord, who makes the application for rent supplement.  Payment of rent supplement is made to the tenant in most cases and rent supplement, if awarded, is the property of the tenant in all cases.  The tenant is an uninvolved third party insofar as the landlord&rsquo;s relationship with Revenue is concerned.  It is not a requirement that the tenant&rsquo;s landlord must produce a tax clearance certificate before rent supplement is paid to a tenant as it would be inappropriate to insert the tenant, particularly vulnerable tenants, into the relationship between Revenue and the landlord.</P>
        <P>However, my Department co-operates closely with the Revenue Commissioners in relation to taxation.  It has provided, on an annual basis for many years, details of landlords whose tenants receive rent supplement and continues to work with Revenue on ways to improve the range and quality of information it provides.</P>
        <P>With regard to anti-social behaviour, such behaviour by a tenant is a matter for the landlord in the first instance.  There are a number of avenues open in such cases, including the mediation service for landlords and tenants operated by the Private Residential Tenancies Board and/or recourse to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and/or the Courts in relation to enforcement of the law in relation to anti-social behaviour.  If necessary, a landlord may seek termination of the tenancy which, if effected, would result in the termination of rent supplement.</P>
        <P>Under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, landlords are legally obliged to register tenancies with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).  My Department is committed to working closely with the PRTB to ensure that all tenancies that come within the area of rent supplementation, comply with the statutory system of tenancy regulation and safeguards.  To that end, my Department provides details of rent supplement payments to the PRTB to enable them identify tenancies that are not registered and to take any follow-up action necessary.</P>

	<P>It is a fundamental principle of our social insurance system that those qualifying for benefits must satisfy a range of contribution and other conditions.  In the case of contributory pensions, this involves commencing payment of contributions 10 years before pension age, payment of a minimum number of contributions at an appropriate rate and reaching a minimum average annual contribution rate.  The state pension (contributory) is a valuable benefit and the conditions are designed to ensure that those qualifying have had a sufficient and ongoing attachment to the social insurance system. </P>
        <P>A special pension for the self-employed was introduced in 1999 to enable people who were over age 56 at the time of the introduction of PRSI for the self-employed in 1988, and who could not therefore meet the standard qualifying conditions, to receive a contributory pension.  The qualifying conditions require payment of 260 contributions and the pension is paid at half the maximum rate.</P>
        <P>Similar arrangements were introduced around the same time for people with social insurance contributions dating from before the unified system of social insurance were introduced in 1953.  The objective of both these measures was to provide pensions for people who could not receive payments under standard qualifying conditions, with due regard being paid to the contributory principle underpinning entitlement to social welfare payments generally.</P>
        <P>There is no facility within the social insurance system to allow for payment of social insurance contributions which were not due in the first place by virtue of a person&rsquo;s status as an employee, self-employed, or as a voluntary contributor.</P>
        <P>The special pension for the self-employed was considered to be a reasonable response to the issues raised in this case and that remains the situation.  The state pension (non-contributory) is, of course, available to those people who do not qualify for a contributory pension, or who receive a reduced payment, and who can satisfy a means test.</P>

These measures include the payment of income support through the back to education allowance scheme, the back to work allowance and funding through the activation and family support programme.</P>
        <P>The activation and family support programme fund provides once-off funding to third parties such as support groups to assist welfare recipients, as well as members of their families, improve their employability, personal and family situations through education, training and personal development courses.  The fund is focused on assisting people most marginalised in social and economic terms and is operated in a manner that enables a quick response to any needs identified.  It is not within the remit of the schemes operated by my Department to provide core funding for projects such as capital costs or salaries.</P>
        <P>The activities supported have given much help by way of intensive training, counselling and other supports to groups at risk of developing long-term welfare dependency.

	<P>Rent supplement, which is administered on my behalf by the Health Service Executive (HSE) as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur. Rent limits are set at levels that enable eligible household types to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State.  The objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation having regard to the size of the household. </P>
        <P>Information available to my Department indicates that 69% of recipients of rent supplement pay rent which is at the maximum rent limit appropriate to their circumstances, 21 % pay rent which is below the relevant rent limit and 10% payment which is above the relevant limit.</P>
        <P>The HSE may award Rent Supplement in cases where the rent exceeds these rent limits in certain circumstances e.g. where there are special housing needs related to exceptional circumstances or where the tenant has sufficient additional income, for example from part-time employment, with which to meet the additional cost.  This discretionary power ensures that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme and specifically protects against homelessness. This discretion was applied in 10% of current rent supplement claims.</P>
        <P>I intend to have rent limits reviewed this year with a view to implementing any revision found to be necessary, from 1 July 2008.  A consultative approach will be used to conduct this review.</P>

	<P>Rent Supplement is administered on my behalf by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive (HSE), as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  </P>
        <P>Where the HSE becomes aware that a person receiving a supplementary allowance is not entitled to that allowance, the payment may be stopped and an overpayment may be raised.  Any overpayment of allowance incurred in circumstances of this kind may be recoverable from the recipient. It is a matter for a Community Welfare Officer (CWO) of the HSE to determine if an overpayment should be raised and recovered, taking into account all of the circumstances of each particular case.  Where an overpayment is deemed to be recoverable, a CWO will make appropriate arrangements with the tenant for recovery of the overpayment.</P>
        <P>Provisional figures indicate that the number of supplementary welfare allowance overpayment cases identified for 2007 was 1454 at an estimated value of &euro;2.38m.  There is currently no breakdown available for cases of fraud or suspected fraud and overpayments arising for other reasons.</P>
        <P>The HSE has statutory power to initiate legal proceedings against individuals alleged to have fraudulently claimed supplementary welfare allowance payments.

	<P>The Department of Education and Science has a range of programmes for people wishing to return to education which provide supports for people participating in certain education programmes funded by VECs.  That Department has overall responsibility for coordination of the expansion of adult education provided for in the Programme for Government.</P><Col N="378"/>
        <P>The back to education allowance (BTEA), administered by my Department, to which the Deputy refers, is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the work force.  To qualify for participation in the BTEA scheme an applicant must be, inter alia, in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months, in the case of people wishing to complete a second level course, or twelve months in the case of people wishing to pursue third level qualifications.</P>
        <P>The BTEA scheme was established to assist people who have been out of the workforce for some time and whose opportunities of obtaining employment would be enhanced by participation in the scheme.  The requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the BTEA scheme and this eligibility criterion is necessary to ensure that limited resources are directed at those most in need.  People who are already in employment are not considered to be in the target group for the BTEA scheme.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that, overall, the current arrangements ensure that the scheme continues to support those people who are more distant from the labour market.  Any further changes to the scheme will have to be considered in the context of budget improvements and resources available for social welfare improvement generally.</P>
        <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive.  The purpose of the scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  In general, recipients of rent supplement are primarily dependent on a social welfare or health service executive weekly payment.  Persons in full-time education other than back to education allowance participants administered by my Department do not qualify.</P>

	<P>It is government policy to facilitate the greater use of electronic payment systems in the economy in the interests of developing a world class payments environment in Ireland. In this context, the National Payments Implementation Program Advisory Group, under the aegis of the Department of An Taoiseach, monitors the growth in electronic payments, the reduction in cash transactions and any new payment mechanisms which come on the market. My Department is represented on this Group. </P>
        <P>The current range of payment options offered by my Department to customers&rsquo; includes payment at a local post office or to a bank or building society account; or certain credit unions that have been authorised by the banking and credit union regulators. Customers opt for a particular payment method having regard to their own personal circumstances.  Currently some 50% of customers receive their payment electronically direct to their Post Office, bank or <Col N="379"/>financial institution. The remaining customers are paid by paper based payment instruments &mdash; cheques, post drafts or personal payment order books.</P>
        <P>The Department is implementing a three year strategy to change paper based payment instruments to electronic payments at post offices and financial institutions. The programme is being implemented on a phased basis to coincide with book renewal production schedules and as personalised payable order books expire.  The replacement of books with swipe cards will have no impact on customers paid at post offices. Customers will simply present their Social Services Card and sign for their payment in the normal way. An Post and the Irish Postmaster&rsquo;s Union (IPU) are committed to assisting customers in the use of cards for collecting their payment.  For those customers who cannot collect their payment in person, the Department is putting arrangements in place to allow a nominated person collect their payment using a Social Services card.</P>

	<P>My Department has a contract with National Radio Cabs for the provision of a taxi service in the Dublin area.  This company has 780 taxis in its fleet, 80 of which are wheelchair accessible.  I understand this company encourages its drivers when changing vehicles to take accessibility issues into consideration. It operates a waiting list for those wishing to join the company and gives preference to wheelchair accessible vehicles. About 10% of its fleet consist of disabled accessible vehicles.</P>
        <P>Details of expenditure on taxis by my Department since 2003 is as follows:</P>

        <Quest> if there is a waiting list in relation to oral hearings of social welfare claims; if so, the period of time an applicant has to wait; the number on the waiting list; the number of appeal officers employed by his Department; if there are vacancies of staff due to illness or retirement; if so, the number of placements vacant; the procedures in place in the interim to ensure that the applicant has income; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised that the Social Welfare Appeals Office receives in excess of 14,000 appeals each year and that the provision of a prompt service remains a major customer service objective of that Office. Available resources are prioritized to the greatest possible extent so as to achieve the best possible standard of service to its customers.  At the same time, however, it is necessary to ensure that improvements in processing times are achieved in a manner which is not in conflict with the demands of natural justice and the requirement that every appeal be fully investigated and examined on all its merits. </P>
        <P>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that as of 21 February 2008 there were 1,576 persons awaiting an oral hearing of their appeal of whom 340 have been notified of a date for their hearing.  Oral hearings are granted at the discretion of the Appeals Officer usually <Col N="381"/>in circumstances where there is a conflict of evidence presented by the parties and where an oral hearing is requested by the appellant in order to present his or her case to the Appeals Officer.</P>
        <P>During 2006, the last year for which statistics have been published, the average time taken to process all appeals (oral hearings and those decided summarily) was 21 weeks.  When allowance is made for the 25% most protracted cases, the average time was reduced to 13.8 weeks.  Given the logistics involved in organising oral hearings including, allowing sufficient advance notice to the appellant, it is estimated that the average time to finalise an appeal is increased by about 8 weeks where an oral hearing is involved.</P>
        <P>Processing times cover all phases of the appeal process including the submission by my Department of its comments on the grounds for the appeal, further medical examination by my Department&rsquo;s medical assessors in certain sickness related cases and the arrangements for the holding of oral hearings which are currently afforded in two out of every three cases determined by Appeals Officers.</P>
        <P>There are currently 18 Appeals Officers assigned to the Social Welfare Appeals Office and there are no vacancies at present due to illness or retirement.  Persons awaiting the determination of their appeal and who are without a basic income may apply for supplementary welfare allowance which is administered on behalf of my Department by the Health Service Executive.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the problems that persons are having in seeking to obtain a PPS number in County Kildare due to a change in procedure that the applicant must now apply to the Newbridge office instead of the local offices; the reason these changes are being made; if a review of the procedure will take place to ensure that applicants are not having delays in obtaining payments due to the changes made; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The majority of Irish citizens now have a PPS number and since the modernisation of civil registration in 2003, all children born in the Republic of Ireland are automatically issued with a PPS number following the registration of the birth.  The Department has, for some time, been encountering attempted abuses of the PPS registration process.  In order to combat fraudulent activity of this nature, the number of outlets for the allocation of PPS numbers is being rationalised to one centralised location per County. To date 13 centres have been established outside Dublin and Newbridge is the centre for customers in County Kildare. Acquiring a PPS number is a once in a lifetime event. The PPS number is a main personal identifier and the key to access a broad range of services. It is not therefore unreasonable that a customer attends a dedicated centre on a once off basis for this purpose. </P>
        <P>There is a considerable element of flexibility in the new arrangements, which allow customers attend the nearest or the most convenient centre to their place of residence.  The quality of the service is not affected any way by these arrangements.</P>

	<P>The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) scientific advice is that the stock of spurdog is depleted, that there should be no targeted fishery for spurdog and that the by-catch in mixed fisheries be reduced to the lowest possible level.  On the basis of this advice, Council Regulation (EC) No 40/2008 provides for a 5% by-catch limit for spurdog/dogfish for all community vessels up to a maximum of 390 tonnes for the year in Ireland&rsquo;s case.  I have asked the Marine Institute <Col N="385"/>to examine the current fisheries that are affected by the provisions in relation to spurdog and to advise me if there is a case to have a review of the current restrictions.  </P>

	<P>Purteen Harbour is owned by Mayo County Council and responsibility for its repair and maintenance rests with the Local Authority in the first instance.  A development options study for Purteen Harbour is being carried out by my Department&rsquo;s Western Engineering Division on behalf of Mayo County Council. Considerable progress was made in 2007 and it is hoped to have the study concluded by April of this year. My Department&rsquo;s Engineering Division has been involved in negotiations with Mayo County Council with regard to the provision of funding for the current year and I am pleased to advise that &euro;11,250 has been allocated towards the project for 2008.</P>
        <P>A further check of my records indicates that Purteen Harbour was not included in Mayo County Council&rsquo;s list of funding proposals for 2008. I regret any confusion caused by my reply to Parliamentary Question 313 of 13th February 2008 which indicated otherwise.</P>

A request for the transfer of 48.36 standard entitlements to the person named under the 2007 Single Payment Scheme was also received on 24 April 2007.  As the person named is not a registered herd owner and, as entitlements can only be transferred to persons who hold a herd number, it has not been possible to complete the requested transfer.

	<P>The persons named were granted a herd number by my Department on 12 October 2001. According to my Department&rsquo;s records, the persons named submitted no applications under the Livestock Premia Schemes or the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme in respect of the 2001 or 2002 scheme years. An application was lodged under the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) on 3 September 2002. My Department issued payment in respect of this application in February 2003.</P>
        <P>The persons named applied for an allocation of entitlements under category D of the 2005 Single Payment Scheme National Reserve.  Category D catered for farmers who commenced farming after 31 December 2002 or who, having commenced farming during 2002, did not draw down any direct payments in that year.  The application was deemed ineligible as the persons named commenced farming in 2001.  On a re-examination of the file it appears that the persons named purchased land in 2002.  They might therefore qualify for an allocation from the 2005 National Reserve under category B(1)(investment in land)  While the persons named did not apply to the 2005 National Reserve under this category my Department will now examine the case again with a view to making an allocation from the 2005 National Reserve.  The persons named will be informed of the outcome in writing.</P>

	<P>The forestry programme of the National Development Plan 2007 to 2013 provides for the introduction of a number of new schemes that will encourage and support Irish forestry.  State Aid approval for the afforestation schemes, including an agro-forestry scheme, was received from the European Commission on 13 September 2007.  I have already introduced the new Afforestation Scheme and the new Forest Environmental Protection Scheme, as well as the new Native Woodland Scheme, all of which are key to the growth of the afforestation programme.  The agro-forestry scheme is another strand to this and represents a completely new approach to afforestation for Ireland.  I intend to consult widely before drawing up the detail of the scheme. This process will begin over the coming months and the scheme itself will be launched as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</askee>
        <Quest> if her Department have plans to relax the regulations regarding meat and bone meal; if so, if her <Col N="390"/>Department will allow MBM to be used as fertilizer in the coming years; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish rendering industry produced 151,000 tonnes of meat and bone-meal (MBM) in 2007.  The use or disposal of this material is strictly controlled under Regulation (EC) No. 1774 of 2002 and the bulk of MBM produced continues to be disposed of by way of export for incineration.  My policy is to encourage alternative uses of MBM in Ireland and I am aware of proposals to use MBM in the production of fertilizer.</P>

        <P>Commission Regulation 181 of 2006 allowed the application of MBM based fertilisers subject to a grazing restriction of 21 days. The Regulation further permits Member States to introduce stricter national controls. Landspread of organic fertilisers containing Category 3 MBM is permitted in this country under S.I. No. 615 of 2006 subject to such controls, including a requirement that the fertiliser go through a process of technical transformation to render it unpalatable to animals; a 3-year prohibition on grazing by farmed animals where the fertiliser is applied; a 12-month prohibition on making silage or hay where the material is applied; prohibition on access by farmed animals to the fertiliser; a requirement that the fertiliser must not come into contact with feed; and the registration of end-users subject to conditions laid down by the Department.</P>
        <P>Ireland has traditionally taken advantage of flexibility to introduce stricter national controls to counter the risk of BSE and other diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease in the context of protecting public and animal health and to safeguard our very important beef export industry.  My Department is currently engaged in a review of regulations in this area with a view to possible relaxation in light of the significantly reduced incidence of BSE.</P>

        <P>My policy is to encourage alternative uses of MBM in Ireland. In excess of 20,000 tonnes of MBM was used in cement manufacture during 2007 as a very useful replacement for fossil fuels.  I am also aware of proposals to use Category 3 MBM in the production of fertilizer. Landspread of organic fertilisers containing Category 3 MBM is permitted in this country under S.I. No. 615 of 2006, subject to certain restrictions.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that officials of my Department have had initial discussions with a number of parties interested in the use of MBM in fertilizer. As the information concerned is commercially sensitive, I cannot disclose the details of any forecasts discussed during those meetings regarding how much MBM might be used for this purpose.</P>

        <P>The findings from these three Evaluation Reports were published in a document entitled The SPHE Story &mdash; an example of incremental change in the school setting. This document is available in hard copy as well as on the SPHE website at http://www.sphe.ie/.</P>

        <P>The Departments commitments under the Strategy did include the delivery of the SPHE programme in all Second level schools. (Action 33 refers) This has been mandatory for all Junior Cycle pupils since September 2003.</P>

        <Quest> the names of the primary schools in each county which received emergency works funding; and the total funding provided for each county under the scheme. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The details of the schools approved for funding under the contingency fund in 2007 are given in the following tabular statement.  I have arranged to have the details of total funding by county forwarded to the Deputy. Grants from this fund are available for very urgent unforeseen works, primarily of a major health and safety nature, to schools that are in most need of resources for capital works that cannot be funded by the schools from their annual minor works grant. </P>

	<P>In the period 2003 to 2007, 335 primary and post primary schools accepted an allocation of funding under the Permanent Accommodation Scheme at a cost in excess of &euro;103m.  This Scheme allows schools to proceed with small scale permanent building projects with minimum interaction with my Department.  Of the 335 approved projects, 166 were completed by the end of 2007, 47 are on site and the remainder are in advanced stages of architectural planning.  I will arrange to forward a list of the projects to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>Bofield Mixed N.S. (RN 14418O) has received &euro;119,718.98 in Capital Funding since 2000. This comprises &euro;20,191 in 2005 for Radon Mitigation, &euro;2,273.08 in 2004 and &euro;97,254.90 in 2002 for repair to windows, <Col N="436"/>play areas, walls and surface water.  Ceara N.S. (RN 16630W) has received &euro;384,323.46 in Capital Funding since 2000.  This is comprised of &euro;380,000 from the Small Schools Scheme in 2006 and 2007 and a Furniture payment of &euro;4,323.46 in 2002.  In addition to the above payments, all Primary Schools with permanent recognition (including Bofield Mixed N.S. and Ceara N.S.) benefit annually from the Minor Works Grant, which has a current rate of &euro;5,500 per school and &euro;18.50 per pupil and &euro;74.00 per special needs pupil.</P>
        <P>In 2004, all Primary Schools received a Science Grant in the amount of &euro;1,000 per school and &euro;10 per pupil, which has allowed the acquisition of appropriate resources and materials for science work.

	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to contacts relating to the building project.  The Planning and Building Unit of my Department would have had numerous contacts with the school in question from 2000 to date. These would have included correspondence/phone contacts etc, in relation to the development of the building project from initial application stage, development of a brief for the project, appointment of a design team, progression of the project through the various stages of architectural planning etc.  The delivery of all building projects, including the project for the school in question will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. </P>

        <Quest> the number of section 29 appeals taken to her Department on a county basis; the number of cases where the appeal was upheld; the number where the appeal was rejected; the measures that are taken by her Department to ensure that the appeals mechanism is consistently applied throughout the entire county to ensure that all matters regarding the important process is consistently applied and rigorously enforced; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The information requested by the Deputy on a county by county basis is not readily available within my Department and would involve an inordinate amount of administrative time to compile. However, I can inform the Deputy that in 2006 and 2007 a total of 266 and 383 appeals respectively were dealt with by my Department under Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998.  These figures cover both first and second level students.  The position in relation to 2006 is that 65 appeals were withdrawn.  A further 15 appeals were resolved by local agreement and 22 were resolved by an independent <Col N="437"/>facilitator.  The remaining 161 cases were heard by an appeals committee and of these 73 were upheld in favour of the student.</P>
        <P>In 2007, 81 appeals were withdrawn.  A further 20 appeals were resolved by local agreement and 64 were resolved by an independent facilitator.  The remaining 218 cases were heard by an appeals committee and of these 88 were upheld in favour of the appellant.  All appeals under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 are dealt with in accordance with the &ldquo;Procedures for Hearing and Determining appeals&rdquo; which issued under Circular M48/01 in 2001.  These procedures are available on my Department&rsquo;s web site at <i>www.education.gov.ie</i>.  The procedures are universally applied regardless of the geographic location of any appeal.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I wish to advise the Deputy that there are 22 people working in the special education section of my Department.  The National Council for Special Education has 98 staff comprising 79 Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) and 19 civil servants.  There is currently a recruitment process underway to fill an additional 3 SENO posts.  This is a significant allocation of staff working exclusively in supporting and improving delivery of education services to persons with special educational needs.</P>

	<P>The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations, including organising the holding of examinations and determining procedures in places where examinations are conducted.  I am advised by the Commission that it is very strongly committed to maintaining the anonymity of candidates in its examining processes.  This anonymity is enhanced through the system of allocating examination numbers to candidates sitting the Certificate Examinations.  The position is that the Commission receives entries for admission to the Certificate Examinations from a number of sources.  Details of pupils attending recognised post-primary schools are obtained electronically from my Department based on data submitted by schools in their October Returns.  As part of the transfer process of this data to the Commission, Junior Certificate (including those attending VTOS centres) and Leaving Certificate candidates are assigned ranges of examination numbers.</P>
        <P>Candidates who are not attending recognised post-primary schools and who apply for admission to the Leaving Certificate examination, generally known as External Candidates, are assigned a different range of examination numbers.  The Commission has received applications from 4,093 External Candidates to take the Leaving Certificate examination in 2008.  The Com<Col N="438"/>mission has advised me that it is satisfied that the methodology used to allocate examination numbers does not undermine the anonymity of the system.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special needs. SNAs are sanctioned specifically to assist in the care of pupils and students with disabilities in an educational context. The SENOs operate within the policy outlined in my Department&rsquo;s circular for allocating such support.</P>
        <P>My officials have been in contact with the NCSE regarding the reference to special needs assistant support for the pupil referred to by the Deputy. The NCSE has confirmed that the SENO has not received a request for such support from the school.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>My Department is not aware that the school in question does not have running water.  Primary school authorities may use their annual minor works grant to deal with smaller scale works. In November 2006 I increased funding for the minor works grant by 44% on the previous year.  Around &euro;27m was paid out to primary schools throughout the country late last year to enable thousands of small scale works to be completed without the need to interact with my Department.  Another avenue to claim grant-aid from my Department is the Emergency Works Fund.  Grants from this fund are available for very urgent unforeseen works, primarily of a major health and safety nature, to schools that are in most need of resources for capital works.  The school management should <Col N="439"/>make contact with the Modernisation and Policy Section of my Department&rsquo;s Planning and Building Unit in the matter.</P>

The Claim sought to have a pass degree, together with 12 years satisfactory teaching experience equated to an honours degree for the purpose of receiving the degree allowance.  Currently, Teachers receive an allowance of &euro;1,846 for a pass degree and &euro;4,928 for an honours degree.  The claim from the Teacher Unions was not conceded on the grounds that teaching experience gained by a teacher was already recognised by the incremental salary scale, and that the degree allowance aims to recognise academic performance by teachers.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department provides a range of teaching and care supports for children with special educational needs, including children with Down Syndrome. The precise level of support is deter<Col N="442"/>mined by the special educational needs of the particular child.  Children with Down Syndrome are entitled to additional provision in school, either under the terms of the general allocation system of teaching supports if the child&rsquo;s assessment places the child in the high incidence disability category or through an allocation of additional resources if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department&rsquo;s circular. </P>
        <P>In circumstances where a Down Syndrome child has other associated needs and would fall into the low incidence disability categories, this may automatically attract an individual resource teaching allocation.

        <P>Applications for reasonable accommodations are submitted by the school which a candidate attends on prescribed application forms. Applications are normally invited one year in advance of the examination concerned.  In respect of the 2008 Certificate Examinations some 4,500 applications for the use of a reader in the examinations have been approved to date.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the State Examinations Commission that readers are appointed by the school authorities. The Commission recognises that a candidate may have worked with a particular person during his/her course of study and, in the interests of the candidate, the Commission accepts that a school may wish to nominate as reader such a person or some other person from the school locality.</P>
        <P>A person nominated as reader should have a capacity to read the question paper in any language subject chosen by the candidate. It is acceptable to have different persons act as reader to match the subject choices of the candidate. The Commission informs schools that, where the person acting as reader is not familiar with the candidate&rsquo;s requirements, it is desirable that he/she should attend at the examination centre on the day before the examinations commence in order to meet the candidate and to allow for practice sessions with the candidate.</P>

On 1 February, I announced a list of schools which are due to go to construction in 2008. It is also my intention to make further announcements of projects to progress to tender and construction during the course of the year as the school building programme is rolled out.</P>
        <P>The Summer Works Scheme was introduced in 2004. Since then, over 3,000 projects costing in excess of &euro;300 million have been completed. Considerable extra investment has been provided in the Budget to increase funding for school buildings to almost &euro;600 million this year. With so many small projects having been completed over the past few years, I am focusing on delivering as many large scale projects as possible in 2008. There is not, therefore, a new Summer Works Scheme as part of our building programme this year.</P>

By enabling children in special classes to have access to a range of methodologies, including ABA, the Government is doing what we are advised is in the best interests of such children.</P>
        <P>My Department supports the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use. Children in special classes have the benefit of fully-qualified teachers trained in educating and developing children generally and who have access to additional training in autism-specific approaches, including ABA. The level of such training available to teachers has significantly improved in recent years and is a major priority for the Government. Children in special classes <Col N="449"/>in mainstream schools also have the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration into mainstream classes and of interaction with other pupils.</P>
        <P>In excess of 277 autism-specific classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level and the National Council for Special Education will continue to establish more such classes where the need arises. At primary level there is a maximum of six children in each special class with a teacher and at least two special needs assistants (SNAs). Extra assistants are provided where the children need them. An individual child can have access to full-time support from an individual SNA if he or she needs one.</P>

       <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The report on the Task Force on Dyslexia contains over 60 individual recommendations ranging across a wide variety of issues from identification and assessment, to models of service delivery, specialist training for service providers, to issues relating to structural reforms and the maintenance of a data-base of pupils with specific learning difficulties, including dyslexia, who are in receipt of special education services in primary and post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>Substantial progress has been made in the implementation of the Task Force&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The pupil:teacher ratio in special classes catering for pupils with dyslexia has been reduced, from 11:1 to 9:1.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department also implemented a new scheme for allocating learning support/resource teachers to schools to cater for the needs of children with high-incidence special educational needs including dyslexia in all primary schools in September 2005. The general allocation model was designed to ensure that each school has learning support/resource teaching support available to meet the needs of children with high incidence special needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Training for teachers has also improved significantly. In September 2003, my Department established the SESS to manage, co-ordinate and develop a range of supports in response to identified training needs. The SESS has since been expanded to provide training to over 17,000 teachers annually, including seminars to primary and post-primary schools. This includes ongoing support to primary and post-primary schools by teams specialising in Dyslexia. The SESS also provide targeted training in catering for students with dyslexia to schools for children with specific learning difficulties. The first ever on-line course for teachers who work with dyslexic students has been introduced. In 2007, over 500 teachers availed of the on-line training module in Dyslexia. A resource pack for schools in CD-Rom, DVD and video format, on understanding and catering for dyslexia, has been provided to schools.  Training is also available through the 21 Teacher Education Centres nationally for teachers using ICT and assistive technologies to support pupils with special educational needs, including those with dyslexia.</P>
        <P>A combined post graduate learning support and special educational needs programme for teachers has also been introduced, offering some 300 places annually.</P>
        <P>As part of its response to the growing demand from teachers for support and training, the SESS is currently developing teams of trainers to deliver training in four specific areas: Autism, Challenging Behaviour, Dyslexia, and Inclusion. This training will be delivered locally through the Education Centre network and/or through whole-staff in-school support. The SESS provides fees subsidies for the on-line training course, &ldquo;Dyslexia: Identification and Early Interventions&rdquo;. Fees subsidies are also provided for teachers to enable them to avail of the Dyslexia Association of Ireland courses.</P>
        <P>Regarding the issue of reasonable accommodations in state examinations, the range of reasonable accommodations which may be approved for examination candidates with specific learning difficulties, including dyslexia, include the use of special examination centres, readers for candidates who have reading difficulties, scribes, tape-recorders, and the use of computer technology for candidates who have writing difficulties, exemption from elements of standard assessment. Enlarged papers are provided to candidates with visual impairment. Applications for reasonable accommodations are submitted by candidates&rsquo; schools on prescribed application forms and are normally invited one year in advance of the examination concerned. The State Examinations Commission endeavours to consider these applications as early as possible in the year of examination.</P><Col N="453"/>
        <P>The State Examinations Commission is currently re-examining policy and practice in relation to explanatory notes being appended to certificates of candidates with specific learning difficulties. This will include a public consultation process and will take into account best international practice.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above measures, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has been in operation since 1 January 2005 with over 90 members of staff working exclusively in supporting students with special educational needs. The NCSE was established under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act (EPSEN) 2004 to improve the delivery of education services to persons with special educational needs arising from disabilities. Since it was established in 2005, the NCSE has been responsible for allocating resources for children with special educational needs including children with Dyslexia. The NCSE has a key role in the delivery of services and operates through a network of special educational needs organisers (SENOs) who act as a focal point of contact for schools and parents.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the legislative front, the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 provides for an educational assessment for children with special educational needs and the entitlement to an education plan to meet those needs. As the Deputy will also be aware, many sections of the Act have already commenced and I am anxious to implement the Act in full in the quickest time possible. However, following consideration of the issues raised in the Council&rsquo;s implementation plan, and the consultations to date with the Education Partners, I consider that the five-year timeframe acknowledged in the legislation is the appropriate period in which to implement the remaining provisions of the Act.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Deputy will be aware of my position on the issues of litigation in special educational needs and assuming that this is the category referred to, the Deputy can be assured that neither I nor my Department take lightly any decision to defend cases concerning children with special educational needs.  I should emphasise that my Department does not initiate any such proceedings and cases are generally only litigated where no potential settlement is acceptable to both sides and the Government&rsquo;s authority to decide issues of policy is in question.  The State has an obligation under the Constitution to provide for primary education. In the context of children with special educational needs, that education must be appropriate to their requirements.  The State decides on an appropriate form of provision, having regard to the advice available to it from relevant experts in the National Educational Psychological Service, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Inspectorate and independent experts.  The Department is not complacent in dealing with these cases and attempts, wherever possible, to reduce the potential for litigation and the levels of legal costs where they arise.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the level of resources being made available by my Department to support students with special educational needs in mainstream education nationally has grown significantly in recent years.</P>
        <P>There are now over 8,800 teachers at primary and post-primary schools working directly with children with special educational needs, including those requiring learning support, compared with fewer than 1,700 in 1998.  In addition, significant progress has been made in relation to increasing the number of special needs assistants (SNAs) in our schools who specifically cater for children with care needs.  There are currently in excess of 9,800 SNAs in primary, post-<Col N="457"/>primary and special schools supporting pupils with special care needs compared with approximately 300 in 1998.</P>

        <P>At that point, the Department of Health and Children/Health Service Executive assumes direct responsibility for young adults with special educational needs who are over 18 years.  My Department, at that stage, may allocate resources towards an education component of such provision.</P>

	<P>The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available.  While comprehensive information is held on individual school files, the Department does not yet have these details available in a format that provides readily accessible cumulative information on the overall position.  It is, however, intended to address this issue as part of a general review of rental policy that is currently being undertaken.  I assure the Deputy that every effort is made by the Department to keep expenditure on prefabricated accommodation as low as possible.</P>
        <P>Where accommodation is needed at very short notice, however, a temporary solution can be the only option.  Such accommodation may also be used where the need is short-term, such as when a school requires a temporary building while it is awaiting the completion of construction of permanent facilities.  Last year, only 5% of the total investment in school buildings went on the rental of temporary accommodation.</P>
        <P>This year nearly &euro;600 million will be invested in school buildings and construction work will take place which is expected to provide permanent accommodation for about 20,000 pupils when complete.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that in the past newly-recognised schools have generally had to open in temporary accommodation.  I have been anxious to move away from this approach in developing areas and this year we are working hard to open as many new schools as possible in permanent accommodation.  Department officials have been working in partnership with local authority staff to acquire sites needed for new schools next September.</P>
        <P>Considerable effort has also been invested in pre-planning discussions with a view to ironing out any difficulties that might otherwise have been experienced at planning permission stage.  I also held very productive meetings with a number of county managers and their senior planners and appreciate the effort that they have put into working with us on this.  Sites for each <Col N="459"/>of the September 2008 projects have been identified and site master-plans have been developed by the technical teams.</P>
        <P>Our aim, where possible, is to put permanent solutions in place on a phased basis to meet the immediate September 2008 needs with a second phase to follow as required.  Permanent solutions will be possible where a long-term site has been secured.  A significant amount of building work on the new schools is being done off-site.  The successful tenderers for the construction of each individual project have been notified.  Project teams which were recruited from the private sector in October 2007 have been tasked with preparing the planning applications, undertaking the necessary surveys and overseeing the delivery of the schools on each site.</P>
        <P>To conclude, expenditure on temporary accommodation has tended to represent a very small proportion of the overall investment in school buildings in recent years.  The use of prefabs is avoided where possible but sometimes they can be the only feasible option.  And we are now working to ensure that, where possible, new schools in developing areas will open in permanent accommodation from the start.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 379 to 394, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The European Union military mission to Chad and the Central African Republic, EUFOR TCHAD/RCA, established under the authority of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1778 (2007), was formally launched by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 28 January 2008.  Ireland is expected to be the second largest contributor of troops to the <Col N="461"/>mission, which aims to protect civilians in danger, particularly refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid, and protect UN personnel.</P>
        <P>The lack of key enablers, in particular tactical and medevac helicopters and medical facilities, had delayed the commencement of the deployment of EUFOR troops to Chad last December.  EUFOR&rsquo;s Operation Commander, Lt. General Nash, was adamant at the time that the deployment would not proceed until these vital components were in place.</P>
        <P>Deployment of EUFOR personnel commenced last month before the outbreak of hostilities between Sudanese backed rebels and the Chadian forces on 2 and 3 February 2008, during which time the deployment was suspended.  When the situation in Chad stabilised, the deployment of EUFOR&rsquo;s Initial Entry Force to Chad re-commenced on 12 February 2008.</P>
        <P>At my meeting with the Operation Commander, Lt. General Nash, at the Operation Headquarters in Paris on 13 February 2008, he assured me that the capabilities required to support EUFOR&rsquo;s main force deployment will be established by mid-March 2008.  The Operation Headquarters has since confirmed that there are now Role 2 facilities (Advanced life support, Basic surgery, Intensive care) in N&rsquo;Djamena in Chad and in Birao in the Central African Republic.  There is also a Role 1 facility in Ab&eacute;ch&eacute;, which has the capability to provide emergency treatment to injured and acutely ill personnel.  Air evacuation assets (1 x fixed wing medevac aircraft and 3 x designated medevac helicopters) are also currently in place.</P>
        <P>A role 2 facility is due to be operational in Ab&eacute;ch&eacute; before the deployment of the main body of troops.  In addition, each Battalion will provide a Role 1 Medical Facility at the Battalion Headquarters (Goz Beida in the case of the Irish Battalion).</P>
        <P>By mid-March 2008, the Operation Commander is planning that the mission will achieve initial operational capability with at least 1,200 troops in theatre.  Planning for the follow on deployment of three multi-national Battalions, including the Irish Battalion, can then commence.  The logistics of deploying the multi-national Battalions requires extensive planning as the vast majority of equipment etc., will arrive in Douala port in Cameroon and will be transported from there to the relevant operational sector.  Lt. General Nash is satisfied that the Operation Headquarters will have the necessary logistical arrangements in place to accommodate this.  Ireland and Sweden will be the first of the multi-nationals to deploy.  The mission is planned to reach full operational capability by mid-May 2008.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces, in association with the Operation Headquarters, has in place a logistics operational planning process for the deployment of Irish troops to the mission.  This includes a comprehensive plan for the over-ground movement of all Irish sea lifted assets and material from the port of Douala in Cameroon to the Irish Battalion&rsquo;s operating base in Goz Beida in south east Chad.  The distance from the port to Goz Beida is estimated at more than 2,700 kilometres.  It is estimated that the overall time for the transportation of equipment from Dublin to Goz Beida is approximately forty-nine (49) days.</P>
        <P>I receive both operational and intelligence briefs regarding the deployment of Defence Forces personnel to the mission on an ongoing basis from the Defence Forces.  The Chief of Staff also accompanied me on my recent visit to the Force&rsquo;s Operation Headquarters, where the Operation Commander briefed us.</P>
        <P>The deployment of 53 Army Ranger Wing (ARW) personnel to Chad, as part of EUFOR&rsquo;s Initial Entry Force to the mission area, was completed on 21 February 2008, bringing the total number of personnel currently deployed to the mission in Chad to 56.  This includes three personnel, who were deployed to Chad in January 2008 as part of the Command Group of the Force Headquarters.  In addition, seventeen Defence Forces personnel are deployed at the Operation Headquarters in Paris.</P><Col N="462"/>
        <P>A number of the ARW personnel remained in the Chadian capital, N&rsquo;Djamena, pending the arrival by air of their transport vehicles and equipment this week.  The remainder of the ARW personnel are currently deployed at their operational base in Ab&eacute;ch&eacute;, a distance of 900 km from N&rsquo;Djamena.  The  ARW personnel will be working in tandem with other EUFOR special forces and will focus immediately on identifying suitable base camp locations for the main body of Irish forces who are due to arrive over the coming weeks and months.</P>
        <P>Based on current planning by the Defence Forces, in consultation with the Operation Headquarters, the advance group of the Irish (97th) Infantry Battalion is expected to deploy to Chad in late April 2008.  The main body of the Battalion is expected to deploy in mid-May 2008, in advance of the rainy season, which commences in June.</P>
        <P>On arrival in N&rsquo;Djamena, members of the 97th Infantry Battalion will be moved forward to the Irish Camp at Goz Beida.  This onward deployment from the capital will be either by road or by air or indeed a combination of both.  To travel solely by road would take four days, by air one day.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied with the level of co-operation being given by the French forces.  During the initial planning phase for the EUFOR mission, the French Armed Forces assisted members of the Defence Forces by facilitating reconnaissance missions to Chad.  The French also agreed to act as lead nation for logistics, supplying a Logistics Battalion to EUFOR TCHAD/RCA and this will prove to be of benefit to the Defence Forces during their deployment phase.  I am advised that there are no outstanding issues between the French Armed Forces and the Defence Forces and that mechanisms are in place to resolve further requirements that may arise.</P>
        <P>There are two French AF 342 attack Helicopters in theatre as part of the EUFOR mission, which are under the operational control of the Operational Commander.  The likely tasks for these helicopters are, inter alia: force protection, surveillance, information gathering, early warning of possible threats and the provision of greater visibility to the commander in theatre.</P>
        <P>Surveillance aircraft and unmanned drones are assets of the Force Commander and it is he who will task same, in accordance with force priorities.  At certain times, they may be operating in the airspace of the 97th Infantry Battalion.</P>
        <P>The provision of all aspects of the supply of Class 1 items, food and water, and Class 3 stores, Petrol, Oil and Lubricants to Irish troops in theatre is planned and forecasted.  This supply will be delivered via the Force logistics system from the Forward Logistics Base in Ab&eacute;ch&eacute;.  Organic Irish assets will move the supply to the Forward Operating Base by road and air.  There is full co-operation available to Ireland from France, the Logistics Lead Nation, in all aspects of support required within their means and capabilities.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces have developed a stress tested set of logistics capability packages for the deployment to Chad.  This provides for the full spectrum of support and services to the individual soldier, and to the unit as a deployed entity.  These packages also provide for specialist support for sensitive cargoes.  In this context, the necessary refrigeration of essential medical supplies is provided for in the projection of assets, material and equipment into Chad.  When the sensitive cargoes that have been under refrigeration arrive into Africa for onward movement, there are facilities in place to maintain the required refrigerated conditions.  This process has been tested many times in past missions, and particularly so in deployments to Somalia, Eritrea and Liberia.</P>

	<P>The Army Pensions Acts provide for the consideration of a claim for a disability pension in respect of disablement due to wound or injury attributable to service in the Permanent Defence Force. Application must be made within one year of discharge from the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
        <P>The person concerned was discharged from the Permanent Defence Force in 1963 and applied for a disability pension in July, 1980 and again in September, 1993. However, as the statutory time limit had long since elapsed in this case, an application for a disability pension could not be accepted.</P>
        <P>There is no record of any compensation claim of the nature outlined by the deputy in relation to the individual in question. The person concerned did however initiate a hearing loss claim, which was settled in 2002. Any compensation claim lodged at this stage would be statute barred.</P>

 </tgroup><P Just="Left">*<Miles com="ix" />The Financial Management System (FMS), which was used from 1999 to 31/12/2005, did not have the facility to record taxi costs separately.   Therefore, details of taxi fare costs for 2003, 2004 and 2005 are not available electronically. Access to this information (2003 to 2005) can only be gained by manually inspecting up to 150,000 T&amp;S claims. The time and manpower involved in such a project would be very time-consuming and it would be difficult to justify the use of manpower.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest> the number of prison nurse officers recruited to date, as planned under the National Drugs Strategy 2001 to 2008; the location where each of these officers are placed and their job description; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Drugs Strategy 2001 to 2008 contained a commitment to continue to implement the recommendations <Col N="464"/>of the Steering Group on Prison-Based Drug Treatment Services which dealt only with the area covered by the then Eastern Regional Health Authority and recommended the recruitment of an additional 9 Nurse Officers.  Since the publication of the National Drugs Strategy there has been an increase of over 30 in the number of Nurse Officers in the Prison Service. These additional Nurse Officers as part of their duties support the implementation of the recommendations in the National Drug Strategy which informed the current Irish Prison Service Drugs Policy and Strategy which was published in May 2006 and which deals with the entire prison estate.</P>
        <P>Included in the number (30) outlined above are seven dedicated Addiction Nurse Officers which were appointed under the Irish Prison Service Drugs Policy and Strategy.  These seven Addiction Nurse Officers have been allocated, to date, solely to support drug treatment in the prisons.  In addition to prison nurse officers, additional prison officers, a psychologist and contract addiction counsellors (24 whole-time-equivalents) have been also provided to support prison drug treatment.</P>
        <P>The role of the nurse in the Prison Addiction Service is to provide a standard of nursing care to service users in a primary health care prison setting that conforms to best practice and An Bord Altranais code of professional conduct.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will no doubt appreciate, drug rehabilitation programmes for prisoners involve a significant multidimensional input by a diverse range of general and specialist services provided both by the Irish Prison Service and visiting statutory and non-statutory organisations.  The programmes seek to reduce the demand for drugs within the prison system through education, treatment and rehabilitation services for drug-addicted prisoners.  Particular initiatives include, inter alia, the provision of detoxification, methadone maintenance, education programmes, addiction counselling, and drug therapy programmes.</P>
        <P>Under the Drugs Policy &amp; Strategy &mdash; Keeping Drugs Out of Prisons &mdash; existing drug treatment programmes are being expanded and enhanced with the further recruitment of nurses, psychologist and the above mentioned addiction counsellors, as well as other staff including prison officers.  The expansion of these services is being achieved in partnership with community based services and will see a significant improvement in the range, quality and availability of drug treatment services in the prisons.</P>
        <P>Specific developments to date include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The awarding of a contract for the provision of Addiction Counsellor Services to Merchants Quay Ireland. The Addiction Counselling Service will, in conjunction with other developments, deliver nearly 1000 hours per week of prisoner access to addiction counselling;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The allocation of additional Nurse Officers and Prison Officers to Dedicated Drug Treatment Teams in prisons with significant needs, improving service quality in prisons, along with the provision of funding under the Dormant Accounts Fund to community groups to provide addiction counselling and support to prisoners while in prison and on release in the community;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The provision of additional specialist sessions in addiction psychiatry, significantly improving the quality, coordination and availability of drug treatment in prisons;</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">In addition, an in-reach Hepatitis C Nurse-Led Service is being contracted from St James&rsquo; Hospital to provide Hepatitis C treatment for prisoners. This service will cover the Mountjoy <Col N="465"/>Complex and Wheatfield in the first instance.  It is hoped to expand this service to other sites if evidence of need is demonstrated; and</P>
<P>These services will be provided on the basis of clinical needs and will be supported by the implementation of a system of Mandatory Drug Testing (provided for in the Prisons Act 2007).</P>
<P>The implementation of this Policy and Strategy has also seen an intensification of efforts to eliminate the availability of illicit drugs within prisons including:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Tighter control and monitoring of prisoner visits in all closed prisons;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />New visiting arrangements in most closed prisons, with visitors required to be pre-approved by the Governor and required to provide identification on each visit;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Greater use of screened visits;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Greater vigilance in examining mail by prison censors and searching of other items entering the prison;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Increased random searching of cells and their occupants;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Stricter searching of all persons committed to custody and prisoners returning from court, temporary release, after visits or on receipt of intelligence;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Use of modern cameras and probe systems which assist in searching previously difficult areas such as hollow chair or bed legs, under floor boards and other cavities;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Installation of nets over exercise yards to prevent access to contraband items, including mobile phones and drugs; and,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Use of phone detectors and phased installation of telephone blocking technology.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I would also like to advise the Deputy that a number of new security initiatives are shortly being introduced in all closed prisons.  Amongst the measures will be:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The introduction of enhanced security screening for all persons (prisoners, visitors and staff) entering our prisons;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The establishment of a drug detection dog service within the Irish Prison Service involving approximately 30 handling teams; and,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The establishment of an Operational Support Group dedicated to and developing expertise in searching and gathering intelligence on illicit material being hidden inside our prisons; they will be available in addition to the normal prison staff and can target specific security problem areas.</P>

	<P>On 1 March 2007 the four children detention schools, based in Finglas and Oberstown, were transferred from the Department of Education and Science to the Irish Youth Justice Service of my Department.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Three of the children detention schools are located at Oberstown, Co. Dublin, and facilities include a stand alone six-bed unit which is, I believe, the unit to which the Deputy refers. This unit had been completed in 2003 under the supervision of the Department of Education and Science.  Following the transfer of responsibility, the Irish Youth Justice Service recommissioned and furnished the unit.  This facilitated the transfer of girls and staff from an older facility which formed part of Oberstown Girls School.  The new unit, Cuan Beag, provides an improved standard of accommodation.</P>
        <P>Cuan Beag is now operational as part of Oberstown Girls School and was formally opened by the Minister for Children on 7 September 2007.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I recently approved the 2008 Garda Annual Policing Plan and laid it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It sets out the Commissioner&rsquo;s proposals to realign the boundaries of Garda Divisions around the country to make them coterminous with local authority boundaries.  Included in this is a plan to establish new Garda Divisions in Louth, Meath, Kildare, and Wicklow. The planned changes will bring about greater efficiencies and effectiveness in facilitating the establishment and functioning of Joint Policing Committees.  A detailed programme of work is currently being developed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to implement these planned changes for various Garda Divisions.  This programme of work will also examine the geographical areas of district and sub-district stations arising from the regional and divisional boundary realignments set out in the plan and will set out a timetable for the establishment of the new divisions.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 6 March 2004 and claimed asylum. Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>The person concerned  was informed by letter dated 13 February 2006 that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her and afforded her three options in accordance with Section 3 (3) (b) (ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended): namely to <Col N="470"/>leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a Deportation Order or to submit, within 15 working days, written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State, i.e. why she should not be deported.</P>
        <P>Her case was examined under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to all representations submitted on her behalf for permission to remain temporarily in the State. On 17 October 2006 my predecessor refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of her. A notice of this Order dated 15 November 2006 was served by registered post. Said notice also invited the making of a Subsidiary Protection application pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 &mdash; Statutory Instrument No. 518 of 2006, which came into effect on 10 October 2006.</P>
        <P>By correspondence dated 6 December 2006, an application for Subsidiary Protection was made together with a request to reconsider the Section 3 (6) application for temporary leave to remain of the person concerned. Following consideration of the information submitted, the deportation order was affirmed and the legal representative of the person concerned was notified of this decision by letter dated 19 December 2006.</P>
        <P>In order to consider the Subsidiary Protection application, the Deportation Order signed by my predecessor on 17 October 2006 was revoked. An order of revocation was signed in this regard on 28 June 2007 by one of the senior officials in my Department. Following consideration of the Subsidiary Protection application lodged, it was found that the person concerned was not eligible under the Regulations. Subsequent to this decision, consideration was again given to the person concerned under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, for permission to remain temporarily in the State. On 31 October 2007, I refused permission to remain and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of her. Notice of this Order was served by registered post requiring her to present herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), on Tuesday 13 November, 2007, in order to make travel arrangements for her deportation from the State.  In response to further representations received on 3rd December, 2007 the person concerned was notified by letter that the decision to make a Deportation Order in respect of her remained unchanged and  on 4th December 2007 she was removed from the State to Nigeria under a valid Deportation Order.</P>

        <Quest> the reason the intended capacity in the proposed women&rsquo;s prison at Thornton Hall is double that of the D&oacute;chas Centre when international best practice recommends a reduction in use of incarceration for women; if a full review of the use of detention for women will be conducted in advance of the drawing up of plans for the new prison; if the proposed prison complex in Kilworth, County Cork will include facilities for women; if so the number of same; if he will make a statement regarding the proposed closure of the D&oacute;chas Centre in view of the unique character and regime of the centre; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that the proposed new prison facilities at Thornton Hall will cater for a greater number of women prisoners than is currently provided for at the D&oacute;chas Centre.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the D&oacute;chas Centre was designed to accommodate 80 women.  However, since the facility was commissioned it regularly accommodates prisoner numbers in excess of its design capacity.  Taking this into account, coupled with the need to future-proof <Col N="471"/>the Thornton Hall facilities in capacity terms, the women&rsquo;s prison at Thornton will provide accommodation for 170 women.  The design will be based on the concept of single room occupancy, will allow for the separation of sentenced and non-sentenced offenders and will afford a greater opportunity of enhanced regimes, thus allowing for greater flexibility.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to move away from the basic architectural design principles of the D&oacute;chas Centre. The design has proved to be a successful (prison) model and the design of the women&rsquo;s prison at Thornton seeks to build on the experience and lessons of the D&oacute;chas model, whilst expanding the regime options and fostering the ethos of D&oacute;chas, i.e. a  domestic scale courtyard development consisting of a number of house units of single occupancy en-suite accommodation. Each house will also have domestic style cooking and laundry facilities, etc.</P>
        <P>In relation to the proposed new prison development at Kilworth, County Cork, I can confirm that the Irish Prison Service intends to provide accommodation for women prisoners in the new development. Although the project has not reached detailed design stage, the likelihood is that the new facility will have accommodation for about 40 women following a similar model to the D&oacute;chas and Thornton designs.  This includes separate accommodation for remand and sentenced prisoners.</P>

These are generally dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. It is likely, therefore, that further processing of the application will commence in late 2009.  I will inform the Deputy and the person in question when I have reached a decision on the matter.</P>

        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 3 June 2004, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of submitting written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain in the State.  Representations were received on behalf of the person concerned.</P>
        <P>Following consideration of the case of the person concerned, under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, as an exceptional measure and subject to certain conditions, the person concerned was granted temporary permission to remain in the State for one year until 3 August 2005. This permission was subsequently renewed for a further two years until 3 August 2007.  Additionally, this permission has been renewed for a further three year period until 20 February 2011. The person concerned was notified of this latter renewal decision by letter dated 20 February 2008.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that Section 36 of the Prisons Act 2007, which was brought into operation from the 1st May 2007, makes it an offence for prisoners to have unauthorised possession of or to use mobile telecommunications devices.  Under the Act, it is also an offence to supply such a device to a prisoner.</P>
        <P>One of the major challenges in prisons worldwide lies in preventing access to or use of mobile phones by prisoners. Efforts are made on a continuous basis to prevent prisoners obtaining or using mobile phones.  Such efforts include the installation of nets over exercise yards, vigilant observation of prisoners by staff, extensive CCTV monitoring, the use of screened visits and prisoner and cell searches.</P>
        <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that I am determined to deal with the problem of prisoners using mobile phones to maintain illicit contact with the outside world.  As I have already indicated to the House, I believe that technology offers the only real answer to dealing with the problem.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the third and final phase of the installation of a pilot scheme of mobile phone inhibition at the Midlands Prison is almost complete.  Following the successful completion of the pilot project, roll-out will commence across the prison estate.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will, I am sure, appreciate that for security and commercial reasons it would be inappropriate for me to put the names of any company with which we have been in contact into the public domain at this point.  Furthermore, I cannot divulge technical details of the inhibitors or the costs of the pilot scheme at this juncture.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will appreciate, on occasion it is necessary to put some prisoners in a place of safety within the prison system when they prove difficult to manage in the general prison population or where authorised by a Prison Doctor for medical observation or for the prisoner&rsquo;s own protection if he/she has suicidal tendencies.  Close Supervision and Special Observation cells are used on such occasions.  These are single occupancy cells with larger windows, a door with a full-face observation window, cell light as close to natural daylight as possible, a communications system including &ldquo;Cell Call System&rdquo;, a television where possible, in-cell sanitation and other technical improvements in the materials used to finish the walls and to improve the quality of the mattress, blankets and bed.  The design of the cells, coupled with the issuing of special clothing, greatly contributes to meeting the needs and respecting the dignity and self-respect of the prisoner in a way consistent with his/her safety.</P>
        <P>The number of placements of prisoners in such cells in 2007 is set out in the following table. However, it should be noted that the same prisoner may be placed in such a cell more than once in a year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 419 to 421, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that on 31 January 2008 (the latest date for which figures are readily available), one Sergeant and 12 Garda&iacute; were attached to the dedicated Divisional Drug Unit in the Wicklow/Wexford Division. The personnel strength of the Wicklow/Wexford Garda Division on 31 January 2008 was 364.</P>
        <P>On 31 January 2008, one Sergeant and seven Garda&iacute; were attached to the dedicated Divisional Drug Unit in the Carlow/Kildare Division. The personnel strength of the Carlow/Kildare Garda Division on 31 January 2008 was 403.</P>
        <P>On 31 January 2008, two Sergeants and 12 Garda&iacute; were attached to the dedicated Divisional Drug Unit in the Louth/Meath Division. The personnel strength of the Louth/Meath Garda Division on 31 January 2008 was 532.</P>
        <P>All members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are tasked with enforcing the law, including drug-related legislation, with training provided by the Student/Probationer School at the Garda College and ongoing education programmes delivered by Continuous Development trainers located in every Garda Division.</P>
        <P>Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from the Louth/Meath and Carlow/Kildare Divisions have undergone training in the area of test purchasing with the Garda National Drugs Unit to facilitate the running of initiatives under Operation Cleanstreet, which targets on-street drug dealing within these Divisions, and to upskill other members within the Divisions. This training programme is being rolled out to other Garda Divisions nationwide.</P>
        <P>Training modules in relation to drug detection are part of all Detective Training Courses and Sergeants&rsquo; Promotional Development Programmes.  However, the development of such skills is primarily gained from experienced Garda members and as such this component of training is facilitated by the policy of Student Garda placements with relevant specialist units.</P><Col N="478"/>
        <P>The Garda National Drugs Unit and Criminal Assets Bureau both run a number of specific training programmes, for selected members in Divisions, which can have direct influence on drug detections.</P>
        <P>The following is the drug-related training provided to all Student/Probationer Garda&iacute;.</P>
<P el="10">Phase I</P>
<P el="0">Student Garda&iacute;, as part of the Student/Probationer Education/Training and Development Programme, are instructed on drug offences and drug legislation. While the majority of this training deals specifically with the Misuse of Drugs legislation 1977-2006, it is recognised that the subject cannot be dealt with in isolation and therefore elements of drug enforcement and prosecution are included in further training, dealing with Treatment of Persons in Custody, Evidence and Court Procedure, arrests, warrants and searching of persons and vehicles.</P>
<P el="10">Phase II</P>
<P el="0">As part of Phase II Experiential Training, Student Garda&iacute; spend a week long placement with a Divisional Drug Unit where they gain valuable experience in the investigation, detection and prosecution of drugs offences.</P>
<P el="10">Phase III</P>
<P el="0">As part of the Phase III Student/Probationer Education/Training and Development Programme, Student Garda&iacute; receive further training in respect of the Misuse of Drugs legislation.  The intervention is at a deeper level of instruction and builds on what the Student Garda learned on Phase I and experienced on Phase II.  The intervention is delivered using facilitative teaching techniques that encourages discussion and interaction among Student Garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>Along with the formal instruction on Phase I and Phase III and the experiential learning on Phase II, Student Garda&iacute; are also involved in the completion of Case Study assessments where they are required to develop investigation files for assessment purposes.  This contributes greatly to their learning.</P>
<P el="10">Phase V</P>
<P el="0">A Superintendent from the Garda National Drugs Unit (GNDU) provides an input to Phase V Probationer Garda&iacute; on drug detection and the role of the GNDU.</P>

	<P>Directive 2006/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the retention of data was due to be transposed by September 2007. Following consultations between interested parties and my Department, I expect to shortly finalise my proposals so that the Directive can be transposed into Irish law in the coming months.   </P>
        <P>Transposition of the Directive will result in Ireland having a similar system of data retention to all of the other Member States of the European Union.  This will allow the Member States to cooperate more fully in responding to crime and in particular to transnational criminal gangs and to the threats posed by terrorists, both from within and from outside the European Union.</P>
        <P>Ireland has challenged the legal base of the Directive before the European Court of Justice.  This challenge relates to a point of principle rather than to the substance of the Directive with which we have no significant difficulty.  Our challenge to the Directive does not absolve us <Col N="480"/>from our responsibility to transpose the Directive and, as I have outlined, work is progressing steadily in that regard.</P>

	<P>Neither the Government nor any State agency maintains a &lsquo;data retention file&rsquo; concerning the use made of any telecommunications device by any person.</P>
        <P>Pursuant to Part 7 of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005, telephony data are required to be retained for a period of three years.  In all such cases, however, the data are retained by the telecommunications service providers themselves and not by any State agency.  Any data so retained may only be accessed in accordance with the conditions set out in Section 64(1)(<i>a</i>)-(<i>e</i>) of the 2005 Act.</P>
        <P>In this regard, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Permanent Defence Force may request access to specific retained data only for the purposes of the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of crime and/or for the safeguarding of the security of the State.  It would not be in the public interest to reveal the number of such requests, if any, made by either organisation.</P>
        <P>The 2005 Act provides for a number of robust safeguards in relation to the accessing of retained data.  In this regard, Part 7 of the 2005 Act extends the duties of the Designated Judge under the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 to the data retention provisions of this Part.  In particular, the Designated Judge shall, inter alia, keep the operation of the provisions of Part 7 under review and ascertain whether the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Permanent Defence Force are complying with its provisions.</P>
        <P>Moreover, Part 7 of the 2005 Act also extends the duties of the Complaints Referee under the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 to the data retention provisions of this Part.  In particular, the Complaints Referee shall investigate, on foot of a complaint alleging improper access, whether, inter alia, any provision of Section 64 was contravened in relation to any such access request.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 429 to 431, inclusive, together.  </P>
        <P>CONNECT was piloted with EU Integra Funding in the years prior to 2000 and was announced as part of the 2000 to 2006 National Development Plan.  Expenditure under the programme consisted in the main, of staff salaries and materials for the work training area.</P>
        <P>CONNECT consisted of three strands: Work Training (including Special Projects); Sentence Management; Capital Project CONNECT&rsquo;s original focus was on vocational orientation and training for prisoners, combined with job placement at the time of release.  CONNECT in its structure was intended to permit other needs of prisoners (which may impact on their employability) to be addressed through the services available within prison.</P>
        <P>An internal Irish Prison Service review of CONNECT was carried out in 2002.  The result of which was a decision to refocus the project to concentrate on the Work Training area.  It was decided that the sentence management elements needed to be aligned more centrally within the prison system rather than residing in the work training area.  This change in focus was subsequently agreed by the Regional Monitoring Committees that monitor the NDP during the Mid-term Review Process.</P>
        <P>The refocus towards the provision of enhanced pre-vocational and vocational training in Irish prisons involved dedicated new staffing and funding for the expansion of work training in the prison system.  The Work Training Service now comprises an authorised complement of over 250 posts &mdash; a major increase on the numbers engaged prior to the Agreement for Organisational Change of 158, resulting in new activities and workshops, and over &euro;5 million has been spent in the last two years alone, on the ongoing workshop refurbishment and equipment replacement programme. New workshops and activities are also continuing to be developed at various institutions.  Furthermore, a Quality Assurance System (QAS) is being introduced to underpin FETAC certification of a range of vocational and employability programmes and courses.</P>
        <P>Currently we have over 90 workshops operating across the prison estate.  The new prison development at Thornton Hall will provide extensive work training facilities, providing vocational skills to upwards of 700 prisoners each day.</P>
        <P>The learning from CONNECT, in respect of such other aspects as individual programme planning, and indeed from new interventions piloted in other initiatives such as the EQUAL project, a  European Social Fund (ESF) programme, is being taken into account in the development and rollout of Integrated Sentence Management (ISM).  ISM, which is being funded under the new National Development Plan, will provide for initial risk and needs assessments, individualised plans and targeted service delivery to prisoners. ISM will be delivered progressively over the lifetime of the NDP.</P>

	<P>Education in prisons is delivered by way of partnership between the Irish Prison Service and a range of educational agencies from the community.  Vocational Education Committees (VECs) and Public Library Services make the largest contribution to, and are the mainstay of, the Prison Education Service.</P><Col N="482"/>
        <P>During the academic year 2007/2008, 220 whole-time equivalent teachers are the main providers of these education programmes.  This enables education to be provided in all prisons, as well as special teaching arrangements where prisoners are segregated (e.g. Portlaoise, Mountjoy, Wheatfield, Limerick, Midlands, Castlerea and Cork).</P>
        <P>Other Agencies also contribute significantly to prison education, for example: The Open University, which now caters for close to 100 prisoners annually on degree-level distance education courses; The Arts Council, which provides writers&rsquo; workshops and artists&rsquo; workshops; Other third-level colleges, such as the National College of Art and Design, which is involved in Portlaoise and the Midlands Prisons; Three full-time librarians, employed by Dublin Public Libraries, work in prisons in the Dublin area.</P>
        <P>With regard to the curriculum objectives, methods and course content are largely those of adult education.  FETAC accreditation is widely used in prison education with all Prison Education Units being accepted as meeting the quality assurance standards demanded by FETAC.  In broad terms, courses may be classified as follows: Basic Education, including Literacy and Numeracy; General subjects, e.g. English, History, Geography, Mathematics, Languages, Computers; Physical Education, Home Economics and Health Education; The Arts, e.g. Visual arts, Music, Drama, Creative Writing, Photography; Technology Courses, (e.g. Woodwork, Metalwork) and Horticulture; Courses that address particular problems or needs that prisoners have, e.g. Pre-Release courses, Addiction Awareness, Child care, Group Skills, and Anger Management.</P>
        <P>A directory of prison education is published each year.  The directory outlines the courses and other educational supports that are available to prisoners in each prison.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service places a strong emphasis on the provision of work and training activities for prisoners.  Training activities are chosen to give as much employment as possible for those in prison and to give opportunities to acquire skills which will help them secure employment on their release.  There are a wide range of training workshops operating within the institutions e.g. metalwork, printing, computers, braille, woodwork, construction, industrial contract cleaning, craft, horticulture, electronics etc.  In addition, the work and training function covers such essential services as catering and laundry services.  The environmental waste management programme and the health and safety function also operate under the aegis of the work and training service.  External accreditation of certified training is available for a number of courses run within the institutions.</P>
        <P>The Work Training Service comprises an authorised complement of over 250 posts &mdash; a major increase on the numbers engaged prior to the Agreement for Organisational Change of 158, resulting in new activities and workshops.  Currently over 90 workshops are operating across the prison estate.</P>
        <P>It is important that the Irish Prison Service trains our prisoners, where possible, to certified levels of achievement to match the qualifications required in the community for jobs.  Currently there are a number of courses in place which are externally accredited (such as laundry skills by the Guild of Launderers and Cleaners, Chef courses by City and Guilds etc), and the aim is to significantly increase the number of such courses over the coming years.  To this end, Prison Management is currently working with FETAC to develop an appropriate quality assurance system to underpin the certification of a range of additional courses.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the numbers that can be allocated to each course or activity is dependent on a number of issues.  For example, the numbers in some courses may be restricted due to the nature of the course, if specialist classrooms are needed and also due to health <Col N="483"/>and safety procedures which must be adhered to.  In general for most courses and activities prisoners can join at any time.  Every effort is made to accommodate students in the course of their choice or another course if their choice is full.  Therefore it is very seldom that there is a waiting period for participation in education or work and training.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 433 and 434 together.  </P>
        <P>Prison education is delivered in prisons by way of partnership between the Irish Prison Service and a range of educational agencies from the community, particularly local Vocational Education Committees and Public Library Services.  During the academic year 2007/08, the Department of Education and Science has provided an allocation of 220 whole-time teacher equivalents to the prisons.</P>
        <P>Literacy work has been a strong element of the Prison Education curriculum since the early 1980&rsquo;s.  The literacy curriculum concentrates on the needs of the individual and respects the adult status of the student, his/her prior knowledge, skills and life experience.  It is also concerned with improving self-esteem and building confidence.</P>
        <P>An Adult Basic Education Development Worker is employed with specific responsibility for implementing and supporting developments and initiatives in the area of literacy, numeracy, English for speakers of other languages and basic education.  Because of the literacy deficit of the prisoner population, literacy work forms an element of more than just the timetabled literacy classes.  All teachers are aware of the literacy needs and these are dealt with as part of the general coursework of prisoners.  This is a very effective method of linking the literacy learning programme of prisoners to an area they can engage with and is widely used in adult education.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service is implementing the new assessment framework devised by the National Adult Literacy Agency; &ldquo;Mapping the Learning Journey&rdquo;, an assessment framework that identifies learner progress, provides tangible feedback and indicates areas on which to focus.  It is a useful tool for both learning and teaching.</P>
        <P>Progress has been made linking the education and training needs of prisoners since 2003, with the literacy action plan prepared by the prison education unit of each prison becoming one vehicle for integrating the efforts of the education and training sectors in prisons.  Peer tutoring, promoting family literacy and developing post-release support for prisoners who undertake literacy tuition in prison are also promoted by the Prison Education staff wherever feasible.</P>
        <P>Each student coming into the Prison Education Centre will have an individual interview to assess his/her educational needs and interests.  Those with literacy difficulties are prioritised and slotted into class almost immediately.  Every effort is made to publicise literacy classes and encourage as many prisoners as possible to avail of classes.</P>

In general these facilities are available in the evening and at weekends, when the prisoners have completed their normal day to day activities, such as education courses, vocational training, or cleaning and catering duties.</P>

	<P>To effect a Deportation Order, and where the person concerned does not hold valid travel documents, it is normal practice to secure the necessary travel documents from the country to which it is intended to return the person concerned.  It is only possible to deport a person on an EU travel letter where the country of return is willing to accept the validity of such a document.  Kosovo and Albania are currently the only countries where we issue EU travel letters in respect of deportations, and prior to their accession to the EU on 1st January, 2007, Romania and Bulgaria also recognised EU travel letters issued by Ireland.  EU travel letters are only valid for the return of the person concerned, travelling on a specific route and on a specific date.  There is no record of a country of return refusing to accept the validity of an EU travel letter which was issued in respect of a person being deported.</P><Col N="486"/>
        <P>Although it is not possible to give an indication of the exact number of EU travel letters issued by my Department for the full period requested by the Deputy without diverting staff from other important work, which would not be justified, I can inform the Deputy that approximately 286 such documents were issued in 2006, 4 in 2007 and 1 to date in 2008.</P>

	<P>The Visa Information System (VIS) is being established as a centralised database of short-term visa applications with the express purpose of countering visa fraud.  The VIS will improve the administration of the common visa policy, the consular cooperation and the consultation between central consular authorities in order to prevent threats to internal security and &lsquo;visa shopping&rsquo;.  It will also facilitate checks at external border checkpoints and within the territory of the Member States, will assist in the identification and return of illegal immigrants and in the application of the &ldquo;Dublin II Regulation&rdquo; (EC) No 343/2003[6].  Exchange of data on other national long-stay visas is also included.</P>
        <P>The Regulation was adopted in June 2007 and work is currently underway on the establishment of the procedures and conditions for the exchange of data.  Ireland did not take part in the adoption of the VIS Regulation due to our limited participation in the Schengen acquis.</P>

	<P>At my request, the Government has given its approval for Ireland to agree to the adoption of the Council Framework Decision on the organisation and content of the exchange of information extracted from criminal records between Member States, by the Council of Ministers of the EU. It has also authorised me, having regard to article 29.4.6 of the Constitution, to propose an appropriate motion in both Houses of the Oireachtas approving the Council Framework Decision, in advance of its adoption. </P>
        <P el="10"><i>The Council Framework Decision:</i></P>
<P el="0"><Miles com="is0p4" />i. <Miles com="ix" />Provides for the transmission of information on a conviction handed down against the national of another Member State by the Member State of conviction to the Member State of the person&rsquo;s nationality;</P>

<P el="0">iii. <Miles com="ix" />Lays down the framework for a computerised conviction information exchange system between Member States to be built and developed on the basis of this Council Framework Decision and a subsequent Council Decision.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">At its meeting on 12-13 June 2007, the Council of Ministers of the EU reached an agreement on a general approach on the proposal for a Council Framework Decision. Subsequently, negotiations on the Preamble to and the Form annexed to the proposal have been completed within the Council. The European Parliament has been re-consulted on the text of the proposal for a Council Framework Decision. It has been asked to deliver its opinion on the text by 26 April 2008.</P>
        <P>I expect that the Council Framework Decision will be submitted to the Council of Ministers for adoption shortly after the 26 April deadline has expired, presuming that all general parliamentary scrutiny reservations on the proposal have been lifted. In that regard, the necessary procedures are being implemented in order for an appropriate motion to be put to both Houses of the Oireachtas approving the Council Framework Decision. Copies of the latest text of the Council Framework Decision were laid before both Houses on the 11th of February 2008.</P>

	<P>Prisoner rehabilitation involves significant multidimensional input by a diverse range of general and specialist services provided both by the Irish Prison Service and in-reaching statutory and non-statutory services.  Amongst these are health care, psychiatric, psychological, educational, vocational, counselling, welfare and spiritual services.  These services are important in addressing offending behaviour, drug and alcohol addiction, missed educational and vocational opportunities, anger management, and self management in the interest of encouraging positive personal development in prisoners, and preparing them for re-integration and resettlement on release from custody.  Details of the major services available in prisons are set out below.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Education</i></P>
        <P el="0">Educational services are now available at all institutions and is provided in partnership with a range of educational agencies in the community including the VECs, Public Library Services, Colleges and the Arts Council.  Broad programmes of education are made available which generally follow an adult education approach.  During the academic year 2007/08, 220 whole-time-equivalent VEC teachers were the main providers of these education programmes.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Work Training</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Work Training programme operates at each prison.  As well as organising necessary services such as catering and laundry, it also provides work and training opportunities for prisoners whilst ensuring a high quality of service delivery within the prison.  Work Training provides structured pre-vocational and vocational training so that persons in custody can acquire the skills that may help them to obtain employment after their release.  The Programme for Organisational Change provided for a significant expansion and development of vocational training programmes.  This is being facilitated by an increased budgetary allocation and by an increase of almost 100 in the prison grade staff involved in work and training activities.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Probation Service</i></P>
        <P el="0">This Service has an active role during the course of the prisoner&rsquo;s sentence in helping maintain links with family and community agencies, encouraging prisoners to address their offending behaviour and engaging prisoners in individual counselling and group counselling programmes such as offending behaviour, addiction, violence and sex offending.  The Service also provides supervision in certain cases under temporary release provisions.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Chaplaincy Service</i></P>
        <P el="0">Prison Chaplains promote the spiritual and pastoral welfare of prisoners and also participate with other services in the secular care of prisoners.  The work of the Chaplaincy Service involves extensive contact with prisoners on personal and family matters as well as other issues which arise in relation to their confinement in prison.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Psychology Service</i></P>
        <P el="0">The principal aim of this service is to provide, in co-operation with others, a generic therapeutic service to prisoners aimed at addressing their psychological needs and at reducing re-offending.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Drug Treatment</i></P>
        <P el="0">Drug rehabilitation programmes for prisoners involve a significant multidimensional input by a diverse range of general and specialist services provided both by the Irish Prison Service <Col N="493"/>and visiting statutory and non-statutory organisations.  The programmes seek to reduce the demand for drugs within the prison system through education, treatment and rehabilitation services for drug-addicted prisoners.  Particular initiatives include the provision of detoxification, methadone maintenance, education programmes, an information forum, addiction counselling, drug therapy programmes and the operation of Voluntary Drug Testing Units (more commonly known as drug-free areas).</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service Drugs Policy &amp; Strategy &mdash; Keeping Drugs Out of Prisons- caters for the expansion of existing drug treatment programmes and further recruitment of dedicated staff.  The expansion of these services is being achieved in partnership with community based services and will see a significant improvement in the range, quality and availability of drug treatment service in the prisons.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Sex Offender Programmes</i></P>
        <P el="0">Every effort is made to assist sex offenders in custody who are willing to participate at any level in their personal rehabilitation and relapse prevention.  In this regard, there are three forms of direct therapeutic intervention currently available &mdash; i.e. individual counselling from the Irish Prison Service&rsquo;s Psychology Service and from the Probation Service; the Sex Offender Programme which has been in operation since 1994, and the Psychiatric Service which provides some support to prisoners in this category.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 459 to 462, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Under Section 29 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 I may, by Order and in the interest of public safety and security, declare specific firearms and ammunition as &ldquo;restricted&rdquo;, by reference to their category, calibre, working mechanism, muzzle energy and description. I recently made S.I. No. 21 of 2008, the Firearms (Restricted Firearms and Ammunition) Order, 2008 which designates certain firearms as &lsquo;restricted&rsquo; by virtue of the above criteria.  Where a person wishes to possess such a firearm they will be required to make an application to the Garda Commissioner for the grant of a firearms certificate and satisfy the Commissioner that they <Col N="494"/>comply with the conditions set out in Section 4 of the Firearms Act, 1925 as amended by the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  In addition, firearms dealers will be required to seek an authorisation from me for the importation of firearms for sale. It should be noted that where a firearm is deemed &ldquo;restricted&rdquo; it does not mean that the possession or sale of such firearms is prohibited.</P>
        <P>Last year, officials of my Department consulted with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, organisations representing different shooting interest groups and firearms dealers representatives regarding the drafting of this Order. The Firearms Consultative Panel, which I set up in 2007 to assist with the introduction of the firearms licensing regime is currently considering criteria for dealers wishing to deal in restricted firearms. I expect the Panel to report on the recommended criteria for selection in due course.  Invitations for applications to become a dealer in restricted firearms are expected to issue next month.</P>
        <P>The Order comes into force on 1 May 2008 and my Department issued a copy of the Order to each Registered Firearms Dealer last week. A letter also issued indicating that dealers who do not intend to apply for an Authorisation, but who have firearms in stock which will be regarded as restricted after 1 May next, will have until the end of the current licensing period (end of July) to dispose of them. The 1 May date was chosen because it provides a three month period, from the date the Order comes into force to the start of the new licensing period, within which applications can be assessed.  This is consistent with Section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which I will shortly commence and which provides, inter alia, for a three month time period within which applications for a firearms licence must be processed.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Justice Act 2006 did not provide for compensation to dealers in respect of firearms held in stock which will now be restricted. It is, of course, open to a firearms dealers to seek an authorisation to trade in restricted firearms until all of the remaining stock in question have been sold. Alternatively, they may choose to sell to other dealers who intend trading in restricted firearms.  In effect, from the date of receipt of a copy of the Order, firearms dealers will have over 5 months to dispose of the restricted firearms stock in question or to register as a dealer in restricted firearms.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Question No. 242 of Thursday 31 January 2008 and the written reply to that Question.</P>
        <P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 31 January 2006 and applied for asylum on 1 February 2006. His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), he was informed, by letter dated 31 August 2006, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of submitting written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain in the State. Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned and will be fully considered before the file is passed to me for decision.</P>
        <P>In relation to the question of the person concerned marrying his friend, the Deputy might note that while it is open to the person concerned to make an application for residence based on verifiable evidence of a durable relationship suitably attested or civil marriage to an EU National under the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) (No.2) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 656 of 2006 &mdash; Directive 2004/38/EC), it is unlikely that such an application would be successful as the person concerned would appear to have no history of lawful residence in another Member State prior to their arrival in the State, as required by Regulation 3.2 of those Regulations. I am not in a position to indicate how the German authorities might view such a marriage/relationship.</P>

        <P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 14 April 2004 and made an application for asylum the following day.  Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 11 November 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned.</P>
        <P>On 10 October 2006, regulations known as the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006) came into force. The person concerned was notified by letter dated 7 February 2008 that she could, if she so wished, submit an application for Subsidiary Protection. She was also invited to update her earlier representations to the Minister. She was requested to respond within 15 working days.  No application for Subsidiary Protection has been received on behalf of the person concerned to date.

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 7 December 2005 and applied for asylum on 16 February 2006. His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>On 2 March 2006 the person concerned applied for permission to remain in the State under the Revised Arrangements for Parents of Irish Born Children, born in the State prior to 1 January 2005, commonly known as the IBC/05 Scheme.  However, as the closing date for receipt of applications under the IBC/05 scheme was 31 March 2005, the application was received much too late for consideration. Consequently the application, and all supporting documentation, were returned to the person concerned on 18 August 2006.</P><Col N="498"/>
        <P>Based on the rejection of the asylum claim of the person concerned, and in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 13 June 2006, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of submitting written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain in the State. Representations were submitted on behalf of the person concerned at that time and remain on his case file.</P>
        <P>On 24 August 2006 the person concerned indicated to Officials in my Department that he wished to return to Italy where he had previously had a right of residency. However, while the necessary arrangements were made to facilitate his return to Italy, it would appear that the person concerned was refused entry into Italy and therefore he returned to this State on 3 November 2006.</P>
        <P>Further applications for residency in the State on the basis of his parentage of an Irish born child have subsequently been received from and on behalf of the person concerned. However, since the closure of the IBC/05 Scheme in March 2005, there has been no separate process for applying for residency in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child. As a result, the case file of the person concerned falls to be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended). During this process, all representations submitted by and on behalf of the person concerned will be carefully considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement in advance of the file being passed to me for decision.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 20 May 2000 and applied for asylum. His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), he was informed, by letter dated 1 August 2002, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of submitting written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain in the State. Representations were submitted on behalf of the person concerned at that time and remain on his case file.</P><Col N="499"/>
        <P>The person concerned then lodged Judicial Review Proceedings in the High Court and, on appeal, to the Supreme Court, challenging the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal to reject his asylum appeal. These Proceedings were unsuccessful. The Supreme Court decision was made on 14 January 2005.</P>
        <P>Since that date, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department has no record of any contact with or from the person concerned. As a result, it was considered that the person concerned no longer wished to pursue his application for permission to remain in the State. However, as a result of the Deputy&rsquo;s Parliamentary Question, the case file of the person concerned is being re-activated and I understand that a representative of my Department will be in contact with the person concerned in the coming days with a view to having his case progressed.</P>

        <P>Officials in that section are currently processing applications received in mid 2005 and have approximately 7,000 applications on hand to be dealt with before that of the person in question.

        <P>However, I understand that the person concerned is a refugee.

It is likely, therefore, that further processing of the application will commence in the coming months.  I will inform the Deputy and the individual in question when I have reached a decision on the matter.</P>

	<P>The person referred to by the Deputy was previously granted permission to remain in the State on student conditions. I have been informed by the Immigration Division of my Department that the person concerned has failed to comply with the Immigration Regulations regarding his permission to remain in the State. </P>
        <P>Permission to remain was granted in respect of the person concerned strictly on the grounds that he cannot have access to State funds, services or benefits.  He cannot therefore have an expectation, having been granted permission to remain on a self sufficiency basis, to avail of State benefits and services including attending State funded schools.</P>
        <P>It follows that the child of an individual in the State on a self sufficiency basis is not entitled to attend a public/non-fee paying school.  Should  such an individual wish to enroll their child in the schooling system they would have to do this through a fee-paying school or fee-paying institution.</P>
        <P>The person concerned should attend at the Garda National Immigration Bureau to enable him to be granted a further permission for a three month period, in order that he can achieve the required attendance record during this  period which he has failed to do previously. If he achieves the required attendance record his permission to remain may be extended further.</P>
        <P>However, permission to remain in the State can only be granted up until 31st July 2008 because he has dependents in the State attending publicly-funded schools.</P>

        <P>The making and amending of rent schemes is the responsibility of local authorities as an integral part of their housing management functions, subject to the broad principles laid down by my Department in Circular letter HRT 3/2002 of 6 March 2002.  I have no plans to change these principles at present. Decisions on whether or not to disregard either a proportion of income or particular sources of income, including the living alone and fuel allowances, for the purposes of calculating rents are matters for each individual local authority.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I consider it important that housing authorities should ensure that rent increases do not absorb an excessive amount of increases in income of tenants on low-incomes, including persons dependent on Social Welfare payments, particularly those in receipt of the Old Age pension. In that regard, my Department advised authorities in Circular letter HRT 3/2002 that, as a general guideline, it is considered that no more than 15% of any increase in such pension income should be absorbed by an increase in rent.	</P>

        <P>The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs, the provision of a premises and the making of such other provisions as it considers necessary or desirable, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under section 10 of the Fire Services Act 1981.</P>

        <P>In August 2007, Waterford Fire Authority requested a meeting with the Department to discuss the construction of fire stations in the County, in the context of the Department&rsquo;s fire service capital programme.  Following this meeting, the Department requested the fire authority to prioritise capital projects for consideration under the programme.  The authority replied on 9 October 2007 to the effect that Lismore and Portlaw were its first and second priorities for replacement fire stations ahead of Tallow.  On 4 February 2008 the Council wrote to the Department confirming these priorities.</P>

	<P>The graveyard at Templebeg, Upperchurch, Co Tipperary, like many others throughout Ireland, is located within an ancient church site, which dates back to between the fifth and seventh century AD.  In cases like this, the surviving walled graveyard is usually part of a much larger archaeological site defined by one or a number of concentric enclosures.  The buried features and deposits in the area around the graveyard can be of great importance from an archeological point of view specifically because they have not have been disturbed by burials.  Where my Department, in the exercise of its functions in relation to heritage protection, is asked for its views on works at or in the vicinity of such sites it takes account, in considering the matter, of the relevant circumstances in each particular case.</P>
        <P>My Department visited Templebeg graveyard in September 2007 to examine, having regard to current levels of use of the graveyard and any accompanying requirement for an access road, whether it might be possible to improve access in a sensitive manner, while minimising any impact on the archaeological features and deposits in the vicinity of the graveyard.  The Department was satisfied that the existing graveyard is at the core of a much larger archaeological site on which any access road would have a significant impact.  Nevertheless, in recognition of the Graveyard Committee&rsquo;s wish to improve access to the graveyard, there is now agreement, following a meeting with the Committee in January 2008, on a type of pathway that would improve access but could be done in a manner that is sensitive to the archaeological features. Proposals for this pathway are currently being drawn up.</P>

	<P>On foot of an application for a foreshore licence, my Department was asked on 29 June 2007 by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to comment on the proposed local authority development given its potential to impact on underwater archaeological heritage.  The Department responded on 7 August 2007 recommending that an underwater archaeological assessment of the proposed development area be undertaken given its high archaeological potential.  There are a large number of archaeological wrecks in this vicinity generally and it is close to the landing point of French troops in 1798.  As part of this assessment an application for a dive/survey licence covering the relevant foreshore, inter-tidal area and seabed was made to the Department by archaeological consultants to the local authority on 23 January 2008.  However, certain additional information was required to enable the application to be processed.  The information requested was received by my Department and the necessary licence has issued in this case.</P>

	<P>I have announced my intention to increase, by 31 March 2008, the present landfill levy from:</P>
<P el="5">(a) &euro;15 per tonne to &euro;20 per tonne for waste legally deposited, and</P>
<P el="5">(b) &euro;20 per tonne to &euro;25 per tonne for waste illegally deposited.</P>
<P el="5" FLI="0">This is the first increase in the levy in respect of legally deposited waste since it was first introduced in 2002 and the first increase for waste illegally deposited since its introduction in 2006.</P>
        <P>The increase will apply on a national basis in respect of all waste deposited.  Landfill gate fees have fallen dramatically in recent years and this factor is impacting on the necessary diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill.  The practice of deploying economic instruments such as landfill taxes as economic drivers to promote recycling and diversion of waste from landfill is widespread in the EU.  In the recently published National Waste Report for 2006, the EPA identified a number of policy instruments, including increased landfill levies, that could help increase the diversion rate of biodegradable waste from landfill and assist in the efforts to meet the very challenging diversion targets set for this waste stream in the EU Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC).</P>
        <P>The landfill levy generates income for the Environment Fund that can be used for a range of environmentally beneficial purposes, including improved enforcement measures, grant aid of local authority recycling infrastructure and assistance towards the costs of remediation of closed or so called &lsquo;legacy&rsquo; landfills.  This increase will allow further support for local authority recycling infrastructure to assist acceleration in recycling activity which will, in turn, contribute to meeting the landfill diversion targets.  This will occur in a context in which the previous EU co-funding for this purpose will no longer be available.</P>

        <P>My Department advised local authorities that the approach in respect of the 2008/9 Register should be to maintain and build on the progress they had made.  Authorities were required to publish the Register for 2008/9 on 1 February 2008.</P>

Progress towards ratification of the Convention is closely aligned with work at EU level and, in that context, the European Union has adopted two Directives as part of the ratification process for the Convention.

	<P>Under the Planning Acts 2000-2006, all development, unless specifically exempted under the Acts or associated Regulations, requires planning permission. Any development that is carried out without planning permission, or that does not comply with the terms of a planning permission, is unauthorised development, and may be subject to enforcement action by a planning authority. </P>
        <P>Part VIII of the Planning and Development Act 2000 sets out the existing statutory provisions for enforcement action by planning authorities in cases of breaches of the planning code.  The 2000 Act also made a number of significant improvements to the enforcement provisions for persons who make complaints, in particular that all well-founded complaints must be investigated by the planning authority and that complainants must be told of the progress of their complaint. The 2000 Act also contains special provisions relating to certain issues that were difficult to address through the normal enforcement process, including applications by persons that have repeatedly breached previous planning permissions, unfinished housing estates and quarries. These provisions were further strengthened under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006. The Act contained an important amendment to section 35 of the Planning and Development 2000 Act, reversing the burden of proof where planning authorities decide to refuse to grant planning permission. Where previously the planning authority could only invoke this power with the consent of the High Court, they may now refuse permission on the basis of past non-compliance, leaving it up to the prospective developer to apply to the High Court to have such a decision overturned.</P>
        <P>On the specific issue of unfinished estates, as indicated in reply to Question No on today&rsquo;s Order Paper, my Department has now issued updated policy guidance to planning authorities on the taking in charge of estates in the form of circular letter PD 1/08.</P>
        <P>The above provisions set out a strong legal framework for planning authorities to take enforcement action where necessary. While I have no specific proposals for review, I will continue to keep the operation of Part VIII under scrutiny to ensure its effective operation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 500 and 501 together.</P>
        <P>The Environmental Liability Directive (2004/35/EC) is a major initiative aimed at preventing and remedying environmental damage by giving effect to the polluter pays principle.  It aims to do this by holding operators whose activities have caused environmental damage financially liable for remedying this damage.  It does not, however, provide for the imposition of fines or other criminal sanctions for causing environmental damage.</P>
        <P>There is provision in existing environmental protection codes, such as the Environmental Protection Agency Acts 1992 and 2003 and the Waste Management Acts 1996 to 2003, for significant fines and other sanctions in instances of serious breaches of the code.  Such fines <Col N="511"/>may be up to &euro;15 million and may attract a daily fine of &euro;130,000 where the breach continues following conviction.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to a review of the role, procedures and governing legislation of the Environmental Protection Agency, and includes environmental fines as part of this review.  I am considering the form that this review will take.</P>

	<P>The Carrickmacross Sewerage Scheme is approved for funding under the Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009, at an estimated cost of &euro;22 million.  Work on the network element of the scheme is expected to commence shortly.  Monaghan County Council also propose to extend and refurbish the existing Wastewater Treatment Plant in the town.  The Council&rsquo;s Tender Documents for the work are under examination in my Department.  </P>
        <P>In accordance with the EU Water Framework Directive, water services authorities are required to recover the cost of providing water services from the users of these services, on the basis of average operational and marginal capital costs, with the exception of households using water services for domestic purposes, and the special transitional arrangements for recognised schools which were recently approved by the Government. The recovery of the cost of providing water services to the non-domestic sector is achieved by means of meter based volumetric charges; metering of the non-domestic sector for this purpose is expected to be completed by mid-2008.</P>
        <P>In the case of each project funded under my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme the marginal capital cost of servicing non-domestic consumers is required to be met by the non-domestic sector. Marginal capital cost is calculated on the basis of existing and future non-domestic capacity requirements which vary from scheme to scheme.   Non-domestic marginal capital costs are recovered by a water services authority from all non-domestic consumers in its functional area (i.e. on a county-wide basis) through a combination of water charges on non-domestic customers and development contributions or by a specific contribution where an industry wishes to reserve a specific capacity.</P>
        <P>My Department and Monaghan County Council are in communication in relation to the non-domestic contribution towards the Carrickmacross scheme and a decision in relation to the overall funding arrangements for the scheme will be made as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I understand that qualifications for &ldquo;Architectural Technologist&rdquo; and &ldquo;Architectural Technician&rdquo; are underpinned by the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999, which comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
        <P>The 1997 Report of the Strategic Review Committee on the Construction Industry &mdash; Building Our Future Together &mdash; recommended that the title of &ldquo;Architect&rdquo; should be registered by law. Subsequently, the Forum for the Construction Industry submitted proposals to my Department for the registration of Architects, following consultation and agreement with the architectural representative bodies.</P>
        <P>The Building Control Act 2007, enacted in April 2007, provides, inter alia, for the registration of the title of &ldquo;Architect&rdquo; broadly along the lines recommended by the Strategic Review Committee and the Forum for the Construction Industry.</P>

        <P>I have received a number of representations in respect of persons who are   providing architectural services, by way of established rights, in regard to their status following the introduction of statutory registration under the Building Control Act 2007.  Part 3 of the Act provides, inter alia, for the establishment of a Technical Assessment Board to assess applications from persons <Col N="513"/>who are not eligible for registration on the basis of specified academic qualifications, but who have been practising architecture for a minimum period of 10 years in the State.  The procedure for the Technical Assessment Board is also set out in Part 3 of the Act.</P>

        <P>In addition, in order to ensure that the maximum number of people are notified of the proposed designation of an area as a candidate Special Area of Conservation, the Department advertises the intended designation in the local newspapers and on local radio. In accordance with Article 4 (2) of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997, maps are made available at a number of prescribed locations, including the local planning office, county libraries and local Garda Stations, and the newspaper advertisements draw attention to this availability.  At the time of publication of a designation as many landowners as can be identified as being directly involved in the site are also directly notified by post.</P>

	<P>Once the Third Postal Directive has been published in the Official Journal of the European Union in the coming weeks, I intend to hold a public consultation process examining the key issues arising from the Directive.  The results of the consultation process will assist my thinking with respect to the transposition of the directive into Irish law, including any possible consolidation of existing postal legislation.</P><Col N="516"/>
        <P>With respect to the development of competition, Ireland&rsquo;s dispersed population pattern means that even in the event of market opening, competition will not necessarily develop immediately. It is unlikely that a competitor would establish an end-to-end solution to compete directly with An Post on a nationwide basis, a view which is supported by a number of international studies.</P>
        <P>However, this issue, along with the other key issues including that of ensuring a universal access to a broad suite of high-quality postal services, will be examined in full in the context of the transposition of the postal directive.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 514 and 516 together.</P>
        <P>The provision of broadband services is, in the first instance, a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</P>
        <P>The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers.</P>
        <P>There are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  Accordingly, the procurement process for a National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is underway.  The NBS will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved, including any unserved areas in Co. Galway, and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband are met.</P>
        <P>The first phase of the procurement process (Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ)) is now complete, and four candidates pre-qualified to enter the next phase of the procurement process.  The four candidates were, in alphabetical order, BT Communications Ireland Ltd Consortium, eircom Ltd, Hutchinson 3G Ireland Ltd and IFA/Motorola Consortium.</P>
        <P>Following the withdrawal of the IFA/Motorola Consortium as a candidate the remaining three candidates have now commenced &ldquo;Competitive Dialogue&rdquo; with my Department and are developing their proposed solutions to meet my Department&rsquo;s requirements for the delivery of broadband to the unserved areas of the country.  It is anticipated that a preferred bidder will be selected and appointed in June 2008, with rollout to commence as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

	<P>The proposed restructuring of the inland fisheries sector contained in the Government decision made on foot of the Farrell Grant Sparks Review of the Inland Fisheries Sector in Ireland, which itself is more than two years old, met with a lot of stakeholder resistance.  In these circumstances and responding to a call of the Fisheries Boards&rsquo; Chairpersons for a somewhat different approach to restructuring of the boards, I requested that they develop an agreed proposal for my consideration by April of this year.  </P>
