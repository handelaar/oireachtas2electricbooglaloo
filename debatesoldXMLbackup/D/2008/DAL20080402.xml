        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> his views on the recent research paper by the National Economic and Social Council, Ireland&rsquo;s Child Income Supports: The Case for a New Form of Targeting, which was recently published, stating that child benefit is hugely inefficient; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[12122/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Financial supports are transferred directly to parents through child income supports, the provision of which is based on the premise that it is appropriate that the State shares with parents the costs of rearing and maintaining children.  The broad objectives are to bring about an improvement in the relative overall position of families with children compared with single persons or childless couples and to alleviate child poverty.  The principal child-centred income support is child benefit, payable in respect of children up to the age of 16 years and to age 19 in the case of children who are in full-time education or suffering from a long-term disability.  Payment is not affected by parental means or employment status.  </P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s other main child income supports are the increase for a qualified child, IQC, which is paid in addition to social welfare payments to age 18 and extended, in most schemes, to age 22 where the child is in full-time education and family income supplement, which is paid to low-income employees working a specified minimum number of hours per fortnight and who have at least one qualified child.  In addition, the early child care supplement, paid by my Department on behalf of the Office of the Minister for Children in respect of all children under six years of age who receive child benefit, makes a significant contribution to recipient families.</P><Col N="384"/>
        <P>For a number of years, Government policy has been to invest additional resources in child benefit.  This policy focus was driven, in part, by the recognition that the loss of IQC payments by social welfare recipients on taking up employment could act as a disincentive to availing of work opportunities.  In terms of tackling work disincentives, the shift towards child benefit has been significant.  For example, in 1994 child benefit represented 29% of the total child income support payment for a four-child family and is now 64%.  In other words, a family will now only lose 36% of its child income support when a welfare recipient loses entitlement to a primary social welfare payment.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of an earlier social partnership agreement, the National Economic and Social Council was asked to examine the feasibility of merging the family income supplement with IQC, with a view to creating a single second-tier child income support.  This commitment to examine such a change was subsequently embodied in the current social partnership agreement Towards 2016.  Dr. John Sweeney was commissioned by NESC to examine the issues and develop proposals for a second-tier child income support scheme.  His research paper on this issue was received towards the end of 2007.</P>
        <P>In considering the future direction of child income support policy, it is important to keep in mind the multiple objectives behind the provision of such support and to maintain the correct balance between child benefit and more selective measures.</P>
        <P>Dr. Sweeney&rsquo;s research paper, which is an important contribution to the debate, is being examined at present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>A great deal of history is being made today and many comments are being made on the success or otherwise of the Governments led by the Taoiseach.  However, not many plaudits will be given in the area of child poverty.  A number of the Government parties failed originally to meet their commitment to eliminate child poverty by 2007.  The Minister addressed my question at the end of his reply and stated the report is currently being studied.  When is a decision on this issue likely to be made?  What is his view on the notion of introducing a second tier child support?  Is he seriously considering this?  Has he examined the commentary by many of the social partners, including well respected groups such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul?  Unfortunately, the society is making a presentation to the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs as we are taking Question Time, which is another example of how badly reform is needed in the operation of the House.  However, groups such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Barnardos believe a second tier payment is necessary.  Will there be a decision on this in the near future?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I fundamentally disagree with the Deputy&rsquo;s opening remarks.  No Governments in the history of the State have done more for children than those led by the Taoiseach over the past ten years.  The figures prove that.  Many of the bodies representing children also subscribe to that view.  For example, child benefit payments in 2000 were &euro;43.81 for each of the first two children and &euro;58.41 for the third and subsequent children while the equivalent payments today are &euro;166 and &euro;203, which represent increases of 280% and 248% respectively.  That is one area of targeted income we put forward in a multiplicity of an effort to make sure children remain in good stead and the Government is seen to support parents and children, particularly those who are less well off in society.</P>
        <P>While Dr. Sweeney published a report on a second tier child payment, there is fundamental disagreement within the NESC on this approach.  There are many different views.  For instance, the family income supplement is targeted at children and people working in low paid jobs to encourage people back to work while, at the same time, giving them a direct payment to <Col N="385"/>support their children.  It is a better and more direct way of assisting families and directly assisting children.  While I have an open mind on the issue, the reality is representative groups fundamentally disagree on this approach.  It is my intention to continue to use resources in a very targeted way to assist children in need.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The failing is that the Minister is examining what he is giving people rather than what they can do with it.  A total of 20% of children in Ireland are at risk of poverty and one in nine is in consistent poverty.  The Minister has not given a specific reply on whether this payment will be introduced.  However, proposals have also been made to tax child benefit recipients to pay for the second tier support if it is introduced.  Can the Minister rule that out?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy stated 20% of children are at risk of poverty.  The measurement in that instance contributes nothing to the debate and I do not accept that 20% of children are at risk of or are in poverty and nobody else does either.   When the specific measures and targets in place are examined, there are very different outcomes.  Under the measurement used previously when we dealt with child poverty, we would have achieved the target we set out but the target was changed and we used a different measurement.  Even under this, the percentage of children at risk is well down in single figures.  The Government and myself will continue to drive down the figures and to end the situation of children of any hue, age or social background being in consistent poverty over the next number of years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>How does the Minister intend to do that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The figures over the past few years indicate we are well on target to achieve it.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> his views on the reform needed to the rent supplement scheme following a recent television programme (details supplied) in sub-standard accommodation occupied by recipients of rent supplement; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[12462/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Responsibility for setting and enforcing housing standards rests with local authorities.  Under legislation introduced in October 2006 the HSE, which administers the supplementary welfare allowance scheme on the Department&rsquo;s behalf, may refuse rent supplement where it has been notified by a housing authority that the accommodation concerned does not comply with standards.</P>
        <P>Where a notification is received from a housing authority in respect of an existing tenant the community welfare officer would discuss the situation with the tenant and take whatever action it decides is necessary in the best interests of the tenant.  These arrangements are aimed at improving the standards of accommodation which rent supplement tenants occupy and supporting the local authority in meeting their responsibilities with regard to housing standards.</P>
        <P>The most recent information available from the HSE is that any notifications of substandard accommodation received from local authorities have resulted in rent supplement being terminated or the refusal of rent supplement where it was not already in payment.  Where the HSE becomes aware of accommodation or blocks of accommodation which appear to it to be substandard, it notifies the local authority and it may advise prospective tenants at such premises that rent supplement will not be paid in respect of those tenancies.</P>
        <P>In addition, details of rent supplemented tenancies that are of more than 18 months&rsquo; duration are notified to local authorities every quarter.  This information is primarily for the purpose of identifying rent supplement tenants for transfer to the rental accommodation scheme, RAS. <Col N="386"/> As part of this process local authorities inspect the accommodation concerned before accepting them on to the RAS and this information sharing assists in enforcing housing standards.</P>
        <P>Given the extent of information sharing and the arrangements in place to refuse rent supplement where accommodation does not comply with standards, I have no plans to make further changes in the rent supplement scheme at this time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The information from the Minister that he has no plans to do anything about this is disappointing.  Did the Minister see the recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme which depicted the appalling condition of much of the private rented sector housing stock?  If the Minister did not see it on the night, did he make any arrangements to view it afterwards?  It was hair-raising.  It showed large numbers of private rented sector units being let out at extremely high rents, particularly in Dublin city, which were rat infested and had serious problems with dampness and overcrowding.  They also had poor quality cooking and bathroom conditions.  Their conditions were appalling and one would not put a dog into them.</P>
        <P>Most people renting this type of accommodation, which is at the lowest end of the market, are in receipt of rent supplement.  The Minister cannot wash his hands of responsibility in this area.  He is responsible for paying out &euro;420 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money annually to landlords, many of whom operate these types of housing units and are unscrupulous people who obviously do not care about standards.  What is the Minister doing to ensure people in receipt of rent supplement are able to access decent quality accommodation?  What action is he taking against unscrupulous landlords who are creaming it at the expense of the most vulnerable people in our society?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy well knows, responsibility for setting and enforcing housing standards rests with local authorities.  I hope her commitment in this House is the same as that of her colleagues in local authorities throughout the country where the responsibility lies for housing standards.  Housing standards are not the responsibility of my Department.  What my Department is responsible for are people who find themselves in difficult circumstances and supporting them directly with substantial financial resources to allow them to source accommodation for themselves.</P>
        <P>As a matter of interest, with regard to the figures, up to October 2007 the HSE received only 18 notifications of substandard accommodation and has acted on all of them.  Of these notifications, 12 were in respect of existing tenancies and all rent supplement claims were terminated.  Six were in respect of tenancies which did not involve rent supplement.  I am happy to inform the House that we acted fully on all notifications and payments were terminated.</P>
        <P>I accept the points made by the Deputy on some of the accommodation made available.  I urge the local authorities with direct responsibility, resources and staff to deal with this issue to do so forthwith.  I hope all councillors on local authorities will raise these issues at full council meetings with the manager or director responsible for housing to ensure the quality and standard of accommodation available to people, particularly those in receipt of rent supplement, is good.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister accept there is a communication problem between his Department and local authorities in this regard?  </P>
        <P>The Minister stated in his initial reply that where poor standards are brought to the attention of a community welfare officer, the matter may be discussed with the tenant and whatever action necessary will be taken.  The Minister is aware there is a dearth of accommodation available for people on rent supplement and that very often they are forced to put up with what they have or be homeless.  It is not good enough for the Minister to preside over a <Col N="387"/>situation whereby large amounts of public money are being spent on accommodation while he opts out of the issue in respect of the standard of that accommodation.</P>
        <P>On how many occasions have community welfare officers brought to the attention of local authorities accommodation which was of a poor standard?  Will the Minister consider issuing guidelines to community welfare officers in respect of the standards of accommodation and what action they can take when appalling standards are brought to their attention?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Deputy heard the point I made earlier that all rent supplement tenancies of more than 18 months duration are notified quarterly to the local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I am speaking about poor quality accommodation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have also stated that the 18 notifications to which the Deputy referred were received and acted upon and that in all cases, rent supplement was terminated.  I agree we must ensure none of our clients has to reside in sub-standard accommodation.  The Deputy is confused.  My role, through the Department, is to support and assist individuals throughout the country in finding suitable accommodation.  This is done on a daily and weekly basis.  The relationship between my Department and the client is specifically to support him or her in finding accommodation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Shortall is trying to disavow the Labour Party of its responsibility at local government level.  They are quick to come into this House to blame me or any other member of the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should conclude his reply as we have run out of time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy well knows, housing standards and the enforcement of housing standards is specifically, in law, a matter for the local authorities.  I do not have the resources at central Government level.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister continues to pay irrespective of standards.</P>

        <Quest> the progress made to date on the development of a national carers strategy which was supposed to be published by the end of 2007; when this will be completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst><Col N="388"/>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The development of a national carers strategy is a key Government commitment in the national partnership agreement, Towards 2016, and the programme for Government.</P>
        <P>The focus of the strategy is on supporting informal and family carers in the community.  While social welfare supports for carers are a key issue in the strategy, other issues such as access to respite and other services, education, training and employment are also important.  Co-operation between relevant Departments and agencies is essential if the provision of services, supports and entitlements for carers is to be fully addressed.  For this reason, an inter-departmental working group has been established to develop the strategy.</P>
        <P>My Department provides the secretariat to the working group which is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach.  The group also includes representatives from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, F&Aacute;S and the Health Service Executive.  Developing the strategy involves consultation with other Departments and Government bodies not represented on the working group.  Yesterday, my Department hosted a consultation meeting with several organisations including the Equality Authority, Combat Poverty Agency, Citizens Information Board, Pobal, the Family Support Agency, NESC, the National Council on Ageing and Older People, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Further meetings will be held with other organisations in the near future.</P>
        <P>A request for submissions from the public was published in regional newspapers during the week beginning 3 March 2008 and in the national daily papers on Friday, 7 March; it is also on the front page of my Department&rsquo;s website.  Representative groups and the social partners have been advised of this process.  The closing date for submissions is Friday, 18 April 2008 and, to date, 35 submissions have been received.</P>
      
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>A meeting was held on 23 January 2008, in line with my Department&rsquo;s commitment in Towards 2016 to hosting an annual consultation meeting of carer representative groups and relevant Departments and agencies.  Representatives of 12 groups and nine Departments and other government agencies attended.  The theme was the national carers strategy and groups were given an opportunity to comment on the draft terms of reference and to raise other issues considered relevant in the context of the strategy.</P>
        <P>Key issues raised at the meeting were recognition for carers and their work, accessing suitable health services, income support, pensions and access to training and employment.  Another meeting with carer groups will be held when the results of the consultation process are available.  The commitment to the development of a national carers strategy includes a commitment to appropriate consultation with the social partners.  An update on the strategy was provided to the social partners plenary session in February.  It is intended that the first consultation meeting with the social partners will be held in April.</P>
</Speaker>
<?oasys _cl14- ?>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is probably aware of and does not need me to point out that every week 161,000 carers are doing 3.5 million hours of work and saving the State more than &euro;2 billion per annum.  As the Minister stated in his response, I appreciate that widespread consultation is taking place within Departments and State agencies.  However, my concern relates to consultation with the groups representing the carers themselves and this is a key part of the process.  As a result of discussions with various people and as confirmed in the Minister&rsquo;s response, I am aware there is no representative from the carers group on the interdepartmental panel which is steering the strategy.  Will the Minister say what level of consultation will be conducted with the relevant stakeholders?  I appreciate the involvement of <Col N="389"/>the State agencies but I am referring to groups such as the Carers Association, which is the representative body of the people dealing with this area first-hand.</P>
        <P>The Minister will recall that this time last year public meetings were held around the country in every constituency prior to the election.  Both the Minister and I saw for ourselves how representative the association is of its membership, considering the number of people who turned out to speak at those meetings.  It is important that the process allows them to be much more involved.  There is genuine concern that there has not been sufficient and appropriate consultation up to now and that a document will be presented as a <i>fait accompli </i>without consultation prior to the document.  I ask the Minister to address this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy said, there has been a very substantial public engagement on this issue and all the groups informed us that there was no need to repeat that process.  There is direct engagement with all of the stakeholders on the development of this process and particularly with those representing the carers, such as the National Carers Association.  Those representatives have also made substantial submissions which will be considered and discussed with them as we come to a conclusion.  I presume the Deputy notes from my reply that substantial engagement is now taking place on this issue and it is one of my priorities to reach agreement on the national carers strategy and to have it published and made public.  This is a priority not just for the Government, but also figures as a priority for the social partners in Towards 2016.  It is an area to which the Government has given significant commitment over the past number of years, particularly in terms of direct resources to those who are caring for people in whatever circumstances they find themselves.  We have made direct financial State assistance much more flexible and accessible for people.  We have also become much more flexible in terms of allowing people to do some work as well as being deemed full-time carers.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Deputy on the importance of completing this process and it is my intention that it will be completed this year.  I have indicated that the closing date for submissions is April this year and at that stage I hope we can finalise the report and complete any further discussions with any of the representative groups that need to be completed.  I assure the Deputy that I want to it to be an inclusive process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will allow a brief supplementary question from Deputy Enright.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not really what I want a commitment on.  The National Carers Association will make a submission but it wants a guarantee there will be feedback on that submission and that it is not just taken on board and the document published.  If the Minister&rsquo;s Department has difficulties with anything in the submission the association hopes there will be discussion about it rather than an item being either ruled in or out and the document published.  The association wants real and active engagement and consultation.  I ask the Minister to give a commitment that this is what will happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously it is my intention and that of my officials to have as inclusive a process as possible.  When one comes to the end of a process, it is clear one is not able to accommodate every single wish of every submission and decisions will need to be made, but they will be made on the basis of what people have said, how the system is working and what is needed for the future development of a national carers strategy.  </P>
        <P>I was asked about young carers.  My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibilty for children, will specifically examine a strategy in the context of young carers, surrounding whom I accept there are also specific issues.  We also look forward to its completion.</P>

	<P>There is a constant balance to be maintained in ensuring that social welfare programmes are developed in ways that are sufficiently responsive to various contingencies, while simultaneously providing opportunities to assist people to become less welfare dependent.  In this context, a number of measures have been introduced in recent years to remove disincentives to taking up employment and to assist in the transition from welfare to work.</P>
        <P>These include the easing of means tests through income disregards, a more gradual withdrawal of benefits as earnings increase and the introduction of employment support schemes such as the back to work programme.  In addition, enhanced disregards of earnings were introduced in 2007 for the rent allowance scheme which complement the rental accommodation scheme that was introduced in 2004.</P>
        <P>As recently as last September, I introduced reforms which improved the methods by which a person&rsquo;s earnings from employment, or the earnings of a partner, are assessed to facilitate persons in increasing their levels of employment and income.  These changes are designed in particular to be progressive for women, who currently make up the majority of qualified adults in the social welfare system, rewarding increased labour market participation and encouraging qualified adults to move beyond long-term part-time employment.  They also benefit many other part-time workers, but particularly those with children.  In addition to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, the new arrangements also apply to the disability allowance, farm assist and pre-retirement allowance schemes.</P>
        <P>A number of further measures are also in place to encourage increased participation in employment.  For instance, the part-time job incentive scheme is available to those who were previously on a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment for 15 months or more and who are now working under 24 hours per week while seeking full-time employment.  This payment is not means-tested.  Farm assist is a weekly means-tested payment for low income farmers, including those who may have off-farm employment or self-employment.  Recipients of various social welfare schemes may also qualify for a transitional payment under the back to work programme, which provides for a phased level of income support over a number of years when taking up employment or self-employment.  This payment is not means-tested, with more relaxed qualification criteria for people aged 50 or older.</P>
      
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>.</P>
        <P>Family income supplement provides support for people in low-income employment with children, even where they have not previously been in receipt of a social welfare payment, preserving the incentive to remain in employment.</P>
        <P>It is important to ensure that work pays and a number of policy instruments crossing a range of Departments are used as a way of alleviating poverty among people in low wage employment.  In addition to those already mentioned, these include changes to the taxation system, the introduction of the national minimum wage, provision of training and access to lifelong learning opportunities and assistance with job search.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has frequently said that a job is the best way out of poverty for people and in most cases that is true.  However, does he accept there is a cohort of people in employment who find it extremely difficult to survive?  I am not only referring to the <Col N="391"/>early stages when transitional arrangements are required.  In many ways the welfare system operates on an all or nothing basis.  Given that many people are on a low level of income, especially those employed on the minimum wage who have children, that cohort find it difficult to survive.  I am referring in particular to families who need to pay rent in the private sector, which might be quite high, and people who have child care costs.  Those who are in employment and living in consistent poverty number some 30,000.  This is not a temporary phenomenon.  The money they earn every week from their employment is not sufficient to pay their overheads.  Does the Minister accept the existence of this cohort of people?  The CSO put that figure at 1.6% of the working population, which accounts for approximately 30,000 people.  They live in consistent poverty.  What steps is the Minister taking to lift those people out of poverty and to provide supports for them on an ongoing basis to enable them to keep their heads above water?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The group the Deputy identified of people at work but living in consistent poverty had fallen to 1.6% of the working population in 2006&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>To 1.7%.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;from 1.7% previously.  They are real people and their circumstances concern me and the Government.  As I stated in my reply, there are a multiplicity of issues we try to achieve to lift those people out of poverty.  There are a number of obvious areas, one being the family income support scheme, which supports those families, members of which are at work but who are still at risk of poverty, directly based on the number of children.  Those supports have increased.  The number in receipt of family income supplement, FIS, has almost doubled from 12,000 to 23,000 and I expect that figure to reach 30,000 this year.  We are on course to reach the full cohort of people who require these types of supports.  Likewise, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance is of significant benefit to low-income families in need of support.</P>
        <P>It is important that we entirely eliminate consistent poverty, which stands at 1.6%.  The best way to do this is to enhance employment and educational opportunities in terms of the career paths available to people.  In addition, we must make it much easier for people to move from the social welfare system into employment.  In particular, we must be careful not to penalise those at the lower end of the income scale by removing all their social welfare benefits.  The welfare system has become far more flexible and amenable in this regard.  We will continue to target resources in this area so as to improve the situation for the 1.6% of the population living in consistent poverty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept there is a serious difficulty with the tax system in that people on the minimum wage, being out of the tax net, do not benefit from the tax improvements generally arising for most people out of the annual budget?  The way to tackle this is to introduce a system of refundable tax credits.  What is the position of the Minister and his Department in regard to the working group on refundable tax credits?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the dilemma that arises.  We have probably been the most successful country in Europe in removing workers on low incomes from the tax net.  One of the consequences of this is that benefits arising to workers based on the tax system will not benefit those who are not liable to pay tax.  In compensation for that, however, we have greatly improved the benefits available to such persons in recent years.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="392"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>However, those benefits are of limited value where the persons concerned are in employment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to continue to ensure that workers do not enter the taxation system until they achieve a good level of income.  This is a laudable and important target and one towards which we have made significant strides in recent years.  I understand approximately 750,000 members of the workforce are outside the tax net.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. These workers derive no benefit from taxation changes in the budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>They receive direct benefit in that they are not paying tax in the first place.  This is the correct approach.  We must allow such workers to retain as much as possible of their income while simultaneously seeking to improve other benefits.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister have a view on refundable tax credits?</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79, 83 and 123 together.</P>
        <P>The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of the Department.  I am committed to ensuring that social welfare payments are available to those who are entitled to them.  I am also determined to ensure that abuse of the system is prevented and is dealt with effectively when detected.</P>
        <P>All child benefit claims require a minimum level of information and documentation to be provided and verified before being awarded.  The amount of information and documentation required varies depending on the customer circumstances, for instance, the child&rsquo;s place of birth.  Given the significant changes in the child benefit customer base and in the value of child benefit payments, the control policy for the child benefit scheme and, consequently, the early child care supplement, ECS, scheme, has been reviewed to ensure that controls against fraud and abuse of the schemes continue to be effective and relevant.</P>
        <P>As a result of this review, enhanced and updated control measures have been devised, which enable the automated issue of forms, that is, certificates, to subsets of selected groups of customers for completion and return to the Department to confirm that they continue to satisfy the conditions for receipt of child benefit and ECS.  In the case of non-Irish national recipients who are resident in Ireland with their children, certification that the children continue to reside here is required.  Proof of such residence can take the form of details of the school or college the child attends or, if the child is not of school-going age, details of the doctor or cr&egrave;che he or she attends.  Such information is used to verify that children are resident in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In the case of EU nationals who are working in Ireland but have qualified children living in another EU state, certification by their employer of continuing employment is requested.  If the required certification is not provided within the timescale requested &mdash; 21 days &mdash; child benefit or early child care supplement payments are suspended pending further inquiry.  If certification is subsequently provided, payments which were suspended will be made in full.  A percentage of all replies is checked to ensure the accuracy of the information provided, with cases referred to social welfare inspectors for follow-up action as necessary.  These new certification reviews commenced in November 2007 and approximately 23,000 review forms have issued since then.  This number will increase in the coming months.  It is expected that more than 100,000 customers will be reviewed this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I tabled this question on foot of the comments the Minister made about the issue of fraud during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill.  The figures given on that occasion were stark.  It was mentioned that a survey found that 1.7% of the 500 Irish nationals who were surveyed were involved in social welfare fraud, compared to a figure of 13.9% in the case of non-Irish nationals.  It is clear that a significant number of people engage in fraud of this nature.  The Minister mentioned that when it is balanced out, there is an overall level of fraud of 2.3%, which probably does not seem so bad.  Was each of the payments being made to the 13.9% of non-Irish nationals and the 1.7% of Irish nationals immediately suspended?  Were the payments which had been made under fraudulent circumstances reimbursed to the Department of Social and Family Affairs?  Was legal action taken to ensure that the moneys which should not have been paid in the first instance were given back to the Department?  The Minister briefly outlined the steps which are being taken to prevent social welfare fraud and ensure it does not happen so frequently.  Are strengthening mechanisms proposed to ensure that fraud does not take place?  The Minister mentioned that letters are being sought from schools etc.  Is that happening on a regular basis?  Is such an approach adopted only when a <Col N="394"/>cohort of 1,000 cases has been examined?  Is each child benefit application the subject of such control procedures?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Child benefit control procedures have been effective to date.  Payments are not made on foot of claims until all the necessary documentation has been obtained and verified.  Sometimes this causes problems for the individuals concerned.  We have to ensure we protect the taxpayer.  The proper information has to be provided.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs has a good working relationship with its counterparts in other countries.  If claims are made in respect of children who are living abroad, we need proof, in the form of birth certificates, for example, of the existence of such children, their ages, their locations and their living arrangements etc.  I have already highlighted how we deal with non-Irish nationals who are living here with their children.  We look for confirmation of school attendance from their schools if they are of school-going age.  If they are not yet old enough to go to school, we are happy to receive letters from the local cr&egrave;che or doctor with whom they are associated.  It is an effective scheme.</P>
        <P>It is clear that we have to remain vigilant &mdash; there is no question about that.  A number of units within the Department of Social and Family Affairs are making efforts to instigate control mechanisms to ensure that fraud is kept to an absolute minimum.  There will always be a certain percentage of the public who try to defraud any system.  We have to ensure that we do not allow such people to get past our system.  If they do, we have to seek them out and catch them quickly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is all very well to say we have to remain vigilant.  I am not sure that the Department of Social and Family Affairs is being vigilant.  The recent report produced by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General showed that there is a fraud rate of 14%, in relation to child benefit, in respect of non-resident children.  Some &euro;137 million is spent each year on child benefit and early child care supplement payments in respect of non-resident children.  The fraud rate of 14% in such cases is significant.  What action has the Department of Social and Family Affairs taken since the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report was made available?  How many checks of the kind mentioned by the Minister have been carried out since that report was published?  As regards sanctions where payments are suspended, how many have been suspended? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Some 2,769 claims have been suspended to date because of late or non-reply of residency funds &mdash; as no reply has been received within the required timeframe.  There can be legitimate reasons for this.  The circumstances of individuals can change so that they are no longer within the system.  As I have indicated, with the additional staff we have put into the control unit at Letterkenny, this year we expect to do approximately 100,000 individual reviews.  That will certainly ensure there are no&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>How many reviews have been done?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe I gave the figure of 23,000 earlier.  The overall scale and the numbers of families and children involved are significant.  The number of children of Irish nationality is 967,767 and there are more then half a million claims.  From the EU 27 the claims come to 48,000 and non-EU applications comprise 28,000.  That is over half a million claims involving 1,113,209 children.  Taking the scale of what Ireland and the Department is doing in trying to ensure that we treat all children fairly and equally and support families in need in this regard, that is a fair return.  I accept, however, that we must maintain a high level of activity in this area, and indeed increase it.  That is why I have indicated in my replies to Deputies Shortall <Col N="395"/>and Enright that there will be specific focus and emphasis on this area this year, with more than 100,000 individual cases being reviewed. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>What steps will the Minister take to ensure the system is strengthened?  I have asked him this already and he more or less outlined what is being done at present.  However, my reason for asking is that my original question in March looked for the figures in 2007.  The statistics I am using, according to the reply I received &mdash; for 13.9% of non-Irish nationals and 1.7% of Irish nationals &mdash; relate only to last year.  That means that a significant number of people under the system currently in place were still able to make fraudulent claims through the Department.  Therefore this is still a live issue and its scale remains significant.  The response the Minister has given appears to indicate that matters are all right when clearly they are not, if that number of people are able to make fraudulent claims. </P>
        <P>I am seeking a more specific response from the Minister in terms of what his Department is doing to ensure that this level of fraudulence cannot continue.  Obviously the measures taken to date have been insufficient to tackle the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>One must keep in context the scale of the inaccurate information found.  The figure is very low, given the size of the Department&rsquo;s operation and the numbers of families and children involved.  I may have given Deputy Shortall a wrong figure a moment ago.  Since November last some 23,000 certificates were issued.  That is the figure I&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not what I asked. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I know it was not and I am sorry.  I have a note in front of me, and I just wanted to correct that on the record and confirm that 23,000 certificates have been issued.  A detailed check was recently carried out, again, on about 10% of all the different claimants involved.  In approximately 3% of cases the information proved either to be incorrect or could not be validated.  These claims were, of course, suspended and referred to the social welfare inspectorate for investigation.  What I have indicated to Deputy Enright are all the recent cases, particularly as regards the certification process.  We must continue to enhance those new ways of doing business, ensuring we can detect where fraudulent claims are being made.  As I have said, the significance of the information the Department is now obtaining from abroad is quite substantial.  The message going out to the various communities, and indeed, our own, is that it is becoming virtually impossible to get away with sustained fraud within the social welfare system, particularly as it relates to child benefit. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like the Minister to respond to Question No. 83, which refers to the payment of child benefit for non-resident children.  There are approximately 3,000 non-resident children in receipt of the benefit.  What steps has the Minister taken in respect of the fraud uncovered to date and how many payments have been suspended since the Comptroller and Auditor General reported on the matter?  How many checks is the Department carrying out annually?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I gave that figure to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The Minister did not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There are 2,900.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The figure of 2,769 is the overall figure for child benefit and does not pertain superficially to non-resident children.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>If I do not have the specific figure on non-nationals in front of me, I will obtain it for the Deputy.</P>
        <P>Under EU regulations, overpayments of family benefits in one state, such as Ireland, are recoverable in another state.  The child benefit section pursues recovery in such cases.</P>

	<P>I went to the trouble of tabling a question and the Minister should be respectful enough to reply today.  I asked about child benefit fraud in respect of non-resident children and it seems the Minister has no figures at all, which is very disappointing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I gave a figure on that matter and on certification.  If there are other issues on which I need to provide information, I will be happy to do so.  I can only give the Deputy the information I have in front of me.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department administers some 50 schemes and makes payments to 1 million people each week.  The nature and volume of its business mean that it is heavily dependent on information communications technology, ICT, facilities to carry out the bulk of its business and it has responsibility for a significant amount of data.</P>
        <P>Given the nature, scale and diversity of its work, the Department holds extensive and detailed personal information about its customers.  It is fully aware of its obligation to safeguard the security of this data and it employs a wide range of measures to protect the confidentiality, availability and integrity of information.  Where staff are found to have breached these measures, disciplinary action up to and including dismissal is taken.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner undertook an audit of the Department in late January 2008.  The commissioner has not yet finalised the report of his findings.  When the final report is received, its findings and recommendations will be carefully examined by the Department with a view to taking whatever additional actions are necessary.</P>
        <P>Over recent years, the Department has continuously strengthened security and data protection protocols.  Staff are regularly reminded of their obligations under data protection and security policies and of the penalties applicable to any breach of these obligations.  Policies and procedures covering the use of systems and data have been developed and communicated to the staff.  These policies and procedures are under continual review and are updated as appropriate.  The most recent policy update took place in June 2007, with the publication of a corporate information security policy.  In addition to the policy measures, the Department is also ensuring that higher levels of data protection are built into its latest generation of ICT systems <Col N="397"/>to reflect the increased threats in this area.  Considerable resources have also been devoted to increasing the security and monitoring facilities in its older systems.</P>
        <P>A high level group has been established within the Department to review access management and control.  The primary focus of the group is to direct the development of the Department&rsquo;s policy on access to data, ensure that existing measures are co-ordinated across systems and to initiate further work programmes to address emerging issues.</P>
        <P>To preserve public confidence in the operations of the Department, there has been, and will continue to be, considerable focus on the issue of data confidentiality.  I assure the Deputy that the Department recognises that security measures must continually evolve and it will continue to reflect this in its systems and procedures.</P>

	<P>Since the difficulties took place that led to the Data Protection Commissioner preparing this report, has the Minister done anything to strengthen the procedures in the Department?

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As a result of my and the House&rsquo;s interest in this issue over time, I raised it at management board meetings within the Department to ensure that the most up-to-date security systems, in terms of the new ICT systems that are being put into the Department, give the highest possible level of protection to the information supplied by customers.  There are spot checks in the Department and senior staff have responsibilities in this area also.  At all times we seek to enhance the process.</P>
        <P>In addition, new enhanced security systems are being included in some of the existing older systems that are maintained.  Given the scale and number of operations &mdash; over 50 schemes <Col N="398"/>and over 1 million customers getting payments every week &mdash; by and large the Department and its officials are doing a very good job.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81, 110, 141, 147 and 149 together.</P>
        <P>There are currently 246,000 customers in receipt of a contributory State pension.  Of these, some 37,000 &mdash; 15% &mdash; reside outside the State in some 63 countries.  The majority of these are resident in the United Kingdom, Australia, the United States of America, Canada, Germany and Spain.  A breakdown of the number of recipients can be provided to the Deputies if necessary.</P>
        <P>In the Department&rsquo;s experience, the death of a contributory State pension recipient residing abroad is generally notified to the pension section without delay, either by a spouse, a surviving relative or a financial institution.  Notifications of customer deaths are received on a daily basis through the customer contact centre, in writing and via e-mail.  Pension payments are stopped on receipt of these notifications and appropriate action initiated.</P>
        <P>The Department has put arrangements in place with a number of foreign institutions to ensure that we are notified when a recipient of a contributory State pension resident outside the State dies.  In this regard, the Department works in close co-operation with the Department of Social Development in Northern Ireland and the Department of Work and Pensions in the United Kingdom and arrangements are underpinned by a memorandum of understanding between these organisations.  A control arrangement is also in place with the Australian Centrelink authorities whereby the Department receives a monthly electronic file of deaths where an Irish State pension is in payment.  The Department is a member of a six nations&rsquo; group, involving Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, which addresses and agrees common approaches on control issues and the sharing of information.</P>
        <P>In addition, at the start of each year, a mail shot issues to all contributory State pension customers resident abroad notifying them of their new pension rate and reminding them to let <Col N="399"/>the Department know of any changes to their circumstances that would affect their entitlements.  Any letters returned undelivered receive urgent attention.  This process acts as an additional control measure.</P>
        <P>As part of the Department&rsquo;s ongoing control strategy, periodic reviews are undertaken in order to determine customers&rsquo; continuing eligibility for pensions.  In this regard, the Department has initiated a customer certification process for contributory State pension customers resident in Ireland and abroad.  Letters issue to customers for completion and return of a certificate within a specified time.  Follow-up action is taken where no reply is received from the customer or where the letter is returned undelivered.</P>
        <P>To date, some 1,000 letters have issued to contributory State pension customers.  Of these, 300 were issued to pension recipients resident outside the State.  Some 81% of these customers have responded and replies are still being processed.  It is planned to issue a further 7,000 letters to contributory State pension customers resident abroad by the end of 2008.</P>
        <P>I am committed to ensuring that social welfare payments are available to those who are entitled to them.  I am satisfied that measures are in place to ensure that payments to customers resident outside the State are stopped when they are deceased.  The Department&rsquo;s control programme is carefully monitored and the various measures are continuously refined to ensure that they remain effective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>When this issue hit the headlines last month it was reported that the Department was of the view that some 8,000 non-resident pensioners were deceased and the pension payment was continuing in those cases.  Is that true?  Is that the view in the Department?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is utterly untrue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>That has clarified the matter.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated that a letter goes out at the start of the year notifying people about pension increases and he stated that there are 37,000 non-resident Irish pensioners.  What checks are in place to pick up on persons who have died since the previous year?  The Minister spoke about the system in Australia where there is an official notification procedure.  What about all the others, particularly pensioners in the UK?  What checks does the Department carry out to ensure that those people are still alive?</P>
        <P>If the Department is sending such letters as a type of check, sending out 300 to a cohort of 37,000 is really only scratching the surface.  I want the Minister to give some assurance to taxpayers that he is taking a vigorous approach to this and putting in place a system which will pick up on those fraudulent payments.  He has not done that to date and perhaps he could take this opportunity to reassure us that he is taking the issue seriously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to do so.  First, it was never the case that either I or any official in my Department believed the story presented in certain elements of the media regarding 8,000 persons.  These are simply control mechanisms that are implemented consistently across a range of schemes.</P>
        <P>Second, we have no evidence whatsoever, or reason to believe, that the 37,000 Irish citizens who live abroad and who are entitled to a contributory Irish pension on the basis of work they have done in this country are not entitled to those payments.</P>
        <P>Third, we have no reason to believe that persons in that cohort have died and are still getting payments.  We have no evidence to suggest that this is the case, but it is part and parcel of the <Col N="400"/>normal control mechanisms, which have been going on for years within the Department, in these areas.</P>
        <P>I indicated that one of the biggest cohorts is in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.  There is a strong working relationship between the pensions Departments there and here and they are in constant contact.  The protocols in place involve a continuous flow of information on deaths that take place.</P>
        <P>In cases where a person dies, there may be some death benefits available and people tend to notify the Government immediately that a person has died.  Banks also do so and probate and wills processes also bring out that information.  It is rare for somebody to make an attempt, on behalf of a deceased person who was in receipt of a contributory pension, to defraud the State on the basis of the person&rsquo;s pension rights.  We do not have evidence that this is the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Did anything trigger this review of the 8,000 persons, or was it merely something that was waiting to be done and it happened to be on a particular date?  In fairness, I am aware from my previous occupation that the Department can be thorough when somebody dies in terms of examining the person&rsquo;s estate.  It is obviously more difficult where somebody is resident abroad.</P>
        <P>Does the Department intend to issue the swipe cards it is progressing to persons living outside the State to collect their pensions or will such cards work abroad?  Regardless of whether the Department intends to do that or makes a decision not to do so for persons resident outside the State, will this review be completed before then?  If the Department will be making further contact, giving persons a swipe card would be on a par with giving them another pension book to enable them get their pensions.  That issue should be resolved first.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>On the first point, our approach was not exceptional.  It was part of the normal process of reviews and control mechanisms constantly being implemented by the Department with regard to various schemes.  It was presented by some elements in the media as if it was something new and special and as if it had been triggered by something specific, but that is not the case.  The Department does this consistently and constantly across a range of measures.  It just happened that on this occasion we were considering this aspect of it.  It was not done on the basis of any belief that there was large-scale fraud taking place, but as part of our control mechanisms.  Where there is significant taxpayers&rsquo; money involved, we want to be able to verify the spending, including from our own perspective.</P>
        <P>The swipe cards are being rolled out currently.  I do not have any details with regard to overseas recipients because not all recipients in Ireland are yet on the swipe card system, but we will achieve that down the road.  It is a system that could work.  The basis of certification and verification is strong and detailed.  Given that swipe cards are used to access funds from banks, the bank controls within the card for its use are specific and difficult to misuse.  Therefore, the use of swipe cards would enhance our security systems, particularly for those who are abroad.</P>
        <P>The irony of my position this afternoon is that Deputies constantly make representations to me with regard to how hard the Department is on individuals, how it makes black and white decisions and how it is not generous or flexible when it comes to accepting people on schemes.  The complaint is that the Department takes a very thorough view.  The complaint I receive most often from colleagues is that the Department is very strict.  It is interesting, therefore, that the questions being asked today suggest the Department is not strict enough.  I believe the Department is vigilant and that it acts in the best interest of all taxpayers and protects the resources being paid out.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="401"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think we are being unduly strict in expecting the Minister to have a system in place to pick up on deceased pensioners so that he can arrange for their payments to be stopped.  The Minister has not said anything today to reassure me that he has a robust system in place.  When he writes to pensioners every year to tell them about the increases in pensions, specifically the 37,000 non-resident pensioners, what does he ask them in terms of returning information to him?  I presume they are asked to sign some document to say they are still alive.  What kind of proof does he require in terms of a witness to that signature?  Will the Minister clarify the details with regard to the form people are required to return?  What percentage of non-resident pensioners have failed to make that return in recent years?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The information in question is not just to do with individual pensioners.  There is a strong and direct relationship between the Department and many of the institutions in other countries, whether banks, social welfare departments, pensions systems or death registries.  I provided some detail to the Deputy with regard to relationships with Northern Ireland and the Department for Work and Pensions in the United Kingdom and how the control mechanisms work in that regard and with regard to Australian institutions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>My question was more specific.  What does the Minister ask from pensioners in terms of returning information on an annual basis?  What information does he ask them to return to validate the fact that they are still alive?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We send out information, particularly when a new book is being issued and there is an increase in the pension, to individual recipients setting out their responsibilities with regard to notifications of any nature that would affect their payments.  We must try to verify that the information we receive is real and we do that in conjunction with the Departments in other countries that have an interest in the matter.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> if he has requested information from the Private Residential Tenancies Board seeking the details of landlords who have been prosecuted by the PRTB for their failure to register tenancies with the board or to comply with a determination order; if his Department pays rent supplement to landlords who have been prosecuted by the PRTB; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[12180/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, provides for the payment of a rent supplement to assist eligible tenants who are unable to provide for their immediate accommodation needs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</P>
        <P>Under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, landlords are legally obliged to register tenancies with the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB.  My Department supports the requirement that all tenancies, including those facilitated by rent supplement, should be registered with the PRTB and is committed to working closely with it in ensuring that all rent supplemented tenancies comply with the statutory system of tenancy regulation and safeguards.  To that end, my Department provides details of rent supplement payments to the PRTB to enable it identify tenancies that are not registered and to take any follow-up action necessary.</P>
        <P>The PRTB has advised that it has successfully prosecuted one landlord for failure to register tenancies with the board.  Rent supplement was paid to one of that landlord&rsquo;s tenants and was not paid directly to the landlord in that case.   Rent supplemented tenancies which are liable for <Col N="402"/>registration with the PRTB should be registered.  In that regard, I am satisfied that the arrangements I have outlined contribute to ensuring that landlords whose tenants receive rent supplement comply with this statutory obligation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I said earlier that there appears to be a serious problem with regard to the exchange of information between the Department, the Revenue Commissioners and the PRTB.  Does the Minister accept that is the case?  A recent report from the Comptroller and Auditor General showed that communications systems were weak in that regard.  What steps has the Minister taken to ensure that his Department&rsquo;s computer system is capable of picking up on this information and relaying it to the other two agencies?  With regard to the PRTB, in how many cases has the Department discovered rent supplement was being paid to landlords who were not registered?  The Minister has stated that one landlord was prosecuted, but in how many cases did the Department find that landlords in receipt of rent supplements were not registered with the PRTB as is required in law?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have taken action since the issue was raised in the House some time ago.  Discussions have taken place between the Department, the Revenue Commissioners and the PRTB to see how we can improve the existing system.  The Department notifies the PRTB of all tenancies where rent supplement is paid by the Department.  I do not have a figure for the total number but only have the figure I provided this afternoon.  I will ask that and will provide the information to the Deputy.  </P>
        <P>My concern is for individual clients who need support from the State in obtaining accommodation here.  People have often confused the issue and thought the Department&rsquo;s relationship was with landlords.  It is not, it is with individual clients whom we support in finding the best accommodation available to them, and we will continue to do that.  There have been some improvements and we would like further improvement with regard to how that information flow takes place.</P>
        <P>I do not want the client or recipient of the social welfare payment to be wholly responsible for the tax affairs of a landlord.  That would be unfair.  There are some mechanisms in place to ensure tax compliance and that the standard of accommodation being sought and given is of a high quality.  This involves not only the Department but also a number of other agencies, as indicated earlier, including local authorities.  Since the issues have arisen, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department and the PRTB have been engaged in discussions to try to enhance and align their systems so as to have a better flow of information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact the Minister is finally having discussions with the different groups involved.  The Minister has said he does not want the individual client to suffer and I agree with him in that regard.  However, the reality is that the individual clients do suffer because they do not get the best accommodation available.  This is because we do not have a system in place that ensures the social welfare payment, the rent supplement and the fact that a landlord is registered are linked with the quality of the accommodation.  Those three things do not link up but they should.  The Minister is not willing to take responsibility for leading the change in respect of this.  When is the Minister likely to conclude the discussion so we can ensure those three things are linked?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s question as well.  I am trying to include one last question before the end.       </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>When we raised this issue with the Minister last month, he more or less washed his hands of it.  He said that it had nothing to do with him and that he was respon<Col N="403"/>sible for rent supplement and answerable to the client.  The Minister is paying out &euro;420 million per year in rent supplement.  The question of whether the landlords who received that rent are tax compliant should be a matter of concern to him.  Given that he is responsible for that very substantial payout, it is not acceptable for him to say that it has nothing to do with him.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say that. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>That is exactly what he told us last month.  He told us that he was not responsible for tax collection.  I welcome the fact that he has seen the light and sees himself as having some responsibility in that area.  Regardless of how late it has happened, now that the Department is participating in some discussions with Revenue and the PRTB, when does the Minister expect new agreements to be in place in terms of the protocols covering the transfer of information between those three agencies? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Two clear issues have come up through discussion.  The first is that it is beginning to emerge that both the Labour Party and Fine Gael do not really want housing to be the responsibility of local government at all. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>We want to see people in proper accommodation and people to pay their taxes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>They obviously do not have any confidence that all of their councillors will fulfil their responsibilities at local level.  </P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister, without interruption.  Deputies should allow the Minister to reply.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>If it is proposed that the existing legislative basis for the responsibility for the quality and standard of housing stock in the country, which at the moment is the responsibility of local authorities, should be changed and if both parties are now saying that they do not have confidence in their own councillors to carry out those responsibilities, we will review the situation.  </P>
        <P>In respect of the second issue, I previously made it clear to Deputy Shortall that, in my view, it was not the case that recipients of social welfare payments or rent supplement should be responsible for the tax affairs of the local landlords or landlords anywhere in the country.  That would be gravely wrong.  It is certainly not the case that I have no particular view on the matter.  Of course, I have a view on it but it is of vital importance that the other agencies who have direct legislative responsibility for many of these issues fulfil the responsibilities they have.  My Department and its officials are quite willing to work with and enhance any of the arrangements that affect the customers of the Department of Social and Family Affairs in working with the Revenue Commissioners, the local authorities or the PRTB to ensure that we have the best system for our customers and the highest quality standard of accommodation in place and that the best value for money is being achieved for the money we give out on behalf of taxpayers in this country.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="404"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Far from trying to put the responsibility on the client, I am asking the Minister whether he, the Minister who pays out &euro;420 million annually in rent supplement, is prepared to accept his Department&rsquo;s responsibility in respect of ensuring that the landlords who receive that rent are tax compliant. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will give his final reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>

    <Title>Leaders&rsquo; Questions. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The old saying that a week is a long time in politics was never more true than today.  I had, obviously, prepared for a different kind of Leaders&rsquo; Questions here at 3.45 p.m. but events, as they say, have overtaken that.  I want to say, man to man, to Deputy Bertie Ahern, as Taoiseach, that I have known him since 1977.  I have watched him rise through his own party to the exalted and privileged office of Taoiseach.  I have interacted with him personally and politically on many occasions over the past 30 years.  I recall us representing our country against the Brits in Islington when we were a little younger and maybe a little fitter.  The Taoiseach played his part at left midfield.  </P>
        <P>I know the pressures that public life can place on people and family life.  I know that this must be a sad day for the Taoiseach in arriving at the decision he made.  When I was elected leader of Fine Gael, I stood in this place and said that I would be happy to give credit where credit was due to the Taoiseach or the Ministers in his Government based on their achievements.  I have not failed in my responsibility in that regard.  I assume there will be time on the formal date of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s resignation to pay tribute to him as Taoiseach for the work he did and the service he carried out on behalf of our country.</P>
        <P>I reflect in particular on the part that all leaders have played since my time in this House in putting together the jigsaw for peace in Northern Ireland.  Obviously, the Taoiseach was in office when that came to fruition.  We hope that peace continues.  I thank the Taoiseach for his unfailing courtesy to me at all times regarding briefings on matters of State and so on.</P>
        <P>As I said in a forum outside the House, I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach has made this decision, tough and inevitable as it has been.  From that perspective, this day had to come and I am glad that the Taoiseach recognises that the ongoing work of Government was being distracted by events at the Mahon tribunal.  We will have an opportunity again to talk about the Taoiseach&rsquo;s achievements.  He has always been a pragmatist.  He understands that night follows day, the seasons change and follow each other.  Life goes on and politics goes on.  From that perspective our country obviously faces a number of serious challenges.  One of those in which the Taoiseach and I share a common opinion is approval for the European Union reform treaty.  The finalisation of the referendum date remains within the Taoiseach&rsquo;s control before his date of resignation.  I ask him to confirm whether the referendum will take place in the week of 12 June as he intimated here prior to the D&aacute;il rising before the Easter recess.  It is obviously of interest to everybody who has a part to play in this to have some clarification of the date so that we can plan accordingly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Kenny for his remarks and comments.  We have worked together from opposite sides but as good colleagues for 30 years so I appreciate what he has said.  I might say a few more words about that in a few minutes.</P>
        <P>We have completed all the work the Cabinet set out.  We have the referendum legislation.  We have the White Paper, which was launched today.  The campaign is, I think, up and running.  All the various interests for and against, which is always good in a democracy, have put together their schedules.  While we have not formalised a date, because I was to do that, it seems that Thursday, 12 June is probably the most appropriate date.  I looked at the weekends, but the reality is that during weekends in June an enormous number of people are on the move, using their weekend breaks.  While some people are going home others are moving out of town.  It seems that the most appropriate date is the 12th and I will finalise that.  We have not made a <Col N="406"/>formal decision, but with the Referendum Commission and all the other issues in place, Thursday, 12 June is the correct day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to accept that will now be the date.  I was reflecting earlier whether the Government would consider postponing the referendum because of the internal decision the Fianna F&aacute;il Party will need to make.  I am happy to accept the Taoiseach&rsquo;s word that it will be 12 June and all parties irrespective of their positions can now plan their referendum agendas.  I thank him for his confirmation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Deputy Kenny in marking the significance of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement this morning.  I welcome the decision he has made.  I appreciate how difficult that decision has been for him personally.  As the Taoiseach said this morning, it was a decision he made in the best interests of the country, which I accept.  It is a course of action I have been advocating to him for some time.  In doing so I have always acknowledged the contribution he has made to the political life of this country.  In particular I again acknowledge and pay tribute to the enormous personal and political effort he made to bring about a settlement in Northern Ireland.  I wish him well personally.  I hope he accepts that the political duty I have had to perform was done on a political basis and not on a personal basis.  I believe his decision today will enable this House and politics generally to move on to put at the top of our political agenda issues that are of immediate concern to the people of this country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to ask the Taoiseach about one of those issues.  While all of us in this House are concerned about the future and in the main the political future generally of parties, individuals and so on, there are many men and women who are concerned about their future in a different way.  I speak in particular about those people who have undergone cancer tests and are now uncertain about the results of those tests.  Notwithstanding the other concerns he has had in the past few days, I am sure the Taoiseach will be aware of the reports that have been published in recent days, the report from the north-eastern region that thousands of X-rays are now being re-examined, the report into what happened with the misdiagnoses in Barringtons Hospital and the Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley report, all of which add to the other reports we have had regarding misdiagnoses of cancer tests.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach agree with the comment made by Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley who, when responding to the report in her case, said we really should ensure that Russian roulette is no longer played with patients&rsquo; safety?  Can he give some assurance to people who have either undergone a cancer test or are about to do so that the results of such tests will be accurate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Gilmore.  Maybe in a minute I will say a few words and wrap up on my own issue.</P>
        <P>On the Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley case, to recall in June 2007 the Health Information and Quality Authority commenced an independent investigation into the care provided to Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley by the HSE.  As part of the investigation into the circumstances around the care of Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley regarding her systematic breast disease, that investigation examined the pathology services provided by the HSE at Cork University Hospital and of course the systematic breast disease services provided by the HSE in the Mid-Western Regional Hospital.  That report by HIQA was published today.</P>
        <P>The main finding of the report, to record for the House, is that the interpretive error made by a consultant pathologist that led to the initial misdiagnosis was a single mistake of human error.  However, the report notes the absence of triple assessment review in the case and the missed opportunities to correct the error.  The report was also critical of the HSE in governance, management and communication of the way in which Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley was informed of <Col N="407"/>matters relevant to her care.  Not to go into them all, the report makes 15 recommendations for the HSE, including matters relating to clinical practice and management.  Obviously it is for it to make sure they are implemented.  The board of the HSE has recently adopted a new interim policy and procedures on serious incident management which include learning from recent reports on the Portlaoise events and will, coupled with the implementation of the new policy on the development of centres of excellence for breast disease services, provide solutions to many of the recommendations in this report.  If I can come back in a minute, I will also say a few words on the Barrington&rsquo;s issue which the Deputy asked me about.  I will let him in first.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Taoiseach to expand on the report on the Barrington&rsquo;s Hospital case.  I ask him specifically about the HIQA report on Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley.  As the Taoiseach said, 15 recommendations were made.  Does the Government accept those 15 recommendations and can the Taoiseach assure the House they will be implemented?</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley, the answer is yes, the Government accepts all 15 recommendations.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The report of the independent review of the Barrington&rsquo;s case was published yesterday, as the House will be aware.  That report confirmed that two women who were among the original ten cases referred to HIQA had their cancer diagnoses delayed potentially causing them serious harm.  The review process did not identify any other women who had a missed or delayed diagnosis.  The report found that of the 285 cases reviewed, in 118 cases it was the clinical and professional judgment of the review team that the level of clinical care was not always what it considered as appropriate.  That is a quote from the report.</P>
        <P>It also concluded that &ldquo;their care did not meet the standards which would have been acceptable at their time of treatment&rdquo;.  The Minister anticipates that the Medical Council, the regulatory body for the profession, will fully examine the findings of this report.  It again highlights the need for the continued implementation, in both the public and private health care sectors, of the national quality assurance standards for systematic breast disease services which were approved last year by the Health Act.  The standards will clearly have implications for private facilities, some of which have already ceased providing systematic breast services.  A total of 16 public sector hospitals with low case volumes have now ceased providing breast care services.</P>
        <P>The issue of safety in the delivery of health services lies at the heart of any care system which has the confidence of the people using those services.  The Minister established the Health Information and Quality Authority in May last year.  The process in which the regulatory regime such as that given to HIQA will be introduced first in the public sector, which is a feature of such developments in other jurisdictions.  The extension of this type of monitoring and control to the private sector is not an easy matter and is considered very complex.  The Minister has referred the matter to the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance.  The commission is due to report in July, with the overall objective of developing clear and practical recommendations to ensure that quality and safety for patients is paramount throughout the entire health care system.  The commission has been asked by the Minister to bring forward proposals that will provide for the licensing of all health care facilities, including private hospitals such as Barringtons.</P>
        <P>A Cheann Comhairle, if I can just very briefly refer to my own statement today.  I want to acknowledge what Deputy Kenny and Deputy Gilmore have said and confirm to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and to my colleagues in this House that on 6 May I will, pursuant to the Constitution, place my resignation in the hands of the President.  I believe it is in the best interests of the country and the Government that a new Taoiseach take charge and lead Ireland forward.</P><Col N="408"/>
        <P>Today is not an end, in my view, it is a new beginning.  It is with a sure faith in our shared future and with great hope and with no regret that I have come to that decision.  I made that decision alone, with the sense of responsibility that this Republic charges all our citizens.  I know that we will continue on the path of progress that marks Ireland out around the world and will surely mark this generation out in history.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Public service is a great privilege and a great honour.  It is a great privilege and a great honour for everybody in this House, particularly for Members on all sides who have been office holders.  It is a privilege and an honour I have enjoyed for over 30 years and been lucky to do so.  I have been humbled by the responsibility and the trust that the people have placed in me.  Today is not an occasion to give account of what I have done or, quite frankly, left undone.  It is, rather, a fitting moment to say to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and to the Irish people that I am humbled to have been entrusted for so long with so great a responsibility of leading my country.  To have been chosen from my own community as a representative in this House, to have been called by successive Taoisigh to serve in government, to have been elected by the people on so many occasions and to have been elected here in this House on three occasions is an honour and responsibility beyond the capacity of any citizen to fully repay.  All I want to say for myself today is that in all these years I have never ceased to try, to the utmost of my ability, to fully discharge those responsibilities to my community, the country and to this House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The past 30 years have been times of great trials and great triumph for all of us on all benches of this House.  For much of that time, the vision of a country that could one day prosper and be at peace seemed far off and almost impossible to maintain.  Unemployment and emigration were harsh realities that made hope and optimism hard to sustain at times.  The cloud of sectarian violence and political conflict hung over all of us and hung over the whole island.  That deeply darkened our national life and brought unspeakable pain to thousands and yet, change did come, optimism did triumph and our hopes have been realised.  As Deputy Kenny said, I share that work with many others, from all sides, and I acknowledge that.</P>
        <P>Opportunity has replaced despondency, peace has replaced bloodshed and we have a new beginning.  The Irish people did not surrender to the common enemy of despair.  They have never ceased to believe that better times would come.  Time and again they looked to politics and to politicians &mdash; the people they chose to represent them in this House and elsewhere &mdash; to give leadership in the challenge of thinking about old problems in new ways.  By brilliant innovation and hard lessons alike, this country has overcome a difficult past and shaped a new beginning.</P>
        <P>The lesson of my political lifetime is that by keeping faith with the future, we discharge our responsibility to history and to ourselves.  People in politics have kept faith with one another.  I acknowledge all of the contributions of the people I have worked with in this House and those I have worked with in Government from various parties.  If there is any single achievement that this generation can boast of it is that it has realised the hopes bequeathed to it.  We hand on confidence as our legacy and we leave tenacity as our testament.  As we look forward to a new beginning in a new Ireland we have nothing to be complacent about.  We have much to be confident in.  This is a time of unparalleled opportunity in a country of great possibility.</P>
        <P>Politics is never over.  I acknowledge what Deputy Kenny and Deputy Gilmore have said.  I totally acknowledge that they do their job here in a democratic system and in a political way.  I fully appreciate that and hold no grudges or animosity towards anybody inside or outside this House, although sometimes I think there is a chamber outside this House that does not have the fairness of this establishment, but that is for another place and another day.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="409"/>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>New challenges emerge and old problems remain to be fully resolved.  I leave the office of Taoiseach full of faith for the future and full of thanks for the opportunity I have had.  Soon a new leader will stand in my stead but between now and then, I will do my job and deal with the Leaders of the Opposition here as best I can, answering the issues of the day.</P>
        <P>My deepest wish is that my successor will enjoy the loyalty, support and wise advice that was so unselfishly given to me by my party colleagues and by hard working and honourable public servants, for whom I have huge respect and regard.  I just want to put on the record my thanks to them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sustaining the hopes of an Ireland that enjoys self confidence at home and widespread respect abroad is a challenge that will require change as much as it will bring continuity.  As the challenges are met and difficulties are faced, when pessimism encroaches and cynicism threatens, remember the goodwill and unshakeable faith of the Irish people.  My view has always been to put my faith in them.  They send us all here, as their representatives and their hope in all our successes is shelter in every storm and true hope in every difficulty.  That is what they want to see us doing here, whether in government or in opposition, on the Front Bench, back bench, as Ministers or Ministers of State &mdash;  they want to see us do well because they do well when we do well.</P>
        <P>Some may see the end of a political career as failure.  Perhaps in a very narrow and petty sense it is but for me, the only lasting regret I should feel would be the failure of never having tried at all.  I have tried and tried again to vindicate the hopes and aspirations that were invested in me.  My success, as it may be, is the measure of the unshakeable confidence of the Irish people in this country&rsquo;s future.  The future is now at hand and so I say again, as I have said before in another place, Ireland&rsquo;s hour has come.  It came not as a victory or a defeat but as a shared future for all.  Solidarity has made us stronger and reconciliation has brought us closer.  Ireland&rsquo;s hour has come &mdash; a time of peace, prosperity, old values and new beginnings.  This is a great lesson, the great gift of Irish history.  That is what Ireland can give to the world.  As I bring my time as Taoiseach to an end, in a month&rsquo;s time, I will recall that Ireland gave me the opportunity to be part of her history and now, at the end, I will submit to the verdict of history.</P>

        <P>The social partnership process comprises the institutions for shared analysis and reflection, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, and the National Economic and Social Forum, NESF, and the arrangements for negotiation and monitoring of agreements, specifically the current agreement, Towards 2016.  During 2008, NESC will undertake a number of studies which will develop the economic, social and environmental analysis set out in the council&rsquo;s 2006 strategy, People, Productivity and Purpose.  In particular, the council expects to complete the following studies: an economic report, which will give an overview of key economic themes and develop an understanding of Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a new economic context, and a social report, which the Government has asked the council to prepare on a periodic basis.  The council expects to finish this work by the autumn.  In addition, the council secretariat will contribute to the Futures Ireland project, in collaboration with the NESF and the NCPP.  This project was recommended by the Information Society Commission and agreed by Government and the social partners in the Towards 2016 partnership programme.</P>
        <P>During 2008, the council will also initiate a number of other studies, including a review of the challenges of climate change and sustainable energy to contribute to building a greater shared understanding of these issues among economic and social organisations; a project to review the regimes of standards and accountability in a range of service areas, including social care, education, training, labour market services and aspects of health care, and identify approaches which can support not only minimum standards, but also continuous improvement and tailoring of services to diverse and changing needs in line with the model of a developmental welfare state proposed in previous council reports; and a study of the quality and inclusiveness of first-time education.</P>
        <P>The NESF completed work on a number of reports published during 2007.  These include, Improving the Delivery of Quality Public Services; The Arts, Cultural Inclusion and Social Cohesion; and Mental Health and Social Inclusion, including a research survey on mental <Col N="411"/>health in the workplace.  The forum also recently published a report, commissioned by the ESRI, entitled A Statistical Analysis of Public Involvement in the Arts.  In addition, the NESF hosted the social inclusion forum in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham in November 2007.  The NESF secretariat is also at an advanced stage in preparing the fifth periodic report, which will review the policy impact of the reports published by the NESF over the period 2004 to 2006.  The membership of the new forum is in place, following the recent nominations to the Oireachtas strand, and its immediate priority will be to agree a new work programme for the period to 2010.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The third plenary meeting of the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, was held on 15 February.  Towards 2016 commits that:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">A formal review will take place during 2008. This will provide an opportunity to take stock of outcomes achieved in relation to the overall goals and to consider any opportunities arising to refocus and reprioritise.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Towards 2016 also provides that the pay agreement would come into force on the expiry of the Mid-Term Review of Sustaining Progress and would last for 27 months.  Given that the terms of the pay agreement for the private sector under Towards 2016 expired last month, the review process will include negotiations on a new pay round.  The pay terms for the public sector expire at end-September.</P>
        <P>I used the opportunity of the plenary meeting to formally invite the social partners to participate in a review of Towards 2016 and a copy of my speech has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.  The programme for Government commits that &ldquo;arrangements for representation of environmental issues in Social Partnership will be considered in the course of the review of Towards 2016 which will take place in 2008.&rdquo;  The issue of environmental representation in social partnership will be considered further during this review in consultation with the social partners.</P>
        <P>Any change to the structure of social partnership must be carefully considered and the Government previously identified clear and specific criteria against which applications to join the social partnership process are considered.  These include that organisations requesting social partner status be national and representative in nature, that they have the capacity to meet the demands and obligations that arise as part of this participation and that they will add to the capacity of the social partnership process to address issues effectively.  In addition, any organisations will be required to formally endorse the Towards 2016 agreement.</P>

	<P Just="Left">It is a little unreal that we are taking Taoiseach&rsquo;s questions, given the events of the day, and it will be difficult to hold the Taoiseach to commitments he might make in the next month.</P>
        <P>Maintaining competitiveness must be the bread and butter of a social partnership system and the consequences of social partnership.  Is the Taoiseach concerned by the remarks made recently by Barack Obama, a candidate for the US Presidency?  He is interested in implementing legislation that would allow for the repatriation of moneys by American multinationals, which would have a serious impact on Ireland.  Will the Taoiseach raise that issue with his counterpart in the US when he visits there in the next month?</P>
        <P>The Central Bank has indicated that Ireland&rsquo;s share of world trade has declined by a quarter, competitiveness has deteriorated by 30%, 30,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost, Ireland&rsquo;s balance of payments has turned from a surplus to a record deficit of just under &euro;10 billion and unemployment is at a ten-year high.  Social partnership has had its value but, for instance, following the driving test fiasco and the failure to introduce widespread e-government, the <Col N="412"/>model is stuck in the old ways.  It is not the one we need now to deal with confidence for the future and to face the challenges of a new era, given the competitiveness challenge from the far east and emerging countries in Europe and the US.  Will the Taoiseach comment on that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Barack Obama&rsquo;s proposal is a Democratic Party policy initiative brought forward by John Kerry during the last election and it is something we must carefully monitor.  Previously, IDA Ireland had a specialist in the US on contract to watch these developments and to lobby on the issues.  The last time Senator Ted Kennedy was very helpful in at least putting the Irish cause at the top level within the Democratic Party so those involved will understand the sensitivities.  I understand the argument from a United States point of view.  The more money they keep and treat to the best advantage within their own Administration, the better it is for them.  However, there are other considerations.  US companies invest in Ireland and elsewhere in Europe, giving them access to a market of 460 million people, which they would not be able to access otherwise.  Failure to invest outside the US and to have incentives for such investment so that these companies can reinvest, extend and update their innovation and research is a consideration for the United States if they want to successfully grow their own multinational companies to invest all over the world.  There is a strong case.  Once again, the issue has come up and we must follow the debate to make sure we put our case.  We will do that, but many senior people such as Senator Chris Dodds and others are very familiar with our argument and our presentation.  However, it is not just about Ireland.  It is about all of the investment companies out of the United States and we must deal with that.</P>
        <P>On the second issue, there is no doubt that in any negotiations on social partnership the issue of competitiveness is crucial because so many jobs in this country exist, or in many cases co-exist, because we are able to produce goods and services and export them at a productive rate which allows us to be able to compete in the international market and provide jobs at home.  If one&rsquo;s competitiveness is lost the danger is always that one can lose these jobs.  This is well understood in the social partnership process.</P>
        <P>It is not just an issue of wages and salaries, which are obviously one part of competitiveness.  Increasingly in recent years, there is also the tax take &mdash; our taxes on employment and labour have been low by international standards.  There are insurance costs, which we have brought down enormously over the past number of years.  There are also energy costs and infrastructural costs.  The reason we spend 6% of our GDP on infrastructure is to make it competitive.  All of these arguments come into it and in this round of negotiations, like every round, the Government side, and also the employers and trade unions, would be conscious of competitiveness.</P>
        <P>While most of the current job losses are in the residential construction side, we are still doing very well in foreign direct investment and we are developing indigenous Irish companies.  We are doing extremely well and I think we are the number one exporter of services internationally, which is an enormous achievement by our companies.  There is no ground for complacency in that.</P>
        <P>On the third point, one can never pay any more than can be afforded in fair negotiations.  Really, what social partnership and all the reviews done into this are about is that we pay our public servants and our private sector workers what is achievable within an economy.  Yes, there are pressures internationally.  One only has to pick up an international commentary to see the difficulties out there such as what happened in sub-prime lending, the financial downturn, inter-bank borrowing difficulties and the loss of confidence in many parts of the world about the future.  These are all difficulties and one way or another to some extent they affect us and we must be conscious of them.</P><Col N="413"/>
        <P>This country is still strong.  Employment is strong.  Our debt ratio is historically low.  Where there are pressures we just have to manage them in a sensible way.  The reality is that all the underlying strengths of the Irish economy are positive.  We just have to manage ourselves through a sharp international downturn.  If we do that, as we have done in recent years, we will get the bounce as soon as the international economy bounces.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Ceann Comhairle to allow me, as the leader of the smaller of the three Opposition parties in the House who did not have an opportunity to do so during Leaders&rsquo; Questions, to take the opportunity to offer the Taoiseach good wishes for the remainder of his term as Taoiseach and for whatever time lies before him in public service.  I commend him on all the good he has done over the years.  While there will be undoubted differences, we will have the opportunity to reflect on these again.  I wish him well and I hope his departure not only represents a change in personnel sitting where he is but that the opportunity might also be taken to arrange for a change in policy direction in a number of key areas, not least in health.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I knew the Deputy would say that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no chance the Taoiseach is taking the good Deputy Harney with him.  I will dream on.  One never knows.  Today was a surprise and perhaps another one will present itself.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach will recall that one of the most important reports presented by the National Economic and Social Forum, NESF, in recent years focused on the care of older people.  With regard to questions I asked the Taoiseach in the past as to what happens to reports presented by the NESF, he indicated these are referred to Departments and are taken on board.  Specifically with regard to the report prepared on the care of older people, has it been presented to the appropriate Department and has it been taken on board?  To what can the Taoiseach point in the recommendations of the NESF which has since been taken on board and either worked towards or implemented?</P>
        <P>In particular, what is the position regarding the proposed fair deal scheme for subsidising nursing home care for older people?  Is it the case, as has been reported, that this is now mired in constitutional difficulties and that the &euro;110 million earmarked for its initial implementation and introduction has been diverted into other areas?  Will the Taoiseach advise us what is the actual position with regard to the fair deal scheme at this point in time?  When will we see the full detail of its essence brought before us?  Is the Taoiseach aware that in November 2007, nine organisations flagged difficulties with regard to the fair deal proposals?  Where does this stand?  Like myself, a number of people on the Front Bench are heading towards the need for care for older people and it seems to be presenting some humour to them.  I assure them this is not a humorous issue.</P>
        <P>As the Taoiseach lumped so many questions together, I also wish to ask questions with regard to the incremental wage increases in Towards 2016.  Given that they have not kept pace with inflation and the fact that the 0.5% additional increase for low-paid workers has proven derisory, is it the case that in future partnership engagement specific reference and attention will be paid to the needs of low-paid workers as against being lumped into wage agreements in general?  Will particular attention be paid to the needs of low-paid workers, particularly as we are looking at more straitened economic circumstances presenting in the time ahead?</P>
        <P>With regard to the promise that 90 labour inspectors would be delivered under Towards 2016, in reply to a recent parliamentary question from my colleague, Deputy Arthur Morgan, it was established from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment that we would <Col N="414"/>have 50 inspectors at the start of this year.  How many are in place as we speak?  When will the 90 promised under Towards 2016 be delivered?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for his good wishes, which I appreciate.</P>
        <P>A number of reports were published by NESF in its work programme, including on improving the delivery of quality public services, the arts, cultural inclusion and social cohesion, mental health, creating a more inclusive labour market, early childhood care and education, and the report mentioned by the Deputy on care for older people.  Once reports are published, the recommendations in each report are referred to the relevant Ministers for their consideration.</P>
        <P>As I stated, the forum is in the process of finalising its fifth periodic report which will provide details of those recommendations implemented under the headings.  The Deputy will know in the aged area, every year in the budget a large increase has been directed to assist the aged.  Under the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, we have co-ordinated and brought the care of the aged groups together under direct responsibility and this helps the entire focus in this area.  Questions on the details of all the recommendations should be put to the Minister of State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in will appreciate, I would not accept that the pay increases were in any way minimal.  What we have done in recent years, under the social partnership agreements, in respect of tax and pay and in other areas has meant strong gains for employees.  Without pre-empting the negotiations on this round, it is fair to say the talks will be set in the context of a more challenging environment.  The parties are aware of the realities as set out for them by myself and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance when we met in Dublin Castle on 15 February.  It is critical we seek to protect our national competitiveness and that we maintain our public finances in a strong position.  It is important that expectations take account of these fundamentals.</P>
        <P>I anticipate discussions in the course of the talks in respect of issues such as pensions, agency workers, employment law compliance, public service reform and benchmarking.  This is not about pay alone but about other issues flagged by the various social partners with whom we must deal.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in spoke about the challenges facing workers.  We are all aware that increases last year in mortgage interest rates and oil prices have driven inflation &mdash; they account for more than half our inflation rate.  Unfortunately, these factors are not within our domestic control.  In particular, energy prices are not determined by Government but are set independently by the Commission for Energy Regulation in light of prevailing conditions.  Mortgage interest relief is a large component of service inflation.  It is clear that limited competition in the services sector is an issue and that this should continue to be a priority for the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency.  We will work to ensure that the increases given to workers in all these areas are meaningful in terms of their quality of life and standard of living.  The statistics clearly show that workers have gained from the national agreements made under the social partnerships during the past 20 years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach made no reference in his response to my question on the current position of the fair deal debacle.  This important matter needs to be addressed in the context of all of this and perhaps the Taoiseach will address it.</P>
        <P>As regards low paid workers and the 0.5% additional increase, will the Taoiseach accept that it is imperative that low pay is a singular issue for discussion in future talks in relation to social partnership and that without it we will, in my view, fail to reach agreement or, worse, fail to meet the needs of people who are already struggling to make ends meet?  What action does the Taoiseach propose to take regarding the HSE, which is one of the largest employers in this <Col N="415"/>State, an agent of Government, which was recently found guilty by the Labour Court of being in breach of Towards 2016?  What action is to be taken in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, I must allow other members to contribute.  Magnus Magnusson would not be able to remember all the questions the Deputy asked.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I will conclude with the following question.  What action does the Government intend to take in respect of the HSE&rsquo;s job cuts and the whole debacle that took place last year and is still ongoing?  Some 30,000 health care workers are currently balloting for industrial action as a consequence of the HSE&rsquo;s obstinacy and attitude towards its employees.  This is aside from how it has stood over the continued diminution of health care services in this State, which is a disgrace in itself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Discussions on the fair deal legislation are ongoing between the Departments and Attorney General.  It is hoped the legislation will be ready shortly.</P>
        <P>On low pay, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in will have seen the European Union charts which show that year after year Ireland, through the minimum wage and its tax policy of keeping low paid workers out of the tax net, is more committed to ensuring a better deal for low paid workers than any other country in Europe.  We first made changes in this regard six or seven years ago and have continued to do so every year since then.  Ireland has been commended in that regard.  Our low paid workers are paid more and our minimum wage is the second highest in Europe.  This money is not taxed.  We also have the family income supplement which assists people with particular difficulties and various other supplements to assist large families.  There can be no criticism of the protection afforded by us to our low paid workers.  The issue is continuing to afford to do these things.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in also asked about the compliance legislation.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, published a Bill on 18 March, which is since I last spoke on this issue.  This legislation will completely overhaul the State&rsquo;s employment rights framework and meets the commitment contained in Towards 2016.  It will serve to modernise the labour inspectorate and strengthen the enforcement of employment rights and work permits.  It will also promote greater compliance in the workplace and increase penalties for those employers who seek to gain advantage by denying employees their entitlements under law.</P>
        <P>The National Employment Rights Authority has received additional staff.  To the best of my knowledge, when I last reported on this matter, only a few staff positions remained to be filled.  The legislation empowers NERA labour inspectors to examine employment permits, prosecute offences and conduct investigations.  It also provides for greater penalties, protection for whistleblowers and sets out a comprehensive list of the documents which must be kept by employers.  All of the commitments set out in the negotiations on Towards 2016 are dealt with in this legislation.  Other legislation deals with agency workers; they are not part of that Bill.  We have honoured our commitments.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, will bring the legislation through the House this session.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the HSE?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the HSE and Labour Court issues, the Government has always honoured Labour Court recommendations.  The Government, with its officials, tries to assist agencies or organisations in resolving difficulties.  An enormous amount of commitment and effort has been put into dealing with the issues that arose last September in respect of the embargo which it was perceived by workers had to be dealt with.  We have put in place a mechanism through which these issues can be examined and have worked within the health <Col N="416"/>forum to bring about a resolution which reflects change, productivity and an enhanced service.  The Government and HSE must work together to try to improve the service and to get value for the enormous amount of resources being provided.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would like to ask the Taoiseach about the considerable spinning going on following the talks with the social partners.  The Taoiseach stated that most of the commitments have been honoured.  However, David Begg, secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, was remarkably apologetic on radio as he explained how the inflation rate had overtaken pay increases.  This leads one to reflect on what he has received over on the social side by way of compensation.  When one goes back to the text of the agreement one finds, in respect of affordable housing, a complete failure to deliver.  Pursuing the spirit of what has been agreed and regarded as a success, I recall that in those days it was described as having two fundamental principles, cohesion and competitiveness.  The economy was to be competitive in an international trading environment.  One must have cohesion with a reduction in gaps in incomes, gaps in services, gaps in access to education and access to services for the elderly.  Suddenly cohesion is missing from all the scripts and we are supposed to be entering bad times when we are to receive lectures on competitiveness.  In order to be positive on the day that is in it, if it is acknowledged that inflation has surpassed some of the basic increases, where then are the non-wage gains for the social partners?  Did the Taoiseach discuss these at the meetings?  For example, the Taoiseach discussed with me over the past year or two something which is very basic, the abuse by the Competition Authority of its role in such a fashion as would undermine the trade union Acts.  The Taoiseach suggested that maybe he would legislate in this area and deal with it or he would deal with it when the social partnership talks were taking place.  Has he dealt with that basic issue, for example, the right of collective representation, which is still outstanding?</P>
        <P>He then moved on to the question about housing.  Let us be positive and say that the contraction in the construction industry in the private speculative sector releases a significant number of labour skills that are available for the public housing programme.  What do the social partners ask of the Taoiseach and what did he offer in terms of an expanded public programme, be it in terms of social housing or affordable housing?  Reflecting on the new Green influence, that is no doubt present every Tuesday in the Cabinet, did the Taoiseach decide to shift resources from roads to rail?  Where is the enhanced public transport programme and was it discussed by the social partners and did it interest them?</P>
        <P>Perhaps if there were not going to be any real wage increases, did the social partners remember the document on child care they produced at the beginning of the talks the last time which showed the comparison between the absence of child care provisions in Ireland compared to European provisions?</P>
        <P>This is a whole set of issues.  The idea is that we are at the end of a period of significant success and we must now make sure we discuss only competitiveness.  We derived from the European objective in the Lisbon accord the twin aims of cohesion and competitiveness, cohesion in terms of narrowing all the gaps and achieving inclusiveness.  Competitiveness is necessary because we must trade internationally.</P>
        <P>In times when the Taoiseach is not offering material on the wage side, what is he offering on the non-wage side?  What is he offering on working time, on increased protection and all the other areas I mentioned such as child care, the difference between the actual net wage and the social wage, and so forth?  Is it that the social partners came to the meeting with the Taoiseach and said they acknowledged they did not get what was promised to them but they were willing to say a prayer together for the future?  Where is it and what is on offer by way <Col N="417"/>of compensation for the non-delivery?  What is on offer by way of balancing the demands being made for competitiveness?  I am not interested in this spinning of information.  One could re-read the tax statistics and say the fact that so many people are out of the tax net is because we are well on our way to a low wage economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Deputy Higgins has asked me approximately 30 questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is multiple choice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>His basic point was that there is another side to the argument other than competitiveness.  I thought I made it clear earlier that of course there is another side.  Workers understand that to keep the jobs of everybody they must be competitive but that does not mean they are not receiving gains.  The social partnership process has delivered gains in return for productivity, competitiveness and more flexible working.  Taxes, proportionally and in every other way, have decreased massively in terms of workers&rsquo; wages over the years.  This happened as a result of the negotiations.  This is what happened in the early years and has continued.  It also extended into the areas of lifestyle such as helping older people in the life cycle approach and helping younger people and helping with child care by way of significant investment.</P>
        <P>Deputy Higgins referred to the affordable housing scheme as a total failure.  The Government set out to expand social and affordable housing and the housing policy statement on sustaining communities and the national development plan reflected that commitment.  The national development plan provided resources of some &euro;18 billion in total to support increased output of social and affordable housing to help 140,000 households.  Those things would not have happened outside of the context of social partnership.  A significant programme of activity has been undertaken to assist house purchase under the national development programme &mdash; 40,000 households.  State lands have been given for that.  In addition, the national development plan resources will be used to meet the needs of 100,000 households through a range of social housing programmes.  A total of 63,000 new social homes will commence or be acquired during the period of the plan.</P>
        <P>Deputy Higgins referred to the pressures and that more may be required but enormous resources are being put into this area and record levels of funding for social and affordable housing are being provided this year.  A total of &euro;2.5 billion is available for housing programmes generally, and the Exchequer provision is &euro;1.7 billion, which even in a difficult year, is 16% higher than last year.  Similar resources are available for child care and resources for the aged.</P>
        <P>I am in complete agreement with Deputy Higgins on his first point, that there is another side to the argument on competitiveness but I cannot agree with his second point.  The achievement of social partnership is providing the resources to do things that would not otherwise have been possible if we had continued with the old style of adversarial human resource issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>About 15 minutes ago the Exchequer figures for the first quarter were published.  They show an Exchequer deficit of &euro;354 million recorded for the first quarter of 2008 and that tax revenues to the end of March are &euro;600 million or more than 5% less than the published profile.  This obviously represents a very serious turn in the country&rsquo;s public finances.  What impact does the Taoiseach think these Exchequer figures will have on the social partnership talks which are due to begin?  When does he expect the talks to commence formally and what is the timetable for them?  Will he tell the House how it is proposed to address the problem that Deputy Michael D. Higgins has outlined, that the pay element of the last social <Col N="418"/>partnership agreement has been beaten now by inflation and that inflation is running at almost 5%?</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="3" />
    </Speaker><!--Fix-->
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Exchequer figures, the tax profile was to be 24% and it was 23% so it is very close to target.  Income taxes are up by 5%.  As I said about the February figures, the capital gains tax is reduced &mdash; it is the property development side that is down.  This area has been extremely healthy for the past number of years but other tax heads are pulling it up.  Like every economy, since the sub-prime issues of last August have affected the economic cycle of the last quarter and into the first quarter, it has become a more challenging position.  However, overall, and providing we keep our expenditure for this year on target and we maintain employment as strongly as possible &mdash; obviously there is going to be an increase in unemployment and that has been well signalled and profiled, particularly in the construction sector &mdash; we should be near enough to our overall targets for this year.  It is a challenge. </P>
        <P>On inflation, I already mentioned the main factors of oil prices and interest rates feeding in from last year are not within our domestic control.  Therefore, we must work hard on those issues over which we have control.  We have actively engaged with the social partners on an ongoing basis, including working with the anti-inflation group which has proved to be successful over the past seven or eight years, to examine ways of reducing domestically generated inflation.  That examination has informed the contributions from the Central Statistics Office, the Competition Authority, the National Consumer Agency and the Commission for Energy Regulation with a view to establishing remedial action in these areas.  We must continue to do that.  It is an ongoing task to try to reduce inflation and not something we simply start and then drop.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s question on when the pay talks will commence, the plenary meeting on 15 February, which was addressed by me and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance, provided the basis for the initiation of formal talks, including those relating to the new pay round and the publication of the Employment Law Compliance Bill, which was an important commitment that we honoured.  It is a commitment congress viewed as a critical element for the emerging talks.  It stated that to us last year and again in February and we honoured that commitment.  I understand a number of special conferences, including on the trade union side, will be held in the next few weeks, in approximately ten days time, to enable the parties to debate and improve their negotiations stance.  It is therefore likely that the pay talks will commence shortly thereafter.  I gave up guessing when they would finish years ago.  As Deputy Gilmore will be aware, that has been a prophecy that has not worked too easily.  Sometimes the social partners surprise one and the talks finish fairly quickly but on the last occasion, the target date was overshot by several months.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise a question concerning companies that made good profits here during the years, that drew down substantial grants from State, that are now relocating elsewhere because of high business costs, taxes and levies imposed by the Government over many years and are effectively throwing their workers on the scrap heap.  What action is the Government taking to fight for proper redundancy packages for those workers and to ensure those companies contribute towards the retraining of those workers? The behaviour of such companies is deplorable.  They have a duty to contribute to retraining programmes for those workers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Whenever a company closure occurs the State agencies, namely, Enterprise Ireland, F&Aacute;S and others, under the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment actively work and usually move to put in place a taskforce strategy to assist redundant workers or <Col N="419"/>workers who will lose their jobs.  Companies have obligations and it is true that on many occasions it is left to the State to operate training programmes mainly under F&Aacute;S.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy mentioned grants given to such companies by Enterprise Ireland or the IDA.  Thankfully, not that many companies renege on any of the commitments under this area, but negotiations are always entered into with IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland depending on from where the grant was allocated to make sure that the company concerned does not simply use a grant period or a tax period and then abandon the country.  Great care is taken by the statutory agencies to guard against that.  If the Deputy has a particular example, I suggest he put the case to the Minister, Deputy Martin, as the agencies under his control are usually diligent about making people honour their commitments.</P>

Seventeen Bills are included in this section of the legislative programme.  The Taoiseach answered a question from Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in on the health (long-term residential care services) Bill, which was to be put through by the Minister for Health and Children before Christmas.  I am not sure of the scale or nature of the problem with this legislation so far as its constitutionality or whatever is concerned.

	<P Just="Left">I seek clarification of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response to Deputy Kenny regarding the health (long-term residential care services) Bill.  It was indicated in the spring programme that this Bill would be published during the last session, but we are now told it will be published during the summer session.  As the Taoiseach has said on many occasions, the parliamentary session runs until the first day of the next term.  In the case of the summer session, this means the end of September.  Will the Taoiseach tell us with certainty that we will deal substantively with this legislation in the House before the summer recess?</P>
        <P>The new legislative programme includes, under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children, the eligibility for health and personal social services Bill and the nurses and midwives Bill, both of which have been promised repeatedly and in respect of which recurrent delays have arisen.  The nurses and midwives Bill was included in the previous programme for publication at the start of this year.  Now, however, we are told it has been put back another 12 months.  This is an incredible situation.  What has gone wrong in the Department of Health and Children that legislation is being continually held back and deferred?  These serious matters require address.</P>
        <P>It has been reported that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is considering a change in legislation to accommodate vending machines in betting offices throughout the State.  Regardless of whether this is the case, will the Taoiseach avail of this opportunity to scotch absolutely any such idea or notion given that such a development would represent a further deepening of the already serious gambling crisis that exists in this State?</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already stated that the health (long-term residential care services) Bill is intended to be published in this session.  The eligibility for health and personal social services Bill and the nurses and midwives Bill are both listed for 2009.  The reason for the delay in the latter is the public consultation process that took place between 30 November 2007 and the end of February 2008.  More than 200 submissions were received and are being examined.  It is expected the heads of the Bill will not be drafted until after the summer.  That legislation will not be brought forward until 2009.</P>

This identified the need to amend existing legislation to provide for public participation.  This relates to the need to sign the Aarhus Convention and implement the EU public participation directive.</P>
        <P>Many important projects are in the pipeline, including, for example, wind energy projects.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government indicated previously that such projects would not be granted until the relevant legislation is amended.

	<P>I welcome the international conference on the banning of cluster munitions that is to take place in this country.  On the last occasion, when the Ottawa Convention that banned landmines was being prepared, the Government prepared a valuable statutory instrument that influenced the conference.  On this occasion, does the Government intend to prepare a statutory instrument on the banning of cluster munitions?  I asked that question previously.  Such an instrument would guide the outcome of the international conference in Croke Park, in which many nations will take part.</P>

        <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>It is illustrative to note that only four Members did not want us to discuss this Bill, which I am delighted to introduce on behalf of the Government, despite the efforts of Sinn F&eacute;in to prevent us from doing so.  It is designed to pave the way for the ratification by Ireland of the EU reform treaty.  The discussion of the Bill by the Oireachtas represents an important phase in our national debate on the treaty, which will be put to a referendum in June.  The reform treaty is important for Ireland and Europe and it is a logical step for the European Union in a world of increasing globalisation.  Ratification of this treaty is a logical step for Irish men and women who want to express their faith in a political project that has, in the past 35 years, changed our nation for the better.</P>
        <P>Through the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, the Government is seeking the people&rsquo;s approval of the reform treaty.  In the period between now and the day of the referendum, the Government will highlight the many positive reasons we ought to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  We will not browbeat anyone or engage in scare tactics, nor will we make outlandish claims about the treaty.</P><Col N="428"/>
        <P>I sincerely believe it would be a profound mistake for us to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Such an outcome would cause great uncertainty within the Union.  It would damage the Union and cast doubt on our collective ability to face up to the new challenges confronting our Continent.  It would be seen as a victory for those across Europe who have never liked the EU way of doing business through the painstaking pursuit of agreement that can serve our shared interests as Europeans.  Failure to ratify the treaty would be especially damaging to smaller countries like Ireland, which derive particular benefit from the level playing field provided by agreed EU arrangements.  Most crucially, a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote would be damaging to Ireland.  It would damage our standing as a committed participant in the evolution of the Union.</P>
        <P>Contrary to what is being suggested by opponents, the treaty does not contain any threat to our vital national interests.  The outcome of the negotiations saw us safeguard those interests.  In areas such as corporate taxation, security and defence, and equality of member states, we fully secured our national priorities.</P>
        <P>All sectors of society are directly affected by our membership of the European Union and will be affected by the result of the upcoming referendum.  This is not a trivial decision to be taken lightly, but a defining moment in our European involvement.  It is therefore vital that this debate extend far and wide.  It should not be confined to the Oireachtas, nor should it be restricted to newspaper columns and television studios.  It should traverse the country and engage pensioners, students and all those in between.  In this regard, I welcome the public meetings being organised by the National Forum on Europe, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs and other organisations.  I also welcome the establishment of the Referendum Commission, which has its own independent role to play.</P>
        <P>The Government is also playing its part.  We have published balanced, factual information and a comprehensive White Paper was published today.  An objective information guide is to be sent to every household in the country in the coming weeks.  All this information, as well as the text of the treaty, in both Irish and English, is already available on a dedicated website.  Copies of the reform treaty and a consolidated version of the EU treaties as amended by the reform treaty are available in every library in the country.</P>
        <P>The reform treaty is not a radical document.  It does not herald major change but, when implemented, it will represent solid progress.  It represents a carefully constructed set of amendments to the existing EU treaties, which have served Ireland and Europe so well for so many years.  Previous treaties have heralded much greater change.  Our accession treaty in 1972 paved the way for us to join the Union after decades of isolation and underdevelopment.  The Single European Act gave us the Single Market, enabling Irish business to grow and create employment.  The Maastricht treaty provided for common foreign and security policy and economic and monetary union.  The latter resulted in the launch of the euro, which has brought real benefit to Irish people.  The Amsterdam treaty increased EU co-operation in the area of freedom, justice and security, which is crucial to the fight against the growing threat of cross-border crime.  The Nice treaty afforded us the historic chance to end the division of Europe and the chance for our European neighbours to put behind them the totalitarian nightmare they had endured since 1945.</P>
        <P>All these developments were good for Ireland and Europe.  Ratification of the reform treaty will allow for continued engagement by Ireland at the centre of European affairs as part of a Union in which the rule of law and the rights of individuals are central values.</P>
        <P>I could set out today to take on one by one the numerous misconceptions and misrepresentations that opponents of the treaty have been circulating but I will not do so.  The Government and those who support the treaty have been challenging these misrepresentations and will <Col N="429"/>continue to do so as the referendum campaign develops.  I could also set out today to explain why the judgment of those who opposed every treaty to date should again not be trusted.  I could also take time to tackle the confused, imported arguments of the eurosceptical right wing, which views our referendum as a battleground upon which to advance its negative assessment of European integration, but instead I will explain to the House why the reform treaty is worthy of support and why the Government remains completely committed to the European Union.  I will also explain why the Government is advocating that the people of Ireland, of all parties and none, maintain their trust in a project that has delivered peace and prosperity to Europe, including Ireland.</P>
        <P>Ireland has been a success in the Union.  It can be argued that we have benefited more dramatically than any other country from EU membership.  Our membership has been a force for progress, jobs and national development.  It has given us a forum within which to make our voice heard on issues of international peace and security.  Vitally, it has allowed us to build a home for today&rsquo;s and future generations, which is surely a most basic measure of our national sovereignty.</P>
        <P>There are policy areas and sectors where painful change has been required but this change would almost inevitably have been required even if we had never joined the Union.  The overwhelming balance of evidence tells us that Union membership has been the central dynamic for growth and development in many spheres.  Economically our national income per head has grown from less than 60% of the European average to a point today where it is well above the average.  Such growth has been underpinned by membership of the Union, which has allowed us to act as a gateway to the European market for multinational companies.</P>
        <P>In 1972, as we were joining the Union, foreign direct investment was just &euro;16 million.  Today it is measured in billions of euro.  Overall, the number of people employed in Ireland has doubled from 1 million in 1973 to 2 million today.  No longer is it inevitable that Irish parents see their children depart for foreign shores in search of employment.  This represents another basic measure of our increased national sovereignty.</P>
        <P>Those who claim that EU membership has curtailed our sovereignty should bear in mind that it has enhanced in a real and meaningful manner our national well-being and our capacity to further the interests of our people.</P>
        <P>The direct financial support we have received, and continue to receive, from the Structural and Cohesion Funds has laid the foundations for many of the major infrastructural developments throughout the State.  The Common Agricultural Policy has allowed the farming sector and our rural communities to develop and sustain themselves in a manner that previous generations could only have dreamt of.  We have also witnessed improved policies and standards in a range of areas such as consumer rights, environmental protection and the promotion of gender equality and workers&rsquo; rights.</P>
        <P>The reform treaty will not change the basic realities of today&rsquo;s Union, which has allowed Ireland to make these giant leaps forward.  However, the global context in which the Union operates is changing all the time.  The reform treaty will allow Ireland and the Union to adapt more effectively to these changing circumstances.</P>
        <P>For the next decade Europe will not have the luxury of focusing mainly on ourselves.  We will have to concentrate more on our relations with the world beyond the Union.  Climate change, the global economic downturn, immigration, demographic changes and the problems facing the developing world present significant worldwide challenges.  We cannot exempt ourselves from these challenges.  How these are dealt with will shape our future.  It is only right that we should want to be part of the solution.  Indeed, it is in our national interest to do so.  We can do this best through Europe.  We cannot do it alone.  No single country can.  This is <Col N="430"/>why the continued development of the EU is so vital.  In today&rsquo;s world, there is strength in numbers.  As part of a grouping with a population of 500 million, the EU can make a difference in world affairs.  Through the EU, Ireland can make its own distinctive impact.</P>
        <P>Europe is already demonstrating that we can make a difference beyond our borders.  On climate change Europe is leading a difficult and challenging global debate.  On development assistance we are the world&rsquo;s largest donors to the world&rsquo;s poorest people.  On human rights we are working to end the culture of impunity that has existed for far too long.  Without Europe&rsquo;s dogged and sometimes unpopular insistence, the International Criminal Court, for example, would not have come about.</P>
        <P>Naturally, we have a selfish interest in making commitments beyond our borders.  We know that even an entity as big as the EU cannot live apart from those forces shaping the wider world.</P>
        <P>We also have a profound interest in creating a fairer and better world.  Countries like ours which have been fortunate enough to live in peace for a long time can make an important contribution to peace in the wider world.</P>
        <P>We are told that the success of the Union leads to difficulty in creating a compelling narrative for the Union&rsquo;s future evolution.  However, more than half of the EU&rsquo;s member states were dictatorships well within living memory.  For instance, the President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, grew up under a military regime in Portugal, a place we now associate with holidays and skilful footballers.  Such regimes are unthinkable in today&rsquo;s Europe.  The EU deserves credit for this impressive triumph of democratic values across our Continent.  The conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s provide proof that Europe&rsquo;s fraught political past is not so distant after all.</P>
        <P>The Bill before the House, which proposes that Article 29.4 of the Constitution be amended, deals with the essence of the reform treaty.  It is relatively short legislation.  However, for Ireland and Europe, it is vital legislation.  It contains a number of important points which merit explaining, particularly in light of some of the misunderstanding and misrepresentation that is being promulgated.</P>
        <P>The substance of the proposed amendment is set out in the Schedule, containing what will be subsections 10&deg; to 15&deg; of Article 29.4 of the Constitution.  The proposed subsection 10&deg; provides that the State may ratify the reform treaty and be a member of the European Union provided for in the treaty.</P>
        <P>The proposed new subsection 11&deg; of the Article has essentially been in place since our accession to the EU 35 years ago.  It will ensure legal compatibility between the reform treaty and Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  It carries forward the concept of constitutional cover for laws, Acts and measures &ldquo;necessitated&rdquo; by the obligations of our EU membership.</P>
        <P>Some opponents of the treaty have been speaking in alarmist terms about this.  It is suggested that, suddenly, EU law will be superior to Irish law.  In language similar to that of parties and newspapers across the water that want to put the EU out of business, these opponents are suggesting that this treaty will put the Irish Constitution out of business.  They are wrong.  This constitutional provision is not new.  It is as old as our membership of the Union.  The wording reflects the principle of the primacy of European law, well established by the Court of Justice in Luxembourg prior to Ireland&rsquo;s accession to the European Communities.</P>
        <P>The EU principle of primacy reflects the general principle of international law, recognised since 1937 by Article 29.3 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, that States must comply with international legal obligations freely undertaken by them in the exercise of their sovereignty.  The practical effect of the principle of primacy is that it offers certainty and clarity regarding the relationship <Col N="431"/>between the Union&rsquo;s laws and those of member states.  It applies only in those areas where the member states have conferred powers on the Union.</P>
        <P>This principle of conferral is an important element which is helpfully highlighted and clarified in the reform treaty.  It makes it clear that the Union does not have powers of its own.  Its powers derive from sovereign decisions by the member states to give the Union certain powers.  These powers are carefully set out in the EU treaties.</P>
        <P>Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann will continue to be the basic legal document of the State and will continue to determine, in the final instance, the precise relationship between Irish and EU law.  The ultimate locus of sovereignty will continue to reside with the member states rather than the Union.</P>
        <P>The new subsection 12&deg; reflects similar subsections introduced to facilitate ratification of the Amsterdam and Nice treaties.  It allows the State to avail of certain options and discretions provided for in the EU treaties, most notably to allow us to utilise the special arrangements Ireland has negotiated with respect to justice and home affairs issues, which the reform treaty refers to as the &ldquo;Area of Freedom, Security and Justice&rdquo;.  The Government may exercise these options and discretions having obtained the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>The new subsection 13&deg; makes specific provision for the possibility of withdrawing, in whole or in part, from the opt-out provided for in the Ireland-UK Protocol on the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice.  The subsection states that prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas would be a condition for such a withdrawal.  One of the most substantive areas of change between the constitutional treaty, agreed in 2004, and the reform treaty was the amendment of the protocol, which has existed since 1997.  It extends our existing arrangement with regard to visas, asylum, immigration and judicial co-operation in civil matters to judicial co-operation in criminal matters and to police co-operation.  This decision was taken because of the sensitive nature of co-operation in this area and particularly the fact that Ireland, like the UK, has a distinctive common law system of criminal justice which is different from the legal systems in place in the majority of our EU partners.  For this reason, Ireland decided to avail of an extension of these flexible arrangements first agreed in 1997.</P>
        <P>These arrangements mean that we will be able to choose, on a case-by-case basis, which criminal justice or police co-operation measures we will participate in.  We have clearly indicated in a declaration made during the intergovernmental conference that we will study how EU policy evolves in this area and review these arrangements within a period of three years.</P>
        <P>We have consistently and strongly supported practical EU anti-terrorism measures and concerted action against organised crime, and we will continue along those lines.  In that regard, Ireland has made a declaration, which is annexed to the final act adopting the reform treaty, stating our clear intention to participate to the maximum extent possible in relevant JHA proposals and particularly in police co-operation proposals.</P>
        <P>In the new subsection 14&deg;, the proposed legislation supplements the provisions of the treaty.  In doing so, it provides for an enhanced role for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It states that prior approval by the Houses would be a condition for action under a small number of treaty provisions, such as the so-called general <i>passerelle</i> clause.  Under this clause, the European Council can decide on a unanimous basis to extend the scope of qualified majority voting in the Council or co-decision between the Council and the European Parliament.</P>
        <P>The requirement to seek the positive endorsement of the Houses of the Oireachtas goes beyond what is required in the relevant treaty provisions themselves, which allow for a negative veto by any national parliament.  In other words, the legislation before us provides that in each of the cases specified in subsection 14&deg;, the Houses of the Oireachtas will have to give positive approval before action is taken.  Silence or inaction will not be enough.</P><Col N="432"/>
        <P>The new subsection 15&deg; carries forward the prohibition on Irish participation in an EU common defence.  The House will know that this was originally inserted in the Constitution by the people at the second referendum on the Treaty of Nice.  To avoid any possible doubt about the constitutional prohibition on Irish participation in an EU common defence, this subsection of the Bill refers to the relevant provision from the Nice and the reform treaties.</P>
        <P>There is currently no proposal for a common EU defence.  In any case, a change in Ireland&rsquo;s position can only come about if the Irish people decide so in a referendum. This is stated in black and white for all to see.  Repeated suggestions to the contrary are totally misleading and should be dismissed.  There is no reference to taxation in the Bill because the treaty leaves policy in this area entirely unaffected.  Taxation remains a member state competence.</P>
        <P>One of the changes introduced by the reform treaty is of particular relevance to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and, by extension, to the Irish electorate.  The treaty strengthens the role of national parliaments by giving them a direct input into EU legislation.  The provision whereby a sufficient number of national parliaments can object to a particular proposal is a genuine step forward.  It will enable national parliaments to ensure that the Union does not exceed its authority.  Under the treaty, national parliaments will also have the right to veto any proposal to change voting rules from unanimity to qualified majority voting in the European Council or Council of Ministers or to extend co-decision between the Council and the European Parliament.</P>
        <P>These new powers will promote democratic accountability within the Union.  They also have the potential to strengthen co-operation between parliaments, political parties and electorates across the Union.  In addition to strengthening the role of national parliaments, the treaty enhances the role of the directly elected European Parliament.  The European Parliament will see an increase in the number of areas in which it shares law making powers with the Council of Ministers.  When the Parliament was first directly elected in 1979 it had no legislative power.  The reform treaty increases co-decision to almost 100%.  The President of the Parliament, Mr. Pottering, will be able to attest to this when he addresses the Seanad next Tuesday.</P>
        <P>It is easy to criticise the Union&rsquo;s democratic structures, but they stand up well by any international standard.  Under the reform treaty they will get even better.  Practically all the legislation which is passed by the Council of Ministers, a body comprising representatives of 27 democratically elected governments, must also be passed by a democratically elected parliament.  Many people throughout the world would envy such accountability.</P>
        <P>In addition to the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament, the European Commission also makes a crucial contribution to the effective functioning of the Union.  Ireland has always been a supporter of a Commission that is strong and independent.  The Commission must maintain a broad perspective over which no member state has disproportionate influence.  In the Nice treaty in 2000, member states already agreed in principle to reduce the size of the Commission once the Union reached 27 countries.  This was done in the interests of efficiency.  It represented a recognition that there would be insufficient portfolios to go around and that the number of Commissioners could go on increasing.  The case is increasingly made that a large college of Commissioners is less likely to be effective and coherent.  An unwieldy, inefficient Commission would not be in Ireland&rsquo;s interests.</P>
        <P>The reform treaty reduces the size of the Commission in line with the agreement reached in Nice and endorsed by the people in the 2002 referendum.  Crucially, it guarantees complete equality of treatment among all member states, large and small.  Thus each member state will forego the right to nominate a Commissioner for one Commission out of three.  Ireland will do <Col N="433"/>this, as will Britain, Germany and all other states.  We are all being treated equally.  The House will recall that until 2004, the larger member states each had two Commissioners.</P>
        <P>The European Union has been carefully constructed to accommodate the different interests of its member states.  It is not a zero-sum game where a member state gets everything it wants.  If it was, it would cease to exist.  Despite the natural differences between member states, there is an underlying common interest not to repeat the past.  Instead, there is a shared determination to move forward together.  In negotiating the reform treaty, all 27 governments will have had this in mind.  Our accepted need for common European institutions comes from Europe&rsquo;s brutal history.  The establishment of these institutions required innovation and generosity, from which Ireland in particular has benefited.  Europe has over the decades shown a great capacity to reform these institutions as circumstances required.</P>
        <P>To listen to some of the criticism of the treaty, one might be led to believe that member states, particularly the smaller ones, abandoned their good sense and their national interests during the negotiations.  We did not.  We negotiated an outcome that we sincerely believe will serve Ireland&rsquo;s interests in the period ahead.  To listen to some of the criticism of the treaty one might be led to believe that the largest member states are throwing their weight about and are determined to run the Union for their own selfish purposes.  They are not and they will not.</P>
        <P>The same principles that applied when Ireland joined the Union in 1973 apply today.  It suits every country to live in a neighbourhood that is prosperous and at peace.  It suits every country to live in a neighbourhood where borders are not disputed and where people feel secure.  It suits every country to work toward a common decent standard of living for everybody in our European neighbourhood.  It is these principles that have contributed to the achievement of previously unknown levels of prosperity in Ireland and to the emergence of peace between the people of this island.  It is these principles which have allowed Ireland to work in close co-operation with Britain after centuries of difficulties.  These principles are not something written on paper which gets dusted down for occasions such as today&rsquo;s debate.  They have a real meaning in practice.</P>
        <P>For instance, anyone who attended the 2005 European Council will be aware that it was flexibility and generosity on the part of Chancellor Merkel which allowed agreement to be reached on the 2007-13 EU budget.  I dare say that Chancellor Merkel will elaborate on the meaning and importance of the Union to its largest member state when she makes a welcome visit here later this month.</P>
        <P>In deciding how to vote in the referendum, the Irish people should vote rationally and with their own interests at heart.  The choice we face is straightforward.  The changes brought about in the reform treaty, like the changes brought about in previous treaties, will make the Union operate more effectively.  The changes brought about in the reform treaty, like previous changes, reflect the changing circumstances in which the Union finds itself.</P>
        <P>The reform treaty will also settle the debate about the internal workings of the Union for the foreseeable future.  We will then be able to focus on the great issues of our time, economic management, climate change and peace and stability around the globe.  Despite suggestions to the contrary, for us to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the reform treaty would damage Europe&rsquo;s and our own interests.  To suggest that abandoning our positive attitude to the EU would win us negotiating space at tables in Brussels is unrealistic.  It remains for opponents of the treaty to explain how the balance of our national interest could possibly be served by a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  I do not believe they can do so.</P>
        <P>It is for the Irish electorate to identify where our nation&rsquo;s interests lie.  I believe they will not allow rigid dogma, whether from the new right or the hard left, to prevail over common sense.  Instead, they should see the reform treaty as the next step on what has been an exceptionally <Col N="434"/>positive national journey.  Voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the referendum will generate political goodwill, a precious resource on which Ireland can draw in the future.  Voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the referendum will confirm that we maintain our faith in an international order based on solidarity, international co-operation and equality between member states.  Voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in the referendum will confirm in the eyes of the international political and economic community that we continue to keep both our feet firmly in Europe, with our eyes fixed squarely on continued economic prosperity and social progress.  That is why the Government believes the reform treaty should be ratified.</P>

	<P>I will share my time with Deputy Lucinda Creighton.</P>
        <P>The Lisbon treaty has undergone a long period of gestation.  Its origins began with the Convention on the Future of Europe and it involved debate and discussion over several years.  The convention took on board the views of many people before it formulated its proposal for the EU constitution.  We now know that this constitution was not passed by the popular vote in France and the Netherlands, and thus the concept was put on hold as consideration was given to what the next step should be.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the constitution was to consolidate the existing treaties and streamline the decision-making process for a membership of 27.  What is often forgotten is that 19 countries ratified the constitution, three of them &mdash; Spain, Luxembourg and Romania &mdash; by referendum, with 77% voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in Spain, albeit with a low turnout of 43%.  At the European Council meeting of June 2007, it was decided to start negotiations on a replacement treaty, which culminated in the signing of the Lisbon treaty, referred to by some as the reform treaty, in December 2007.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In order for the Lisbon treaty to come into effect, it must be ratified by all 27 member states, with the intention that the process will be completed by 1 January 2009, when the treaty will come into effect.  It appears that Ireland alone will hold a referendum on the matter.  This will lead to additional focus being placed on us not just from the 500 million in the EU, but also from the other power blocks.  The figure of 500 million is significant when compared to 4 million, but not so much when compared to China&rsquo;s 1.4 billion, a country with one fifth of the world&rsquo;s population and which now uses half of the world&rsquo;s cement and one third of its steel.  This is the challenge that the European Union faces as the global becomes local.</P>
        <P>Many people who will vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; will do so for idealistic reasons, perhaps motivated by the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and others will vote for economic reasons.  Since 1973, Ireland has received about &euro;60 billion from the EU budget and has made contributions of &euro;19.5 billion in the same period.  Some will vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; for a combination of these reasons.  Some will vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; for idealistic reasons and one has to respect that.  However, the most important thing is that people have as much information as possible to make an informed decision and vote in a certain manner for the right reasons.</P>
        <P>Traditionally, Irish people have voted in a pragmatic manner but the decreasing turnout certainly gives one food for thought as the comfort zone creates a certain disengagement.  This can create a fertile environment for &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaigners who can oppose a policy from opposite ends of the spectrum.  Strangely, very few are opposed to the general principles of the European project.  Indeed some &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaigners talk about how good Europe has been.  Alas, this treaty is the one that will cause the difficulty.  It is difficult to go back and establish which treaty might have been supported in the past by those advocates of a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote, albeit they recognise the good that Europe is doing.</P><Col N="435"/>
        <P>The same arguments are made time and again.  Our neutrality is akin to the cat with the nine lives &mdash; it being lost on each occasion that we passed an EU treaty.  Our neutrality must have many graves stretching from Rome to Maastricht to Nice.  I would like to be in a position to say that our concept of neutrality has ceased and that we are full participants in the common foreign and security policy but this is not so.  If something is worth being a member of, it is worth protecting.  Where we can assist in dealing with evil and oppression, we should do so and follow our own sovereign decision.  In recent weeks, there has been much criticism of China&rsquo;s role in the Tibet Autonomous Region and yet that country, as a member of the UN Security Council, can decide our foreign policy, as can any other permanent members if certain circumstances arise.  The comfort blanket of the UN can dictate our sovereignty in some decision making on foreign policy, while the European Union, strangely, cannot.  This is paradoxical.  I also believe that the majority of Irish people would favour our participation in the common foreign and security policy if they were afforded the opportunity to voice their opinion on it.  Hopefully, they will get that opportunity in the not too distant future.</P>
        <P>Support for membership of the European Union is high in this country.  A recent EU barometer showed that this support is at 74%, with recognition by 87% of the people that we have benefited from Europe in the past.  However, there is also concern that six out of ten people believe that their voice is not heard in Europe.  Many see Europe as being out of reach and this presents a challenge to us to try to bridge this divide.  If we took responsibility for some hard decisions rather than seeking to blame Brussels, we could assist in this regard.</P>
        <P>Right around the world, we witness unrest such as that in the Middle East, conflict in South America and human rights difficulties in China.  When this is contrasted with the peace that exists within the European Union, we are starkly reminded of one of the main reasons the Union was established.  It is difficult for the generation of today to visualise that Europe was the cockpit of two world wars.</P>
        <P>The referendum campaign will throw up many issues, some of which are factual and some of which are not.  To date, much misinformation has been put into circulation and while one has to deal with this, the detail of the treaty and what it does must be outlined.  The reform treaty will provide for a more effective Union over a number of areas and will permit the Union to develop in a positive manner.</P>
        <P>I will now move on to aspects of the treaty itself because, as I have outlined, it is very important that people know what it proposes to do.  With respect to institutional provisions, it proposes many changes, such as a new full-time president elected for a renewable term of two and a half years.  This concept aims to improve the coherence of the Council.  The presidency of the Council of Ministers will held by blocs of three with one lead country.  Ireland will be grouped with Greece and Lithuania.  Again, this aims to improve the coherence of the Council.  There will be a new voting arrangement called the double majority system where 55% of the states and 65% of the population will be required.  This replaces the cumbersome method used at the moment which is based on a certain allocation of votes per country.  Where the Council is acting other than on a proposal from the European Commission, 72% of member states will be required.</P>
        <P>As outlined by the Minister, the size of the Commission will be reduced from 2014, with a maximum cap of two thirds of members.  This was agreed to in principle in the Nice II treaty.  The detail of it was not adhered to so this is something that has been decided in the past.  In real terms, in respect of the concept of Commission cake time, we will be in a healthier position than we were prior to 2004 where the five larger countries had two Commissioners each and the remainder had one.  We will be on a par with others, as we have been since 2004.</P><Col N="436"/>
        <P>There will be a high representative for foreign affairs and security policy combining the current High Representative for Common and Foreign Security Policy and the Commissioner for External Relations.  This appointment will also represent the Vice President of the Commission.  This is to enhance the co-ordination of EU activity in respect of third countries and improve the EU&rsquo;s visibility in external relations and support the person who will answer the phone to Mr. Kissinger.  The European Parliament will be capped at 751.  The role of the Parliament is enhanced by extending areas of co-decision with the Council of Ministers.</P>
        <P>There will be an increased role for national parliaments.  The Commission is obliged to give them at least eight weeks advance notice of legislative proposals.  Each national parliament will be given two votes.  In Ireland, the D&aacute;il will have one and the Seanad will have one.  There will be 54 votes in total.  National parliaments or houses can vote to issue a reasoned opinion on whether a Commission proposal respects subsidiarity &mdash; the principle that the EU does not take action in areas of shared competence unless it is more effective than action taken at national, regional or local level.  If at least 18 votes out of the 54 are issued, the Commission&rsquo;s draft must be reviewed.</P>
        <P>In the case of judicial co-operation in criminal matters and police co-operation, the threshold is 13.  The two measures mentioned earlier make up what is known as the yellow card system.  However, the Commission is not obliged to amend or reject the proposal but if it maintains it, it will have to justify it in a reasoned opinion.  If a majority of national parliaments oppose a Commission proposal as a breach of subsidiarity and the Council or European Parliament agree with them, the proposal can be struck down.  This is known as the orange card system.  National parliaments are to be kept informed of evaluations of the member states of the Union policies in the justice and home affairs area, the work of a standing committee on co-operation on internal security and the evaluation of the activities of Eurojust and Europol.</P>
        <P>A new treaty article will state that the Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights as we incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the treaty.  The treaty will confer legally binding treaty status on this charter, which was only a political declaration when agreed in 2000.  This is very welcome.  This charter consists of 54 articles, divided into seven sections, covering a diverse range of rights, for example, the right to life and respect for private and family life.  It applies to the Union&rsquo;s institutions and to member states in their implementation of EU law.  Nothing in the charter is to be interpreted as restricting or adversely affecting human rights as recognised by, for example, the member states&rsquo; constitutions.</P>
        <P>In the area of justice and home affairs, the European Union defines itself as an area of freedom, security and justice.  Where people move freely across borders, police and judicial co-operation is required to protect people from terrorism and serious crime.  Under the existing treaties, the EU can already act in the areas of police co-operation and judicial co-operation on criminal matters but using inter-governmental co-operation methods with a limited role of the Parliament and Court of Justice, rather than the normal &ldquo;Community method&rdquo;.   The new treaty will enhance the EU&rsquo;s effectiveness in fields where it has already been active, for example, external border control, visas, asylum and immigration.  The new treaty will extend the EU&rsquo;s field of action in the fight against serious cross-border crime, police co-operation, mutual recognition of decisions by courts and judges and the creation of an EU public prosecutor with functions in defined areas.  Majority voting will now become the norm in this area but unanimity is retained for some matters, such as family law.</P>
        <P>In the area of judicial co-operation in criminal matters, there will be an &ldquo;emergency brake&rdquo;.  A member state can refer a proposal to the European Council if it is concerned that it would <Col N="437"/>affect fundamental aspects of its legal system.  If there is no unanimous agreement at European Council, a group of not less than one third of member states may proceed among themselves after four months but this is not binding on other states.  Ireland has availed of an opt-out in regard to judicial co-operation in criminal matters and police co-operation.  In a separate declaration, Ireland has indicated its intention to opt in to the maximum extent possible and to review this measure within three years of the treaty&rsquo;s adoption.  Fine Gael opposed this policy decision.  However, we acknowledge the existence of the declaration and we hope that the opt-in will be availed of in the not too distant future.</P>
        <P>The treaty provides for little overall change in the Union&rsquo;s competences in policy areas.  It sets out some basis principles.  Regarding conferral, the Union only has those powers explicitly conferred on it.  All other powers remain with member states, which is important to remember.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding subsidiarity, the Union shall only act in so far as the objective in question cannot be sufficiently achieved at member state level.  In respect of proportionality, the Union shall only act to the extent necessary to achieve the objective in question.  I cannot see how anybody could argue with any of those points.  The Union is conferred with a single legal personality.  Competences in different policy areas will be grouped by category.  The Union will have exclusive competence in areas such as competition rules for the Internal Market and monetary policy for euro currency states.</P>
        <P>Regarding shared competences, member states can take action if the EU does not, for example, in energy policy, environment and consumer protection.  There is the concept of a supporting role where competence lies with member states but the Union has a supporting role, for example, in health and education.  Unanimity is retained in taxation and defence.  There are new areas of competence dealing with cross-border threats to health, energy security, sport, humanitarian assistance, space policy and climate change, which are all very desirable.</P>
        <P>Enhanced co-operation will require at least nine member states, which is one third of member states.  This would need to be open, then and later, to all member states.  When relating to internal EU matters, external economic relations and humanitarian aid, it would need to be backed by the Commission, approved by the Council and accepted by the European Parliament.</P>
        <P>Common foreign and security policy will need to be unanimously approved by the Council.  Decisions in common foreign and security policy would in general continue to be made by unanimity.  However, there will be two exceptions.  The treaty provides for the possibility of QMV where a particular decision relates to a policy previously decided at summit level or alternatively to details of implementation.  However, even in these cases, a member state could, for vital and stated reasons of national policy, veto any resort to decision by QMV.  There is a general clause, under which the European Council could decide unanimously to transfer decisions from unanimity to the QMV category in any common foreign and security policy domain, other than military and defence aspects.</P>
        <P>I wish to deal with the concept of structured co-operation, whereby member states with bigger military capabilities could come together.  Only member states taking part in this arrangement will be permitted to debate and vote.  Member states are bound to support the Union&rsquo;s common foreign and security policy.  Regarding common defence, when the EU unanimously decides, it will be up to Ireland to decide what arrangement or participation we will have and if we participate in common defence, a referendum will be required.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope we will get an opportunity to deal with details of the Bill on Committee Stage.  There are many other aspects with regard to foreign direct investment, which I hope speakers from <Col N="438"/>this side of the House will address.  On Committee Stage we will raise some issues with respect to what will become subsections 13&deg; and 14&deg; of Article 29 of the Constitution.  It may be unnecessary to include them as we believe the authority already exists in the Constitution given that we have signed up to the treaty.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael wholeheartedly supports the Bill.  We compliment the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche, on the work they have carried out in the past on the EU constitution.  We on this side of the House will give any assistance we can over the coming months.  It is in our interest and the country&rsquo;s interest that we all support this referendum.</P>

	<P>I and my party, Fine Gael, are proud to support the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  We support it because the Lisbon treaty is good for the nation and it is good for the people.  It would certainly serve Fine Gael&rsquo;s short-term political interests to oppose the Bill proposed by and negotiated by the Government.  However, we are putting the potential for short-term political opportunism aside in order to put the national interest first.  We believe it is in the interest of the people to secure a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote and Fine Gael will be playing its part in convincing the people that this is the case.</P>
        <P>It is important to put the treaty in context.  Let us cast our minds back to Ireland before we joined the European Union or European Economic Community as it was in 1973.  In the period between Ireland&rsquo;s gaining independence and our joining the EEC, we became a closed, inward looking, insular nation.  We were a nation that had thrown off a major colonial power in this country and our natural response was to draw into ourselves and shut the door behind us.  We ourselves, sinn f&eacute;in ironically, characterised the Ireland of the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s.  At that time, however, we had in reality no meaningful economic independence whatsoever.  We were absolutely dependent on the United Kingdom as our dominant export market.  Our economic policy was purely dependent on that of the UK.  When sterling was devalued, there was no option open to the Government other than to follow suit and the Irish punt would automatically be devalued within hours.  Clearly, if England sneezed, Ireland caught the cold.</P>
        <P>Our insular economic policies and our absolute dependency on the UK led to the type of economy that can barely be imagined today and has not been experienced by most of my generation.  We had enormous rates of unemployment.  We experienced depression in the extreme.  There was no growth, high emigration and a very depressing and bleak picture for the future.  Then we joined the EEC and things began to change dramatically and quite rapidly.  The EU and in particular the Common Market has provided a framework through which Irish business has thrived.  Ireland has managed to gain confidence and independence by accessing new markets.  The EU has opened up enormous opportunities for Ireland to thrive.  The new markets opened up to us have seen the Irish economy benefit beyond any expectation we might have had on joining the EEC.</P>
        <P>Ireland has been a beneficiary of European funds since our accession to the EEC.  Receipts from the EU budget during that period amount to a staggering &euro;58 billion in total, or 3.3% of our GDP.  We have received billions of euro in Structural Funds, which built roads and railways that have contributed to our prosperity.  While there have been frustrations, dealing with the bureaucracy, red tape and some of the stringent requirements of the EU system, overall it has benefited the country beyond all belief.</P><Col N="439"/>
        <P>What will this particular treaty achieve that will be so significant?  Many people are asking whether the treaty is really necessary.  Previous treaties focused on clear and crucial initiatives of the EU.  At first it was dealing with the Single Market.  As it progressed, it dealt with the common currency, the euro.  More recently we voted for the Nice treaty to support the enlargement of the European Union, allowing 12 new member states from the eastern bloc to join the EU and benefit from it in the same way as we have done.  We now face a new juncture in the development of the European Union.  We face new challenges and the Lisbon reform treaty is designed to assist Ireland and other member states in facing up to these challenges.</P>
        <P>These challenges are numerous.  They are the challenges that affect each and every citizen of this country.  Anybody who believes this referendum, this Bill or Europe is not relevant to their lives should think again because they are simply wrong.  The challenges that face us are relevant to every citizen.  They include the challenge of global warming and climate change, the threat to energy security in Ireland and the rest of Europe, the challenges associated with Third World hunger and peacekeeping and peace-enforcement missions in our neighbouring regions.</P>
        <P>Critically, the treaty also addresses perhaps the greatest threat to the Irish people, that of the global economic downturn and the prospect of job losses in this country. The Lisbon treaty focuses on making Europe more competitive and on the completion of the Single Market, with the prospect of greater economic security for all of us in the context of our place in Europe in the future.</P>
        <P>While the treaty proposes many important changes in tackling those challenges and in dealing with the functioning of the European Union, it does not, as Deputy Timmins outlined, interfere in any substantial way with how power is divided within the European Union and its member states or with the substantial powers that are already vested in the European Union. Very importantly, this treaty proposes institutional changes which will deal with some of the problems that have been associated with the EU for some time.  It will improve the role of democracy by strengthening national parliaments and the European Parliament and by enhancing the role of MEPs.  It will downsize the Commission to make it work more efficiently and to make it less unwieldy.  It will also create a permanent figurehead and Chair of the European Council who can ensure that there is consistency in the work of the European Presidencies.  These changes are good for Europe and particularly for Ireland.</P>
        <P>The detractors from this treaty, from the extreme left and right, are the same people who opposed our accession to the EEC in 1973.  At that time those same people warned of a real doomsday scenario.  They claimed we would have our sovereignty negated, that we would become subsumed into a giant European super state and that the children of Ireland would be conscripted to a massive war-mongering army.  The &ldquo;anti&rdquo; campaigners never referred to the huge export markets that would open up to us, nor to the confidence and self-sufficiency that membership of the European Union would lead to in this country.  They never mentioned how the Union would enhance equality and workers&rsquo; rights, while strengthening competition and ending monopolies.  They never acknowledged the peace and prosperity that would come from our membership of the EU.  Fine Gael did so at that time and continues to do so.</P>
        <P>Today, the same people are proffering the same old, tired and discredited arguments.  They are peddling the same old misinformation and it is time that this propaganda be exposed for what it is. Let us look at the myth being put forward, that Ireland will become part of a militarised war-mongering Europe and that our neutrality will effectively become a thing of the past.  We heard this in 1972, prior to joining the EEC.  We heard it again in 1986, before the Single European Act.  We also heard it in relation to the Maastricht treaty in 1992, the Amsterdam treaty in 1997, during the first Nice referendum campaign in 2001 and the second <Col N="440"/>successful Nice treaty campaign in 2002.  On every single occasion they have been wrong so why should we believe them now?</P>
        <P>It is time to listen to the facts rather than the scare-mongering spin, and here are some of the facts.  On the issue of neutrality, Ireland will retain its veto on all matters concerning European defence policy.  We cannot be forced into anything of which we do not want to be part.  The treaties will continue to recognise that EU policy &ldquo;shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States&rdquo;, a clear reference to Ireland.  The constitutional prohibition in this country on joining an EU common defence force remains in place.  The triple lock means that no Irish troops will be deployed without a UN mandate.  That position is very clear.  These three levels of protection from the treaty and the Constitution mean that no amount of spin from &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaigners can undermine the true facts of this scenario.</P>
        <P>I am not particularly interested in what we will not be able to do but am more interested in what the common foreign and security policy will enable us to do.  I am concerned about what we will be able to do through our membership of the EU.  Such a policy allows us to face the challenges of the 21st century in the knowledge that we are facing these challenges from a secure base at home and that we are facing them abroad with a capability that matches our moral position.  This is extremely important in the context of any negotiations we have with other major powers in the world.  We only have to cast our minds back to the invasion of Iraq when the European Union was so divided on that issue.</P>
        <P>The changes introduced by the Lisbon treaty will equip the European Union to undertake widely supported crisis management and peacekeeping tasks around the world and particularly in neighbouring regions.  The current UN-authorised EU mission to Chad, in which Ireland is playing a leading role, is a prime example of the European Union&rsquo;s activities in this area of common security policy.  The mission will provide security for the provision of humanitarian relief to hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced persons, many fleeing persecution in Darfur.  Surely that is a meritorious activity for Irish troops to be part of and I am proud of it.</P>
        <P>Other missions with Irish involvement have included police training in the Palestinian territories, monitoring a peace process between rebels and Government in Aceh, Indonesia and providing support to the police authorities in Bosnia.  There have been more than 20 such missions since 2003.  The European Union is receiving more and more requests for assistance and it must be in a position to react.  I would question the patriotism of those in this country who claim to be patriots while at the same time detracting from what our troops are doing abroad in terms of their fine peacekeeping and humanitarian work and criticising the common foreign and security policy of the European Union, which is simply trying to ensure that the security of our troops is safeguarded.</P>
        <P>The reform treaty also extends the EU&rsquo;s potential in terms of conflict prevention missions, post conflict missions and so on.  It introduces the idea of permanent structured co-operation, which has been totally misrepresented by certain factions.  This will enable our troops to ensure that when they are on a peacekeeping mission with French, Dutch or other European troops they are able to work with them.  It will ensure that they have equipment that is suitable and will be able to train in advance to ensure there is harmony between the troops from different member states.  I do not see how that could possibly be a bad thing.  It is in the interests of the security and safety of the good men and women who represent this country abroad.</P>
        <P>Another myth being propagated by the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side, particularly by the so-called pro-business elements of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side, is that this treaty will undermine business in this country.  I wonder where they have been for the past 35 years.</P>

	<P>By supporting this treaty, the Irish people will be enabling the European Union to take specific action which will benefit business interests in Ireland.  The treaty will ensure increased access for Irish business to European markets.  It will also ensure that Ireland will retain a veto in key areas for Irish business, such as taxation.  We must not be deluded or confused on this issue &mdash; we retain our veto on taxation.  The treaty will improve our ability to attract foreign direct investment and will increase access for Irish business to international markets.  It will lead to enhanced investment in research and development and an improvement in the European transport infrastructure.  Critically, it will also reduce Ireland&rsquo;s exposure in the area of energy security.  If the opponents of the treaty are seriously suggesting that such developments are bad for Irish business, then I throw up my hands in absolute desperation and exasperation.</P>
        <P>Overall the case for the Lisbon treaty is indisputable.  The EU has been and will continue to be good for Irish business and the Irish people.  Those of us supporting this Bill realise that we have the facts on our side.  The people who oppose this treaty do so on the basis of misinformation, misinterpretation and the concoction of some far-fetched tales.  By sticking to and promoting the facts it will become clear to the public that this treaty is in their interests.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>&ldquo;The Lisbon Treaty provides the Union with a stable and lasting institutional framework ... so that the Union will be able to fully concentrate on addressing the concrete challenges ahead, including globalisation and climate change.&rdquo;  That is a quotation from the European Union Council meeting on 14 December 2007, after the treaty had been signed.  I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche, and particularly the Taoiseach for the work he did on the constitutional treaty.  I agree with him that this treaty contains 90% of what was in that treaty, much of which was good material.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  Its publication has been long anticipated but the Government has kept it under wraps like the third secret of Fatima until quite recently.  However, many of the other elements of the referendum package remain under wraps.  There is still no sign of a consolidated text, annotated text or a complete text.  There is no sign of activity by the Referendum Commission, which was established on 6 March.  The commission will play a key role in disseminating information on the substance of the Lisbon treaty.  The commission is expected to operate for approximately 90 days before the referendum but four weeks have passed and its website remains blank.</P>
        <P>Until today there was no sign of the promised White Paper, which was anticipated before the publication of the Bill.  Presumably, the White Paper contains a substantial summary and analysis of the treaty.  I do not know because I have just received a copy and I have not had an opportunity to examine it carefully.  The White Paper is the Government&rsquo;s contribution in advance to informing the debate on particular legislation.  It should have been published well in advance of this debate.  This is most unsatisfactory.  The Taoiseach has hummed and hawed about the date for the referendum and we were kept in the dark until today.  After some prompting earlier, he finally and reluctantly announced the date.  We are glad this has happened but we still do not have the wording of the amendment.  Will the Minister of State consider publishing it?  People at the public meetings I have attended want to know the wording they will vote on.  We need to know the date and the wording.  These are simple matters and it is not rocket science to deal with matters of this nature.</P>
        <P>The Government has been in rag order since its accession nine months ago and nothing demonstrates this better than its dysfunctional approach to the preparations for this refer<Col N="442"/>endum.  The making of laws in Parliament requires care and professionalism but making an amendment to the Constitution requires absolute care and professionalism.  The citizens of Ireland who will vote in the referendum in approximately two months expect that the highest standards are observed in preparing and presenting it.  They deserve no less because our Constitution contains the values and principles which guide our lives and our society.  Alas, those high standards have not been met to date and time is running out.</P>
        <P>The Bill before us makes provision for the 28th amendment to the Constitution.  It seeks to amend Article 29 of the Constitution.  The text of the referendum Bill is understandably complex like the treaty itself.  I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs for their willingness to consult Opposition parties on finalising the text and I compliment the Labour Party&rsquo;s legal advisers on their constructive contribution over a period.  The aims we had regarding the text of the legislation have been achieved to a considerable extent.  Our aim was to have a wording that was as clear as possible and easy to read, that avoided unnecessary duplication of provisions and that included existing provisions while removing any unnecessary matter from Article 29.4.  Those aims were largely achieved and I appreciate the fact that the Government was prepared to consider all suggestions in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I particularly welcome that the wording avoids duplication and removes unnecessary material by deleting Articles 29.4.97&deg; and 29.4.11&deg;.  Article 29.4.9&deg;, which relates to defence, will be replaced in the new wording while Article 29.4.11&deg; on the patents convention is obsolete and will be removed.  The wording of the new Article 29.4.10&deg; reflects the continuity between the existing European Union and the Union post-Lisbon and the layout of the amendment is readable, particularly given the complexity of the matters involved, especially Article 29.4.14&deg;.  The parliamentary approval process contained in Articles 29.4.12&deg; to 14&deg;, inclusive, reflects a proposal made by the Labour Party during the drafting of the Amsterdam treaty to ensure full democratic scrutiny of the exercise of the EU options.</P>
        <P>Article 29 has been amended to incorporate the Treaty of Rome 1957, the Single European Act 1986, the Treaty on European Union, signed at Maastricht in 1992, the Treaty of Amsterdam 1997 and the Treaty of Nice 2002.  These treaties established the original European Economic Community &mdash; the forerunner of the European Union &mdash; in 1957 and moulded it progressively to its current structure of the European Union half a century later.  Each of the five treaties was voted on by the people in successive referenda.  On each occasion the treaties were ratified.  The Treaty of Lisbon is the latest in a line of treaties to come before us for ratification.  If Ireland or any other of the 27 member states rejects the treaty, it cannot come into force.  Since Ireland is the only member state to require ratification by referendum, the ratification process is fraught with difficulties and, therefore, requires the greatest of care.</P>
        <P>The phoney war is over and the formal debate has begun in the Oireachtas.  Both the National Forum on Europe and the Joint Committee on European Affairs will take the debate to the people throughout the length and breadth of Ireland, which is most welcome.  The Labour Party is also taking the referendum very seriously.  We debated the substance of the Lisbon reform treaty at our annual conference in November 2007 in Wexford and voted overwhelmingly to campaign for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  We have produced high quality literature to inform our members and to inform the public and we are holding a series of public meetings in the main urban centres in Ireland.</P>
        <P>When the campaign begins next month, we will treat the referendum like an election and ensure all the units of the Labour Party are involved in canvassing the electorate and in ensuring that our members and supporters deliver a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  Ireland&rsquo;s interests are best served in Europe.  An island country on the periphery of Europe cannot afford to be isolated in terms <Col N="443"/>of society, culture or the economy.  Those who oppose the Lisbon reform treaty must not only demonstrate it is bad for Ireland but also that the Treaty of Rome, the Single European Act, the Treaty of Maastricht, the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Treaty of Nice were also bad for Ireland because these are the pillars on which the new edifice is built.</P>
        <P>The same people who opposed the earlier treaties are using the same arguments they used during each treaty debate to assert that particular treaty would be the one that finally broke the camel&rsquo;s back.  The Lisbon treaty is the end game, the doomsday treaty or the apocalypse now, according to the naysayers.  How can any right-minded person believe that having got it wrong on five previous occasions using the same arguments that they will get it right this time?  The more often they cry wolf and the wolf does not materialise, the more threadbare their admonitions and warnings become.</P>
        <P>Not only has the European wolf not consumed this little island but Ireland has become a prosperous, equal and respected member of a European Union of 27 member states.  We have progressed significantly through our association with the Union over the past 35 years.  The old Irish proverb, &ldquo;N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile&rdquo;, is absolutely true in this case.  It is difficult to conclude that more has been achieved towards implementing the aims and ideals of the 1916 Proclamation and the 1919 Democratic Programme through Ireland&rsquo;s 35-year association with Europe than had been achieved in the previous 50 years of isolated national independence.</P>
        <P>The founding fathers of the Labour Party, James Connolly and James Larkin, were internationalists.  They believed the progressive way forward was to build solidarity and equality between neighbouring countries and fellow workers in those countries.  Neither they at the beginning of the 20th century nor the Labour Party at the beginning of the 21st century would have ever supported the narrow concept of sovereignty which isolated and suffocated Ireland for 50 years after the foundation of the State and which consigned our people to poverty, emigration and the tyranny of monopoly British capitalism until the European Union provided the vehicle for economic freedom.</P>
        <P>The European project unites the people of Europe by democratic consent on the basis of shared values and in doing so the participating countries agree to pool and share sovereignty in the pursuit of peace, prosperity, stability and solidarity.  At the same time the principles of subsidiary and proportionality ensure that matters which can be dealt with by the individual member states are left to the individual member states.</P>
        <P>The Lisbon treaty starts by restating the values enshrined in the existing treaties and expanding on them.  Article 2 of the Lisbon treaty states the internal values that will apply to the member states of the European Union:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The EU is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights including the rights of persons belonging to minorities.  These values are common to the member states in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between men and women prevail.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">These are the internal values which apply between member states of the European Union.  It is the bedrock in terms of the values on which the European Union is built and which has been restated and expanded in this new treaty.</P>
        <P>Article 3(5) of the Lisbon treaty goes to the next level and states the future values the European Union will have in its external relations as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In its relations with the wider world, the European Union shall uphold and promote its values and interests and contribute to the protection of its citizens.  It shall contribute to <Col N="444"/>peace, security, the sustainable development of the earth, solidarity and natural respect among peoples, free and fair trade, eradication of poverty and the protection of human rights, in particular the rights of the child as well as the strict observance and the development of international law, including respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">These two statements of values constitute a magnificent foundation for the creation of a European Union of equal member states and for determining that Union&rsquo;s benevolent relationship with the rest of the world.</P>
        <P>At every referendum since Ireland joined in 1972, dire warnings and predictions were given and made about what Europe would do to Ireland.  However, Europe did not do any of these awful things.  It did not reduce Ireland to a province of a European empire or super state.  It did not enforce the conscription of young Irish men and women into a European army, as we heard so often.  It did not force Ireland into aggressive imperialist wars.  It did not bring about a disastrous fall in the nation&rsquo;s population &mdash; in fact the reverse has occurred.  It did not cause wholescale unemployment or destroy the small Irish economy &mdash; again, the reverse has occurred.  It did not undermine Irish culture or the Irish language; the Irish language is now an official language of the European Union.  It did not put an end to trade union or workers&rsquo; rights; they are firmly supported and enshrined in the charter of fundamental rights.  It did not introduce abortion or euthanasia, nor can it.</P>
        <P>All these predictions were made again and again during every treaty debate by those campaigning for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  Every one has proved to be groundless and inaccurate.  They are being made again by the same individuals and groups who are opposing the Lisbon reform treaty.  They are just as unfounded, inaccurate and misleading today as they were when first made.</P>
        <P>In 1972, the Labour Party campaigned against Ireland joining the European Economic Community, the EEC.  The given wisdom in the Labour Party and the trade union movement at the time was that the powerful industrialised countries of Europe would destroy Ireland&rsquo;s weak protected industries, thereby causing widescale loss of jobs.  However, a resounding 80% of the electorate voted for Europe.</P>
        <P>Brendan Corish, the then leader of the Labour Party, immediately accepted the outcome, declaring that the people had spoken and that they had clearly decided that Ireland&rsquo;s future was with Europe.  The Labour Party soon realised the benefits of the European Union and that our fears were groundless in the particular areas of concern.  We re-assessed the situation in the light of Ireland&rsquo;s experience as a member of the European Economic Community.  It proved to be a wise choice for Ireland to move from isolation on the periphery of Europe to collective decision-making at the heart of Europe.  Since then, Irish citizens have voted democratically in referenda in every decade to approve every stage of the development of the EU to the present time.</P>
        <P>The European Union has a long tradition of promoting rights in the workplace, including women&rsquo;s rights to equal pay, parental leave, working time and health and safety in the workplace, all of which have benefited Irish employees.  The first action taken by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions was under the Treaty of Rome in 1974 to obtain equal pay for women.  The European Union vindicated certain rights from the beginning.</P>
        <P>The Common Agricultural Policy transformed Irish agriculture, providing farmers with a substantial transfer of EU funds and with incomes no longer dependent on Britain&rsquo;s cheap food policy and price monopoly.  The education and training of our young people was hugely supported by the European Social Fund.  A countrywide network of institutes of technology was established in the 1970s and 1980s with European money.  They produced the young gradu<Col N="445"/>ates with the high-tech expertise that made Ireland the European hub for so many international companies and so much foreign investment.</P>
        <P>At the time of membership of the European Union, Ireland was by far the poorest of the nine member states.  Ireland&rsquo;s gross domestic product was only 58% of the EU average in 1972.  Today it is 130% of the EU average.  The massive haemorrhage of our young people in search of work across the world has ceased and now the youth of Europe is attracted to our shores.  A workforce of less than 1 million in 1972 now exceeds 2 million.</P>
        <P>Clearly, membership of the EU has had a significant and positive impact on who, what and where we are at this stage in our history.  The Lisbon reform treaty is not a bolt out of the blue but rather the latest in a line of treaties which have moulded the Union since its foundation in 1957.  The Lisbon treaty is an amending or reforming treaty which seeks to make the EU institutions in an enlarged European Union more effective, transparent and answerable to the member states.</P>
        <P>Under the Lisbon reform treaty, all member states, large and small, have exactly the same rights in an EU Commission reduced in size to ensure greater efficiency.  Article 4 of the Lisbon treaty states clearly that the EU shall respect the equality of the member states as well as their national identities.  All the law-making deliberations of the European Council of Ministers will take place in public for the first time.  The directly elected European Parliament will have co-decision powers with the Council of Ministers and will have democratic control of the European budget for the first time.</P>
        <P>Important new powers are given to national parliaments which will enable them to play a key role in the framing of policy and law making.  A citizen&rsquo;s initiative will enable ordinary citizens to have important issues placed on the European Union agenda and they will have to be dealt with there.  Each aspiring member state must adhere to the provisions of the United Nations Charter of Human Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights and international law and have democratic institutions in place before it can join.</P>
        <P>The Lisbon reform treaty will give effect to a new body of human, civil, social, cultural and workers&rsquo; rights that will be binding in law.  These are contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights which will underpin all law-making in the European Union once the treaty is passed.</P>
        <P>In addition, a social clause requires that social issues be taken into account when defining and implementing all policies.  The treaty makes legal provision for social dialogue and recognition of the social partners.  From a Labour Party point of view, these are important issues bearing in mind we started off with the European Economic Community, the Single European Act and the Common Market all of which placed emphasis on economic matters, the eurozone and so on.  There is now a better balance in terms of the social and economic dimension written into this treaty.</P>
        <P>I will now deal with the provisions of the Bill before us.  The text of the referendum Bill is even more complex than the text of the treaty, which is understandable.  The explanatory memorandum is helpful in providing the context of this treaty and in assisting us in interpreting the provisions.  The Minister referred to Articles 10 and 11 which are key provisions.  Under these articles ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon by the people in the forthcoming referendum would &ldquo;ensure legal compatibility between the provisions of the Treaty and the Irish Constitution and would carry forward the concept of constitutional cover for laws, acts and measures necessitated by the obligations of EU membership&rdquo;.  That is the standard and necessary statement of incorporation into Article 29.</P>
        <P>Article 13 makes provision for Ireland to exercise the right to opt in or out of measures in the area of freedom, security and justice.  Given the profound differences between the common law system of justice in Ireland and the UK and the legal system operating in mainland EU <Col N="446"/>countries, these provisions are essential to avoid situations that could give rise to future constitutional conflict.  However, Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to tackling cross-border crime and co-operating with EU police forces is asserted by a special declaration incorporated in the treaty which states that police co-operation is a priority and that Ireland will review its position after three years with a view to fully opting into the freedom, security and justice provisions if that is legally and operationally possible.</P>
        <P>In the past 50 years Europe has been at peace with the world and with itself.  The EU common foreign and security policy is firmly anchored in peacekeeping, peacemaking and humanitarian missions of a civil and military nature.  The Petersberg Tasks have been extended in this treaty.  The Lisbon reform treaty specifies that all missions must be in accordance with the United Nations charter and with international law.</P>
        <P>Article 15 restates the existing prohibition inserted at the time of the referendum on the Nice treaty in 2002 in respect of Irish participation in any EU common defence structure that might be established in the future.  It states: &ldquo;The state shall not adopt a decision taken by the European Council to establish a common defence pursuant to Article 1.2 of the Treaty referred to in subsection 7 of this section or Article 1.49 of the Treaty referred to in subsection 10 of this section were that common defence would include the State.&rdquo;  This is a welcome re-affirmation.</P>
        <P>A policy of non-alignment and military neutrality is at the core of our security and defence policy.  Ireland only engages in military missions under the triple lock mechanism of a UN Security Council mandate and Government and D&aacute;il approval.  Ireland&rsquo;s neutral status remains unchanged and our participation in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions such as those in Kosovo, the Lebanon and Chad will continue under the Lisbon reform treaty.  Indeed, Ireland has a proud record of serving on peacekeeping, peacemaking and humanitarian missions abroad for 50 years under the UN mandate.  Some 87 Irish soldiers have lost their lives serving on such missions.  It is important that the principle of active military neutrality be redefined and restated in the context of European Union defence policy in a transparent way.  Thus, the constitutional re-affirmation is exceedingly important.</P>
        <P>The treaty creates new goals and challenges for member states.  At the National Forum on Europe the Labour Party argued that the EU should take leadership of the great challenges of the day affecting humankind.  Under the Lisbon reform treaty the EU has firmly placed itself as the leading player in tackling climate change and the sustainability of the planet.  Article 37 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights states &ldquo;a high level of environmental protection and the improvement of the quality of the environment must be integrated into the policies of the Union and ensured in accordance with the principle of sustainable development&rdquo;.  Likewise the Lisbon reform treaty commits the EU to become the world leader in Third World development, humanitarian aid and the eradication of global poverty.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Labour Party believes that the Lisbon reform treaty contains worthy challenges and objectives for the 21st century.  In terms of the Bill, I suggest there are two areas where, perhaps, the Minister could have added to the Bill.  The Lisbon reform treaty gives, for the first time, a new, significantly enhanced role to national parliaments in the law making process at European Union level.  It also provides for citizen initiatives which will enable one million citizens to have an issue of importance placed on the European Union agenda and that this will have to be dealt with by the institutions of the European Union.  It is important to emphasise that these new democratic initiatives bring the workings and institutions of the European Union closer to the people of the member states and to their public representatives elected to democratic parliaments.  I suggest to the Minister that the best way of doing this would be to write this into the Irish Constitution by way of amendment to Article 29.  This would be a constitutional reminder to the Irish people and parliamentarians <Col N="447"/>of the extra democratic powers contained in the treaty.  This would help to ensure these powers would be utilised to the maximum.</P>
        <P>Also, given the new powers granted to the parliaments, we will have to review the way we do business in this House.  The new role for the D&aacute;il and Seanad will have to examined bearing in mind their central role in law-making and decision-making in the context of the European Union.  I am not sure this matter can be adequately dealt with in committee.  I believe it will have to be dealt with in the full light of the D&aacute;il Chamber.  However, this is perhaps a matter we can discuss in the future.  It would be valuable if this new power were highlighted in a permanent fashion in the form of an amendment to the Constitution through this legislation.  Perhaps the Minister will on Committee Stage consider the merits of my suggestion in the context of the new role for national parliaments and citizens initiatives.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party believes the Lisbon reform treaty reflects more than any previous treaty its ethos and values.  We believe it will be good for Ireland.  We are totally opposed to an Ireland on the periphery and isolated from Europe and to an Ireland that exports 90% of its produce.  Previously we had the Single Market.  We now have a single European market which is a horse of a different colour.  The treaty is deserving of our full support and I, too, commend it to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>In a debate on competitiveness last December, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, told us the best test of a Government&rsquo;s policies was the ability of the economy to retain and create new jobs.  I agree with that assessment and if the current Minister and Government are to be judged by their own criteria, their economic enterprise and employment policies have been an abysmal failure.  The Ministers for Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, were given the job of managing our economy following the Cabinet reshuffle of 2004.  Since then, however, 20,065 people have been added to the live register and the standardised unemployment rate, the best measure of unemployment, has risen to 5.2%.  The contrast with the Minister&rsquo;s forebears, Deputy Mary Harney and Deputy Richard Bruton, is stark.  Those two people managed to move 100,000 people from the dole queues into work.  On Friday the Central Statistics Office will publish figures which are likely to show that the standardised unemployment rate will exceed that of the United <Col N="449"/>Kingdom for the first time in almost a decade.  However, it appears clear that the figures are going to get much worse.  The Department of Finance has projected that the live register will break the psychological figure of 200,000 by the middle of the year.  The standardised unemployment rate will exceed 5.6% by Christmas and if the ESRI is to be believed, will reach as much as 6% by the end of the year.  In terms of new jobs the Government&rsquo;s own estimates suggest that employment growth will fall to 1% this year and other economists and the ESRI has suggested that we may have no job growth at all.  In recent months jobs have been lost in Allergan in Arklow; Merriot and Bulmers in Clonmel; Xerox and Lucent in my constituency of Blanchardstown; the Burlington Hotel and Arnotts in Dublin, to name a few; Portwest in Westport; Jacob&rsquo;s in Tallaght; Kingspan in Dungarvan; Abbott Laboratories in Galway; American Power in Castlebar; Grove Turkeys in County Monaghan; Dawn Meats in County Roscommon; Oatfields in Letterkenny; SFL Engineering and Slaney Meats in Kilkenny and Nexans in Athlone.  These job losses will have a profoundly negative effect on the local economy and on the individuals and families affected.  Some of my colleagues will speak on this aspect later in the debate.</P>
        <P>The Minister, no doubt, will use his speech to give us a history lesson.  He will tell us about the economic progress that has been made since his party came to office in 1997.  He will seek to convince us that the Celtic tiger and the economic benefits that came with it were achievements of Fianna F&aacute;il but this is not true.  I do not think the House needs a history lesson or a debate on history.  The economic success which this country has enjoyed in recent years came about for a multitude of reasons.  The establishment of the Industrial Development Authority was opposed by Se&aacute;n Lemass, who promised its abolition if returned to Government.  Following Ireland&rsquo;s accession to the European Union under Jack Lynch and the succeeding years when Charles Haughey plundered the public finances and plunged Ireland into recession, the task of restoring the public finances to relative health fell to Alan Dukes as Minister for Finance.  These tough and unpopular decisions brought public spending, Exchequer borrowing and the balance of payments deficit under control.  The Tallaght strategy enabled Ray MacSharry to continue these policies and during these years we began to see the green shoots of recovery appear.  The Single European Act opened European markets to Irish business and the Rainbow coalition&rsquo;s successful navigation of Ireland&rsquo;s entry into economic and monetary union allowed us break free from sterling and the constant fear of currency instability and devaluation.</P>
        <P>The social partnership system has allowed unions, farmers and business to buy into the economic reform process, exchanging confrontation for engagement and nominal pay hikes for real improvements in take-home pay through tax cuts and pay increases.  Under the rainbow Government, Ruair&iacute; Quinn balanced the budget for the first time in decades and as any independent analysis will show, that Fine Gael-led Government remains unsurpassed by any of the three Fianna F&aacute;il Governments that have followed, in terms of economic growth, the control of inflation and our export and productivity performance.  Over the past ten years, the three Ahern Governments, or perhaps the Cowen-Ahern Government, have benefited hugely from the decision made by all parties and none in the years gone by.  The Celtic tiger is an achievement that belongs to all of us and was certainly not the creation of one party nor of one man.</P>
        <P>This debate is not about the past but it is about the present and more important, it is about the future.  Ireland is currently facing into its sharpest downturn in 25 years.  Unemployment is rising at a faster rate than at any time in a quarter of a century.  The public finances have gone from surplus to deficit at an alarming rate for which there is no historic precedent.  Our economy is in serious trouble but the Cabinet will not take its head out of the sand.  The Taoiseach would have us believe, to use his words, that we are facing into &ldquo;a hard year&rdquo; as a result of the global credit crunch brought on by the sub-prime crisis in the United States.  The T&aacute;naiste would have us believe that the dramatic downturn in construction activity is a &ldquo;healthy correc<Col N="450"/>tion&rdquo; in the housing market and that the &ldquo;fundamentals of our economy are at the strongest for ten years&rdquo;.  None of this stands up to scrutiny.</P>
        <P>Countless countries have been affected by the credit crunch but few are slipping as badly as Ireland.  The rate of economic growth in Ireland is projected to be as little as 1% in 2008 yet other economies in the world continue to prosper.  I refer to anticipated growth figures for other countries including China at 9.8%; India, 7.8%; Russia, 7%; Poland, 5.1%; Australia, 3.3%; Czech Republic, 4.7%; Norway, 2.9%; Turkey, 3.7%; and Argentina, 5.5%.  Crucially, the growth rate in our knowledge economy competitors include Singapore, 4.4%; South Korea, 4.4%; Hong Kong, 4%; Hungary, 3.6%; and Israel, 3.7%.</P>
        <P>This new reality is also evident when it comes to unemployment.  The figures show that Ireland is rapidly moving from the premier division when it comes to high employment and low unemployment and back into the league of middle to high unemployment.  We have already overtaken the United States on 4.8%, Austria on 4.2%, Denmark on 2.2% and the Netherlands on 4.1%.  I expect the figures on Friday will show that we will overtake the United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, the Czech Republic and Sweden by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>The Government might accuse us of talking the economy down but  there is nothing more worrying than a Government that will not take its head out of the sand or its head out of the clouds.  Unemployment is the human cost of economic mismanagement and notwithstanding the problems created by the downturn in the American economy, our economic slump is largely of the Government&rsquo;s own making.  Like an old-fashioned tax and spend socialist, Deputy Brian Cowen has allowed public spending to spiral out of control.  Billions of euro have been thrown at health, education and justice and 178 new quangos, without any real reform, any improvement in public services, any performance targets, any efficiencies or any requirement that taxpayers&rsquo; money should be used for their benefit.  Spending has increased by 11 .5% on average, 40% more than the rate of growth.  This reversion to the economics of the 1970s has resulted in current spending rising from 25% of GNP to 31% and taxation from 32.5% to 36% in the past six years.  There have been higher taxes and higher inflation but no improvement in services.</P>
        <P>The Government has run away from the challenge of public sector reform, most obviously by its decision to accept the recommendations of the review body on higher remuneration.  By the end of the year, Deputies Brian Cowen and Miche&aacute;l Martin will earn over twice the salary of US Secretary Paulson, their counterpart in the USA who manages the largest economy in the world.</P>
        <P>Inflation has also been of the Government&rsquo;s creation and is the reason for a loss of competitiveness.  In the past six years, inflation in Government-regulated services was 31%, three times the EU average, whereas in the competitive sectors it was 12.5%, which is less than the EU average.  Since 2001, services regulated or directly provided by Government have accounted for half of all non-mortgage inflation yet nothing has been done to address this.  No progress has been made towards deregulation of bus services.  There has been no separation of EirGrid from ESB, no overhaul of the telecoms sector, no independent regulator for waste management, no moves to tear down barriers to entry or uncompetitive practices in the professions and a <i>carte blanche</i> to NRA to increase tolling on the nationalised West Link.  Where a private company, NTR, was running the West Link toll bridge, it will now be nationalised and cost the country even more under a State monopoly.  As the economy falters,the Government&rsquo;s response seems to be to postpone, not accelerate, reforms.  There are no decisions, no Ministers, no Government.</P><Col N="451"/>
        <P>The cost of doing business and living in Ireland has soared.  According to the Central Bank, our cost competitiveness against our trading partners has deteriorated by 30% since 2000, driving a range of manufacturing industries to the wall.  For key business costs like waste, electricity, local charges, mobile phones, office rental, Ireland is now way out of line with the UK and other competitor countries.  The common theme behind these cost burdens is a Government that has been unwilling to drive service sector competition and efficiency improvements.  According to Forf&aacute;s and the National Competitiveness Council, Dublin is ranked as the third and most expensive of 14 cities in which to invest when it comes to telecommunications, fund administration and biotechnology and the fourth most expensive for medical technologies, engineering and pharmaceuticals.</P>
        <P>We in Fine Gael believe that the time for wake-up calls has long since passed.  We need a Government that is prepared to govern and Ministers who will make decisions and drive change.</P>
        <P>We must continue to invest in infrastructure and education so our economy will have the capacity to grow and develop in the future.  We must bring inflation under control through productivity-related pay increases, greater competition in sheltered sectors of the economy and real public sector reform to boost efficiency and productivity.  We should support small and medium enterprises, the engines of job growth, by reducing red tape and setting an ambitious target for reduction of the cost of regulatory compliance to business, a target that still has not been set by the Minister, despite commitments to do so almost five months ago.</P>
        <P>We must overhaul F&Aacute;S and initiate a national upskilling programme with the aim of upskilling 500,000 people in the next 12 years with annual progress targets to assess whether this policy is being delivered.  Instead of paying lip service to the knowledge economy we need to start implementing tangible policies that will transform Ireland into a knowledge economy by investing in next generation networks, accelerating e-government, raising education standards rather than ignoring that issue, increasing investment in IT and extending the research and development tax credit.</P>
        <P>We need to promote greater involvement of immigrants in the economy, who face huge barriers when they wish to set up businesses, and grant knowledge visas to highly skilled workers from overseas to enable us to benefit from a brain gain in contrast to the brain drain we suffered in previous decades.</P>
        <P>While Fianna F&aacute;il can take its fair share of credit for Ireland&rsquo;s economic transformation, the Celtic tiger was certainly not the creation of one party or one man.  However, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister, Deputy Martin, have nothing to be proud of when it comes to their time as economic helmsmen.  As stated in the motion, we have witnessed a period where the largest surplus has been turned into the largest deficit, 20,000 more people have been added to the dole queues and ours is among the highest inflation rate in Europe.</P>
        <P>The time has come for the Government to take its head out of the sand and embark on the long and difficult process of implementing sound policies that will restore our competitiveness and reverse the rising tide of unemployment.  If it does not, Fine Gael is ready to take over the reins of Government and will do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnOMahony"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Fine Gael Private Members&rsquo; motion and I commend Deputy Varadkar on bringing it forward.  </P>
        <P>It is only nine months since the Government told anyone who wanted to listen that the boom times would continue into the future and that the country needed its steady hand to guide it.  We now know that the real truth is different.  A few months later, we know that the property <Col N="452"/>boom is well and truly over, unemployment and inflation are increasing and we are rapidly losing our competitiveness when compared to our European neighbours.</P>
        <P>What is making our economy particularly vulnerable is that the expansion in the early part of this decade was based on unsustainable, debt-driven growth in construction and public services whereas the good times in the 1990s were export-led and productivity-led.  Ireland now has the most highly indebted households of any EU member state.  The excuse is often trotted out that our rising inflation is due to external factors such as higher energy costs and the like, but it must be remembered that our strong euro against the dollar has cushioned us to a great extent in this area.  According to CSO data, 53% of inflation since 2002 in Ireland has been caused by indirect increases and price rises in Government administered and regulated services.  What is needed as a response to our deteriorating situation is to expedite the development of our country&rsquo;s national infrastructure, particularly in communications and transport.</P>
        <P>Competitiveness and, therefore, jobs are directly affected by the snail&rsquo;s pace roll-out of broadband here.  Widespread availability of broadband would attract equal opportunities for businesses throughout the length and breadth of the country to compete for jobs, particularly in rural areas that are seriously disadvantaged because of poor physical infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Recently I heard that a person who had relocated to a rural village in Mayo from England for a better lifestyle is considering moving back to England as a result of losing contracts because broadband is not available there.  We seem more intent on stopping rural dwellers cutting turf on bogs than supporting them in business.  We will not let them carry on doing what they have done for hundreds of years but we are preventing them from moving into modern times.  The Government cannot have it both ways.</P>
        <P>There is no reason this country should be in its current position.  The profits of the good times have been squandered while our physical infrastructure is nowhere near the standard needed.  In Mayo we are looking into the distance for the completion of the N26, N5 and many other routes.  Work on the western rail corridor is moving at a snail&rsquo;s pace and Ireland West Airport in Knock needs increased support as it has enormous potential.</P>
        <P>My region is suffering mounting job losses in Portwest in Westport, Dawn Meats in Ballaghaderreen, Contract 4 call centre in Achill and APC in Castlebar, an industry brought to the town by Deputy Kenny many years ago.  If we are serious about arresting the current downturn in the economy, the delays and cutbacks in the implementation of our major infrastructural projects must be stopped.  We need them now more than ever.  In many cases it is not that the money is not there.  For instance, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, transferred &euro;10 million from funds intended for broadband investment.</P>
        <P>As I was driving to the D&aacute;il this morning, I got a telephone call from a person who has a company based in Mayo which went into liquidation in the past few days resulting in the loss of 20 jobs locally and many more jobs countrywide and in other countries.  These people need to know that the economic climate is being created here with the necessary business support structure to prevent a bad situation turning into a crisis.  We need action now.  I strongly commend this motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Deputy Frank Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also commend this Private Members&rsquo; motion to the House.  The fact that the largest ever increases in the number of people on the live register were recorded in January and February of this year signals that a crisis is looming.  The construction boom of the past seven or eight years has come to an end and that is causing great problems in rural areas.  The live register figures would be much higher were it not for the fact that, as openly admitted by the Polish ambassador who visited this House today, most Polish construction <Col N="453"/>workers have moved to the UK where there are jobs.  Thankfully, once again the UK is acting as an escape valve for people from this country.    </P>
        <P>Irish workers need to be upskilled.  Major job opportunities are not available to them.  As Deputy O&rsquo;Mahony said, broadband access is required in the smaller towns and not only in the so-called hubs and gateways.  Smaller towns have their own identity and we need to support the development of small and medium-sized enterprises as the engines of job growth there.</P>
        <P>Companies have to cope with considerable red tape.  A constituent contacted me today concerning a safe certificate which he had obtained in Australia but on returning here found it was not recognised.  He has spent five weeks waiting to do such a course, although he has the offer of employment.  A safe course here costs five times more than a similar course in Australia.  I tabled a question on that aspect to the Minister today and I look forward to a reply to it.  The layers of red tape with which small and medium-sized industries have to cope is a matter of concern.  That aspect must be addressed.</P>
        <P>We are all in this together in that we are all trying to create jobs.  I travelled to Scotland in the past six months to encourage a call firm to locate in my town in the west.  It has considered locating in the west where there are major opportunities in that it is a good place to live, there is a good standard of education and people there enjoy a good quality of life.</P>
        <P>I compliment Enterprise Ireland and the people working on its behalf, but we need to attract small and medium-sized enterprises to locate in towns such as my town and other towns like it in my constituency of Roscommon-South Leitrim.  Such industries create part of the identity of an area and help it to develop.</P>
        <P>The announcement of new companies creating 1,000 jobs were welcome but we now need to focus much more on companies creating 50 to 100 jobs, which give an area an identity and help those areas where the building industry will no longer be prevalent for the next few years.  The aspect on which we need to focus is on supporting small and medium-sized enterprises.  They need much more assistance and for the Government to address the level of red tape imposed.  Otherwise the number of people unemployed will rise.  There is a crisis and, as we are all in this together, we must ensure we solve it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this motion which highlights the rising level of unemployment that is threatening our economic viability.  A staggering 187,000 are currently on the live register, of whom 16,300 account for the huge increases in January and February of this year &mdash; that figure is expected to be higher when the March figures are published on Friday.  This is indicative of the rapidly increasing level of unemployment throughout the country, which is hitting every community.  In my constituency of Longford-Westmeath, a devastating blow was dealt with the closure of Nexans Ireland.  Ninety-six jobs were lost and workers and their families who have been associated with the company for many years were devastated.  I call on the Minister to ensure retraining is put in place for these workers, who are facing an extremely uncertain future, and that a generous redundancy package is secured.</P>
        <P>What efforts did the Minister make to save these jobs in Athlone and how does he propose to attract new jobs to the midlands?  Only three companies have moved into the midlands in the past ten years and new investment is urgently needed.  The re-investment of &euro;30 million in C&amp;D Foods in County Longford is welcome, but much more needs to be done to attract new jobs to the area.  Announcements such as that in regard to Nexans Ireland are shockingly common and are an indictment of the Government&rsquo;s failure to tackle spiralling business costs and falling competitiveness.  Basic costs must be addressed so that businesses are not forced to move out of Ireland to retain a competitive edge.</P><Col N="454"/>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s economic competitiveness has fallen 17 points since the Minister, Deputy Martin, came into office.  The standardised unemployment rate now stands at 5.2% nationally, the highest level in seven years, and is predicted to rise by more than 6% to a nine-year high by the end of the year.  As a representative of a rural constituency, I am only too aware that the direct impact of job losses is most strongly felt in the farming sector.  Farmers are being driven off the land and out of the industry by falling prices, lack of guaranteed markets and the excessive bureaucracy brought about by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  In recent years, Longford-Westmeath has seen job losses of almost 150 at the Lakeland Group, which followed as a direct result of the Government&rsquo;s failure to maintain adequate price structures and support for farmers.  The cattle markets in Edgeworthstown, Mullingar and Moate have closed and other enterprises are under threat.</P>
        <P>If it is to increase employment opportunities in the farming sector and retain workers on the land, the Government must provide the best possible education and upskilling opportunities for farmers.  This is the key to providing agriculture with a competitive advantage.  The midland counties are starved of infrastructural investment with a shameful underspend in BMW funding.  However, this money seems to find its way back into the Exchequer each year and the Government persists in failing to meet its obligations to provide essential infrastructure and thus increase the attraction of these counties for investment.</P>
        <P>Much could be done to improve rural development through prioritising high-potential projects.  Longford-Westmeath, although perfectly situated in the centre of the country, is losing out on major international investment due to the poor state of its infrastructure.  This infrastructural deficit is to the detriment of its economic development.  It highlights the failure of the national spatial strategy, which is perhaps the largest scam perpetrated by the Government.  Balanced regional development is a myth we have been sold by the Government as a reality.  Longford-Westmeath is getting less than its fair share of State-assisted jobs &mdash; less than 2%.  Employment can be created in this area by attracting new industry to Longford-Westmeath, creating off-farm and rural employment opportunities, providing additional funding to encourage indigenous industry, advancing the decentralisation programme and securing existing jobs.</P>
        <P>Throughout the country, thousands of untrained workers were drawn into the construction industry during the boom years.  Their futures have been dismissed by the Government as the big freeze in the economy begins to hit home and little provision has been made for their upskilling and retraining.  The long-term sustainable pace of housing output is approximately 50,000 units per annum.  From 2003 to 2006, this output was exceeded by a total of 120,000 units, an increase that could not be maintained.  This explains the current decrease in construction industry activity and employment.</P>
        <P>The Government is lacking an industrial strategy of low taxes and high skills.  It deserves strong criticism for its part in facilitating encroaching inflation and lack of competitiveness.  The Government has lost the plot and is failing to achieve and maintain a high rate of labour force participation, which is critical to the continuation of the economic strength that Ireland has experienced.  Regions and rural areas are bearing the brunt of State-supported jobs being channelled into our largest cities.  Such State support has failed to impact on the rural areas where it is most needed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AndrewDoyle"><NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Somebody seems to have been dusting down speeches and mantras from five years ago on behalf of the Government.  We heard all about the potential impact of global economic downturns after 11 September 2001.  We are told, once again, that such global turbulence is responsible for the current downturn in our economy.  Yet, when the situation improves, shrewd Government management will be credited.</P><Col N="455"/>
        <P>In his Budget Statement last December, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance acknowledged that we should expect more modest growth.  He stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Against this background, my Department is forecasting that GDP will increase by 3% in real terms, 24,000 new jobs will be created with the total number at work increasing by a little over 1% and unemployment at 5.5% by the end of next year, inflation will ease and the harmonised index of consumer prices will average 2.4%.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Inflation currently stands at 4.8%.  Anybody who predicted last December that inflation growth would be 2.4% must have intended to remove everything from the consumer price index.  It was unrealistic then and it is even more unrealistic now.  We have had predictions that unemployment will rise to 6% by the end of the year.  If up-to-date figures were available, they would probably show it already at 5.5%.</P>
        <P>I recently put down a parliamentary question to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on the roll-out of broadband.  The bog standard response to queries about broadband provision is that it is a matter primarily for the private sector.  The Minister tells us he is sorry but the decision was taken before he came to office.  It is clear that the Government&rsquo;s commitment on broadband provision has been abandoned.  This problem is widespread, in towns and rural areas, and there is no workable and realisable national broadband plan.  It is critical that this infrastructure deficit be addressed immediately.  It is a problem the Government cannot ignore.</P>
        <P>I speak now with my food hat on.  Significant and laudable effort is being put into promoting renewable energy.  I would be pleased if as much effort were put into building jobs in food related employment.  We must get serious about this natural resource instead of allowing it go down the swanny.  At this morning&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, representatives of the fishing industry told us that from the aquaculture point of view, 80% of the fish being landed is exported for processing before being brought back in.  This is madness.  Why can we not address such simple issues?  Tourism is another natural resource.  Nothing need be imported to enhance this resource but we are allowing the industry to become uncompetitive.</P>
        <P>I was glad to see the Minister in my constituency in January when he said that Arklow was to be a priority location.  The unemployment figure for Arklow in February rose by 20% purely on the basis of the loss of Allergen, the largest remaining employer.  A taskforce similar to those established elsewhere in the State must be put in place.  In Greystones, an 80-acre IDA site has been lying idle for some 20 years because the policy has been to secure one major employer.  Smaller employers who were interested in coming in have been turned away.  It is better to have a range of smaller employers so that the impact is not as great if one goes out of business.</P>
        <P>I was asked in an interview on RTE last Wednesday week about the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day access available to Ministers and representatives of the Government abroad.  I hope each and every one of them, particularly the Minister, Deputy Martin, was listening to what was being said about why we are not getting the jobs, why jobs are leaving and why this country is not as attractive as it was ten or 15 years ago, when we were ahead of the game.  We need to get ahead of the game again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the years, this Chamber has paused to take stock of where the economy is and where Deputies want it to go.  For example, I refer to the efforts of the former Taoiseach, Se&aacute;n Lemass, and Dr. T.K. Whitaker to open the Irish economy in the 1950s.  Similarly, a former leader of my party, Alan Dukes, adopted the Tallaght strategy in the 1980s to help a minority Fianna F&aacute;il Government to regain control of the public finances.  It is time for <Col N="456"/>further reflection of that nature if we are genuinely to plan for the future.  The former Deputy, the late John Kelly, once said that the Irish economy is like a sow being slowly devoured by her piglets, who are gorging themselves with no thought of the future.  This country has moved on from such rural imagery.  Nowadays, we might say that the manner in which we are dealing with our economy reflects our obsession with style over substance &mdash; our desire for &ldquo;quick fix&rdquo; solutions.  We think everything can be sorted out by means of cosmetic surgery, without any need to deal with the fundamentals.</P>
        <P>Many Members have spoken about the job losses in their constituencies.  There have been significant job losses in County Clare at Aer Lingus, Tyco Electronics, John Crane Limited and Thompson Financial.  Some companies have put their workers on a three-day week because they are unsure of their futures.  The number of people on the live register in the county increased from 4,249 to 5,072, or 19.4%, in the 12 months between February 2007 and February 2008.  Such a rate of increase has not been seen for a long time.  There is nothing to indicate the rate of unemployment, or the overall number of people on the dole, will abate in the near future.  The region&rsquo;s economic balance was severely undermined by the Government&rsquo;s decision not to use its 25% stake in Aer Lingus to stop the recent transfer of Shannon Airport&rsquo;s Heathrow slots.  The Government has walked away from the promise it made before last year&rsquo;s general election to allocate &euro;53 million towards the well-being of the mid-west.  That figure became &euro;3 million overnight.</P>
        <P>Presentation is of paramount importance for the Government.  It does not engage in any analysis, consideration or planning of the future.  Such an approach is fine in the short-term &mdash; from election to election &mdash; but when the Government&rsquo;s record is analysed by historians over the longer term, the conclusion that will be reached is that huge opportunities were squandered without anything to show for them.  This country was fifth on the international competitiveness league table in 2000, but it had fallen to 22nd by 2007, primarily because of high costs, inflation and poor infrastructure.  There has been a shift from economic growth driven by exports and productivity to domestically driven growth that depends on new jobs in construction and public services.  The swift downturn in house building has had as significant an impact on the economy as the growth in construction some years ago.  We have to pay for our public services from a dwindling income.  The number of people working in the public service has increased by 160,000 since 2000, without a discernible improvement in service provision.</P>
        <P>The Government needs to make an explicit commitment to introducing the necessary reforms that will ensure swifter delivery of national infrastructure projects, particularly communications projects such as the roll-out of broadband services and transport and education projects.  The Government must move beyond its rhetoric about the knowledge economy to the development of an actual knowledge economy.  This involves supporting investment in next generation broadband networks rather than merely maintaining its regulatory role.  Small and medium sized enterprises can be the engines of job growth in our economy.  Ireland needs to enter a new phase of economic growth, in which it regains its international competitiveness.  If Ireland is to return to the forefront of international trade, we must display a commitment to promoting a competitive business environment, a responsive public sector and a political system that can make decisions.  I support the motion before the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to say a few words about jobs in the west.  It is not long since the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment was in Westport for the launch of the brochure for the town&rsquo;s business park.  I do not think a single job has been created in that park since that date.  Similar problems are being encountered throughout the country.  Nobody is going into these new business parks.  The Minister and his Cabinet colleagues need to listen to <Col N="457"/>people on the ground.  The reason jobs are leaving this country is quite simple.  The Government&rsquo;s failure to tackle problems like inflation is affecting the way people do business in this country.  If the Minister talks to people who are involved in small businesses, they will tell him they are over-regulated by the Government, the EU, local authorities and the HSE.  The Government has been in place for a long time, but it has done nothing about these problems, with which it is familiar.  Every time local authorities try to raise funding for themselves, they do so by imposing additional costs on businesses.  The local authorities were unable to deal with the refuse service, so they handed it over to the private sector in some cases although they held onto it in other cases.  Business people have told me that it costs them a small fortune to get rid of their refuse.</P>
        <P>As matters get more difficult, people are looking at their cost bases on a day-to-day basis.  For example, the Portwest facility in Westport has relocated to China.  Many enterprises do not want to do business in Westport or anywhere else in this country.  The Allergan plant in Westport shed 800 jobs a number of years ago and a further 1,000 jobs are being lost at the company&rsquo;s Arklow facility.  I am worried about the future of Allergan&rsquo;s 800 or 900 employees in Westport.  As previous speakers have said, this country is dependent on industrial jobs.  While Westport has a nice balance of industry and tourism, many of its eggs are in the Allergan basket.  If anything happens those jobs, it will be devastating not only for Westport but also for the surrounding areas.  Something has to be done.  What has the Minister, Deputy Martin, done?  What has the Minister for Finance done about this country&rsquo;s energy costs?</P>
        <P>I will give a simple example of the hypocritical manner in which the Government is running this country.  We have had an oil crisis for the last 12 months &mdash; oil has never been so expensive &mdash; but the Government has done nothing.  It could have reduced its tax take to try to keep the price of energy down and keep this country&rsquo;s companies competitive.  Many companies in Westport and other parts of the country are reviewing their operations to see whether they should stay in Ireland or move abroad.  A company that has been based in this country for many years is targeting companies to see if they can be attracted out of this country and into cheaper bases in the Middle East and other areas.  What are we doing about it?  We are doing nothing.  We are putting more pressure on employers and businesses.  We are not doing anything.  We have talked about it for 20 years.  The small business committee that was set up in the D&aacute;il made recommendations to the Government, but none of them was adopted by the Government.</P>
        <P>We stood by when the good days were good and thought this day would never come.  This dangerous day has come.  If current trends continue, the 187,000 people who have been unemployed since last year will continue to suffer.  We thought the good days would never come to an end.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Martin, to try to support small businesses, which represent the backbone of our economy.  They will stay here.  The big supermarkets like Tesco which have come to Ireland over the last 20 years have got rid of jobs in small businesses in every town and city.  Of course they have created a few jobs, but they have also taken a lot of other jobs.  Small businesses are no longer able to compete.  It is time for the Minister and the Government to try to support this country&rsquo;s small businesses.  If a company from China or Taiwan looks for grant aid, the Government and IDA Ireland will do everything they can to bring them in.  They do not want to do anything for Irish companies, however, because they are Irish.  It does not matter if the company is from Dublin or Mayo.  It is time to change the policy.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this subject and to recall and articulate the substantial achievement of modern Ireland in transforming the economy and increasing competitiveness.  I note Deputy Varadkar asked that we not indulge in giving a history lesson tonight.  He then proceeded to give a very unusual version of history, criticising the great Se&aacute;n Lemass, who is widely regarded by historians as the architect of a modern, open, export-led economy.  He moved quickly through the barren years that Fine Gael had spent in Opposition <Col N="459"/>seeking to convince the House that this was the period which actually turned the economy around.  We shall leave that to historians to discuss, perhaps, at a later date.</P>
        <P>We need balance and perspective in terms of our assessment of the economy.  We are very clear as regards both our achievements and, indeed, the challenges of the future.  I shall reiterate to the House that the Government&rsquo;s objective is to build and protect employment.  That has been at the top of our agenda for the last ten years.  For Deputy Ring or anybody else to say it has not, is pure nonsense.  The reality is that the employment performance of the last decade has been extraordinary.  Even in 2007 alone, more than 80,000 jobs were created, an extraordinary amount.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is seeking to disguise the fact, in talking about the existing companies, that they are taking on no one. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect, those are the facts.  The number of jobs created in the last three years is very significant.  We have moved from a workforce of one million, 12 years ago, to more than two million now.  Yet all the debate and the rhetoric would suggest none of that happened and that it was all a mirage.  We need some reality and perspective.  I certainly accept reasoned debate as regards the challenges that we face globally and domestically, because Ireland is now a different economy from what it was ten years ago &mdash; or when Fine Gael was last in office.  I accept that when Fine Gael was last in office, during difficult times, there were very few jobs to compensate for those that were lost.  However, in recent times we have been able to create jobs and through our policies to create the environment to facilitate job creation, both indigenously and through foreign direct investment.  Neither can any responsible Government pretend that no company will every close, that there will not be economic churn, or that jobs will never be lost.  Jobs will continue to be lost in certain sectors and we have to win them in others.  That is the challenge Ireland faces as a country.  We cannot stand apart, either, from global shifts and movements.  Globally, the past ten to 15 years has been a dramatic time.  I noted that a majority in the long list of countries cited by Deputy Varadkar were what we would term emerging economies &mdash; in terms of China, India, the eastern European economies and many more.  The Government will continue to work to replace jobs and, above all, to equip people with the necessary skills to deliver employment opportunities. </P>
        <P>There is no basis for complacency about the economy and we shall remain vigilant.  We shall continue to invest in the critical areas in the context of the national development plan.  I would caution the Opposition, however, against dismissing the underlying strength of the economy and ignoring the major new job creation that has occurred over the decade which means the economy is a on a different plateau relative to where it was ten years ago.  To refuse to acknowledge the positive structural changes in the economy in the last decade is to completely opt out of constructive debate.  That is Fine Gael&rsquo;s choice, but it is not ours on this side of the House.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to get into a negative type of debate this evening.   That appears to have marked quite a number of the opening speeches we have heard in this debate.  We want to work on policies that will position the country to take advantage of global upturns in the months and years to come.  The reality is that the strength and resilience of the economy has enabled us to dramatically raise living standards and improve life chances for our citizens.  In these two areas our record of achievement is beyond question.  The United Nations ranked Ireland as No. 4 on the OECD&rsquo;s quality of life index in 2007 and we now have one of the highest <i>per capita</i> income levels in the European Union.  We have a well educated workforce, and an environment which encourages work and entrepreneurship.  We have already embarked on the next phase of economic development with unprecedented levels of investment in science, infrastructure and skills.</P><Col N="460"/>
        <P>Let no one talk to me about paying lip service to science and technology.  I recall when I was Minister for Education in 1997 that the Department&rsquo;s budget for research was nil.  It has restarted the PRTLI programme and it was this Government that started the Science Foundation Ireland programme, which in an unprecedented way catapulted research to a primary position within the political agenda.  It has invested hugely in the physical capacity of fourth level and in programming funding for science, particularly in terms of biotechnology and ICTs, the two fundamental pillars of Science Foundation Ireland.  We continue to do that and last year we published an all-embracing comprehensive science technology innovation strategy, which will have an &euro;8.2 billion budget under the national development plan.  That is, again, to effect a quantum leap forward in terms of our performance in research and development, and ultimately is a key pillar underpinning competitiveness into the future, in terms we can maintain as regards jobs in high-end manufacturing, services and across a whole range of other areas.</P>
        <P>The profile of employment has changed.  We now have more and better paying jobs.  We have a growing services sector, with a very strong exports performance.  That is an aspect of the economy which has not been profiled, perhaps, to the extent it should have been.  It has been getting some attention, however, in terms of the dramatic growth in services in recent times.  Clearly, there are external challenges to be faced, not least as regards the whole financial situation internationally, liquidity issues and the difficulties in both the US and UK economies, which are two significant markets for Ireland.  Ireland&rsquo;s growth rate will clearly moderate this year, but let us not forget that GDP expanded at an annual average rate of about 6.5% over the period 1997-2007, and this has facilitated a substantial improvement in living standards.  Only last month the Lisbon Council in Brussels and the Centre for European Reform ranked Ireland highly in their annual reports, reporting a strengthened performance on the previous year.  They noted that Ireland&rsquo;s growth potential was far from exhausted.  The 2007 business environment ranking of <i>The Economist</i> intelligence unit placed Ireland in tenth place globally, out of 82 countries, naming it as one of the most attractive business locations in the world.</P>
        <P>In the World Economic Forum, WEF, ranking Ireland has dropped in position from the stellar heights of 2000 when we had super national growth rates.  The growth rates of over 6.5% could not be sustained on an ongoing basis, yet we are still ranked among the top ten smaller economies in the world.  I also want to mention the capital access index, CAI, drawn up by the Milken Institute, based in Santa Monica.  This is a publicly supported independent US economic think tank, whose capital access index scores the ability of entrepreneurs to gain access to financial capital in countries across the globe.  The CAI measures the breadth, depth and vitality of capital markets and also openness in providing access without discrimination &mdash; a measure of global progress in the democratisation of capital.  The 2007 index ranks 122 countries based on macro-economic and institutional environment, financial and banking institutions, international funding, bond and equity market development and alternative capital sources.  Again, the key point is that Ireland has performed well, securing sixth place overall in 2007 &mdash; an improvement on the 2005 and 2006 rankings of tenth and ninth place, respectively.  Ireland also tops the ranking for financial and banking institutions &mdash; based on the level of involvement of deposit-taking institutions in financing businesses.  Our achievement in this domain is reflected not only in the effectiveness of our banking institutions but also in the Government initiative through Enterprise Ireland, namely, the access to venture capital scheme.  That is a practical measure we decided on more than two years ago, which seeded the 2007-12 venture capital programme.  The Government, through Enterprise Ireland, injected a new round of &euro;175 million in venture capital funding and to date this has leveraged about &euro;560 million of the funding being raised against a target of &euro;860 million over that period to 2012 &mdash; and many of the funds have been established.  When this is combined with some of the budget initiatives we introduced <Col N="461"/>in terms of small business, we are making a difference to the capacity of indigenous enterprise to access venture capital.</P>
        <P>I am not saying we are finished yet.  We are looking at new opportunities for enhancing that access to venture capital in this country into the future.  In terms of Ireland&rsquo;s trade performance, the value of our merchandise exports in 2007 reached &euro;88.6 billion, up &euro;1.8 billion on 2006, equivalent to a 2.1% rise.  I noted earlier that services is a key sector.  It has risen dramatically between 2003-07, from about &euro;37.1 billion to &euro;64.7 billion, an increase of nearly 75%.  It has been an extraordinary story and the value of services exports represents about 42% of our total export trade now, and is growing.  Some economists estimate that it will reach 50% by 2010-11.  Again, in terms of the future, we have put together a working group to look at the services sector in this country and how it may more effectively be internationalised, and enhance its contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s economic growth.</P>
        <P>We have made provision in the budget to account for the economic growth rate but global uncertainty will affect the projections of economic growth.  We are not immune from global developments.  It is important that we focus on the fundamentals of the Irish economy, which remain sound and which will shore up our capacity to respond to the challenges that exist.</P>
        <P>The slowdown in the domestic housing and construction sector has been a significant factor in the moderation of growth this year.  We are moving towards a more sustainable level of house building.  We could not have continued to build over 90,000 houses every year.  Approximately 48,000 houses are expected to be built in 2008.  This does not represent a collapse but indicates a significant move back from 90,000.  It presents an opportunity to refocus capital and funding on enterprise, new technology companies and value-added food companies, as has been stated.  We will work on this through Enterprise Ireland with a view to convincing people to invest in new enterprises.  We must be honest about the fact that the property sector in recent years was drawing an increasing amount of capital away from other productive sectors of the economy.</P>
        <P>The good news that arises from the considerable activity in the construction sector is that we have witnessed the growth of a significant number of high-quality construction companies.  The challenge for us now is to internationalise some of these companies, export construction products and services and avail of the various opportunities that present themselves, such as the Olympic Games in London in 2012. The international business community will be looking for professional services that our construction sector should be well placed to provide.</P>
        <P>We believe our medium-term growth prospects remain favourable.  The Minister for Finance has made it clear we will keep an eye on the public finances, which process we have already begun in the context of the most recent budget by way of ensuring that fiscal measures will remain a core part of our overall strategy.  Current spending will rise moderately this year.</P>
        <P>Deputy Varadkar indicated he wants further curbing of public expenditure.  He clearly wants to slash it but we believe that rather than adopting a slash-and-burn approach, we need to moderate current expenditure and not decrease capital expenditure.  Capital expenditure will increase by approximately 12% this year and it will be used to deliver on the national development plan across all the areas of infrastructure.</P>
        <P>This year will be different to last year in terms of employment.  We will not enjoy the same level of employment growth as last year.  We have forecast this and said so at the beginning of the year in light of the budget forecasts.  Over recent years, there has been a significant churn in employment.  The Opposition has mentioned various companies in this regard.  We could also mention companies that have been established in the past two to three years.  Only yesterday I was in Dungarvan, where an American multinational, Lancaster Laboratories, has decided to <Col N="462"/>locate so as to have a footprint in Europe.  It took over an indigenous company that has been in the region since 1986.  There are currently 100 jobs and 100 more are to be created.</P>
        <P>Genzyme, a major biotechnology company in Waterford, is to spend a further &euro;113 million and increase its employment level in Waterford to above 600.  Earlier this week I visited Thermo King in Galway, where a research and development centre has been established, again with a view to underpinning manufacturing jobs.  The technology available in Thermo King to produce next-generation green refrigeration products for trucks is probably the best around.  It is extraordinary.  The company is a subsidiary of one of the most successful companies in Europe, Ingersoll Rand.</P>
        <P>We need to celebrate and talk up our technology a little more.  We can overdo the gloom and negativity in respect of the Irish economy and its performance.  Zimmer Holdings, one of the most renowned manufacturers of medical devices for joints, including knee joints, which we will all need at some stage, is to locate in Shannon in County Clare, thus creating 250 high-quality jobs.</P>
        <P>Investments have been made by Vistakon in Limerick, a great company that manufactures contact lenses.  ChannelAdvisor Corporation has also announced jobs in Limerick.  Jobs have also been created by Citco Fund Services in Cork and Service Source Europe in Dublin.  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries has created jobs recently, again in Waterford.  IBM has decided to establish Europe&rsquo;s first cloud computing centre with the support of IDA Ireland in Mulhuddart.  We are therefore going up the value chain and targeting companies, mandates and functions that will make a difference.</P>
        <P>I set up the small business forum to create a new focus on small business.  There are 800,000 people working in small businesses in our economy, which represents almost 50% of private sector employment.  We received a significant number of recommendations on this and we are clearly focusing on indigenous and small countries to develop and internationalise them.</P>
        <P>I mentioned our commitment to science and technology, research and development and the &euro;8.2 billion to be allocated in the coming years.  The good news on this is that we are making very rapid progress.  On human resources, the number of employed researchers has risen dramatically since 2000 in parallel with the strong increases in investment in research and development.  The proportion of full-time adjusted equivalent researchers per 1,000 in employment has risen significantly and is now in line with the EU average and only slightly below the OECD average.  The increase in the number of researchers, including principal researchers and their teams, to realise the goals of our investment will continue.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to the brain gain.  We are in the business of procuring skills and we have a migration policy that facilitates high skilled labourers, particularly world-class researchers to attract them into Ireland with good, interesting and well-funded projects.  At the close of 2007, there were over 400 different companies collaborating with scientists supported by Science Foundation Ireland, SFI.  Some 42% of SFI-backed scientists were collaborating with industry.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and SFI all meet under a group called Technology Ireland and work in a cohesive way to develop research investments in collaboration with industry.  We probably have a more flexible suite of offerings in terms of the synergies between industry and academia than many other countries.  This is generating a lot of interest in the global research community.  There is a lot on offer in Ireland through the funding of Science Foundation Ireland, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  The challenge is to maintain this in terms of both indigenous industry and foreign direct investors.  It is not a question of &ldquo;either or&rdquo; and we should not engage in the game of playing one off the other.  There is a lot of foreign direct <Col N="463"/>investment to be won.  The task has become more challenging but we can still win a significant amount.</P>
        <P>There is a link between foreign direct investment and indigenous enterprise in that many in the latter sector are supplying the former.  Many of them are adding solutions to the multinational offering in terms of the quality of our technology.</P>
        <P>I mentioned small business.  The small business report listed many recommendations, which we have implemented.  The Minister for Finance, in his budgets of 2006 and 2007 in particular, gave effect, in a very solid and effective way, to almost all the taxation recommendations contained in the report.  We introduced the innovation voucher, for example, which represents a novel approach to enable micro-companies of four and five people to obtain grant aid from Enterprise Ireland to buy knowledge and expertise from colleges.  To date, approximately 428 companies have received innovation vouchers.  The interest of the companies in this initiative has been satisfactory.  The business forum picked up the idea in Holland.  It is a very useful way to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship across the economy.  We also introduced a Tech-Check system, whereby we enable small companies to check that their technology is being used to the greatest effect.  We are supporting companies in this regard.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to regulation and the external audit.  We did significant work to remove the audit burden from many small companies.</P>
        <P>We are agreed on the issue of skills and we have devised and developed a national skills strategy.  It sets out the most challenging upskilling target the country has ever set and will result in the upskilling of 500,000 workers between now and 2020.  We have, through Skillnets and the F&Aacute;S one-step-up initiative, allocated significant resources over the past two to three years to dramatically change the level of engagement with existing workers and to enable existing workers to upskill.</P>
        <P>Some 80% of all existing workers will be working in 20 years&rsquo; time and our challenge is to enable them to gain an extra qualification while at work.  That is a big challenge for education and training providers, but it is one that we are keen to deliver.  The function of the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, who is straddling both the Department of Education and Science and my Department, is to implement that skills strategy and to facilitate synergies between the two Departments in the future.</P>
        <P>As the House will be aware, the Minister of State with responsibility for trade, Deputy McGuinness, has been active on the trade front and is particularly active on the WTO side.  Mention was made of agriculture earlier.  We are focused on the connection between agriculture, as a key sector in the economy in terms of job creation, and the value-added nature of the food industry, on which Enterprise Ireland is working flat out.  Enterprise Ireland has a strong, proactive approach with food companies.  I have been at many functions with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Coughlan, and the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, related to the research and development activities of many of our food companies such as Glanbia and Dairygold in terms of the nutritional health-enhancing foods, which are dear to my heart as many of the Deputies will be aware.  It is all about gaining increased market share.</P>

	<P>Economic migration is a challenging debate for us.  I have brought in a green card system to facilitate the attraction of high-skilled persons with their families to this society.  Only approximately 1,000 were facilitated last year since the scheme was introduced.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>However, I am conscious it is not a popular message to send out.  If we are serious about competitiveness, we must heed what multinationals such as Microsoft and Intel tell me when I visit, that the growing issue is procurement of skills and they will go where the skills are available.  Due to the post-11 September 2001 scenario in the States, such companies are encountering significant difficulty accessing skills outside the US.  Therefore, a properly managed migration policy is important and it is a factor.  When one looks at Google in Ireland, for example, with 1,500 employees in Dublin and 43 language competencies, one begins to see the complex nature of the modern Irish economy.  It is not one that lends itself to simplistic notions, one way or the other, and it creates its own challenges in terms of economic planning into the future.  However, in terms of sustainable migration policy, we have developed a good framework in this country and it is a policy we worked on with Forf&aacute;s, and the expert group on future skills needs, in terms of developing to meet skills deficits in a sustainable way regarding non-EU citizens coming into the country.  It is a framework that will continue to help us attract foreign direct investment.</P>
        <P>The foreign direct investment pipeline is still strong.  We are focusing on certain areas, including high-end manufacturing, internationally traded services and areas such as financial services, pharmaceuticals, bio-pharmaceutical, technology companies, information communication technologies, space, etc.  We are chasing existing clients to bring more mandates into the country and we are chasing new companies and asking them to consider locating in Ireland.  I am only back from the States where I was with representatives of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  We are developing greater synergies between the two in respect of our trade missions.</P>
        <P>Some 64% of investments in 2007 were located outside Dublin.  Our corporation tax rate of 12.5% is critically important.  This Government brought it down to 12.5%.  In fairness, former Minister Charlie McCreevy took no prisoners when he did it.  He was condemned and attacked at the time of that budget by certain politicians on the other side of the House but he was right to proceed with it because it has had an important bearing.</P>
        <P>Employment in IDA Ireland companies accounts for approximately 136,000 jobs.  The average salary from IDA supported investments in 2007 was almost &euro;44,000 or 19% above the average industrial wage of &euro;36,800, reflecting the higher quality and related higher skills of the new positions created by these investments.  IDA Ireland supported companies paid &euro;3 billion in corporation tax in 2007, accounting for 47% of the total corporation tax take of &euro;6.7 billion.</P>
        <P>I refer the House to a contribution penned by Alan Gray of Indecon to a recent competitiveness conference held at Farmleigh where he tracked American FDI investment in Ireland over the past six to seven years and the output.  He outlined significant increases in the value of US investments in Ireland compared to 2000, giving the lie to the story that it is all over and ending.  In terms of eastern Europe, we compare extremely favourably regarding both the value and volume of FDI emanating from the United States.</P>
        <P>However, it is clearly more challenging.  We will not be competing with China and India on wage rates.  When a company such as Allergan moves to China or Costa Rica, there are certain areas in which we will not be competing.  I do not think anyone in the House will suggest that we try to match the wages of China or Vietnam.  We will not do that.  Brain power and targeting certain key areas is the name of the game.  We look at China and India as big markets to which our own companies may go to see what niches they can establish and what portion of the market share they can get.</P><Col N="465"/>
        <P>We must watch our overall offering, such as cost competitiveness.  We have no argument in that regard.  This is a different economy now.  It is a far more value-added economy and the cost of living here is higher than it was ten or 15 years ago.  Therefore, we offer companies different value propositions, but we must ensure that the net package we offer is still beneficial and narrows the gap between ourselves and our competitors.  That is the issue.</P>
        <P>We must drive the Irish entrepreneurial story and really work behind quality Irish companies such as high-potential start-up companies and the scaling division of Enterprise Ireland, which selects companies with potential for growth and works with them actively on research and development, human resource, sales and marketing and management capability to drive them on.  Some 30 CEOs from the companies in the scaling division went to Stanford University to do a leadership for growth programme sponsored by Enterprise Ireland.  They are the kind of programmes that will make a difference to the growth of Irish companies in the future and we are clearly aware of the need for enhanced management capability on the indigenous side as well as sales and marketing.</P>
        <P><i>The New York Times</i> ran an article entitled &ldquo;Ireland is alive with enthusiasm for entrepreneurship&rdquo;.  In fact, I got a telephone call from <i>The New York Times</i> asking if I would give an interview about a company called Photo Nation Ireland Limited, which is based in Galway.  It developed the technology, beloved of all politicians, which takes the red eye out when Deputy Ring is being photographed.  <i>The New York Times</i> asked me quizzically how that technology originated in Ireland, of all places.</P>

        <P>The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, is working actively on the broadband issue.  We have made extraordinary progress in the past two years from what I accept was a low base and there are considerable challenges on the broadband agenda, but I am confident.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan&rsquo;s draft policy paper is currently being updated.  He held a major forum on it recently.  We will make considerable progress, particularly in terms of next generation broadband which is important.</P><Col N="466"/>

	<P>I speak on behalf of the Labour Party which broadly supports the motion.  However, some aspects of the motion are a cause of concern.  I do not intend to engage in destructive argument, but I hope to be constructive in my contribution.  It is important not to talk ourselves into a deeper recession than exists and we must acknowledge the strengths of the economy.  We hope people will still find our economy attractive and will be willing to invest in it.</P>
        <P>It is important we maintain the current taxation regime.  I remind the Minister that it was Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn who negotiated the 12.5% and who left our first budget surplus in place.  At the time we were creating 1,000 jobs a week.  The economy was very strong when it was handed over to the Fianna F&aacute;il regime.  I read the comments made by the Minister for Finance on our taxation returns that we are &euro;600 million out.  He basically referred to all the ills that occurred in the international area and the associated risks.  While issues such as credit and energy costs are relevant, it would be churlish of him and foolhardy of us not to admit that the Government has played a significant role in the current crisis.  The Government cannot act like Pontius Pilate and wash its hands of responsibility for its input, particularly with regard to some of its taxation measures, both direct and indirect, which have placed significant impositions on areas of the economy and threatened their viability and existence.</P>
        <P>In this context, ISME made a presentation to the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, where it outlined much of the red tape and bureaucracy involved with regard to the significant amount of legislation in the taxation, health and safety and industrial relations areas.  There are up to 1,000 items of legislation that must be addressed and taken into account by small businesses.  I know from experience what a business involving three people must address.  The bureaucracy is incredible and is a significant imposition.  The quicker we streamline and regularise the position and minimise the bureaucracy, the better because we are strangled by the regulations.</P>
        <P>The Minister is correct in saying that foreign direct investment is still very important for us.  We must continue to articulate this.  We have an excellent third level educational base and significant fourth level expertise and we must sell this aspect on world markets to remain competitive.  However, we must not forget the indigenous small industry sector.  This is particularly important in the rural context.</P>
        <P>Almost ten years ago I attended an IRD conference in Kiltimagh, Mayo, where a man spoke about the creation of six to eight jobs in the telecottaging area.  That was very important at the time.  The availability of broadband is very important for the creation of such jobs.  We cannot over-emphasise the importance of broadband availability in terms of competitiveness and the ability to be innovative, maintain communication with the outside world and create jobs.  We want to create jobs that will not just be good for the people in the local area and economy but that will contribute to sustaining the area and to the development of infrastructure in those areas.</P><Col N="467"/>
        <P>In this regard, the roll-out of broadband was a disaster.  The Government, particularly the former Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, must take full responsibility for this.  Broadband roll-out was a cock-up and it is wrong to say it was not.  The companies in the market gravitated towards the urban areas where there were significant profits to be made and rural areas were left to wait.  There are areas in Westmeath and Longford that are crying out for broadband.  People want to be able to do business from home.  Home-based businesses are important and provide an added impetus to competition.  We need broadband to be rolled out to the rural areas that are without it.  No area should be forgotten or isolated.</P>
        <P>Start-up industries must also be encouraged.  It is important that seed capital is available for such industries to provide them with an important boost.  I watched the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; the other night on which two young men described how they had to go to Silicon Valley to make a success of their enterprise, all for the want of &euro;20,000.  Nobody wants to see young people with the brainpower to achieve what those two young men achieved having to leave the country for encouragement.</P>
        <P>The Minister must inform Enterprise Ireland that taxpayers do not mind contributing &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000 to get more young people like this up and going.  We must get the vision right.  If the two young people I saw on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; could make &euro;2.5 million or &euro;3 million from selling their business, just imagine what can be achieved.  One of the young lads I saw is now going to be one of the main executives in the company which bought their business.  We should take note, as should the Minister for Education and Science, that one of these young lads bypassed the traditional educational route.  I am a traditionalist at heart, but we must abandon our traditional attitudes and open up.  If a young lad can achieve such success without a traditional education, it opens our eyes.  He is the type of young person we need and he has shown us the way forward in this context.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was shaken by Deputy Bannon&rsquo;s comment that the infrastructure in Longford and Westmeath was poor.  He is not very long in the D&aacute;il, but he was a while in the Seanad.  I am very proud of the infrastructure in Westmeath.  There are 75 acres marked down for an IDA Ireland park.  I have spoken to the executive of IDA Ireland and I am glad to be able to say that it is pressing for movement on the construction of a 25,000 sq. ft. facility, for which tenders will be in next week and which will, hopefully, be built and opened by the end of the year.  I do not mind who opens anything as long as someone does.</P>
        <P>Westmeath also has tremendous infrastructure in terms of recreational facilities and roads, for example, the N4 and N6.  The Athlone Institute of Technology is probably one of the most progressive institutes of technology.  I have discussed the issue of industry with the AIT and advocated the provision of an industry for Mullingar, which is particularly important in the context of the IDA Ireland park.  One facility will beget another.  Once we get something in one area, whether services, technology or IT, we will get more in another.  Just as a number of people in Athlone lost their jobs with Nexans, Mullingar had similar job casualties with the loss of Tarkett ten years ago.  This happens, but when it does, we must try to put in place replacement industries.  I have made that argument to IDA Ireland which listened carefully to me.  Deputy Bannon must fight for the same in Longford, his area.</P>
        <P>I remind the Minister that we have good infrastructure, but we need joined-up thinking from Government so that it will use some of the moneys available for transport to link the gateway towns of Athlone, Tullamore and Mullingar.  We have the infrastructure in place and all we need is the moneys to open the routes, approximately &euro;85 million to open the Athlone-Mullingar railway link and only &euro;1 million to open the Killucan link, which would take people off the road and contribute to enhancement of the environment, quality of life and the <Col N="468"/>reduction of carbon emissions.  This would reflect joined-up thinking by Government and that is what is needed.</P>
        <P>I strongly reject Deputy Bannon&rsquo;s implication that Longford-Westmeath lacks infrastructure.  Our local authorities have fought hard alongside Government to put the necessary infrastructure in place.  We should acknowledge that and not put on the poor mouth or b&eacute;al bocht.  We do not want to down-play what we have, but should go out and sell what it in a positive way.</P>
        <P>The international crisis will affect us, but we do not know how it will play out and for how long.  However, some of the current difficulties with our economy are of our own making.  The main drag on the economy is the near collapse of the house building sector.  The number of houses built in Ireland increased rapidly from 52,000 in 2001 to approximately 88,000 in 2006.  We must remember now that for each reduction in the number of houses built, a job is lost.  If we have 20,000 fewer houses, that is 20,000 fewer jobs.  We have put too many eggs in the one basket, but hopefully we have learned something from that.</P>
        <P>A national upskilling programme must be set in place quickly.  We do not want theoretical barriers to that.  As people lose jobs, they must not be left to stagnate, as happened in the 1980s.  We want them involved in upskilling straight away.  We must broaden our horizons in this regard.  There must be no restrictions on the opportunity to upskill.  For example, if young apprentices who are on their third or fourth study module fail an exam with F&Aacute;S, they can only repeat the exam twice.  That does not happen with regard to university students, who get two or three runs at an exam.  If that was the case, half the graduates that come out of universities would be excluded.  One gets two or three runs at it and gets the opportunity again.  Let us cut out that codology.  If somebody is willing to spend four years there, let us give them the opportunity.  We need upskilling straight away particularly given that there are threats to the manufacturing base.  We must acknowledge that they are there and ensure that people are upskilled and trained appropriately so that they can go into other challenging areas, such as IT and services areas.  This is what is going to be important and this is what the Labour Party will advocate quite strongly as we confront this crisis together because, after all, we all have a duty and obligation to ensure we work together in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity to address the D&aacute;il on the increasingly worrying issue of unemployment and this Government&rsquo;s mismanagement of the economy.  As a member of the Oireachtas Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, my colleague, Deputy Arthur Morgan, recently undertook a visit to east Cork, Waterford and Tipperary to visit some of the State&rsquo;s worst job loss black spots.  During that trip he, along with members of the Government parties, met with chambers of commerce, unions, workers, business people and community groups to establish what was or was not happening in these areas to bring about job creation.</P>
        <P>The report compiled out of that trip is a damning indictment of this Government&rsquo;s ability to keep and create jobs in this State.  Ten points were listed as being urgently needed to stimulate the local economy.  They include a full roll-out of broadband, an investment in incubator units and research and development facilities, the provision of adequate funding to local authorities to help reduce rates on businesses, ensuring that decentralisation proceeds, making land affordable, greater co-operation between Government agencies, extending gas lines, building a fast and efficient road and rail infrastructure and making education and training a priority, with investment in third-level facilities and upskilling courses.  These demands are not peculiar to that region.  From my constituency of Kerry North, to Dublin, to Donegal and right across this State, we are lagging behind in infrastructure and skills.</P><Col N="469"/>
        <P>This Government has been riding on the crest of an economic wave for the last ten years but what did it do with the surplus in our economy over that time?  It allowed our economy to become almost completely dependant on an unviable construction sector and put in no provisions for when that sector would slow, as it is doing now.  How foolish of a First World Government to invest everything in property.  How little it must know of international markets and economic history.</P>
        <P Just="Left">After ten years of pushing this sector, what have we got?  We have thousands of newly built houses with no road or rail infrastructure, not enough schools and no local community services.  We have a Third World health service.  We have no investment in the retraining of construction workers for alternative employment.  Essentially, we have failed to provide any of the seven pillars that lead to increased ability to compete and we are running out of money to provide them.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s short-sightedness and mismanagement of the economy can be seen in the promises made in the programme for Government, which include a reduction in PRSI.  With unemployment on the rise, the social insurance fund is needed more than ever.  Yet only last year, this Government wanted to slash contributions to it.  As recently as two weeks ago, Government officials said significant additional funds would be needed to meet growing unemployment payments.  The Government has yet to admit the folly of its PRSI plans.</P>
        <P>While we agree with the sentiment of this Private Members&rsquo; motion, we do not agree with some of the solutions put forward in it.  Competitiveness will be restored if we invest in infrastructure but wage moderation alone cannot control inflation. Workers&rsquo; rights cannot be the first point of call for sacrifice when we discuss competitiveness.  In most countries which lie ahead of us in the competitiveness tables, workers&rsquo; rights and conditions are protected as a content workforce is seen to contribute to a stable and successful economy.  Lower wages are not an option when the cost of living in this State is so high.</P>
        <P>I am also concerned at the reference to competition in sheltered sectors of the economy and public sector reform to boost efficiency and productivity.  We had a State-run communications network and airline.  They were opened to privatisation and we now have the worst broadband provision in Europe and vital flight routes are being pulled from rural airways because they are not considered sufficiently profitable.  Workers&rsquo; rights have been eroded and the threat of strikes is always present.  The public health sector is in the process of being reformed to boost efficiency and productivity and, again, we have seen what an absolute disaster that has caused for the State.  While I agree that our regulatory system is complicated and costly, we must be careful that in cutting some of the red tape, we do not create loopholes that can be exploited.</P>
        <P>Unemployment in Kerry is a serious cause for concern, as I am sure the Ceann Comhairle can testify.  The live register figures for February show there are over 1,000 more people signing on than there were 12 months ago.  The bulk of this increase has come from a series of closures and lay offs in Listowel and Tralee, among them, Dennys, Tillitson and Swiss Wire in Tralee and Contact Four in Dingle.  In February 2007, there were 1,069 people signing on in Listowel.  This figure has increased to 1,385, an increase of more than 300.  There were just over 3,178 people signing on in Tralee this time last year and that figure has increased to 3,500.  The number in Killarney is 1,449.  This makes these three towns among the worst in the country for unemployment and Kerry remains among the top three or four worst affected counties in the State.  Over 8,000 people are now on the live register in Kerry, which is an increase of 1,125 on the figure for February of last year.  This is despite the presence in successive Governments over the past 12 years of two Cabinet Ministers from the north and south of the county.</P>
        <P>What is particularly worrying is that the loss of jobs in traditional manufacturing and processing is not being compensated for by new jobs.  Time and again, I have raised the issue <Col N="470"/>regarding the lack of new investment in Kerry and, in particular, the failure to capitalise on the presence of the institute of technology and the technology park.  However, one of the factors I referred to earlier &mdash; the lack of broadband access in much of the county &mdash; is also clearly a factor in deterring such investment.</P>
        <P>I have raised this issue with the IDA on numerous occasions and I appreciate that genuine efforts are being made to redress the situation.  However, local people have little confidence in such reassurances in light of their most recent record and the frustration felt at the downscaling or ending of operations by some of the larger companies in the county.  I, along with Deputy McEllistrim from the Government side and Deputy Deenihan, will meet with the IDA later this month to discuss the situation.  All of us have worked together to try to bring about a situation where investment would come to the county and where the IDA would play a leading role.  Unfortunately, the record over the past five years and even before that has shown that little or no attention has been paid to our county.</P>
        <P>The slowdown in construction is also a factor, as is the issue of displacement and downward pressure on wages.  For the first time in many years, I am hearing reports of tradesmen considering travelling to England to find work.  I know of agencies which are trying to recruit local labour to work in London, particularly on the Olympic village.  With the growing uncertainty facing construction workers, the availability of other employment is essential.  The effects of this Government&rsquo;s over reliance on the construction industry and the property market are now becoming apparent.  It is also worth noting that following the boom in the construction sector over the past eight years, we now have a situation where speculators have built houses which are then rented back to local authorities or Health Service Executive areas to house people on local authority housing lists.  This is a clear sign of terrible mismanagement by the Government in its efforts to bring this about.</P>
        <P>It is unfortunate that the Government did more to bolster the property sector than it did to assist indigenous enterprises in the past ten years.  It has squandered the unprecedented wealth created, which could have been used to address the major infrastructural imbalance between east and west.  For example, the lack of access to broadband in many parts of Kerry and many parts of our rural communities and the disgraceful lack of a proper road and rail infrastructure are consistently cited as obstacles to investment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to raise this extremely important issue in the House even for only two and a half minutes.  I was shocked when I got a phone call recently from the relative of a 99 year old in a nursing home in County Cavan who has been asked to pay the increased charges that the nursing home wants from 1 January this year because the Minister and the HSE have decided that no further increases would be allowed under the subvention system.  This is supposed to be because the fair deal &mdash; or fairytale deal &mdash; that has been talked about has never been delivered.  In December 2006 it was first hinted that there would be a new fair deal for nursing home charges.  The details of that scheme were announced in February 2007 and we were advised that it would be brought through the Cabinet, D&aacute;il and Seanad and be in place for operation on 1 January 2008.  However, as of today we have not seen sight of that Bill and the Minister has refused to allow the subvention offices to <Col N="471"/>deal in a sympathetic and realistic way with such situations.  This is not the only case &mdash; I have several other letters.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, is here as the matter relates to the elderly.</P>
        <P>After nine years in a nursing home being covered by the pension and subvention, how can I say to this lady or her family that suddenly she must find the money, at the same time as the Minister has taken an increase of &euro;35,000 for herself?  I accept that does not apply to the Minister of State.  I refer to the Minister, Deputy Harney.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister, Deputy Harney, has not taken the increase either.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>She has agreed it.  At the same time she is asking the 99 year old person to pay the extra amount.  Another nursing home has a similar situation where a man has already got a bill for &euro;500 for the first ten weeks of this year.  It is absolutely disgraceful.  Are the elderly being asked to bear the brunt of the cutbacks and the other problems at a time when the better off are being made even better off?  Regardless of what the Minister of State has said all that has happened is that the ministerial salary increases have been postponed to September.  I urge the Minister of State to ensure the situation is rectified.  Some &euro;110 million was transferred from this section to prop up the overall HSE, which is unacceptable when the aged are being ordered to pay for something to which they are entitled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Today I tried to extract information from the Taoiseach on the status of the fair deal scheme.  He ends his time as Taoiseach as he began by keeping his cards close to his chest.  I could only get an indication &mdash; I could not call it a commitment &mdash; that the health (long-term residential care services) Bill would be published in this term.  Nothing was said to address the concern and distress caused to older people and their families by the current uncertainty over this scheme.  A debacle is the only word I can use to describe that the legislation is mired in problems.  I ask the Minister of State to confirm whether the &euro;110 million allocated to the scheme has now been diverted.  I also ask the Minister of State to where it has been diverted if that is the case.  Will it be used to provide alternative services for older people?</P>
        <P>In November 2007, nine organisations working with older people joined together to express their concern at the fair deal proposals.  They raised the lack of clarity about what older people would be entitled to.  They also stated the scheme was an erosion of the entitlement to State-funded long-term care in public nursing homes through the State&rsquo;s proposed claim to a proportion of all disposable income as well as up to 15% of the estate after death.  It seems that this property provision has caused the constitutional and other legal difficulties for the legislation.  That problem should have been obvious to the Minister, the Cabinet and the drafters of the proposed legislation.  The Government failed to heed the warnings and now &euro;100 million allocated to the scheme is to be diverted.  This is gross mismanagement and older people in nursing homes or those who expect to enter such care are being left in a state of doubt and confusion again.  Instead of proceeding with this scheme the Government should move towards direct provision of care for older people in their homes, the community and, where necessary, in public nursing homes.</P>
        <P>On a related matter, I deplore the decision of the HSE to close 12 respite beds for patients with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease in Cherry Orchard Hospital.  Approximately 24 individuals are affected, for many of whom residential care is not available.  Now even respite care is being taken away.  I urge the Minister of State to have that specific and disgraceful development addressed urgently.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="472"/>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I thank the Deputies for raising these questions as it provides me an opportunity to outline to the House the improvements made to the existing nursing home subvention scheme and the position in respect of the new nursing home support scheme, the fair deal.</P>
        <P>Government policy regarding older people is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and, where this is not possible, to support access to quality long-term residential care.  This policy approach is renewed and developed in the latest partnership agreement, Towards 2016.  The nursing home subvention scheme was introduced in 1993 to assist with the cost of private nursing home fees.  A subvention may be paid where a person has been assessed as needing nursing home care by the Health Service Executive and where the person has satisfied a means test.</P>
        <P>Since 1 January 2007 there are no longer three separate rates for subvention.  Persons who apply may receive any amount up to a maximum of &euro;300 per week.  The change in the rate means that many people who were not previously eligible for subvention may now qualify for a payment.  The payment of subvention is managed by the HSE under the Health Act 2004.  In 2007 the HSE finalised and circulated national guidelines to the local health offices, for the standardised implementation of the nursing home subvention scheme.  Under the guidelines, the assessment of means will now be carried out using a national standard financial assessment method.  In addition to the increased rate of basic subvention, a person may receive enhanced subvention.  This is a supplementary subvention, which may be paid by the HSE, to a person in or entering private long-term care.  The amount of enhanced subvention paid is at the discretion of the HSE and varies according to the cost of care and the circumstances of the applicant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.  There is a maximum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>Enhanced subvention should be used to develop consistency between the payment of subvention and the new nursing home support scheme, and to work towards equalisation of the level of support paid to people in different areas taking local prices and a person&rsquo;s means into account.  The HSE guidelines provide that an applicant for enhanced subvention will be subject to the means assessment.  Regarding the specific case raised by Deputy Crawford, I understand from the executive that the individual concerned is on the current maximum enhanced subvention rate.</P>
        <P>The new nursing home support scheme, a fair deal, was approved by Government and announced in December 2006.  The fair deal is designed to remove real financial hardship from many individuals and their families who, under the old system of nursing home subvention, are forced to sell or re-mortgage homes to pay for the cost of nursing home care.  This is the essence of the policy.</P>
        <P>Since December 2006, my Department has met groups and organisations, including the national federation of pensioners associations, the Irish Farmers Association, the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament and the social partners.  The Department also attended the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament AGM at its request and participated in a workshop on the new scheme.</P>
        <P>The Bill to provide for the scheme is currently being finalised by the Office of the Attorney General and I hope to publish it as soon as possible following Government approval.  On publication of the Bill, further engagement will take place with stakeholders on the details of the new scheme.  This will take place under the auspices of Towards 2016.  The subsequent presentation and passage of the legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas will be a matter of priority for me as I wish to make the benefits of the scheme available to older people as soon as possible.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The north east hospital situation is in crisis, including Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  Serious concerns raised by cancer X-rays have recently been brought to light.  There is no clarity and no objectivity and we do not know what is going on.  The HSE is releasing information bit by bit.  These concerns are serious and have been evident for some time.  The HSE has not appointed radiographers, which it ought to have done, as recommended by the former health board.  There has been a deficit of full-time professional staff to read X-rays and a lack of commitment by the HSE to the entire north east, particularly Drogheda and its hospital.</P>
        <P>I am deeply saddened by the news I heard tonight that the new north-eastern hospital will not be located in Drogheda but in County Meath, at Navan.  Drogheda will have a population of 90,000 people in the near future, it has rail links, motorway links, it is beside the airport and is at the centre of the growth of population.  The people of Drogheda and those in the surrounding county, as well as in east Meath, will absolutely resist the removal of the centre of excellence at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  That hospital has been run down by the HSE.</P>
        <P>Professor Carney, the leading professional cancer consultant in the north east for over 17 years, resigned last October because he was not consulted about changes being made to breast cancer services <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> staff at the hospital.  He recently withdrew his resignation, which the HSE did not accept.  I wish to quote directly from and place on the record of the House his letter of 7 March 2008, when he wrote to the chief executive of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  Professor Carney is a national figure dealing with oncology and cancer.  He is an absolute professional who is totally dedicated to the north east and has been for 17 years.  In his letter he states that he withdrew his resignation because:</P>
        <P LI="1">I now realise, for a variety of reasons, that it has not been possible to make the arrangements that would allow a smooth transition of care, particularly of patients currently undergoing active chemotherapy treatment, for newly diagnosed patients, or indeed for patients receiving chemotherapy for recurrent cancer.  Moreover, arrangements are not in place for the follow up and support of patients who have attended our clinic for a number of years and who, for one reason or another, have become dependent upon us.</P>
        <P LI="1">All of the above has led to considerable stress and uncertainty for patients, their family and for the oncology staff in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The HSE is an absolute disgrace.  It is running down the hospital and allowing a situation to pertain whereby the patients of the most eminent professor in oncology and cancer care in this country will not, in his medical opinion, be properly looked after.  Professor Carney is not being allowed to continue to treat those patients until the transition, as he points out in his letter, is in place.  It is unacceptable and is an appalling, shameful situation for which the Government is totally responsible.</P>
        <P>It is a sign of how bad things are that, having gone through the Celtic tiger era, the Government is now destroying a fantastic hospital in Drogheda, which employs more than 1,500 people.  Those people will not now be able to work in the place where they live but, more importantly, the cancer care to which patients are entitled, and which Professor Carney wants to provide, will not be provided.  He is not satisfied that adequate and proper arrangements are in place for their medical care.  This is the worst story that could ever be visited upon cancer <Col N="474"/>patients in the north east, many of whom are breast cancer sufferers.  They have been abandoned by the HSE and by the Government.  I ask the Minister of State to respond to this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  I welcome the opportunity to set out the current position to Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd regarding cancer services, with particular reference to the north east region.</P>
        <P>The HSE issued a statement on Monday, 31 March concerning radiology services in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, and Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Navan, which have emerged in the media in recent days.  The HSE has informed the Department that it is HSE policy, learned from recent events in relation to diagnostic services in the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, to ensure that if there are concerns regarding any aspects of patient care which are found to be valid, the patients and their families will be the first to be informed and supported.  This requirement takes precedence over all other considerations and, on that basis, the HSE will not be making further comment on the details of the review until these arrangements have been finalised.</P>
        <P>Regarding the small number of cases referenced in the HSE statement, arrangements are in train to ensure the necessary initial contacts and briefing, initiated via the relevant general practitioners, are in place.  It is expected that this very important phase will shortly be completed.  In tandem with this, the HSE is assessing the appropriate next steps to be taken.  This will take into account the input of external experts who have been consulted by the HSE and the advice from whom has only very recently been received.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised that it will make a full statement on the matter, including providing details of next steps, very shortly after the contacts referred to above are completed.  In making its statement, the HSE will be in a position at that stage to provide additional background information.  The HSE is very anxious to provide such additional information as it can appropriately make available to inform the public and allay fears.  However, it is entirely appropriate that the small group of those most affected are communicated with directly in the first instance.</P>
        <P>As the House is aware, Professor Tom Keane has been appointed to lead and manage the establishment of the HSE national cancer control programme.  Professor Keane has ambitious plans and has already made significant progress in implementation of the programme.  The key objective of the national cancer control programme is to ensure equity of access to services and equality of outcome, irrespective of geography.  This will involve significant realignment of cancer services to move from the present fragmented system of care to one which is consistent with international best practice in cancer control.</P>
        <P>The HSE has designated Beaumont Hospital and the Mater hospital as the two cancer centres in the managed cancer control network for the HSE Dublin and north-east region, which includes Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while at the same time allowing local access to services, where appropriate.  Where diagnosis and treatment planning is directed and managed by multidisciplinary teams based at the cancer centres, then much of the treatment, other than surgery, can be delivered in local hospitals, such as Our Lady of Lourdes.  In this context, chemotherapy and support services will continue to be delivered locally.  Cancer day-care units, including at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, will continue to have an important role in delivering services to patients as close to home as possible.</P>
        <P>An absolute priority is to retain the key cancer clinicians in the networks even in circumstances where their own hospitals may no longer be involved in cancer control.  Professor Keane has advised that meetings and discussions are under way with the eight designated centres and <Col N="475"/>with the non-designated hospitals currently providing cancer services to manage the transition.  These discussions have focused on identifying the capacity issues for the eight designated centres so that a detailed transitional plan can be put in place to facilitate the progressive, gradual and carefully managed transfer of services over the course of the next two years.</P>
        <P>The HSE has informed the Department that early in 2007 a strategic decision was made to develop links for both breast services and oncology services with Beaumont Hospital, which has a major academic link with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  Professor Carney tendered his resignation as a medical oncologist last October, as and from the 31 March 2008.  The HSE has informed the Department that Professor Carney&rsquo;s resignation from Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital was received with much regret by both management and staff within the hospital.  His expertise, experience and commitment to patients and staff have been very much appreciated.</P>
        <P>Following the receipt of Professor Carney&rsquo;s letter of resignation, management at Our Lady of Lourdes has been working with colleagues in Beaumont Hospital to put in place alternative arrangements for the transition of care of patients to a consultant medical oncologist from Beaumont Hospital.  A series of meetings took place and a plan has now been put in place which will allow both new and review patients to be seen by this consultant and his team in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital from 31 March 2008.</P>
        <P>From 1 July there will be a registrar in place on site specifically focused on oncology.  While the HSE is continuing with the three sessions per week by the consultant oncologist, previously provided by Professor Carney and now provided by a consultant from Beaumont, it is working to develop a full-time oncology post for Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, which would be linked with Beaumont Hospital.  The HSE has confirmed that there will be no interruption in the continuity of care that patients are receiving in the provision of oncology services at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to making the full range of cancer services available and accessible to cancer patients throughout Ireland in accordance with best international standards.  The developments which I outlined here today will ensure that a comprehensive service is available to all patients with cancer in the eastern region.</P>

    <Sect LHead="Suicide" RHead="Prevention"> 
      <sTitle>Suicide Prevention.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to raise the issue but, with all due respect to the Minister of State, I am very surprised the Minister for Health and Children or the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Devins, are not present.  However, I can understand this in the context of their disinterest towards the issue I am raising.  More than 500 people die by suicide annually.  In 2005, Reach Out, the national strategy for action on suicide prevention, was published and it made more than 90 recommendations which have been practically ignored.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP, was established but it only has a budget of &euro;3.5 million annually, which means it can continue with its current work but it cannot develop its service during 2008.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State not to say &euro;8 million is being spent on suicide prevention.  I refer only to the investment on the strategy for suicide prevention published in 2005.  In 1998 the national task force on suicide reported with recommendations and approximately &pound;4 million was spent on that but the Government has rowed back on this as well.  One of the key recommendations of that report was the appointment of suicide resource officers but their budget has been cut back.  Suicide resource officers were available in 11 areas but three of them are not being retained and, therefore, the number available has reduced to eight.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last year, the budget for the Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training, ASIST, programme for volunteers in suicide prevention was also reduced.  The Minister of State, Deputy <Col N="476"/>Devins, cancelled eight training courses under the programme because he would not pay for hotel accommodation.  The Government, therefore, reduced the funding for those who wanted to be involved in suicide prevention and who were anxious to obtain intervention skills in suicide prevention.  ASIST funding will reduce further this year because the co-ordinators of the two-day courses provided under the programme are the suicide resource officers.  However, three of them are not being reappointed in key areas because of the cutbacks and the Government&rsquo;s decision.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach in 2005 stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">At Government level, a task force will be established with representatives of relevant Government Departments to advise on and provide support in overcoming any barriers encountered in implementing the strategy.  Additional funding allocations will be made available for the coming years to support the strategy and to complement local and national efforts.</P>
        <P FLI="0">However, the Government is rowing back on this commitment.  I compliment the suicide prevention office on the work it is trying to do but it is being frustrated by a lack of funding.</P>
        <P>A sum of &euro;3.5 million is allocated to the NOSP while last year there were 500 deaths by suicide.  The Road Safety Authority receives an inadequate allocation of &euro;44.3 million and 338 road fatalities occurred last year.  Why the difference in the Government&rsquo;s approach to the prevention of suicide and road safety, which is given 15 times the allocation?  Why does the Government ignore the issue of suicide?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking the debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.  I assure the Deputy that the Government is fully committed to the implementation of suicide prevention initiatives and the further development of services to prevent and reduce further tragic loss of life.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>We should be encouraged by the progress to date in suicide prevention, in particular the launch of two important strategy documents: Reach Out &mdash; A National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention 2005-2014, which was launched in September 2005, and A Vision for Change, the report of the expert group on mental health policy, published in January 2006.  Since the establishment of the HSE&rsquo;s NOSP in 2005, which is responsible for the implementation of Reach Out, additional funding of &euro;3.55 million has been provided for its implementation.  This brought the total funding available to support suicide prevention initiatives to &euro;8 million and this level of funding continues into 2008.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the Minister of State not to say that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>The NOSP has an annual budget of &euro;4.5 million.  Initiatives funded by the office include developing and implementing national training programmes, developing mental health awareness campaigns, implementing recommendations arising from a review of bereavement services and supporting voluntary organisations working in the field of suicide prevention.</P>
        <P>A number of other suicide prevention initiatives are also delivered by the HSE for which funding does not come within the suicide prevention office&rsquo;s budget.  These include funding for 11 dedicated resource officers and deliberate self-harm response nurses in accident and emergency departments.  It should also be emphasised that a range of services such as general psychiatric services and primary care services are important in helping to prevent suicide.  These <Col N="477"/>services play a vital role in the drive to reduce the incidence of suicide and should be taken into account when considering the level of expenditure devoted to suicide prevention.  A total of &euro;1 billion is spent on mental health services.</P>
        <P>A fundamental aim of Reach Out is to prevent suicidal behaviour, including deliberate self-harm and to increase awareness of the importance of good mental health among the general population.  A Vision for Change considers mental health as a resource that needs to be promoted and protected.  The report views mental health awareness and promotion as relevant to the whole population, regardless of age, social status or either physical health or mental health status.  Thankfully the level of discussion and openness on mental health issues, including deliberate self harm and suicide has also increased significantly in recent years.  We do, however, need to ensure that public discussion and media coverage of suicide and deliberate self harm remains measured, well informed and sensitive to the needs and well-being of psychologically vulnerable and distressed individuals in our society.  In particular, we need to continue to work as a society to create a culture and environment where people in psychological distress feel they can seek help and support from family, friends and health professionals.</P>
        <P>Mental health awareness campaigns launched by the NOSP and the National Disability Authority, NDA, in 2007 further highlight the importance of taking care of our mental health and go a long way to helping to remove the stigma that is often associated with mental health issues.  These are very welcome developments.  Suicide affects all age groups and communities and reducing the present rate of suicide requires a collective, concerted effort from all age groups in society, health and social services, other professionals, communities and community leaders, voluntary and statutory agencies and organisations, parents, friends and neighbours.  I assure Deputies of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring the actions identified in Reach Out are implemented.</P>

      <sTitle>Special Areas of Conservation.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise the matter of the proposed off-wintering and destocking regime to be applied in Connemara in the Twelve Bens-Garraun and Maumturk mountain complex special area of conservation.  Proposing what will effectively be a six-month withdrawal of sheep from the Connemara mountain commonages cannot work in practice and while whoever drew up this directive might know something about protecting grouse, if grouse were in this area which they have not been for 20 years, they certainly know nothing about mountain sheep.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>To produce a regulation that all sheep have to be removed from mountain commonages from 1 November to 31 December and from 14 February to 13 May in reality means from 1 November through to mid-May as it would not be practical to have the sheep back on the mountains for the month of January.  This will not work.  How can hill farmers who have limited lowland accommodation, which is the situation in Connemara, accommodate their flocks off the hills for half the year?  These sheep will have to be fed when they are removed from their natural grazing area and with the increased cost of sheep nuts, now up to &euro;8 a bag compared with &euro;6.25 a bag last year, flock owners would not be able to sustain this extra cost.</P>
        <P>If a farmer is in REPS he or she cannot winter the sheep on the limited low lands.  The cost of providing sheds will be prohibitive, even if planning permission can be obtained for such buildings in special areas of conservation, which will be very difficult.</P>
        <P>Last Monday night, I attended a meeting in Maam Cross with 300 concerned farmers and it is a pity the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or his representative did not accept the invitation to attend as he could have received first-hand knowledge on <Col N="478"/>how these proposals cannot work.  One colourful speaker there in referring to the national parks and wildlife scheme, NPWS, said the acronym stood for &ldquo;no people west of the Shannon&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>A line in the reply from the Minister&rsquo;s office to the IFA&rsquo;s invitation to attend the meeting states: &ldquo;It has also been our experience that the convening of mass meetings of farmers, particularly in the evening, is not conducive to good and accurate communication and discussion of proposals.&rdquo;  When else could one have a meeting with farmers except in the evening?  It would have been productive if the Minister had bothered to attend or send a representative.</P>
        <P>I am all for preserving the environment and no one is more committed to the environment than I am, but we will not do it this way.  The majority of the people who attended the Maam Cross meeting will not support the Lisbon treaty and neither will the Connemara and west coast fishermen because they see European directives wiping out their livelihood and way of life.  Let us protect the grouse and other birds and wildlife by taking measures to control foxes, badgers and mink which are now major threats to bird life on the hills.  Grouse feed on fresh young heather shoots and, therefore, they need the heather to be grazed.</P>
        <P>If the hills are destocked it will lead to greater growth and more hill and heather fires in the summer months and, therefore, these proposed measures will be counterproductive for the protection of wildlife.  Last year the majority of calls to the Clifden fire brigade dealt mainly with mountain bog fires.  Some commonage is growing wild from undergrazing, such as the Shanakeela commonage of approximately 1,500 acres with approximately 550 ewes.  The heather there is growing strong and wild.</P>
        <P>Look at what happened in the Burren.  Under a directive a number of years ago, cattle had to be taken off the Burren.  The hazel and other brambles came up and people are now trying to put cattle back on the Burren to control this as the Burren was controlled in a natural manner for thousands of years.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to meet the Connemara hill farmers and to work with the IFA to establish a satisfactory solution to this problem in everyone&rsquo;s interest.  We need the co-operation of everyone concerned in the interest of the environment and who better to protect the environment than the people who have been doing this for generations.</P>
        <P>Once sheep are taken off their natural habitat on the mountains for six months of the year it will be impossible to put them back because mountain cross-bred scotch ewes are bred for grazing on mountain commonage.  I appeal to my fellow Galway TDs, none of whom was able to attend the meeting in Maam Cross on Monday night, to ensure this directive does not go through on 1 November because it will be the death knell for sheep farming in the traditional manner in the Connemara mountain range.</P>
        <P>I am very disappointed, although not for the sake of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Hoctor, who has been put in the House tonight to take every Adjournment matter.  Her office has nothing to do with the matter I raise and she will make a reply prepared for her without any reference to the serious points I raise.  I wish, however, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or someone responsible would have the manners to come here and deal with this serious problem.  They did not have the manners to attend the meeting at Maam Cross on Monday night.  I assure the Minister of State that this will not work and I ask her to take this message back.</P>

	<P>I am glad of this opportunity to provide some background to the agri-environment measures to apply in the Twelve Bens-Garraun and Maumturk mountain complex special areas of conservation, in addition to providing clarification on the further measures that are to be implemented.  These measures are an effort to meet fully the requirements set by a European Court judgment in 2002.  The court ruled that:</P>
        <P LI="1">[B]y failing to take the measures necessary to safeguard a sufficient diversity and area of habitats for the red grouse and by failing to take appropriate steps to avoid, in the Owenduff Nephin Beg complex special protection area, the deterioration of the habitats of the species for which the special protection area was designated, Ireland has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 3 of Council Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds and Article 6(2) of Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Major efforts are being made by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, in co-operation, to address the court finding.  These Departments took a number of steps to try to reduce damage to red grouse habitat across commonages generally, and in the Owenduff-Nephin Beg ranges specifically where an intensive and generously funded agri-environmental programme of measures has been in operation for some years.  Almost all farmers in the area have co-operated fully in implementing these measures, which include two periods of off-wintering for sheep between November and May.  I acknowledge their co-operation.</P>
        <P>In addition, since 2005 the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has been evaluating the condition of habitat for red grouse in commonage and non-commonage land throughout the country, with particular focus on sites found to be damaged in the initial commonage framework planning exercise.  Notwithstanding these efforts, the Commission has pursued Ireland for full compliance with the ruling and has taken the necessary preliminary steps to refer Ireland to court for a fine for failure to comply.</P>
        <P>In particular, the Commission continues to be concerned that the detailed monitoring I mentioned has established that no recovery has taken place to the extensive areas damaged in the Twelve Bens-Garraun and Maumturk mountain complex special areas of conservation despite the commonage framework plan and the existence of schemes such as the rural environmental protection scheme.</P>
        <P>As a result, the two Ministers have agreed to put in place the following additional measures to deliver recovery.  It is intended there will be a five-month off-wintering period in commonages in the Twelve Bens-Garraun complex special area of conservation and the Maumturk <Col N="480"/>mountain complex special area of conservation similar to that applying in Owenduff-Nephin Beg.  This should be in place for five years, from 1 November to 31 December and from 14 February to 13 May annually, commencing on 1 November 2008.  Farmers in these areas will be required to comply with the new farming conditions by amending their existing REPS plan or entering the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government&rsquo;s national farm plan scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The revised plans will ensure the commonage is grazed sustainably and that the off-wintered stock can be managed on the private land over the winter period.  The level of sustainable stock numbers in the open commonage period and on privately owned SACs will be assessed by the farm planner taking into account the farmer&rsquo;s share, where relevant, the habitats involved and the condition of the habitats.  Farmers who join the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government&rsquo;s farm plan scheme will be compensated on the model that has been successfully operated in the Owenduff-Nephin Beg SPA, through compensation for each destocked ewe &mdash; below the level of five ewes per hectare over the whole farm &mdash; or the off-wintering of ewes which requires the provision of foodstuff by farmers.  REPS farmers are entitled to substantial payments under the scheme.</P>
        <P>During the coming weeks both Departments will arrange a series of local meetings or clinics in the area concerned in order that these measures and the necessity for them can be explained to farmers on an individual basis.  The Ministers for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government believe these measures are necessary to secure the closure of the outstanding infringement proceedings against Ireland.  I add the warning that if the measures set out are not implemented, Ireland is likely to be referred to the court and face very large fines for its failure to comply with EU legislation.</P>

	<P>Rent supplement is administered on my behalf by the Health Service Executive (HSE), as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The tenant makes the application for rent supplement and the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant in all cases. Payment is made to the tenant in most cases, it is the property of the tenant in all cases and is specifically for the benefit of the tenant to assist them with their accommodation needs. In the minority of cases where payment is made direct to a landlord, this is done to facilitate the tenant.</P>
        <P>Rent supplement has over the years developed beyond the original objective of providing short-term assistance with accommodation. A significant number of people have now come to rely on rent supplement for extended periods, including people on local authority housing lists. For this reason, the scheme has to be viewed in the context of overall housing policy, particularly in the case of long-term claimants.</P>
        <P>In response to this situation, the Government has introduced new rental assistance arrangements which include the rental accommodation scheme (RAS). This gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more, on a phased implementation basis. Housing authorities can meet the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, a public/private partnership type rental accommodation scheme.</P><Col N="482"/>
        <P>When the new rental assistance arrangements have been fully implemented it is expected that in excess of 30,000 individuals will have transferred from the rent supplement scheme to the local authorities under the rental accommodation scheme or other social housing schemes. This will enable the rent supplement scheme to revert to its original objective, namely that of a short term income support scheme.</P>
        <P>I intend to keep the rent supplement scheme under review and my Department will be working closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in ensuring that RAS meets its objective of catering for those on long term rent supplementation while enabling rent supplement to return to its original role of a short-term income support.</P>

	<P>The telephone allowance is a component of the household benefits package which also includes the electricity/gas allowance and free television licence schemes. The package is generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test. It is also available to people aged under 66 who are in receipt of certain disability social welfare payments or carer&rsquo;s allowance. There are currently some 355,000 customers in receipt of household benefits at an annual cost of &euro;317 million.</P>
        <P>The primary objective of the telephone allowance scheme is to ensure access to help in an emergency and to provide an element of security. A secondary objective is to encourage social contact and to assist in the prevention of social isolation for those living alone.</P>
        <P>The Department has endeavoured to meet the demands of deregulation, notably in the telecoms market, where it supports multiple providers within the fixed-line telephone business.</P>
        <P>A restructuring of the telephone allowance to a cash value was undertaken in 2003 and this has facilitated the inclusion of additional providers in the scheme since July 2004. The scheme was further extended to include mobile phones in April 2007 as a result of improvements announced in Budget 2007. Since then, customers have the choice to either opt for a direct credit to a telephone company for their landline or a cash payment in respect of their mobile phone. This means that it is no longer necessary for a person to have a fixed line phone in order to benefit from the telephone allowance. There are currently some 15,000 customers availing of the mobile phone option.</P>
        <P>In addition, the value of the telephone allowance was increased in line with general price increases in August 2007 from &euro;296 per annum to &euro;310.80 per annum.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to extend the scheme further to incorporate broadband services for older people. However, where people access the internet using a landline, the tele phone allowance applies to their bill usage and will cover the cost of calls or internet usage up to the level of their allowance. My Department is currently examining how best to implement this commitment in cases where a landline does not exist and customers are not availing of their allowance in respect of a mobile phone.</P>

	<P>The primary objective of my Department&rsquo;s information policy is to ensure that all citizens are made aware of the wide range of schemes and services available and that they are kept informed of changes and improvements as they occur.</P>
        <P>The  Department operates a network of approximately 130 local and branch offices throughout the country.  Each Local Office has officers who are dedicated to providing information and are available to explain supports and services to people.  This locally based service is supported by a central Information Unit which operates a LoCall information line (1890 66 22 44) which customers may call for information and guidance on their entitlements.</P>
        <P>The Department produces a comprehensive range of information leaflets and booklets covering each social welfare payment or scheme which are available in a wide range of outlets, including Social Welfare Offices, Citizens Information Centres and Post Offices.  Booklets are also available from the LoCall Leaflet Request Line 1890 20 23 25.</P>
        <P>In addition, information on all our schemes and services is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, www.welfare.ie.  Information leaflets can be downloaded from this site or a request can be made online for a booklet to be posted out.</P>
        <P>A pro-active approach is taken in advertising schemes and services by using a mix of national and provincial media and through fact sheets, posters, direct mailshots and advertising on plasma screens in approximately 80 Credit Unions nationwide.  Nationwide advertising campaigns are undertaken periodically to promote greater awareness of schemes or to highlight changes to particular schemes and services.</P>
        <P>Presentations and talks are given by staff of the Department to various interest groups relevant to their needs.  Staff also attend exhibitions and seminars throughout the country promoting information on social welfare rights and entitlements.</P>
        <P>The Department works closely with voluntary and community organisations involved in an information giving role.  A number of such organisations receive funding on an annual basis towards the cost of providing information on welfare rights and services for their target groups.</P>
        <P>The Citizens Information Board, which comes under the aegis of my Department, is the national information agency with responsibility for supporting the provision of independent information and advice on the broad range of social services including social welfare services.  Information is provided through Citizen Information Centres and other offices throughout the country, through a phone service which operates from 9am to 9pm Monday to Friday, and on the website at www.citizensinformation.ie.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that my Department is taking all necessary steps to ensure that people are made aware of their entitlements.</P>

        <Quest> the position in relation to the review process regarding new guidelines which was to be completed by 10 March 2008 on people returning to Ireland having being born here and other EU citizens coming <Col N="484"/>to Ireland to seek the same social welfare benefits; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004. The reason for the introduction of the habitual residence condition was to ensure that persons who have not worked in Ireland or who have not established habitual residence in Ireland cannot avail of assistance schemes or child benefit. The restriction is not based on citizenship, nationality or any other factor. The question of what is a person&rsquo;s &ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo; is decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law, which sets out the grounds for assessing individual claims.</P>
        <P>These grounds are now specified in Section 30 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007. Each case received for a determination on the Habitual Residence Condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case. Any applicant who disagrees with the decision of a Deciding Officer has the right to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>
        <P>EU legislation prohibits discrimination between nationals of EU member states in the context of freedom of movement of workers and their access to social security or social assistance entitlements. Therefore national legislation must not differentiate between Irish nationals and EU nationals in the application of the Habitual Residence Condition. Irish nationals returning to live here, on a permanent basis, should experience no difficulty in meeting the requirements of the Habitual Residence Condition.</P>
        <P>The operation of the condition was reviewed by my Department in 2006 and the report of the Review was published on 1st February 2007. The full content of the Review may be accessed on the Department&rsquo;s website www.welfare.ie. The process undertaken to amend the existing guidelines, in the light of the report of the Review is now in its final stages.</P>

	<P>The case referred to by the Deputy concerns the rights of a person who has undergone gender reassignment surgery to recognition of her acquired gender. In particular, the person in question sought a declaration pursuant to section 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 that the Civil Registration Act 2004 is incompatible with the provisions of Articles 8, 12 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights in failing to allow for a correction to the person&rsquo;s birth registration.</P>
        <P>In a High Court judgement delivered on 19 October 2007, the judge indicated that he intended to issue a declaration of incompatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights. Section 5(3) of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 provides that a copy of any order containing such a declaration be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas within 21 sitting days of the date when the order is made.</P><Col N="485"/>
        <P>The judge made his order at a hearing on 14 February 2008 and the perfected order was issued on 10 March 2008. The order of the court contains a declaration pursuant to Section 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 that Sections 25, 63 and 64 of the Civil Registration Act 2004 are incompatible with the obligations of the State under the European Convention on Human Rights by reason of their failure to respect the private life of the Applicant as required by Article 8 of the Convention in that there are no provisions which would enable the acquired gender identity of the Applicant to be legally recognised in this jurisdiction. The judge also ordered that the execution of the judgment be stayed for a period of two months from the date of perfection of the order and, in the event of an appeal that execution be further stayed until the final determination of such appeal.</P>
        <P>While the Deputy refers to the introduction of legislation to enable transgendered persons to obtain new birth certificates reflecting their new sexual identity, the judgment has implications for a wide range of legislative and policy areas including taxation, social welfare, pensions, family law, criminal law, equality, employment, sport, financial services, health, education and so on. As the judgment of the High Court is the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Court, it is not appropriate for me to comment further at this time.</P>
        <P>I would, however, point out to the Deputy that Section 5(2) of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 provides that a declaration of incompatibility does not affect the validity, continuing operation or enforcement of the existing law relating to civil registration.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88, 90, 120, 127 and 151 together.</P>
        <P>The CORI Justice annual socio-economic review published last week  sets out a comprehensive and detailed analysis of developments in Ireland in recent years and the challenges Ireland faces to achieve a fairer society. I welcome the review and its contribution to shaping policy priorities to bring about a more inclusive society.</P>
        <P>The review acknowledges the significant progress that has been made in lifting people out of poverty.  The &ldquo;poverty line&rdquo; used in the review refers to the income threshold based on a percentage of average median income. This percentage is 60 per cent for the EU threshold. People with incomes below the 60 per cent threshold are regarded by the EU as being &ldquo;at risk of poverty&rdquo;, relative to the prevailing living standards of the countries where they reside. Whether people &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; are actually in poverty depends on other factors such as degree to which their income is below the threshold, the duration of low income, employment participation, family responsibilities, disabilities, housing and access to other resources and services. A high proportion in this category in more developed and prosperous countries such as Ireland are not experiencing actual poverty.</P>
        <P>For example, 60 per cent of median income for a family of two adults and two children in Ireland in 2004 (latest comparable figures available) was 17,802 euro.  By comparison, this threshold was four times higher than that for Bulgaria which was 4,269 euro and significantly higher than that for a number of other EU countries.  This means that many classified as &ldquo;at risk of poverty&rdquo; in Ireland have incomes and purchasing power that would put them well above the &ldquo;at risk of poverty&rdquo; threshold in many other EU countries.  To provide a more balanced view of the situation the EU Commission now publishes a table giving the levels of the 60 percent threshold for all EU countries adjusted for purchasing power.</P>
        <P>For the UN, the percentage of average median income used is 50 per cent. Using the latest EU SILC figures for 2006, 9.1 per cent overall were below the 50 per cent threshold, compared to 18.5 percent below the 60 per cent threshold.</P>
        <P>The consistent poverty measure, developed by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), measures actual poverty and deprivation as compared to relative income.  It is used in Ireland as the basis for setting objectives and targets and measuring progress under the national anti-poverty strategies and national action plans. .A person with income below 60 per cent of median income is regarded as being in consistent poverty if he or she also experiences deprivation in relation to two out of 11 items considered essential for a basic standard of living in Ireland. The importance and value of this type of measure is now recognised at EU level.  Work is in progress to develop a clear and consistent basis for its application EU wide to complement the &ldquo;at risk of poverty&rdquo; measure in providing a more balanced and accurate analysis of the overall poverty situation.</P>
        <P>There is, however, no acceptable level of poverty and tackling poverty and social exclusion remain key priorities for the Government.  The degree of progress made in recent years, however, augurs well for what can be achieved in the future.  For example, unemployment in the last quarter of 2007 at 4.5 per cent and long term unemployment at 1.2 per cent are among the lowest in the EU.  Between 1997 and 2008 spending on social welfare increased from &euro;5.7 billion to &euro;17 billion. The impact of these changes has resulted, for example, on the basis the most recent information available, in the consistent poverty rate being reduced from 8.2 per cent in 2003, when the EU-SILC survey was first introduced, to 6.5 per cent in 2006.</P>
        <P>Looking to the future, the overall goal of the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion (NAPinclusion) 2007-2016 and the social inclusion commitments in the National Development Plan is to reduce the number of persons experiencing consistent poverty to between 2 per cent <Col N="487"/>and 4 per cent by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016. Twelve high level strategic goals and over 150 detailed targets are designed to achieve this aim. They cover a range of services that includes early childhood development and care, education, health and long-term care, housing, income support, employment supports.</P>
        <P>However, experience has shown that more effective outcomes can be achieved by an integrated approach that focuses on the multifaceted needs of people and by greater coordination of policies and programmes to meet those needs.  The NAPinclusion addresses this challenge through adopting a lifecycle stage approach, in line with Towards 2016, with specific measurable goals set for each lifecycle group: children; people of working age; older people and people with disabilities; and their communities.</P>
        <P>Ending child poverty is a particular priority.  Budget 2008, for example, included &euro;194 million improvements in income supports to combat child poverty focused on increases in the early childcare supplement and in child benefit. Further such improvements for families with children included increases in the family income supplement, in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance and the school meals scheme.</P>
        <P>Employment is the main route of poverty. Most children in poverty or at risk of poverty are in households where parents are not in employment or in low income employment. A major priority in the strategies is to remove obstacles and disincentives to employment for those of working age such as access to education and training, income support, health, housing, transport, and lack of child care services through an integrated policy approach at both national and local levels. Provision for carers is also being significantly improved. These actions are specifically targeted at those of working age that are identified in the CORI review as being most vulnerable to poverty and social exclusion, including the working poor, lone parents and people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>A further major priority is to ensure that older people, who are most dependent on income support, health and other relevant services, have an adequate standard of living and a good quality of life. Budget 2008 has taken the first step to fulfilling the Programme for Government commitment to achieving a pension of at least 300 euro per week by 2012 by increasing the State Pension (Contributory) by 14 euro a week to 223.30 euro and the State Pension (Non- Contributory) by 12 euro a week to 212 euro. Since 2002, the level of the State Pension (Contributory) has increased by over 147.30 euro to 223.30 euro. These measures have contributed to reducing consistent poverty among this group by almost a third from 3.1 per cent in 2005 to 2.2 per cent in 2006.  The proportion of older people below the EU &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; threshold has also more than halved from 29.8 in 2003 per cent to 13.6 per cent in 2006.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My priority, in working with Government to deliver the NAP inclusion over the coming years, is to build on the significant and visible progress already made in reducing poverty. It will involve, in particular, delivering real improvements in living standards and well-being for the most vulnerable in our society and continued investment in a range of measures to bring about the fairer and more inclusive society to which we all aspire. Full account will be taken of CORI&rsquo;s analysis and recommendations in the further development of policies and programmes to achieve these goals.</P>

	<P>Rent supplement is administered on my behalf by the Health Service Executive (HSE) as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur. Rent limits are set at levels that enable the different eligible household types to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State. The objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation having regard to the size of the household.  There are currently over 61,000 rent supplements in payment. Some 52,000 have been awarded since the current rent limits were set in January 2007. This suggests that the limits are set at reasonable levels at present.</P>
        <P>Setting maximum rent limits higher than are justified by the open market would have a distorting effect on the rental market, leading to a more general rise in rent levels. This in turn would worsen the affordability of rental accommodation unnecessarily, with particular negative impact for those tenants on lower incomes, including people in low wage employment. Notwithstanding these limits, under existing arrangements the HSE may, in certain circumstances, exceed the rent limits. This discretionary power ensures that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme and specifically protects against homelessness.</P>
        <P>In January 2007 a review was completed of the maximum levels of rent which a person may incur and still be eligible to receive rent supplement. The purpose of the review was to inform the process of setting new limits, applicable from January 2007 until 30 June 2008. The review included consultation with the HSE, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Central Statistics Office, the Private Residential Tenancies Board and voluntary agencies working in this area. This process ensures that the new rent limits reflect realistic market conditions throughout the country. Arising from the review, rent limits were adjusted upwards, from January 2007, for a number of household types in 14 counties at an annual cost of &euro;13 million. I intend to have rent limits reviewed this year with a view to implementing any revision found to be necessary, from 1 July 2008. A consultative approach will be used to conduct this review.</P>

        <Quest> the arrangements in place to assist carers to re-engage with the workforce or training or education after the death of the person they are caring for; and the way the income needs of long-term carers are met by his Department in these circumstances. </Quest>

	<P>Persons in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant may engage in employment, self employment, training or education outside the home for up to 15 hours per week and still be considered to be providing full-time care and attention for the purposes of the schemes.  This enables carers to retain an attachment to the labour market while they are caring if their circumstances allow.  Those carers who avail of this facility are likely to remain in the workforce or in education or training when their caring role ceases.</P>
        <P>Carer&rsquo;s allowance recipients who have ceased caring duties may be eligible to apply for the back to work allowance or back to education allowance schemes.  The back to work allowance scheme enables social welfare customers to return to the workforce in either paid employment or self-employment and retain a proportion of their social welfare payment over a number of years.</P><Col N="489"/>
        <P>The back to education allowance scheme is an educational opportunities scheme for social welfare customers who wish to return to education at either second or third level.</P>
        <P>The objective of the scheme is to enhance the employability skills of vulnerable groups who are distant from the labour market.  Participants in the scheme receive a standard weekly rate of payment equivalent to the relevant social welfare payment they were in receipt of prior to participation in the scheme.</P>
        <P>Budget 2007 provided for significant structural reforms to introduce new arrangements whereby people in receipt of a social welfare payment, other than carer&rsquo;s allowance or benefit, who are also providing someone with full time care and attention, can retain their main welfare payment and receive another payment, depending on their means, the maximum of which will be equivalent to a half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>Similarly, people currently in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s allowance, who may have an underlying eligibility for another social welfare payment, can transfer to that other payment and continue to receive up to a half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance. The back to education allowance scheme is one of the payments which can be paid in addition to half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Those in receipt of a social welfare payment in addition to a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance will continue to be supported by the Department with their primary payment when their caring role has ceased.</P>
        <P>My Department addresses the income needs of long-term carers who are no longer in a caring role based on their individual circumstances.  Some carers will return to the workforce and will no longer require income support, others may avail of some of the employment or educational supports offered by my Department.  Older carers may be in receipt of a state pension from my Department and this payment will continue when caring ceases.</P>
        <P>I will keep the supports for carers available from my Department under review in order to continue to improve the schemes and ensure that commitments in relation to income support are delivered.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92, 117 and 145 together.</P>
        <P>Rent Supplement is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive. The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short- term income support to eligible tenants living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</P><Col N="490"/>
        <P>The tenant makes the application for rent supplement and the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant in all cases. Payment is made to the tenant, it is the property of the tenant and is specifically for the benefit of the tenant to assist them with their accommodation needs. Approximately 20% of rent supplemented tenants have chosen to have rent supplement paid direct to their landlord. These arrangements are made at the request of the tenant and are usually a simple matter of personal budgetary/income management convenience for the tenant.</P>
        <P>The Department is committed to effective co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners, the PRTB and also with the local authorities, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Details of rent supplemented tenancies have for many years been supplied to the Revenue Commissioners, in a format agreed with them, including details of payments made in respect of tenancies where landlords were resident outside the state. Details were also supplied in respect of rent supplement paid directly to non-resident landlords. Tax collection is of course the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners and my department has no responsibility in this regard. Although the department does not have a facility to withhold tax from rent supplement paid directly to non-resident landlords, the Revenue Commissioners can use the data which we supply to them to check tax compliance in relation to all landlords whose tenancies are rent supplemented.</P>
        <P>The Finance Act 2007 obliges the department to collect and supply the Revenue Commissioners with Landlord PPS or other Revenue Reference Number. The Department is endeavouring to find a solution that would allow it to meet these requirements. Issues, including legal and administrative issues, associated with the collection and recording of landlord PPS numbers on the Department&rsquo;s IT systems, are being examined. Liaison continues with the Revenue Commissioners in relation to all of these matters.</P>
        <P>The Department supports the requirement that tenancies facilitated by rent supplement should be registered with the PRTB and is working co-operatively with the PRTB to achieve this. To that end my Department provides the PRTB with details of rent supplement payments to enable them identify tenancies that are not registered and take any follow-up action necessary.</P>
        <P>I consider that the existing co-operation between the Department and the other government departments and agencies continue to produce positive and effective outcomes which have resulted in better housing solutions for long term rent supplement recipients and supports the local authority in meeting their responsibilities in relation to housing standards. It has also identified key groups of landlords whom both the Revenue Commissioners and PRTB can target with regards compliance with their respective legislation.</P>

        <Quest> if he will confirm a current investigation by his Department which found that 2% of non-contributory State pensions were improperly claimed; if measures are in place in his Department to recover fraudulent claims; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>A key objective of my Department&rsquo;s control strategy is to ensure that the right person is paid the right amount of money at the right time. As part of this strategy, my Department undertakes surveys of the levels of fraud and error to identify the types of claims which should be prioritised for review. The process involves a review of a random sample of cases, generally in the region of 1,000, to assess the underlying levels of fraud and error with action being taken by scheme managers to address the risks identified. When a survey is completed the results are extrapolated and are <Col N="491"/>used to provide the overall fraud and error rate in terms of the percentage of cases affected and the percentage of annual expenditure in the scheme attributed to fraud and error.</P>
        <P>A fraud and error survey of the State Pension (Non Contributory) scheme was recently completed to determine the level of fraud and error within that scheme. The State Pension (Non Contributory) scheme has a customer base of 97,000 pensioners and for the purpose of this survey 1,008 cases were reviewed. Cases were randomly selected to show representation across a range of parameters including region, gender, age, means etc.  The result of the survey confirmed that the level of fraud was extremely low with only one case out of the 1008<?oasys _jy ?>(0.1%) deemed to be fraudulent. An error rate of 1.9% was identified and mostly related to cases with means. The majority of these cases were reduced by &euro;10 per week or less. The outcome of the survey confirms that the risk control policy in place for State Pension (Non Contributory) is working effectively.</P>
        <P>All overpayments relating to fraudulent claims are actively pursued. In 2006 a new debt management strategy was developed for the Department to pursue the recovery of debt, to maximise recovery levels with due regard to value for money and with particular emphasis on recovery from people no longer dependent on social welfare payments.</P>
        <P>I am committed to ensuring that social welfare payments are available to those who are entitled to them. I am also determined to ensure that abuse of the system is prevented and is dealt with effectively when detected. In this regard the control programme of my Department is carefully monitored and the various measures are continuously refined to ensure that they remain effective.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 102 together.</P>
        <P>The principal child-centred income support is child benefit, payable in respect of children up to the age of 16 years and to age 19 in the case of children who are in full time education or suffering from a long-term disability.   Payment is not affected by parental means or employment status.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s other main child income supports are the qualified child increase, paid in addition to social welfare payments and family income supplement, paid to low-income employees working a specified minimum number of hours per fortnight and who have at least one qualified child.</P>
        <P>The number of FIS recipients has substantially increased in recent years, from just over 12,000 at the end of December 2002 to the current figure of almost 23,000.  My Department is currently undertaking a project to determine if, despite this increase in take up, there are significant numbers of qualifying families who have not yet availed of this payment. This project is expected to report later in 2008.</P><Col N="492"/>
        <P>In addition, the early childcare supplement, paid by my department on behalf of the Office of the Minister for Children in respect of all children under 6 years of age who receive CB, also makes a significant contribution to recipient families.</P>
        <P>For a number of years, government policy has been to invest additional resources in child benefit.  This policy focus was driven, in part, by the recognition that the loss of qualified child increases by social welfare recipients on taking up employment could act as a disincentive to availing of work opportunities.  In terms of tackling work disincentives, the shift towards child benefit has been significant.  For example, in 1994 child benefit represented 29% of the total child income support payment for a four child family and is now 64%.  In other words, a family will now only lose 36% of their child income support when a welfare recipient loses entitlement to a primary social welfare payment.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of an earlier Social Partnership agreement the National Economic and Social Council was asked to examine the feasibility of merging the family income supplement with qualified child increase with a view to creating a single second tier child income support.  This commitment to examining such a change was subsequently embodied in the current social partnership agreement &lsquo;Towards 2016&rsquo;.  NESC commissioned John Sweeney to bring forward proposals for child income support and his research paper was received towards the end of 2007.  NESC did not reach agreement on the proposals.</P>
        <P>The broad objectives of child income support are to bring about an improvement in the relative overall position of families with children compared with single persons or childless couples and to alleviate child poverty.   In considering future policy, it is important to keep in mind the multiple objectives behind the provision of such support and to maintain the correct balance between child benefit and more selective measures. Dr Sweeney&rsquo;s research paper will make an important contribution to this process.</P>

	<P>The transfer of certain functions from the HSE to my Department is a major programme that has implications for important services and also affects, on a personal level, the staff delivering these services. Accordingly, the programme to implement the transfer is being managed in a careful and comprehensive manner.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Industrial Relations considerations associated with this transfer, a specific industrial relations process has been put in place to manage this element of the transfer process. A Joint Liaison Group was established involving SIPTU, IMPACT, the HSE, the Department of Health and Children and my Department. My Department is also involved in discussions with the unions representing staff in the Department through the Departmental Council.</P>
        <P>The Joint Liaison Group has met very intensively over the last six months. An independent chairman has been appointed to facilitate the negotiations. The relevant Departments including my own and the HSE are aiming to reach a collective agreement with the trade unions in relation to the transfer. There has been a productive and meaningful engagement by all the parties involved. While there has been progress on some issues during this process a number of issues remain to be resolved.</P><Col N="493"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98, 100 and 122 together.</P>
        <P>The Government discussion paper, &ldquo;Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents,&rdquo; put forward proposals for the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents; the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents; focused provision of childcare; improved information services for lone parents and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low income families with young children. The paper also proposed the abolition of the cohabitation rule as a condition for receipt of the proposed social assistance payment.</P>
        <P>Under the proposals, the contingency of lone parenthood would no longer exist. Instead, a new payment would be made to all parents (living alone or with a partner) with young children on low income. Issues such as the possible poverty traps caused by the initial income support proposals are currently being addressed within my Department.</P>
        <P>As I have stated before, any proposed new payment can only be introduced when the necessary co-ordinated supports and services are put in place on the ground by other Departments and Agencies. This is why the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion has been tasked with bringing forward a plan on the key issues of childcare, education, training and activation measures.</P>
        <P>The testing phase of the non-income measures contained in the discussion paper has ended and the outcome of the process is currently being considered in my Department. This will inform the further development of the proposals. I have asked that a number of issues be examined and I hope to bring the matter to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion in the coming months.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 99 and 561 together.</P>
        <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over.  All carers in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative&rsquo;s allowance, regardless of their age, receive a free travel pass.  It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, <Col N="495"/>such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person&rsquo;s pension.  People resident in the State who are in receipt of a social security invalidity or disability payment from a country covered by EU Regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, and who have been in receipt of this payment for at least 12 months, are also eligible for free travel.</P>
        <P>The scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.</P>
        <P>The proposal to extend the free travel scheme to those aged under 66 with certain conditions who are not in receipt of a qualifying payment is one of a range of proposals made to extend the free travel scheme.   Further extensions to the scheme could only be considered in a Budgetary context and taking account of the financial and other needs of those not covered by the existing arrangements.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 138 together.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Maintenance Recovery Unit (MRU) is to recover some or all of the moneys being expended on social welfare payments for lone parents.  In every case where a one-parent family payment is awarded, the Maintenance Recovery Unit seeks to trace the other parent (liable relative) in order to ascertain whether he or she is in a financial position to contribute towards the cost of one-parent family payment. This follow-up activity takes place as soon as possible after the award of payment.</P>
        <P>The methods of assessment of the liable relative&rsquo;s ability to pay are specified in detail in my Department&rsquo;s Regulations. The assessment is based on net income and certain allowances are deducted. Certain categories of liable relative are not pursued due to personal circumstances or because they have low incomes.</P>
        <P>All liable relatives assessed with maintenance liability are issued with a Determination Order setting out the amount of contribution assessed. Decisions on the amounts assessed can be appealed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>
        <P>MRU pursue eligible liable relatives by issuing Determination Orders, first reminders, revised Determination Orders, final notices and submitting cases for court action (since 2001, 215 cases were referred for legal action). In addition older cases are reviewed to determine if there has been a change in the liable relative&rsquo;s circumstances.</P><Col N="496"/>
        <P>Applicants for one-parent family payment are required to make ongoing efforts to look for adequate maintenance from their former spouses, or, in the case of unmarried applicants, the other parent of their child. Since 2001, one-parent family payment claimants are allowed to retain half of any maintenance received without reduction in their social welfare entitlements, as an incentive to seek support.</P>
        <P>Where, following contact with the liable relative, there is no compliance with a Determination Order issued by my Department, the recipient of one-parent family payment is reminded of their obligation to seek maintenance in order for their payment to continue.</P>
        <P>The following appendix gives details of cases dealt with by MRU and costs of MRU activity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The programme for Government includes commitments to reduce long-term reliance on rent supplement. This is being done mainly by providing enhanced financial incentives for people taking up employment and by providing long-term housing solutions under the rental assistance scheme.</P>
        <P>Significant changes to the means test were implemented in 2007 specifically to facilitate people returning to work. Where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes.</P>
        <P>This improvement in the assessment of means for those with income from employment, applies to all rent supplement recipients who are engaged in employment of less than 30 hours per week. It also applies to those returning to full-time employment and who are accepted as eligible for accommodation under the rental accommodation scheme (RAS). These measures ensure that those returning to work or participating in training schemes are better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity. It is estimated that the gross annual cost of this provision is of the order of &euro;5.2 million.</P>
        <P>Overall I consider that the current eligibility thresholds, income disregards and associated arrangements ensure that people have a financial incentive to take up employment opportunities. I intend to keep the rent supplement scheme under review and my Department will be working closely with the Department of the Environment Heritage and Local Government in ensuring that RAS meets its objective of catering for those on long term rent supplementation, while enabling rent supplement to return to its original role of a short-term income support.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 546 together.</P>
        <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare division of the HSE. Enforcement of housing standards regulations is a matter for Local Authorities and the Community Welfare Service of the HSE is not qualified to undertake this work. However, under legislation introduced by my predecessor in October 2006 the Health Service Executive (HSE) can decide that a rent supplement may not be payable where it has been notified by a housing authority regarding the non-compliance with standards.</P>
        <P>Where a notification is received from a housing authority in respect of an existing tenant, the Community Welfare Officer would discuss the situation with the tenant and take whatever action it decides is necessary in the best interests of the tenant. These arrangements are aimed at improving the standards of accommodation which rent supplement tenants occupy and support the local authority in meeting their responsibilities in relation to housing standards.</P><Col N="498"/>
        <P>The most recent information available from the Health Service Executive (HSE) is that it has received 18 notifications of failure to meet housing standards since the new arrangements came into place in October 2006. 12 of these notifications were in respect of existing tenancies and all rent supplement claims have been terminated. 6 were in respect of tenancies which were not rent supplemented and rent supplement has not been paid in respect of these tenancies since notification was received.</P>
        <P>Where the executive becomes aware of accommodation or blocks of accommodation which appears to it to be sub-standard, it notifies the local authority and it may advise prospective tenants at that premises that rent supplement will not be paid in respect of these tenancies. Details of new rent supplements are given to the PRTB in order to ensure that these tenancies are registered by landlords. Revenue generated from registration of additional tenancies will support the inspection of accommodation.</P>
        <P>In addition details of rent supplement tenancies that are of more than 18 months duration are notified to local authorities every quarter. This information is primarily for the purpose of identifying rent supplement tenants for transfer to the Rental Accommodation Scheme. However local authorities inspect the accommodation concerned before accepting them on to RAS and this information sharing assists in enforcing standards.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105, 136, 142 and 144 together.</P>
        <P>The Estimates allocation for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance in 2008 is &euro;1,019.8 million while the provision for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is &euro;614.52 million. Expenditure on these schemes amounted to &euro;875 million and &euro;545.6 million respectively in 2007. This year&rsquo;s allocations are based on an underlying live register forecast of an average of 170,000 for the year. Live register forecasts are determined by the Department of Finance. Developments in relation to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit will be closely monitored during the year in the context of the Government&rsquo;s framework for reporting on public expenditure.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 129 together.</P>
        <P>At the beginning of January 2008, there were 90,063 people signing for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance.  The number has increased by 8,574 to 98,637 at 21st March 2008. The comparative figures for 2007 were 84,122 at the beginning of January increasing by 991 to 85,113 at 23rd March 2007.</P>
        <P>At the beginning of January 2008, there were 70,647 people signing for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit. The number has increased by 16,678 to 87,325 at 21st March 2008. The comparative figures for 2007 were 61,523 at the beginning of January increasing by 372 to 61,895 at 23rd March 2007.</P>
        <P>The figures reflect a substantial increase in the number of people on the Live Register in the 12 months to 21 st March 2008. The increase in the numbers on Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit which is short-term in nature and based on paid PRSI contributions, was almost double that for the means-tested Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance.</P>
        <P>My Department, through its Employment Support Services and in conjunction with other agencies, continues to assist persons on the Live Register to make the transition to work, education or relevant training. Under the National Employment Plan, people who are approaching 3 months on the Live Register are identified by my Department and referred to F&Aacute;S for interview with a view to job placement or offer of training. A significant measure available to eligible long-term unemployed people is my Department&rsquo;s Back to Work Allowance scheme which allows them to retain part of their social welfare payment for a period when they take up employment or self-employment.</P>
        <P>Other measures include the Back to Education Allowance scheme, the Technical Assistance and Training grants and the PRSI Exemption Scheme. In addition, the Activation and Family Support Programme and the Second Chance Education Opportunities Scheme offer supports to social welfare customers and other disadvantaged persons to assist them in improving their employability and personal and family situations.</P>

        <P el="5">1. <Miles com="ix" />All cases for inclusion in the survey must be selected randomly from the population of cases in payment at a specific time.</P>
        <P el="5">2. <Miles com="ix" />The sample size must be sufficiently large to yield reasonably reliable estimates.</P>
        <P el="5">3. <Miles com="ix" />The reviews should be carried out quickly</P>
        <P el="5">4. <Miles com="ix" />The results of the survey should be capable of being audited</P>
        <P el="5">5. <Miles com="ix" />Cases should be tested fully for all possible breaches of regulations.</P>
        <P el="5">6. <Miles com="ix" />The monetary values of any changes as a result of the review together with the monetary value of the sample should be captured so that the results can be extrapolated to draw conclusions about the estimated value of the loss.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">When the survey is completed the results are extrapolated and are used to provide an estimate of the overall cost of fraud and error within the scheme.</P>
        <P>Two surveys are planned for 2008. The first survey on the state pension contributory scheme will be undertaken in Quarter 2, 2008 and a second on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme is planned for Quarter 3.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108, 128, 146 and 545 together.</P>
        <P>The development of a national carers&rsquo; strategy is a key Government commitment in both the national partnership agreement &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; and the Programme for Government.  A working group, chaired by the Department of An Taoiseach, has begun work on developing the strategy.</P>
        <P>My Department provides the secretariat to the working group which also includes representatives of the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Enterprise, Trade and Employment as well as F&Aacute;S and the Health Service Executive. To date, the working group has held two meetings, one in February and the other in March.  A list of those who attended the meetings is set out at the end of the reply.  It is intended to hold the next meeting later this month.</P>
        <P>Developing the strategy involves consultation with other Departments and Government agencies not represented on the working group. Yesterday, my Department hosted a consultation meeting with several organisations including the Equality Authority, Combat Poverty Agency, Citizen&rsquo;s Information Board, Pobal, the Family Support Agency, the National Economic and Social Council, the National Council on Ageing and Older People, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  A list of attendees is set out at the end of the reply.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; commits the DSFA to hosting an annual consultation meeting of carer representative groups and relevant Departments and Agencies. Such a meeting was held on 23 January 2008. Representatives of 12 groups and 9 government departments and agencies attended.  A list of attendees is set out at the end of the reply.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The theme was the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy and groups were given an opportunity to comment on the draft terms of reference and to raise other issues considered relevant in the context of the strategy.  Key issues were recognition for carers and their work, accessing suitable health services, income support (including pensions) and access to training and employment. Another meeting with carer groups will be held when the results of the public consultation process are available.</P>
        <P>The commitment to the development of a National Carers&rsquo; Strategy includes a commitment to appropriate consultation with the social partners. An update in relation to the strategy was provided to the social partners plenary session in February. It is intended that the first consultation meeting with the social partners will be held in April.</P>
        <P>A request for submissions from the public was published in regional newspapers during the week beginning 3 March 2008 and in the national daily papers on Friday 7 March. It is also on the front page of my Department&rsquo;s website. Representative groups and the social partners have been advised of this process. The closing date for submissions is Friday, 18 April 2008. To date, 35 submissions have been received. It is intended to publish the strategy later this year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109, 114, 143 and 150 together.</P>
        <P>Estimated costings were agreed between the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Finance in relation to the PRSI commitments in the Programme for Government. These suggest that, were the commitments to be implemented in full, the cost to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) would be &euro;645 million, in 2006 terms, in a full year. However, it should be noted that, if introduced as a package, the combination of measures will give rise to <Col N="504"/>a compound effect with an estimated overall impact in the order of &euro;685m based on figures supplied by the consultants who carried out the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, 2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Social Insurance Fund has sufficient resources to provide for the changes to the PRSI system and a rise in the number of benefit recipients. The effect over a five year period would be dependent on the sequencing of any changes to the PRSI rates. Obviously, however, decreasing contributions while the number of beneficiaries is rising will bring forward the time when exchequer subvention is required.</P>
        <P>A key function of Government, accepting the role of the Exchequer as residual financier of the Fund, is to balance the need for contributions with liabilities &mdash; in an overall budgetary context; with any shortfall in the cost of benefits paid being, in the normal way, addressed by Exchequer subvention. If implemented, the Programme for Government proposals would not alter the fact that, between the Fund and the Exchequer, social insurance liabilities will be met. Their main effect would be to ease the cost of contributions on individual contributors and further strengthen the redistributive nature of the Fund.</P>

        <asker>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> when he expects to complete his Department&rsquo;s technical review of the entire social welfare code to examine its compatibility with the Equal Status Act 2000. </Quest>
        <QRef>[12198/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the review of the social welfare code, which is currently being undertaken in my Department, is to examine its compatibility with the Equal Status Act, 2000 (as amended). The review will examine all the schemes and services provided for both in social welfare legislation and the administrative schemes operated by the Department. It will identify any instances of direct or indirect discrimination, on any of the nine grounds under the Act that are not justified by a legitimate social policy objective or where the means of achieving that objective are either unnecessary or inappropriate.</P>
        <P>A decision was taken that the review would take place in two phases. Phase 1 involved the undertaking of a scoping exercise to establish the most appropriate approach and methodology to carrying out the main review, which would be robust and verifiable. The results of Phase 1 then formed the basis of the terms of reference of the main review. A request for tender for Phase 2 of the work, involving the undertaking of the main review, issued in April 2007. Consultants were selected to carry out the work in July 2007, with work commencing in October 2007. The work is expected to be completed by early 2009.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> if he will undertake a risk analysis of each welfare payment affected by the habitual residence condition to determine if the rule could be abolished for low-risk claim-types. </Quest>
        <QRef>[12206/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The habitual residence condition currently applies to the following schemes:</P>
        <P>Jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, one parent family payment, disability allowance, old age non-contributory pension, widow&rsquo;s non-contributory pension, guardian&rsquo;s non-contributory payment, carer&rsquo;s allowance, blind person&rsquo;s pension, child benefit and supplementary welfare allowance. <Col N="505"/> It does not apply to exceptional or urgent needs payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  The basic rationale for introducing the condition was that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere should not be entitled to payment under these schemes on arrival in Ireland or if they have had no attachment to the work force since arrival in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I presume the Deputy&rsquo;s reference to a &ldquo;low-risk claim-type&rdquo; is intended to mean the schemes which have had a low number of applications. To remove the condition from one of these schemes merely because there has been a low application rate would introduce an inconsistency in the above rationale which would be hard to justify. I have no intention of amending the habitual residence condition on this basis.</P>

	<P>The legislative provisions relating to late claims for social welfare benefits are set out in Section 241 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, and in Regulations made under that section.  These provisions set out the times within which a person must claim, the disqualifications which apply where a late claim is made, and the circumstances in which the time limits may be extended.</P>
        <P>Since 1997 a number of improvements have been made to the provision relating to late claims for social welfare payments.  For example, prior to 1997 arrears of state pension contributory claims were limited to either three months or six months before the date of claim.  Regulations made in 2000 established a statutory basis for certain extra-statutory provisions which were applied in the case of late claims under certain schemes.  All late claims are now determined in accordance with the legislation.</P>
        <P>The legislation also provides for payment to be made on foot of late claims in the case of a range of other schemes for a period of 6 months prior to the date of claim, provided that there was good cause for the delay in claiming.</P>
        <P>The legislation now also provides for relaxation of the restrictions on backdating late claims under all schemes apart from jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and supplementary welfare allowance, and for further payment to be made, up to the level of full retrospection if the circumstances would warrant it, where:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the delay was due to incorrect information having been given by my Department, or</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />illness or a force majeure prevented a person from claiming earlier or,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the person is dependent on the arrears of payment to relieve financial hardship.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is generally accepted that there is an obligation on people to claim their social welfare entitlements in time. However, cases will inevitably arise where they fail to do so and the legislative provisions are designed to cater for such situations.  I am satisfied that the current provisions strike a reasonable balance between, on the one hand the need to exercise supervision and control of claims and, on the other hand,  the need for appropriate recognition to be given to cases of genuine hardship or difficulty.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The European Commission&rsquo;s proposal to designate 2010 as the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion is currently under consideration by the  European Council and the European Parliament.</P>
        <P>This proposal essentially arises from the decision of the European Council at Lisbon in March 2000 to invite Member States and the Commission to take steps to make a decisive impact on the eradication of poverty by 2010.  Member States in response adopted national strategies designed to progressively achieve this objective.  The EU Commission and the EU Social Protection Committee through the Open Method of Coordination (OMC) provided detailed guidance and supports for the process with a view to promoting a coordinated strategic approach across Member States.</P>
        <P>The Commission&rsquo;s proposal for the designated year will build on these processes and is also intended to reaffirm and strengthen the political commitment of the European Union to eradicate poverty beyond 2010. The types of actions and activities envisaged include meetings, seminars and other events; informational and promotional campaigns; and surveys and studies at a national and European Union level.</P>
        <P>Ireland welcomes and supports the Commission&rsquo;s proposal for the European Year in 2010.  The National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 (NAPinclusion) underlines the continued importance and value of a strategic approach. This plan, together with the major social inclusion commitments in the National Development Plan, provide for a coordinated strategy to combat poverty and social exclusion well into the next decade.</P>
        <P>The programmes and activities planned for 2010 under the EU Commission proposal should greatly assist in deepening understanding of the challenges to be faced in the coming decades, the policies and resources required to continue to make a decisive impact on poverty, the nature and extent of the progress achieved over the past decade and how that can be built on to match and, where possible, exceed that level of progress in the years ahead.  The year will be marked, in particular, by the involvement of all relevant stakeholders, not least people experiencing poverty, in the process.</P>
        <P>Ireland, therefore, will be fully supporting the proposal to designate 2010 as the European Year for Combating Poverty Social Exclusion at the Council of Ministers meeting which is to take place in June.  Preliminary consideration is being given by the Office for Social Inclusion to the specific type of actions being proposed by the EU Commission for 2010. This also includes consideration of structures that would be appropriate for coordinating implementation and providing for the effective involvement of the social partners and other relevant stakeholders in the process.</P>

	<P>The Department&rsquo;s inspectorate, appointed under Section 250 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 is responsible for ensuring that employers comply with their legal obligations in relation to Pay Related Social Insurance contributions.  Employer compliance in this regard, is monitored by Inspectors conducting employer inspections. The nature of these inspections can vary; ranging from the straightforward, where compliance is fully in order, to the more complex where evidence of non compliance is obtained and an in-depth inspection is required. Over 4800 employer inspections were carried out in 2007.</P>
        <P>Joint Inspection Units (JIU) comprising of personnel from both the Department of Social and Family Affairs (DSFA) and Revenue Inspectorates have been in operation for many years. These units were established countrywide, to combat Social Welfare Fraud and tax evasion i.e. to uncover instances of non compliance by employers with the PAYE/PRSI regulations and abuse of DSFA schemes.</P>
        <P>A Service Level agreement between this Department and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners defines the administrative and operational arrangements under which these Units operate.</P>
        <P>This joint cooperation, drawing as it does, on the expertise and experience of those involved in planning and conducting joint projects, has been beneficial in the detection of non compliance by errant employers and in the collection of any outstanding PRSI liabilities arising. In addition, the use of both DSFA and Revenue legislation has been most effective in this regard.</P>
        <P>Legislation was introduced in the Social Welfare Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2004, to enable Social Welfare Inspectors verify that employers had entered into a contract with a Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) provider in cases where the employer does not operate a pension scheme with retirement benefits for employees. Where in the course of employer inspection work, Social Welfare inspectors uncover evidence of non-compliance by <Col N="509"/>employers in this regard, the Pensions Board is notified accordingly. Once notified the onus is on the Pensions Board to follow up and ensure compliance. Almost 1,500 PRSA enquiries were carried out in 2007, of which over 440 were referred to the Pensions Board.</P>
        <P>In June 2006, arrangements were put in place between my Department and the Department of Enterprise Trade &amp; Employment (DET&amp;E) on the transfer of information regarding work permits. As part of this process, my inspectors notify DET&amp;E of cases of suspected non compliance with Work Permit legislation which they identify in the course of their normal inspection work.</P>
        <P>Toward 2016 provides for greater coordination between agencies in the area of employment law and employment rights, with a view to ensuring compliance in this area. The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007, includes a provision to enable the Department, the Revenue Commissioners and the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) to exchange relevant information and undertake joint investigations. There have been ongoing exchanges of information between the three agencies and a number of joint investigations have already taken place. Inter agency co-operation of this nature can be particularly effective and the Department is committed to maintaining close working relationships with both the Revenue Commissioners and the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).</P>

	<P>The Department undertakes surveys of levels of fraud and error as part of its control strategy, to identify types of claims which should be prioritised for review purposes.  The Department is committed to undertaking at least two such surveys annually and these are done in accordance with specific criteria laid down by the Comptroller and Auditor-General (C&amp;AG).</P>
        <P>The objective of the surveys is to identify the percentage of cases where the rate of social welfare payment is changed following review, as a result of fraud or error (whether by the claimant or by the Department), and to assess the total cost of overpayments as a percentage of scheme expenditure. When a survey is completed the results are extrapolated and are used to provide an overall fraud and error rate for the scheme in question.</P>
        <P>A fraud and error survey for the Disability Allowance (DA) scheme was carried out in 2005, where Social Welfare Inspectors reviewed a random sample of 1,000 DA cases to assess the underlying levels of fraud and error.  The result of this survey showed the level of fraud as being 2.3% of Disability Allowance expenditure.  The level of 4.7% to which the Deputy refers is the level of error which was assessed in this survey.</P>
        <P>A systematic review policy is in place for all DA customers.  This policy is reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure it adequately caters for the control requirements of the scheme. The policy takes account of issues arising from the fraud and error survey, analysis of outcomes from various control projects and also from risk assessment processes.</P>
        <P>If, as a result of control activity, an overpayment is identified, this is dealt with in accordance with Sections 334 to 343 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 and Regulations 242 to <Col N="510"/>249 of the Social Welfare (Consolidated Claims, Payments and Control) Regulations 2007, with a view to recovering the overpayment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department assumed responsibility for the allocation of PPS Numbers in June 2000. Because the PPS Number is a unique identifier for access to services provided by Government Departments and other public bodies it is essential to have effective controls around the PPS Number registration process. Controls, which are evaluated on an ongoing basis, are exercised at both the initial allocation stage and at subsequent stages in the lifecycle of the number.</P>
        <P>In the case of children born in Ireland a PPS Number is automatically issued. In other cases application must be made in person at one of the Department&rsquo;s network of Local Offices. PPS Numbers are issued following a controlled allocation procedure, involving;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a personal attendance at the office,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the completion of a written application form,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the submission of appropriate identity documents proving identity and address.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">Proof and evidence of identity is a vital element of the allocation process.</P>
        <P>In order to ensure that a person receives only one number and that the number is allocated on information that is accurate and verified, certain operational procedures are prescribed for local office personnel when dealing with applications. These operational guidelines are regularly revised and updated with the latest revision taking place in February 2008.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Other initiatives designed to improve the PPS Number registration process began in 2007 and it is hoped these will be completed by September 2008. In particular, a reduction in the number of PPS Number allocation centres from 128 to 28 will permit the concentration of expertise in document examination and authentication. Also an organisational review of the registration process is currently underway and should also be completed by September 2008. Tougher legislative measures introduced in the Social Welfare Act 2007, allowing the retention of proof of identity documentation, should also significantly enhance the Department&rsquo;s ability to detect and control identity fraud.</P>

	<P>The Family Support Agency was established on 6 May 2003 by the then Minister for Social and Family Affairs and brings together programmes and services to support families introduced by the Government in recent years.  Its mission is to promote family and community well being through the provision of appropriate supports and services to families.  Funding for the Agency has increased from &euro;17.28 million in 2003 to &euro;39.38 million for 2008.The main functions of the Agency include:</P>

Details of the individual organisations funded will be made available to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>For the current year, over 600 applications for funding have been received by the Agency. 2008 will also be the first year where groups in receipt of more than &euro;60,000 per annum will be eligible to receive multi-annual funding, thus giving large groups the opportunity to make more long-term plans to develop the invaluable service that they provide to thousands of people across the country.</P>
        <P>The FRC programme, which currently supports 106 Centres, will also be expanded over the duration of the current National Development Plan. In addition, funding has been allocated for an additional worker in 100 Family Resource Centres between 2007 and 2013.</P>
        <P>The Family Mediation Service has expanded to 16 centres nationwide with another centre being operated on a pilot basis.

        <Quest>  his views on the recommendations published by CORI Justice in the Socio Economic Review for 2008, entitled Planning for Progress and Fairness, of introducing measures to address child poverty and child care problems by increasing child benefit or increasing the early childhood supplement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>In its Socio Economic Review for 2008 CORI Justice proposed that the issues of child poverty and childcare be addressed through substantial increases in child benefit and/or early childcare supplement.</P>
        <P>Child benefit (CB) is a universal payment, paid in respect of children up to the age of 16 years. It continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19 who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.</P>
        <P>Child benefit supports all children but delivers proportionately more assistance to those on low incomes and with larger families. While it is not intended primarily to meet childcare costs, the very substantial increases in benefit in recent years can make a significant contribution to meeting those costs.</P>
        <P>Effective from April 2008, monthly rates of child benefit have increased to &euro;166 in respect of each of the first two children and &euro;203 in respect of the third and subsequent children. Monthly rates of child benefit have increased by &euro;127.90 at the lower rate and &euro;153.48 at the higher rate since 1997, increases of 335.7% and 309.9% respectively. This level of increase is unprecedented and is in line with the Government&rsquo;s objective of improving income for children generally.</P>
        <P>Early childcare supplement which is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children is payable in respect of all children under the age of 6 years who receive child benefit.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It came into effect on April 1st, 2006 at an annual payment of &euro;1,000 per year. This amount was increased to &euro;1,100 in Budget 2008.  The question of further increases in child benefit will be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

        <Quest>  the steps he has taken to ensure that his Department are not operating the habitual residence condition in an over-rigid fashion; and if he will undertake to publish his Department&rsquo;s legal advice on the operation and application of the current criteria and any correspondence between his Department and the European Commission on this issue.  </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assist<Col N="513"/>ance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004. It was introduced in the context of the Government&rsquo;s decision to open the Irish labour market to workers from the 10 new EU Member States, without the transitional limitations which were imposed at that time by most of the other Member States. The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere would not normally be entitled to social welfare assistance or child benefit payments on arrival in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Under Social Welfare legislation, decisions in relation to all aspects of claims are made by statutorily appointed Deciding Officers. Each case received for a determination on the Habitual Residence Condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the legislation and guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case. Decisions in relation to Supplementary Welfare Allowance are made by Community Welfare Officers in the Health Service Executive (HSE).</P>
        <P>Any applicant who disagrees with the decision on a case has the right to request a review of that decision and/or appeal to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>
        <P>While decisions to the effect that applicants satisfy the habitual residence condition (HRC) can be made in the vast majority (over 90%) of cases at claim acceptance stage on the basis of answers given on the primary claim forms, complex cases are examined in more detail. Claims involving complex HRC issues are assessed and decided in all scheme areas within my Department by a small number of deciding officers who are experienced and fully familiar with the issues involved for each scheme in regard to HRC. I am satisfied that this arrangement contributes greatly to accuracy and consistency in the decision-making process.</P>
        <P>Arising from a review of the operation of the habitual residence condition which was published in 2007, revised and expanded guidelines for claims decisions staff on the application of HRC are currently nearing completion, in consultation with management in the various scheme areas.</P>
        <P>Following final clearance, the revised guidelines will be made available to all relevant staff and published on the Department&rsquo;s website www.welfare.ie . As an additional support, and to maintain standards of accuracy and consistency, on completion of the revised HRC guidelines, arrangements will be made to provide training and/or briefings as appropriate to decisions staff within my Department and within the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>My Department consulted in the normal manner with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office in the course of drafting the habitual residence legislation and subsequently when issues were raised regarding compliance with the EU legislation and other international convention commitments. This advice is subject to legal professional privilege. The substance of the advice has been fully reported in earlier Parliamentary Questions.</P>
        <P>At a recent meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs, dealing with the Habitual Residence Condition, officials from my Department indicated that, while advice from the office of the Attorney General was confidential, a note would be furnished, outlining the substance of that advice. That note was issued to the Committee and dealt with the position in relation to the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. The European Commission initiated infringement proceedings in December 2004.</P>
        <P>Following written and oral response by my Department and a full investigation of the matter, the Commission was satisfied that the HRC was being operated in conformity with the EU legislation and withdrew its infringement proceedings in April 2006. As this matter has also been dealt with in detail in previous Parliamentary Questions, and relevant issues have been fully explained at the Joint Committee meetings I have referred to, I see no need to publish the correspondence on this matter.</P>

	<P>The reviews, in relation to the work of the Combat Poverty Agency, are at different stages of progression.  The review of the Agency&rsquo;s Research Programme, initiated in May 2007 by the Agency and the Office for Social Inclusion of the Department, was carried out by Goodbody Economic Consultants.  Its objectives were to</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Assess the activities, output and outcomes of the research programme;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Review the programme&rsquo;s contribution to research on poverty;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Benchmark the Agency&rsquo;s research programme against best practice in the design and implementation of similar social research programmes in Ireland and internationally;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Advise on the future direction of the research programme, particularly with regard to the most effective allocation and optimum use of research resources, both within the Agency and in collaboration with other organisations.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The work was overseen by a steering committee comprising representatives of the Combat Poverty Agency, the Office for Social Inclusion, and relevant government departments, as well as Goodbody Economic Consultants. The review has now been completed and the final report has just recently been made available to my Department and to the Board of the Agency and is being currently considered.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In line with a commitment in Towards 2016, a review of the Combat Poverty Agency&rsquo;s programmes that facilitate the participation of the community and voluntary sector and people experiencing poverty in the policy-making process has been in progress over the period 2006 and 2007.  Some aspects of that review remain to be considered further before it is finalised.</P>
        <P>The review of the Combat Poverty Agency, which forms part of the Department&rsquo;s Value for Money and Policy Review Initiative programme for 2006-2008 commenced in December 2007.   When completed, it will include recommendations on the future role and functions of the Agency.</P>
        <P>Mr. Niall Callan, formerly Secretary General of the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, is the Chairperson of the Steering Committee.  The membership of the Steering Committee, which is overseeing the task, comprises senior officials from my Department, other relevant government departments and the Combat Poverty Agency.  I expect that this review will be completed in mid 2008.</P>

	<P>The Department has taken a lead role over the years in developing and implementing identity management policies and <Col N="515"/>procedures based on the use of the Personal Public Services (PPS) number. This number was previously known as the Revenue and Social Insurance (RSI) number. The name was changed to indicate the broadening of its role to one which supports delivery of a broader range of public services, but it is also still used for its original core purpose of providing a common identifier for the Revenue Commissioners and this Department.</P>
        <P>As well as facilitating wider-scale exchange of information, the PPS number also has a role in the development of on-line services for individuals. The Department provides identity related services to a number of agencies in accordance with legislation. Building on these services, the Department constructed Public Service Identity (PSI) services to assist agencies in basic on-line identity management. The initial deployment of PSI services, through the Reach agency, supports the registration and authentication functions of the Revenue Commissioners PAYE on-line services.</P>
        <P>The overall Government strategy is to realise the potential of the Information Society through innovation and modernisation of public services. As part of this, the Standard Authentication Framework Environment (SAFE) programme, co-chaired by the Department and the Department of Finance, builds on PSI Services to provide the basis for a consistent set of registration and authentication services for customer interaction with public services.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners are also participating in this programme of work and the Department will continue to develop PSI and other relevant services in conjunction with them.  The Department and the Revenue Commissioners are currently finalising a renewed Memorandum of Understanding between the two organisations concerning co-operation and mutual assistance. The objective of the Memorandum is</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to provide a basis for the continuance, enhancement and expansion of the existing administrative and operational arrangements</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to better reflect the missions, modern operating realities and totality of the relationship between the two organisations</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to recognise the growing interdependencies between the two organisations in achieving the delivery of services to the highest standard</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to strengthen liaison structures with a view to monitoring service delivery and control aspects</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">While it had been planned to finalise the memorandum by the end of 2007, the work of completing the document is now drawing to a close and it is expected the memorandum will be finalised within the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>The Department will continue to explore on the basis of the ongoing developments how greater data and money transfer efficiencies could be realised in the future.</P>

	<P>The current range of payment options offered by my Department to customers includes payment at a local post office or to a bank or building society account; or certain credit unions that have been authorised by the banking and credit union regulators. Customers opt for a particular payment method having <Col N="516"/>regard to their own personal circumstances. The Department is implementing a three year strategy to move from paper based payment instruments to payment using a social services card at post offices and electronic payments to financial institutions. The programme is being implemented on a phased basis to coincide with book renewal production schedules and as personalised payable order books expire.</P>
        <P>Customers who collect their payment at a post office will present their Social Services Card and sign for their payment in the normal way. Payments can be collected up to 60 days after the due date in the case of pensioners and up to 100 days for child benefit recipients. Certain other customers have 20 days to collect their payment which is considered to be the optimum time for collection of a weekly means based payment. After these times the payments go out of date and are returned to the Department. Where a payment is not collected in time the Department can be contacted and a replacement payment made as appropriate.</P>
        <P>The following grid sets out the collection periods for schemes administered by my Department.</P>

	<P>The Guardians&rsquo; payment schemes allow for the provision of a weekly allowance to a guardian of a child who has either <Col N="517"/>been orphaned or whose parents have deserted and failed to provide for the child.  The review of the Guardian&rsquo;s payment within my Department commenced in late 2006 and involved a detailed analysis of a large sample of guardian&rsquo;s payment files.</P>
        <P>Issues emerging from the review include the structure of the scheme, administration issues in relation to the application of criteria and the need for closer co-ordination with the Health Service Executive in relation to child protection issues.  These issues are being progressed in my Department and with the relevant officials from the Department of Health &amp; Children.  I expect that proposals for improving the scheme will be forthcoming later this year.</P>

The service will assist individuals in identifying their needs, understanding their options and assist them in securing their entitlements to social services which include health, social welfare, education, family support, housing, taxation, citizenship, consumer matters, employment and training, equality, asylum and immigration.</P>
        <P>The development of a Personal Advocacy Service remains a priority for my Department.   An organisational structure has been developed by the Citizens Information Board to meet the needs of the Personal Advocacy Service.  Discussions between my Department, the Department of Finance and the Citizens Information Board are ongoing in relation to these structures and the additional staffing resources required for the provision of the service.  The post of Director of the Personal Advocacy Service was advertised in December 2007.  The Board is currently working through the recruitment process and expect to make an appointment shortly.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that appropriate structures and staffing resources will be in place shortly and the new service is still on target to be up and running in 2008.</P>

        <Quest> the plans he has to improve the income disregard available to claimants on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance to bring it in line with the proposals for the parental payment contained in Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government Discussion Paper on Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents put forward a proposal to introduce a new scheme, Parental Allowance, for all low income families with young children. It was envisaged that those in receipt of Parental Allowance would be able to earn up to &euro;120 per week without affecting their payment and that 40% of the remainder would be assessed as means. It was also proposed that the entitlement to the new payment would continue up to an upper earnings threshold of &euro;400 per week.</P>
        <P>Prior to September 2007, the earnings disregards which applied to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance were as follows:</P><Col N="518"/>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Where a person had one or more qualified child dependant(s) and was working part of the week while claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance, means were assessed as 60% of the average net weekly earnings.</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Where a person had no qualified child dependants, &euro;12.70 earnings for each day worked was disregarded from the average net weekly earnings, and 60% of the balance assessed against the weekly rate of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">With effect from the end of September 2007, &euro;20 earnings for each day worked, up to a maximum of &euro;60 per week, are disregarded from the average net weekly earnings. These new arrangements replaced the previous arrangements including the distinction between persons with and without qualified children. There is no upper income threshold for entitlement. As a result of these changes, the position of all part-time workers in receipt of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance was significantly enhanced.</P>
        <P>Any further improvement in the means testing arrangements for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance would have to be considered in a Budgetary context.</P>

	<P>The Green Paper on Pensions was published on the 17th October 2007 and a major consultation process is now underway. Following the completion of the consultation process, a framework for long-term policy will be developed.</P>
        <P>Pensions is one of the major issues the country must tackle for the future and any decision taken at this stage will impact on society for decades to come. Given the importance of the issue, I am anxious to ensure that the consultation process is as inclusive as possible and that people have ample time to study the Green Paper and to formulate their ideas and comments.  Therefore, I intend to leave it open until the end of May 2008.</P>
        <P>Once the consultation process is completed, work on developing the framework for future policy will commence. At this stage, it would be my intention to see this work completed and proposals submitted to the Government for consideration by the end of 2008.</P>

	<P>The Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers. This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible. The staff and other resources available to the Department are regularly reviewed having regard to the workload arising and other competing demands. The available resources are then used to discharge the Department&rsquo;s obligations towards its customers and in implementing cost effective controls to prevent and detect fraud and abuse.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s management services unit monitors available resources against workload on an ongoing basis with a view to ensuring optimum processing times for claims.</P>
        <P>The processing of applications under any of the schemes operated by my Department can require the collection and assessment of a complex range of information in relation to a variety of factors including means, medical condition, domestic and EU contributions and other criteria.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This can involve medical assessments of applicants, the verification of information provided through visits by the social welfare inspectorate, correspondence and evidence from other EU jurisdictions, all of which add to the processing time required to ensure that the terms of the scheme are correctly administered. In addition the timescales in processing applications for some of the Department&rsquo;s schemes have been influenced by increases in the numbers of claims being submitted.</P>
        <P>Measures introduced by the Department to address the efficiency of claim processing include the following:</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The review of existing processes and procedures on an ongoing basis with the explicit objective of reducing delays in claim processing;</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />In situations where payment is being renewed priority is being given to these claims to ensure continuity of payment;</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The review of ongoing staffing requirements in light of the increased volumes of claims in certain areas;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The judicious application of overtime working;</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Where backlogs exist extra temporary staff have been recruited, where appropriate, to eliminate these;</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The introduction of scanning technology in certain areas to update details directly from claim forms to computer systems.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">These measures will, over time, lead to more efficient processing and reduce the number of claims on hand. The position is being closely monitored and kept under review by my Department.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 152 and 153 together.</P>
        <P>The Anti-Inflation Group, reconstituted under Towards 2016, has met four times since the ratification of the Agreement and the last formal meeting of the Group took place on 5 March, 2007.  However, in the meantime, the regular meetings under Towards 2016 have enabled representatives of IBEC, ICTU and Departmental officials to monitor trends in inflation.</P>
        <P>The Group has actively engaged with the Central Statistics Office, the Competition Authority, the National Consumer Agency and the Commission for Energy Regulation with a view to coordinating the fight against inflation on an informed basis.</P>
        <P>The provisions relating to inflation in Towards 2016 provide a useful basis for cooperation and coordination in combating inflation and are reflected in the Government&rsquo;s ongoing and regular contacts with IBEC and ICTU where inflation is often pertinent to discussions on pay, industrial relations and workplace issues.</P>
        <P>I can assure the House that the Government is committed to tackling inflation in a manner which will underpin sustainable growth and social partnership and that, in line with Section 5, paragraph 4.2 of Part Two of Towards 2016, the Government gives due consideration to any potential inflationary impacts when developing public policy.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The CSO recognises that the survey imposes a burden, particularly on small employers when they are included in the survey. Steps have been taken and continue to be taken to keep this burden to a minimum. These include: the NES has an innovative survey approach which involves information being collected in respect of individual employees from both the employer and employee themselves.  In total it has an annual sample of approximately 10,000 employers and 100,000 employees. However only employers with greater than 249 employees are included every year with a rotating systematic sample of smaller employers (employers with less than three employees are excluded from the survey entirely), depending on the size of the employer. <Col N="528"/>For example, employers with between two and ten employees have a one in twenty chance of inclusion in the survey while employers with between nine and twenty employees have a one in ten chance of inclusion in the survey etc. Once an employer has been included in the survey, it is rotated out of the sample for subsequent years and is not included again until other employers in the same category have been sampled, except in certain limited circumstances. In addition, the CSO has been working in consultation with payroll software providers to reduce the burden of response on enterprises. These payroll companies have installed an optional  CSO &ldquo;module&rdquo; on their payroll packages which will extract all the payroll data required for the NES (and the new quarterly  Earnings, Hours and Employment Costs Survey or EHECS). This innovation will lead to a significant reduction in burden on those companies using the modules. The modules are currently been rolled out by the payroll companies and will be available for the NES from next year onwards.</P>

	<P>Section 23 (1)  of the Betting Act, 1931 prohibits licensed bookmakers from engaging in a betting transaction with a person under the age of eighteen years whether such person is acting on their own behalf or as an agent for another person. This law is applicable to race tracks and betting shops.</P>
        <P>The Totalisator Act, 1929 provides that the Minister for Finance can grant licences to set up, maintain and work totalisators. Such licences have been granted to Horse Racing Ireland (HRI) and Bord na gCon.</P>
        <P>Individuals under the age of eighteen are not prohibited from using the Tote under the Totalisator Act, 1929. However, HRI and Bord na gCon, which are agencies of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, as operators of the Tote, have pointed out that the Tote primarily operates in the controlled environment of the racecourse, where children are typically accompanied by adults. Furthermore, they are not aware of any evidence to suggest that use of the Tote by people under the age of eighteen is problematic.</P>

	<P>There is no proposal by the European Commission to further harmonise VAT in relation to petrol or diesel.</P>
        <P>There is a proposal for a Council Directive amending the Energy Tax Directive regarding tax treatment of motor fuel for commercial purposes and the co-ordination of taxation of unleaded petrol and gas oil used as motor fuel. This proposal, published in March 2007, is aimed at tackling distortions of competition in the haulage markets which stem from wide variations in excise rates across Member States.</P>
        <P>The Commission notes that such variations lead to fuel tourism whereby drivers, particularly in the haulage sector, will travel across borders to take    advantage of cheaper fuel prices due to lower national taxes and the Commission highlights the negative environmental impact from such behaviour.  In response, the Commission considers the best response is to raise the minimum rate for diesel from 2012 (and petrol from 2014). Some increase in the minimum rate for diesel has already been agreed from 2010 under the EU Energy Tax Directive (2003/96/EC) of October 2003.  The planned increases together with the current EU minima and Irish rates are illustrated as follows:</P>

        <P FLI="0">Most Member States including Ireland welcomed the motive behind the Commission&rsquo;s proposal on environmental grounds.  The actual impact of the changes proposed, from an Irish perspective, are minimalist and would only require a 1.2 cent increase in our national diesel rates by 2014. Some Member States are seeking greater flexibility with respect to the timelines in the proposal. Discussions are ongoing in this regard. Many of the new Member States either have an issue with raising the minimum rates or the fact that the transitional periods proposed by the Commission are not sufficiently accommodating. This is largely a function of the low excise rates in the Accession countries.</P>

	<P> I would like to start by clarifying that neither I, nor my Department are party to the discussions which take place within RTE on pension matters.  Furthermore, neither I nor my Department would be aware of, or make any input to such discussions, which are between the Company as employer and its staff.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is responsible in the first instance for matters relating to RT&Eacute; and his Department deals directly with the Company on such issues.  The Broadcasting Authority Act 1960 (as amended by the Broadcasting Act 2001) provides that pension schemes and arrangements for officers of RT&Eacute; must be approved by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources with the consent or concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  These provisions are similar to the standard provisions which are generally used in legislation governing State Bodies.</P>
        <P>My general role under the legislation is to receive for assessment and consent, specific proposals which have already been examined in the first instance by the Department primarily concerned.  Normally, proposals received in this way will have been discussed and agreed within the State Body prior to their transmission to the Minister of the relevant parent Department.  My role is to consider and assess any public service implications of the proposals.  My Department does not engage directly or indirectly in the internal processes within the State Body which lead to the generation of such proposals although in the exercise of my role, it is occasionally necessary for my officials to attend meetings between a particular State Body and its parent Department for the purposes of clarification on points of detail.</P>

          <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in order for tax relief on contributions to a Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) to be given in a previous tax year a claim by the taxpayer must be made on or before the relevant return filing date for that previous tax year. This claim may be made without the immediate production of the relevant certificate from the PRSA provider.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In this case, the person in question sought to claim tax relief for 2006 in respect of a PRSA contribution of &euro;15,000 paid on 30 October 2007. The closing date for such an election was 31 October 2007 (the filing date for 2006) but this person&rsquo;s election is recorded as received by Revenue on 8 January 2008. Accordingly, the requested tax relief for 2006 cannot be given. Subject to the normal qualifying conditions, tax relief would appear to be available for the 2007 tax year on &euro;14,299 (being 20% of declared income) and the balance of  &euro;701 may be carried forward and treated as a qualifying contribution for the next year, and where necessary, for succeeding years.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that as part of its modernisation programme, Revenue has invested heavily in the provision of internet-based services.  The Revenue On-Line Service (ROS) has been widely acknowledged as a major success both from a technological and customer service point of<?oasys _jy ?>view.  </P>
        <P>Revenue adds to the range of services available on ROS on an ongoing basis and during 2003 vehicle registration was added to the suite of on-line services.  These new on-line facilities have greatly reduced the demand for service at vehicle registration offices.  An increasing number of motor dealers now register new vehicles on-line themselves (currently approximately 95% of such registrations nationally are on-line) in preference to using the facilities at vehicle registration offices.  In addition, a valuation enquiry facility has been made available on the Revenue website, allowing customers to obtain vehicle registration tax quotations on second hand vehicles on-line.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners reviewed the implications of these changes and, having regard to the reduction in service demand, decided to close a number of smaller vehicle registration offices and consolidate the service in adjacent offices.  Opening hours have also been reduced in some other offices.</P>
        <P>Vehicle registration facilities ceased in Portlaoise with effect from 28 March 2008.  The Kilkenny Revenue District provides a call in service (including VRT service) for taxpayers living in Counties Carlow, Kilkenny and Laois.  This service is available Monday to Friday from 9:30am to 5:00pm.  The District also provides a VRT service on Wednesday and Thursday each week from 9:00am to 12:45 in Carlow.  In addition the Westmeath/Offaly Revenue District provide a VRT service at their Tullamore office Monday to Friday from 9.00am to 4.00 pm.  VRT services are also available at VROs nationwide, details of which are available on the Revenue website.</P>
        <P>New procedures have been introduced which simplify and speed up the registration process for used vehicles.  These new procedures eliminate the necessity to physically examine all such vehicles, as had been the case previously.  The new arrangements also provide a facility for customers to register vehicles by post without the need to bring their vehicles to a Revenue office.  These initiatives have greatly assisted the successful consolidation of vehicle registration services into the larger centres.</P>
        <P>Based on service demands, the alternatives available and the need for Revenue to make effective use of resources, it is not proposed to re-introduce vehicle registration services at Portlaoise.  A small number of staff were involved in vehicle registration work at Portlaoise.  These staff remain in Co. Laois working on alternative Revenue functions.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 50 of the Finance Act 1999 provided for a scheme of tax relief for rented residential accommodation for third level students. The relief provided for a deduction of 100% of the construction, conversion or refurbishment expenditure, which may be off-set against all Irish rental income, whether derived from the premises in question or from other lettings.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the relief was to increase the supply of quality accommodation for third level students and the scheme has been very successful in this respect. However, a report on tax relief for student accommodation carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants and published by my Department in February 2006 as part of Volume 1 of the Review of Property-based Tax Incentive Schemes, indicated, among other things, that there were concerns about over-supply of accommodation in the student accommodation sector.  Following this review, a number of property-based tax incentive schemes were discontinued, including the tax incentive scheme for student accommodation.</P>
        <P>This scheme had been due to terminate on 31 December 2004 but Finance Act 2006 extended the deadline to 31 July 2008 for pipeline projects (where a planning application has been received by the planning authority by 31 December 2004) and work to the value of 15 per cent of actual construction, conversion or refurbishment cost had been carried out by 31 December 2006.  75 per cent of capital expenditure incurred in the year 2007 and 50 per cent of capital <Col N="547"/>expenditure incurred in the period 1 January to 31 July 2008 can qualify for relief.  I have no plans at this time to introduce another tax incentive for the provision of student accommodation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>In relation to the tax incentives currently available for wind turbine energy, the Business Expansion Scheme (BES) provides an incentive, in the form of tax relief, for individuals to invest in companies which carry on qualifying activities, services and trades, including the trade of manufacturing.  The generation of electricity, including electricity generated by wind turbines, is a qualifying trade under the BES manufacturing provisions.  This scheme currently runs until 31 December 2013.  </P>
        <P>In addition, tax relief in the form of capital allowances is available where capital expenditure is incurred on the provision of plant and machinery that is used in the carrying on of a trade.  In general, the cost of providing a wind turbine would qualify for capital allowances.  Capital allowances for plant and machinery are given over an 8-year period at an annual rate of 12.5% of the allowable expenditure and can be used to reduce the taxable income of the trade.</P>
        <P>The Renewable Energy Generation scheme, which provided relief from corporation tax for corporate investment in certain renewable energy projects (including projects based on wind power technology) was extended to 31 December 2011 by section 51 of the Finance Act 2007, subject to State-aid clearance from the EU Commission.  This scheme has not yet re-commenced due to issues relating to the application for State-aid approval which are under consideration by my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</P>

	<P>The initial application for a Primary Medical Certificate under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994, is made to the Senior Medical Officer of the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area. </P>
        <P>If the Primary Medical Certificate has been refused in this case, the named person may appeal the refusal to the Medical Board of Appeal, National Rehabilitation Hospital, Rochestown Avenue, Dun Laoghaire, Co. Dublin.  I would point out that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware there was an interdepartmental review of the scheme.  Some 12,500 people benefited under the scheme in 2007 at an overall estimated cost of &euro;74 million.  Any changes to the scheme would have to be considered in the context of the annual Budget.</P>

	<P>Under the Guidelines for the Appraisal and Management of Capital Expenditure Proposals in the Public Sector all capital investment costing more than &euro;30m should be subject to detailed Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA). The current CBA best practice guidelines outline that external costs and benefits such as carbon dioxide emissions should be included where they are a significant project outcome and where they can be valued on the basis of a reliable, well established methodology; where they cannot be given a monetary value external costs and benefits are to be fully assessed in the cost-benefit report to ensure their full consideration in the decision-making process.</P>
        <P>To assist Government Departments and other public bodies, and to develop a standardised approach to this issue, an Interdepartmental Working Group on reflecting the cost of Carbon Emissions in Cost Benefit Analysis, chaired by the Central Expenditure Evaluation Unit in my Department, has been established to consider the appropriate means of treating environmental emissions, in particular CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> aspects, in cost benefit analysis of major infrastructure projects.

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 150 of 12 February 2008, the measures in place to track the temporary importation of vehicles; when a person, previously established outside the State, is considered to be established here; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[11796/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that Section 135 (a) of the Finance Act 1992 permits a European or other foreign registered vehicle which is temporarily brought into the State by a person established outside the State to be exempted from the requirement to register for vehicle registration tax purposes for a period normally not exceeding 12 months from the date upon which the vehicle concerned was brought into the State.  Temporary exemptions are allowable for vehicles brought into in the State by visitors, tourists and foreign workers. </P>
        <P>Statutory Instrument No. 60 of 1993 prescribes the criteria for eligibility for the granting of temporary exemption from the requirement to be registered for VRT purposes in the State.</P><Col N="550"/>
        <P Just="Left">There is no requirement for vehicles imported under temporary exemption provisions to be presented to the Revenue Commissioners to avail of the relief.  Details of these vehicles are therefore not captured by Revenue or held in the vehicle registration system.  When a vehicle fails to meet the conditions for temporary exemption, e.g. the temporary status no longer applies, the onus is on the person availing of the exemption to remove the vehicle from the State or present it for registration.</P>
        <P>As part of their enforcement activity, Revenue mobile units and the Garda Siochana monitor Irish and foreign registered vehicles on our roads and examine documents relating to ownership, registration and the importation of foreign registered vehicles to ensure that they are still eligible for temporary exemption from registration.  The documentation must be kept with the vehicle when it is in use in the State and be made available to Revenue officials when requested.</P>
        <P>In 2007, Revenue mobile units challenged and investigated 15,417 vehicles in the State.  Of these, 10,325 satisfied Revenue officials that the registration status was in order at that particular time and no further action was necessary. 2,313 vehicles were registered for VRT purposes as a direct consequence of these investigations.  Enforcement activity also resulted in prosecutions, seizures, exportation and scrappage of vehicles and indeed in the granting of temporary or permanent exemptions depending on the circumstances of the case.</P>
        <P>A person, previously established outside the State, who avails of a temporary exemption, may decide to set up permanent residence here.  An application for permanent relief from VRT should then be made to Revenue.  Where the application is successful, the person will register the vehicle free of VRT.</P>
        <P>In this regard, Section 134 of the Finance Act 1992 provides for permanent relief from the payment of VRT on the registration of a vehicle which is the personal property of a private individual being brought into the State as part of transfer of residence.  (Permanent reliefs are also available in other cases, e.g. for vehicles acquired as part of an inheritance or for vehicles transferred into the State under diplomatic arrangements).</P>
        <P>Statutory Instrument No. 59 of 1993 sets out the conditions governing the registration of vehicles under the above section.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 195 and 196 together.</P>
        <P>Across the public service, recruitment and promotion practices generally are being managed in a way which facilitates the achievement of the Decentralisation Programme in an efficient manner. The primary mechanism for placing Civil Servants whose posts are due to decentralise but who themselves wish to remain in Dublin is by way of bilateral transfer.  As staff who have applied to decentralise continue to be transferred into decentralising organisations, the posts they vacate become available to those wishing to remain in Dublin.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The objective of the Dublin Arrangements is to provide to the Public Appointments Service (PAS) details of staff who wish to remain in Dublin at each grade level so that a proportion of vacancies arising in Dublin based posts may be filled by those staff.  The Arrangements seek to balance the need to facilitate the effective achievement of the decentralisation programme with the business needs of departments and offices and the aspirations of staff to be placed in appropriate posts in Dublin. To achieve this, they allow for prioritisation at certain times of staff in organisations who have an immediate need to be placed in Dublin posts due to the timing of the relocation of their current department or office. While the aim is to ensure that transfers take place within 4-8 weeks, in many instances I understand that the actual transfer date is the subject of bilateral discussion and agreement between the organisations involved.</P><Col N="553"/>
        <P>Under the Dublin Arrangements, the PAS circulates as much detail as possible in relation to the post to be filled to persons in the appropriate grades in the organisations participating in the arrangements at that time. Further information is of course made available to individual applicants by the receiving organisation as required. Once the closing date for expressions of interest in the post has passed, the post due to be filled is offered by the PAS to the most senior volunteer. Consequently, the issue of a potential receiving Department or Office having a veto over an applicant does not arise.</P>
        <P>My understanding from the Office of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is that the GSOC wished to review all aspects of organisational staffing both current and prospective, to cater for the long-term needs and structure of the office. In that context, following the advertisement of the post to Dublin based staff, that office advised my Department that the filling of the post of Head of Corporate Services was postponed pending a review of the posts at senior level in the GSOC. I understand that this review is ongoing.</P>
        <P>It is intended that the Dublin Arrangements will continue over the full transition phase of the Programme and I can confirm that my department is monitoring them in co-operation with Departments and the relevant unions to ensure that they are operating efficiently.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The reasoned opinion which the Deputy refers to was received in January 2007 and it made reference to Sections 71 and 73 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  These provisions relate to the tax treatment of the income arising on an Irish resident from UK sources.  The European Commission took the view that these provisions were contrary to the obligations under Article 56EC and Article 40EEA and it directed Ireland to take the necessary measures to comply with the reasoned opinion.</P>
        <P>The Commission was subsequently notified that provisions would be included in the 2008 Finance Bill which would address the issues raised.  This was done and Section 18 Finance Act 2008 deals with the matter.</P>

	<P>PAYE workers may claim an income tax allowance in respect of their membership subscription to a registered Trade Union.  The amount of the allowance in 2008 is &euro;350 at the standard rate of tax, which is equivalent to a tax credit of &euro;70.  This credit, when claimed, is included in the individual&rsquo;s annual certificate of tax credits.  Where the tax credit has not been claimed up to now, an individual may claim, in 2008, for each of the tax years 2004 to 2007, inclusive. </P>
        <P>Full details on how to claim the credit are available on the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; website at <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.  There is a variety of self service options available, including claiming on-line or by text message.  The Revenue Commissioners can also be contacted on the relevant regional PAYE LoCall number or by calling to the local Revenue office.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> if a retired person's total income from investments and pension is such that all such income is less than the person's tax allowances, if the person has tax liability in such an instance (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that it is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation.  This includes income received in the form of a social welfare pension and investment income.  However, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, based on the limited information supplied, it would appear that the taxpayer&rsquo;s tax credits are sufficient to offset any liability to income tax on his social welfare pension and his income from Irish shares.</P>
        <P>Where an individual is in receipt of dividends and other distributions from an Irish resident company, such investment income is liable to dividend withholding tax (DWT) at the standard rate (currently 20%).  Such income cannot be paid to an Irish resident individual without deduction of DWT unless the individual is permanently and totally incapacitated from maintaining himself or herself.  However, an Irish resident individual who is not liable to income tax, may make a claim for a refund of DWT deducted.  Claims should be submitted to an individual&rsquo;s local Revenue office.  All refund claims should be accompanied by original dividend vouchers and/or any subsidiary tax certificates.</P>
        <P>Deposit interest retention tax (DIRT) is deducted from Irish deposit interest income.  Regardless of the amount of tax credits available to a taxpayer, an individual is not entitled to a repayment of DIRT or to have deposit interest paid without deduction of DIRT unless:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the individual or his/her spouse is 65 years of age or over, or</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />is permanently incapacitated, and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />his/her total income (including the gross DIRT income) is less than the relevant income tax exemption limit, or the individual&rsquo;s  tax credits exceed his/her tax liability.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">It is understood from the details supplied that the taxpayer does not satisfy these conditions.</P>
        <P>On reaching the age of 65 and provided the taxpayer&rsquo;s total income for the year is below the annual exemption limit, (currently &euro;20,000 for a single individual aged over 65 and &euro;40,000 for a married couple, one of whom is aged over 65, with increases for qualifying dependent children), the taxpayer may apply directly to his or her financial institution to have interest arising on the investment account payable without deduction of DIRT.  The application is made by completion of Form DE1, available from financial institutions, Citizens&rsquo; Information Centres, Revenue offices, the Revenue website, <i>www.revenue.ie</i>, or by phoning LoCall 1890 306 706.</P>

	<P>The Office of Public Works expects to issue final contract documents for the Civil Engineering Contract on the Fermoy North flood relief scheme to the successful applicants from the pre-qualification process in the next few days.  This will allow completed tenders to be received in the middle of May.  Once the tenders have been examined and a tender report has been received, OPW <Col N="555"/>expect to be in a position to issue a Letter of Intent to a successful civil engineering contractor by the end of June.  This would allow construction works to commence within a matter of weeks afterwards.</P>
        <P>OPW plan to commence the detailed design of the remaining phases of the overall Fermoy flood relief scheme shortly.  There is a very strong commitment to completing all phases of the scheme as quickly as possible and OPW has been greatly encouraged by the strong support shown by Fermoy Town Council and the local population.  The recent flooding in January was a stark reminder of the current threat from flooding in the town without a scheme in place.</P>

The Report recommends inter alia that a plan to bring about the closure of all psychiatric hospitals should be drawn up and implemented, and that the resources released by these closures should be protected for reinvestment in the mental health service.  The Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney has made it clear to the HSE in the context of their Service Plan for 2008, that there can be no question of diverting capital or development funds to meet expenditure pressures arising in relation to core services.</P>
        <P>The identification and disposal of assets which may be in excess of known HSE requirements is the responsibility of the HSE National Director of Estates.  The Executive, therefore, is the appropriate body to consider the particular matter raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>I am aware of concerns regarding the online sale of medicinal products.  Such sales do not have any requirement for the type of consultation and safety precautions which normally accompany the sale of a medicinal product.  There are also concerns in regard to the quality of products sold in this manner due to the high level of counterfeit products.</P>
        <P>Anyone purchasing medicinal products via the Internet would normally have such products delivered by post.  It is an offence in this country to supply prescription only medicines by mail order.  The Irish Medicines Board is responsible for investigating breaches of the medicines legislation in Ireland and the Board works closely with the Revenue Commissioners to enforce these provisions.</P>
        <P>The Board monitors the activities of online website suppliers, a great number of which pose as pharmacies, and takes action against such websites where possible.  However the difficulties associated with policing the Internet in general also apply to online sales of medicinal products.  The vast majority of internet pharmacies are based outside Ireland and this poses challenges in the area of enforcement.  The Board works in partnership with medicines enforcement agencies in Europe and elsewhere and has in the past taken action to stop the supply of medicinal products by online pharmacies based outside Ireland.</P>

The HSE has submitted a draft Capital Plan to my Department for consideration and approval in the normal way which sets out the HSE&rsquo;s proposed short and longer term priorities and commitments.  Consultation on this draft Capital Plan is ongoing between the HSE, the Department of Finance and my Department.  The HSE has undertaken to provide additional clarification on its proposed capital developments and is currently engaged in this process.</P>

	<P>The Primary Care Strategy aims to increase health service capacity through the development of services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, home helps, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and others.</P>
        <P>It has been estimated that up to 95% of people&rsquo;s health and social services needs can be properly met within a primary care setting and the establishment of new Primary Care Teams can contribute greatly to enhancing community based health services.</P>
        <P>The provision of the appropriate infrastructure to facilitate the delivery of primary care services is being considered by the HSE, having regard to a number of factors.  These include the type and configuration of the services involved, the mixed public/private nature of our health system, the suitability of existing infrastructure and the capital requirements of the health services generally over the coming years. I understand that in December 2007 the HSE sought expressions of interest from the private sector for the provision of the Primary Care Team infrastructure, with the HSE proposing to enter into fixed term leases with such providers.</P>

	<P>The assessment of eligibility to medical cards is statutorily a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE) and, with the exception of persons aged over 70 who have an automatic entitlement to a medical card, is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants.  Under Section 45 of the Health Act, 1970 medical cards are provided for persons who, in the opinion of the HSE, are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants. </P>
        <P>In assessing eligibility, the HSE uses guidelines based on people&rsquo;s means, which includes their income, certain allowable outgoings and the effect of other factors which may impact on people&rsquo;s ability to meet the cost of GP services.  There are also a number of income sources, including the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, which are disregarded in assessing an applicant&rsquo;s income.  Furthermore, people whose sole source of income is from social welfare or HSE allowances and benefits are allowed a medical card.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently reviewing all legislation relating to eligibility for health and personal social services with a view to making the system as fair and transparent as possible.  As part of this exercise, a review of the eligibility criteria for medical cards in the context of financial, medical and social need is being undertaken and is expected to be completed by autumn 2008.</P>

	<P>The Home Help service nationally is a well established and successful component of this Government&rsquo;s strategy to provide a range of services to enable older people to remain in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  In this context, and in order to address increasing demands in the specific area of Home Helps in recent years, approximately &euro;56 million additional funding has been provided for service improvements over the three years 2006-8.  This has enabled the provision of 11.3 million Home Help hours by the Health Service Executive (HSE) in 2006 and 11.7 million hours in 2007. </P>
        <P>Budget 2008 provided significant additional current funding of &euro;22 million to cover a range of new community-based initiatives for Older People.  This includes a sum of &euro;5 million for this year towards 200,000 extra Home Help hours.</P>
        <P>This will bring the expected number of Home Help hours nationally to some 11.98 million in 2008. Bearing in mind all the circumstances, I am satisfied that the prioritised funding made available this year will assist the HSE in meeting increasing demands on its Home Help service.</P>
        <P>An extra &euro;3.6m has also been provided, arising from the recent Budget, to enhance DayCare/Respite services in 2008. The HSE has allocated &euro;1.1m of this for an additional 345 <Col N="566"/>Day Care places, bringing the total number of such places nationally to around 21,640 by year end.  A sum of &euro;2.5m is being made available by the Executive to benefit 1,245 new Respite Care clients in the current year.</P>
        <P>I will of course, in conjunction with the HSE, continue to monitor the delivery of these various new services to ensure that provision is maximised across the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 230 and 366 together.</P>
        <P>The reduction in the wholesale mark-up paid on the price of drugs and medicines under the GMS and community drugs schemes is part of a process aimed at reforming all aspects of the drugs supply chain from the manufacturer to the patient.  The existing wholesale mark-up in the range of 15% to 17.6% is neither reasonable nor sustainable.  The Government supports the HSE&rsquo;s decision to pay an 8% mark-up from 1 March, and 7% from 1 January 2009 which will be applied by reducing the reimbursement price paid to community pharmacy contractors from those dates.</P>
        <P>In response to demands from community pharmacists to address the alleged impact of the new wholesale pricing arrangements on GMS dependent pharmacies in particular, the HSE has offered a voluntary interim contract with a flat rate dispensing fee of not less than &euro;5 for all dispensing made on the GMS and community drug schemes.</P>
        <P>I have established an Independent Body to assess an interim, fair community pharmacy dispensing fee of at least &euro;5 to be paid for the medical card scheme, the DPS and other community drug schemes.  This Body is being chaired by Se&aacute;n Dorgan, former Head of IDA Ireland. It has been asked to make its recommendations by the end of May 2008.</P>
        <P>Based on its consideration of submissions received and its own independent evaluation, the Body will recommend an appropriate dispensing fee that would, in its view, represent a fair and reasonable price to be paid for the pharmaceutical service currently being provided by community pharmacists to the HSE under the GMS and community drug schemes.  If approved by Government, it will be backdated to the date from which any individual community pharmacist may choose to avail of the HSE&rsquo;s offer.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, each community pharmacist will have three options: to avail of the interim contract as recently offered by the HSE; to accept the interim contract upon the report of the Independent Body; or to stay with the existing retail fee structure until the agreement of a substantive new contract.</P>
        <P>I believe this provides all concerned with a reasonable way to make the transition to a fair and transparent method of payment for present services and, I hope, greatly developed pharmacy services in the near future.</P>
        <P>While a number of community pharmacies have indicated their intention to withdraw services under their contracts with the HSE, I understand that no contractor has formally withdrawn <Col N="567"/>their services at this point.  There are no changes planned to the operation of the GMS and community drugs schemes and all patients continue to receive their entitlements in the usual way.</P>

	<P>Adoption is a service for children who are in need of a permanent home. My Department and I are of the view that intercountry adoption should be child centred, that is, in all stages of the process the child&rsquo;s interests must be paramount. As such, there are a number of statutory procedures regulating intercountry adoption. All prospective adoptive parents must be assessed initially by the HSE or a registered adoption society. Where applicants are recommended as eligible and suitable the application is sent to the Adoption Board for its consideration. The Adoption Board are the statutory body with responsibility for the issuing of declarations of eligibility and suitability under the Adoption Act, 1991.</P>
        <P>Each application/applicant is considered individually on their own merits. The Framework used to assess applicants was developed with a wide range of stakeholders including practitioners, academics and adoptive parents. The Framework provides that prospective adoptive parents are assessed against five standards for intercountry adoption. The focus of the assessment is on the capacity and preparedness of the applicants to meet the child&rsquo;s needs and their capability to meet the long-term challenges. These standards include, inter alia, the capacity to fulfil all of the parental duties over the lifetime of the child; the capacity to promote and support the child&rsquo;s development and well-being; the capacity to safeguard and support the child&rsquo;s welfare; and to provide the necessary health, social, education and other interventions for the child. Further details regarding the Framework for Intercountry Adoption Assessment can be provided to the Deputy, if required.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has designated University College Hospital Galway and Limerick Regional Hospital as the two cancer centres in the Managed Cancer Control Network for the HSE Western Region, which includes Sligo.  The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while at the same time allowing local access to services, where appropriate.  </P>
        <P>Where diagnosis and treatment planning is directed and managed by multi-disciplinary teams based at the cancer centres, then much of the treatment (other than surgery) can be delivered in local hospitals, such as Sligo General Hospital.  In this context, chemotherapy and support services will continue to be delivered locally.  Cancer day care units, including at Sligo General Hospital, will continue to have an important role in delivering services to patients as close to home as possible.</P>
        <P>The decisions of the HSE in relation to four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006 &mdash; 2010 (NCIP), which will invest &euro;575 million over 5 years, with &euro;358 million of this in capital grant aid for childcare services.</P>
        <P>The NCIP came into effect in January 2006, and aims to provide a proactive response to the development of quality childcare supports and services, which are grounded in an understanding of local needs.  It is building on the success of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000 &mdash; 2006 (EOCP) and has a target of creating 50,000 new childcare places, supported by capital grant aid.  Services eligible for support include those providing care for babies, full-day care, part-time, sessional playschool and other pre-school places, school age childcare including &ldquo;wrap around&rdquo; childcare places, and childminding.  Special consideration is given to supporting services which provide a range of these services.</P>
        <P>Eligibility for capital grant funding under the NCIP is assessed under a number of criteria; chiefly the nature and extent of the need locally for the service proposed, the applicant&rsquo;s capacity to deliver the project proposed and value for money.  To comply with the criteria, services, including playschool and other pre-school services, are expected to operate for minimum periods per day.  All proposals are expected to demonstrate how they will increase the supply of quality childcare and community-based projects are expected to demonstrate a focus on disadvantage.  The maximum capital grants available to private childcare providers under the scheme, for the building or expansion of childcare facilities, are &euro;100,000 per facility (subject to a maximum of 75% of the total cost) and a maximum of &euro;500,000 for multiple services in different catchment areas.</P>
        <P>The NCIP also provides capital grant aid to childminders provided they are notified to the Health Service Executive where so required under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations 2006,  or are voluntarily notified to their City and County Childcare Committee (CCCs).  Funding of up to &euro;5,000 per full-time equivalent childminding place can be applied for to undertake necessary renovative work or to purchase equipment related to the service.  In addition, a small Childminding Grant of up to &euro;630 for the purchase of smaller scale equipment is administered directly by the CCCs.  This grant was recently reviewed by my Office and I am pleased to advise that it has been increased to a maximum of &euro;1,000.  These measures recognise the fact that for many parents childminders continue to be the preferred option for childcare.  This is particularly relevant in rural areas where there may be insufficient numbers of children in an area to sustain a centre-based childcare service.</P>
        <P>To apply for NCIP funding applicants should contact their local CCC which will provide advice and assistance in the completion of applications.</P>

        <P>I understand from enquiries I have made that the service in question applied for interim NCIP staffing funding of &euro;4,800 which was declined last September as their application had not demonstrated sufficient ability to efficiently manage and sustain the service from September 2007 and therefore did not meet the requirements of the NCIP interim support scheme.  Subsequently the service requested a review of this decision which was upheld in December 2007 as sufficient evidence of financial sustainability had not been submitted.  The service was notified of this decision on 4 January 2008.</P>
        <P>The interim support scheme under the NCIP was introduced pending the introduction of the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) in January 2007, to facilitate services which were unable to meet the contractual deadline of December 2006 which applied to the previous support scheme, operated under the EU co-funded Equal Opportunities Investment Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP).  The service should contact its local County Childcare Committee should it wish to apply for funding under the CCSS.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 250 and 254 together.</P>
        <P>The Government decided in July 2005 that the best option for improving geographic access for patients in the North West to radiation oncology services is to (i) facilitate access to Belfast City Hospital and (ii) progress consideration of a joint venture for the provision of oncology services in the medium term to patients in the North West from a satellite centre in the North West linked to Belfast City Hospital.</P>
        <P>Cancer patients in the North West requiring radiation oncology treatment are referred to either St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital Dublin or to University College Hospital Galway.  A Service Level Agreement has also been in place since 2006 between the Health Service Executive, Belfast City Hospital Trust and Altnagelvin Area Hospital for the referral of radiation oncology patients from Donegal to Belfast City Hospital.</P>
        <P>I met with Minister Michael McGimpsey of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Northern Ireland on 28 November last.  We discussed the potential for further cross-border collaboration in relation to cancer care, and specifically, provision of a satellite centre for radiation oncology in the North West, linked to Belfast City Hospital.  We agreed that this issue would be progressed by both of our Departments in the context of our ongoing assessment of the feasibility of greater cross-border co-operation in health and social care.</P>
        <P>The specific questions raised by the Deputy in relation to the referral of patients from County Donegal to Belfast City Hospital and the funding for same relate to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the HSE under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department  has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this regard.</P>

        <P>The Deputy may wish to note that it is a condition of the career break scheme that if a suitable vacancy does not exist at the date of the termination of the career break an employee is guaranteed re-employment within twelve months.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Health Act, 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for arrangements to ensure appropriate service delivery for General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme (medical card and GP visit card) patients.</P>
        <P>Services under the GMS Scheme are provided by general practitioners (GPs) holding contracts with the HSE. The terms of these contracts were agreed on foot of negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO). Under the terms agreed, contracts are made available where the HSE decides, after consultation with the IMO, that there is a need for a service having regard to a range of factors, including whether the needs of the population in the area are met by the services already available.  The agreement also provides that the number of persons on a GP&rsquo;s patient panel may not exceed 2,000, save in exceptional circumstances. Not all GPs hold GMS contracts, as they may not qualify or wish to provide services under the Scheme.</P>
        <P>When a person qualifies for a medical card or GP visit card, he/she accesses services by choosing a GP from a list of local GPs who have been contracted to provide services under the GMS Scheme. The person will be assigned to the GP he/she has chosen from the list subject to the GP&rsquo;s acceptance and his/her total patient list being within the agreed limit. If a person is unsuccessful in locating a GP who is able to take on additional patients, the HSE may in certain circumstances assign an eligible patient to a medical practitioner&rsquo;s list.</P>
        <P>The arrangements for the provision of publicly funded GP services, including those provided under the GMS Scheme, are under review. I regard the existing arrangements in relation to access by GPs to public contracts as unnecessarily restrictive and it is my wish that new contractual arrangements for the provision of publicly-funded GP services should ensure that HSE contracts are open to all suitably qualified and equipped doctors.</P>
        <P>As aspects of the Deputy&rsquo;s question relate to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive,  my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter addressed and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The Emergency Department Task Force Report was commissioned by the Health Service Executive and published in June 2007.  The Report set out a series of recommendations for action to improve service delivery and included a particular emphasis on the introduction of waiting time targets for patients attending emergency departments.  The report also described a range of initiatives which would enable hospitals to comply with these targets.</P>
        <P>Significant additional resources have been provided to address the problems which manifest in Emergency Departments.  Among the developments which have taken place in line with the recommendations of the Task Force Report are</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />additional public and private Long Stay Beds,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />additional Home Care Packages and Home Help Hours,</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Rapid assessment clinics to support the catchment population of the Mater hospital.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Expansion of the GP out of hours services in North Dublin.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In terms of waiting times, a revised target of 12 hours waiting from decision to admit was introduced in October 2007.  This built on an initial maximum target waiting time of 24 hours.  The HSE is also committed to monitoring and reporting on the total length of time patients spend in Emergency Departments, whether they are admitted or not.  A number of hospitals have commenced reporting this information and the HSE expects to be in a position to publish data on up to 18 hospitals in the next few months.</P>
        <P>The HSE is also working closely with those hospitals which are experiencing difficulties in meeting waiting time targets.  The focus is on improving and streamlining hospital processes and patient pathways to ensure that care is provided in a more timely, appropriate and efficient manner.  Targeted initiatives include:</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />setting up consultant led Clinical Decision Units and Acute Short Stay Units with a dedicated number of beds,</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />integrated discharge planning implemented on a 7 day basis, including nurse facilitated discharges,</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />updating the bed management system and processes with a focus on improved discharge planning,</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />reducing inappropriate referrals from GPs to Emergency Departments,</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />reducing admissions with the duty medical registrar deciding on admissions,</P><Col N="581"/>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />standardising assessment processes,</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />enhancing diagnostic capacity.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">These initiatives which I have described are designed, inter alia, to free up capacity during 2008, to allow for more timely admissions from Emergency Departments and further movement towards a lower target of 6 hours waiting from decision to admit in line with the recommendation of the Task Force report.</P>

In recent years, the Government&rsquo;s ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future.</P>
        <P>Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.

	<P>BreastCheck commenced roll-out in the Western Region last May and in the Southern region last October.  I officially opened the BreastCheck clinical static units in Galway and Cork last December.  The expansion of the BreastCheck programme to the Southern region covers counties Limerick, Kerry, Cork, Waterford and Tipperary South Riding.  The expansion of the BreastCheck programme to the West covers counties Clare, Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo and Tipperary North Riding.  The screening sequence for roll out to individual counties will be dictated by BreastCheck&rsquo;s operational considerations such as maximising uptake, most efficient use of mobile and static units and radiographic personnel.  The programme is designed to offer repeat screening within an interval of 21-27 months. </P>
        <P>An additional &euro;26.7 million capital funding was provided for the construction of the two new clinical static units, eight additional mobile units and the provision of state of the art digital equipment.  A total of &euro;15 million additional revenue funding has been allocated to cater for national roll-out of the programme.  The full complement of 111 staff for roll-out has been approved and recruitment is under way.</P>

	<P>I have recently received the report from Mr John Fitzgerald in relation to the decision to suspend breast radiology services in Portlaoise Hospital.  This report has identified that the problems arose fundamentally from systemic weaknesses of governance, management and communications within the HSE in dealing with the situation which arose in Portlaoise.  I have asked the Board to consider whether the lessons arising from the systemic weaknesses of governance and management which have been identified in relation to the events at Portlaoise have wider application across the HSE.  To this end, the Chairman of the Board of the HSE and I have discussed the need to optimise the HSE&rsquo;s operational capability by addressing issues such as:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />robust governance and management structures, processes and procedures;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />clear reporting relationships and lines of accountability;</P>

      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a strong sense of corporate identity which permeates all levels of the organisation.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I have asked the Board to consider these wider aspects and to let me have its assessment of the overall situation as a matter of urgency, and its proposals to address matters, as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>In the light of this development, and pending receipt of firm proposals from the HSE I have not decided at this time to initiate the review referred to by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 289 and 290 together.</P>
        <P>As I have previously advised the Deputy, my Department was not furnished with any documentary or other evidence in support of the concerns that had been expressed by a particular HSE Consultant in relation to Barrington&rsquo;s Hospital. It formed the view that there was insufficient evidence available to allow it to pursue these concerns directly with the Hospital.  This remained the situation up to August last year despite consultations with the HSE and various telephone contacts with the Consultant.</P>
        <P>Last August, my Department received correspondence from the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) advising that it had obtained patient-specific information in relation to the adequacy of breast cancer services at Barrington&rsquo;s Hospital from the Consultant.  HIQA indicated that the information had been reviewed by two specialists in the field of symptomatic breast disease.  On the basis of these reviews, HIQA advised that it had formed a view that serious issues existed in relation to the management of current and future patients with symptomatic breast disease at the hospital.</P>
        <P>In the light of this new information, officials in my Department, at my request, immediately met with the Management of Barrington&rsquo;s Hospital and obtained agreement to the immediate suspension of all breast cancer work there.  It was agreed to undertake an independent review of patients&rsquo; files in the Hospital during the period 1 September, 2003 to 10 August, 2007.</P>
        <P>The Chairperson of the review team is Dr. Henrietta Campbell, Chief Executive Officer of the All-Ireland Cancer Foundation and former Chief Medical Officer for Northern Ireland and she informed me that Barrington&rsquo;s Hospital co-operated in full with the review process.  Barrington&rsquo;s Hospital published the report of this review yesterday.</P>

	<P>At present, medical cards are granted primarily on the basis of means and individual circumstances.  Under the Health Act, 2004, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive. Persons aged seventy years and over are automatically entitled to a medical card, irrespective of means.  Under Section 45 of the Health Act 1970, medical cards are provided for persons who, in the opinion of the HSE, are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants. </P>
        <P>This provision also entitles qualifying dependants to avail of a medical card.  The HSE may also grant a person full eligibility for a particular service where the person would be unable, without undue hardship, to provide that service for themselves or their dependants.</P>
        <P>In assessing an application for a medical card on behalf of a child, the HSE uses guidelines based on the means of the child&rsquo;s parent(s)/guardian(s), which includes their income after tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, childcare and travel to work.  The assessment process also takes account of other factors, such as medical or social need, which may impact on their ability to meet the cost of GP services.  The HSE has discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to provide for the granting of medical cards to any particular group as a whole.  However, my Department is currently reviewing all legislation relating to eligibility for health and personal social services with a view to making the system as fair and transparent as possible.  As part of this general review, a review of the eligibility criteria for medical cards in the context of economic/financial, medical and social need is being undertaken with a view to clarifying entitlement to a medical card, and is expected to be completed by Autumn, 2008.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 297 and 298 together. </P>
        <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the report by Dr Ronnie Pollock which was commissioned by the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Following publication of the Pollock Report in 2005, the Health Service Executive established a Working Group to undertake a detailed review of cystic fibrosis services.  The Group, which was multi-disciplinary in its composition, was asked to review the current configuration and delivery of services to persons with cystic fibrosis in Ireland.  The Group identified a range of service improvements required for persons with Cystic Fibrosis, including the need to increase the level of clinical, nursing and allied health professional staffing in Cystic Fibrosis units around the country.</P>
        <P>Arising from the Pollock Report and the emerging recommendations of the Working Group, I identified the development of cystic fibrosis services as a policy priority in the Estimates process.  In 2006 and 2007, additional revenue funding of &euro;6.78 million was provided to the Health Service Executive (HSE) to develop services.</P>
        <P>My Department is advised by the HSE that 44 additional staff dealing with cystic fibrosis were recruited on foot of this additional funding and that the necessary funding is available to facilitate the recruitment of a further 37 staff nationally.</P>
        <P>The HSE was asked to place a particular focus on the development of services at the National Adult Tertiary Referral Centre at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital.  A number of capital projects have recently been completed at the hospital and have helped to improve facilities.</P>
        <P>However, it is accepted that these developments do not fully address the immediate needs of patients.  The HSE has been working intensively with the Hospital and with representatives of the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland to progress options for further interim improvements.</P>
        <P>In the longer term, a new ward block is to be built and will include 120 replacement beds in single en-suite accommodation.  The new facility will accommodate cystic fibrosis patients and will include appropriate isolation facilities.</P>
        <P>Beaumont Hospital operates as a regional centre in providing services to adults with cystic fibrosis.  In the 2008 Budget, a special allocation of &euro;2.5m capital funding was provided to enable the hospital to develop out patient facilities for cystic fibrosis patients.</P>
        <P>My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the publication of the report of the Working Group.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Newly diagnosed HIV infection rates per 100,000 population were at their highest in 2003 at 10.03 per 100,000 population.  In 2006 there was an estimated rate of 7.95 newly diagnosed HIV infections per 100,000 population.  Current figures reflect the year of diagnosis rather than the year of infection.  Rates are population based estimates and reflect an increase in population over recent years.</P>
        <P>Since 1999, there has been a general upward trend in the number of HIV infections being reported, with the largest increase seen in heterosexual transmission.  The increased immigration of individuals from areas with high incidence of heterosexual HIV infection accounts for a significant proportion of the increase in overall numbers of new HIV diagnoses, and particularly the increase in heterosexual transmission.</P>
        <P>Three sub-reports from the Irish Study of Sexual Health and Relationships, which was commissioned by my Department and the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, will be published shortly.  The need for further measures to respond to the upward trend in HIV infections will be considered in the light of the findings of these reports.</P>

	<P>Substantial resources have been invested in mental health services.  Estimated expenditure in 2006 <Col N="592"/>and 2007 was &euro;984 million and &euro;1 billion respectively.  It is important to bear in mind that some 90% of mental health services are provided at primary care level.  Expenditure on these services is not captured in the above figures. </P>
        <P>The estimated additional cost of the implementation of &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo; the Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy is &euro;150m over 7 &mdash; 10 years.  A total of  &euro;51.2 million has been allocated since 2006 which represents over a third of the overall requirement.  In addition to the extra funding required, existing resources need to be remodelled and reallocated.  Indeed, implementation of &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo; is dependent to a much greater extent on the remodelling of existing resources than on new funding.   Both aspects of the additional investment and the reorganisation of existing mental health services and resources must be managed in parallel.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children has been advised by the HSE that the additional &euro;51.2m development funding was not used as planned because of competing expenditure pressures and the overriding obligation on the HSE to live within its approved overall allocation.  As a result, some of the planned developments in mental health services have been delayed.  However, I understand from the HSE that some of the mental health services funded in 2006 and 2007 will be put in place in 2008.  These include</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the provision of 8 additional Consultant Child Psychiatry teams</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the provision of 18 additional beds for children and adolescents at St. Anne&rsquo;s, Galway, St. Vincent&rsquo;s, Fairview and St. Stephen&rsquo;s Hospital, Cork, to increase the bed complement from the current provision of 12 to 30 during 2008, and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the construction of two 20 bed units for children and adolescents in Cork and Galway. Construction on these units is expected to commence in 2008 and be completed in 2009.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney has made it clear to the HSE in the context of their Service Plan for 2008 that there can be no question of diverting capital or development funds to meet expenditure pressures in relation to other services.  The Minister also pointed out that she believed there is scope within the HSE&rsquo;s overall allocation to deliver further service enhancements in 2008 over and above those outlined in the Service Plan through improved performance / productivity and realignment of existing resources.   The implementation of &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; will be a key priority for the recently established Office for Disability and Mental Health.</P>

	<P>On 27 March 2008, the health service employers issued a comprehensive document to the IHCA and the IMO detailing the proposed terms and conditions of a new contract for consultants employed in the public health service. A copy of this document was also furnished to the independent chairman of the negotiations, Mr. Mark Connaughton SC, who, on 28 March, wrote formally to all the parties indicating that the document appeared to encompass the various matters dealt with by him during the course of the talks process.</P>
        <P>The document was considered by both the National Council of the IHCA and the IMO last Saturday, the 29th March but a decision on putting it to a ballot of their respective memberships has been deferred for the time being pending clarification on a number of issues. The IHCA did acknowledge that considerable progress had been made last week and that it expected to be in a position to recommend acceptance of the proposals for new contractual arrangements in the near future.</P>
        <P>Health service employers met representatives of the IHCA and the IMO yesterday and further meetings will take place over the coming days in an attempt to finalise matters. A positive development at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting was the agreement of both representative bodies to the advertisement of some 100 consultant posts, commencing next week. I welcome this development as the delay in filling posts in critical areas such as cancer care, neurology, rheu<Col N="596"/>matology, respiratory care and mental health is having a detrimental effect on the development of much needed services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 318 to 320, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP) under which the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) was introduced in January of this year.  The CCSS replaced the previous staffing support grant scheme which was implemented under the EU co-funded Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and which ended in December 2007.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In providing for the CCSS and the previous EOCP support scheme, Government child care policy has recognised the need to target additional supports towards disadvantaged families in addition to the main supports which are made available to parents to assist them with their child care costs, that is Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement.  The latter payment is the responsibility of my Office, and it alone is expected to amount to expenditure of over &euro;500m in 2008.  These payments are universal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of child care they choose.</P><Col N="597"/>
        <P>The Community Childcare Subvention Scheme has an allocation of &euro;154.2 million over 2008-2010 and will continue to support and ensure the sustainability of community-based child care services which provide reduced child care fees for disadvantaged parents.  Community-based child care services will qualify for grant aid on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  The parent profile of each service, and the amount of subvention it will receive, are determined on the basis of completed parent declaration forms which they return as part of the application process.  The subvention received by services is, in turn, reflected in a tiered fee system under which reduced fees are charged to parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.  As the parent declaration forms are completed on an annual basis, the level of funding which is approved for each service is established on an annual basis.</P>
        <P>Transitional arrangements have been put in place to facilitate services which were funded under the previous EOCP support scheme to adjust to the new arrangements.  As a result, these services will receive not less than 95% of their previous level of funding in 2008.  The CCSS also recognises that in some cases, particularly in rural areas or on the islands, community child care services may operate with a small or fluctuating number of children, in which case a minimum annual grant level of &euro;20,000 can be awarded.</P>
        <P>The CCSS provides an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community-based child care services generally, and I am satisfied that it will also be effective in delivering the NCIP objectives of  supporting families to break the cycle of poverty and disadvantage.  It will also provide a framework which can accommodate any future child care related initiatives which may be introduced.  The scheme is responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage and the ceiling for funding which existed under the previous scheme has been removed.  Account is also taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  The changes which have been introduced will ensure that the most affordable child care is available to families according to their means.  Put simply, the tiered fee structure is the most effective way of ensuring that the considerable and ongoing Government support for the community child care sector, will be targeted at those who need it most.</P>
        <P>I am also pleased to advise the Deputy that, the Childcare Directorate of my Office has begun notifying services of their individual grant levels for July-December 2008 and that the total amount of grant assistance under the new Scheme will be significantly higher than was the case under the previous scheme.  I am confident that the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme is a fair and equitable way of supporting community child care operators in the provision of an affordable and high quality service to parents, based on their means.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP) which will invest &euro;575 million over 5 years in developing child care services.</P>
        <P>The NCIP came into effect in January 2006 and aims to provide a proactive response to the development of quality child care supports and services, which are grounded in an understanding of local needs.  It is building on the success of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Prog<Col N="598"/>ramme 2000 &mdash; 2006 (EOCP) and has a target of creating 50,000 new child care places, supported by capital grant aid.  Services eligible for support include those providing care for babies, full-day care, part-time, sessional playschool and other preschool places, school age child care including &ldquo;wrap around&rdquo; child care places, and childminding.  Special consideration is given to supporting services which provide a range of these services.</P>
        <P>The NCIP has a particular focus on identifying service gaps and matching supply and demand for services at a local level, both in urban and rural areas.  In this regard, the City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs), which are established throughout the country, play an important role in assisting capital grant applicants to develop child care services which need priority local needs.  The CCCs have undertaken strategic mapping exercises to assist them in identifying gaps in the provision of services in their locality, to maximise the impact of NCIP capital grant funding and ensure better value for money.</P>
        <P>The CCCs also work closely with other key agencies at local level, and are well-placed to assist the local authorities to meet the commitment in the Programme for Government to provide child care facilities as part of their social housing plans.  My Office will also continue to liaise with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government in regard to its commitments under the Programme for Government, to ensure a supply of affordable child care premises by requiring housing developers to make a monetary contribution or provide a site to local authorities for child care facilities, the location and type of which will be decided in consultation with the CCCs.</P>
        <P>The NCIP also provides for the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) which was introduced in January of this year.  The CCSS has an allocation of &euro;154.2 million over 2008-2010 and provides an effective framework for targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community-based child care services generally, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents in the form of Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement.  The level of grant aid which individual services qualify for will reflect the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  The subvention received by services is, in turn, reflected in reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the Scheme.  The Scheme recognises that in some cases, particularly in rural areas or on the islands, community-based child care services may cater for small or fluctuating numbers of children, in which case a minimum annual grant level of &euro;20,000 can be awarded.</P>

        <Quest>   her views on whether there are sufficient stockpiles of anti-virals here to protect against the imminent arrival of bird flu particularly in view of a recent statement (details supplied) which warned that waiting until an outbreak occurs to acquire anti-virals is ill-advised as it would be impossible to stockpile after an outbreak occurs due to protection and supply chain constraints.   </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Avian flu, or &ldquo;bird flu&rdquo;, is an infectious disease of birds caused by type A strains of the influenza virus. It can affect all species of birds and other animals and can very rarely infect humans. To date , there have been a small number of human cases of infection with the avian flu (H5N1) virus in situations where there has been very close human contact with infected birds. There is no evidence of efficient human to human transmission.</P>
        <P>I would like to draw a very clear distinction between avian flu and the possibility of a future human flu pandemic. Experts advise that such a pandemic may arise from the avian flu ( H5NI) virus, but this is by no means inevitable. Nevertheless, the pandemic threat is real and it is for such an eventuality that my Department and the Health Service Executive (HSE) published the National Pandemic Influenza Plan in January 2007.  I can confirm that our pandemic preparedness strategy includes the stockpiling of antivirals and these stockpiles are in place.</P>
        <P>An emergency supply of over 45,000 treatment packs of antivirals (Tamiflu&reg;) was purchased in 2004. A further 1 million treatment packs of Tamiflu&reg; have since been stockpiled. This quantity is sufficient to treat 25% of the population.  The health services have also stockpiled a supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) which will allow for treatment of almost 110,000 children.</P>
        <P>Recommendations for the stockpiling of antivirals are kept under constant review by the Pandemic Influenza Expert Group. The Expert Group advised that a quantity of zanamivir (Relenza&reg;) should be stockpiled in addition to oseltamivir (Tamiflu&reg;). 706,000 courses of Relenza&reg; have now been stockpiled by the HSE.</P>
        <P>The quantity of antivirals in stock or on order is enough to treat almost 2 million people. This compares very favourably with other countries across Europe and beyond.</P>
        <P>If an outbreak of avian influenza occurs in birds in Ireland, antivirals will be used in the prevention and control of avian influenza in occupational groups and other contacts exposed to dead or diseased birds. In a pandemic situation antivirals will primarily be used for treatment of influenza cases: -</P>
        <P>At the start of a pandemic in Ireland (when isolated cases or small outbreaks are occurring, and when transmission is not occurring efficiently), antivirals will be used for treatment of influenza cases and short-term prophylaxis to prevent infection developing in close contacts including family members and health care workers; In the event of a full scale pandemic, antivirals will be used for treatment only.</P><Col N="603"/>
        <P>As the definition of risk is likely to change over time, recommendations for the use of antivirals are kept under review by the Pandemic Influenza Expert Group.</P>

	<P>The current eligibility requirements for a Health (Amendment) Act Card, which entitles persons who have been infected with Hepatitis C through the administration within the State of blood and blood products, are set in primary legislation under the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act, 2006.   </P>

	<P>Under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme contract, between individual general practitioners and the Health Service Executive (HSE), GPs are obliged to provide services in their practice premises or by way of domiciliary visits, as appropriate, for their medical card and GP visit card patients, for 40 hours each week.  They must also make arrangements to enable contact to be made with them, or a locum/deputy, for emergencies outside of these hours. </P>
        <P>The question of whether a domiciliary visit is appropriate is a matter for decision by the GP according to the clinical need, social and other circumstances in any particular case.</P>
        <P>GP out-of-hours co-operatives allow general practitioners to put in place arrangements to provide services to their patients outside normal surgery hours in the evening, on weekends and bank holidays.  The development of GP co-operatives is in line with the overall health service policy of strengthening primary care services and ensuring that to the greatest extent possible, people&rsquo;s care needs are met in the primary care setting.</P>
        <P>GP out-of-hours co-operatives are now in place in all HSE areas, providing coverage in all or in part of all counties and the HSE Vote includes some &euro;37 million in baseline funding for these services.  This figure does not include the fees of the participating doctors.</P>
        <P>Persons who contact GP out-of-hours co-operatives are prioritised as either emergency, urgent or routine.  In emergency cases a triage nurse will organise the appropriate care for the patient and will generally arrange for the dispatch of an ambulance and/or duty doctor.  For non-emergency calls a triage nurse carries out a structured assessment by telephone of the patient&rsquo;s symptoms, after which home care advice may be provided or the nurse may make an appointment for the patient to be seen by the duty doctor at a treatment centre or, if necessary, a home visit may be arranged.</P>

        <P>While the development of health registries can contribute to enhanced decision-making in the health sector such development must have regard to issues of privacy, confidentiality and consent as well as the need to collect and hold only such personal patient information as is directly necessary for the purposes involved.

	<P>The Report of the National Task Force on Medical Staffing, 2003 set out a detailed implementation plan for reducing NCHD hours to meet the requirements of the European Working Time Directive (EWTD). Its recommendations centred on the introduction of a consultant-provided service and the appointment of additional consultants under new contractual arrangements. </P>
        <P>A national coordinator and support team was appointed, draft rosters and hours recording systems developed, and extensive work undertaken by health agencies at local level.</P>
        <P>Training principles and advice on safe EWTD compliant rosters were provided to employers by the post-graduate medical training bodies and the Medical Council.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A National Implementation Group (NIG) was established in February 2005 to oversee the implementation of the conditions of the European Working Time Directive by co-ordinating the work of local implementation groups in nine pilot sites and assisting them to identify the measures needed to achieve EWTD compliance while maintaining safe patient care and high quality NCHD training. The Group is representative of major stakeholders including my Department, the Health Service Executive and the medical representative organizations. The NIG is expected to complete its work by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>Intensive talks between management and the Irish Medical Organisation, under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, on new contractual arrangements for NCHDs are due to resume in April.</P>

	<P>I recognise that the number of General Practitioners (GPs) being trained at present is not sufficient to meet anticipated manpower need.  In 2004, my Department agreed with the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) that the number of GP vocational training places should be increased from 84 to 150 on a phased basis over three years.  Since 2005, an additional &euro;6 million has been provided to the Health Service Executive (HSE) to facilitate the creation of additional GP places.  I am informed by the HSE that to date, 36 of the additional 66 places have been filled. </P>
        <P>There are currently 12 GP vocational training programmes in the State and these programmes are accredited by the ICGP.  The HSE has indicated that there have been capacity issues within these training programmes and that this is the principal reason that it has not been possible to increase the number of training places as quickly as had been hoped.  I understand that the HSE continues to work with the ICGP with a view to addressing these issues.</P><Col N="607"/>
        <P>In 2007, F&Aacute;S agreed to undertake an update to their 2005 Healthcare Skills Monitoring Report. The 2005 Report identified a range of health care skills requirements up to 2015. The current research by F&Aacute;S, which is expected to be completed in 2008, will analyse the labour market for 11 health care grades and professions, and will help to determine future GP training needs.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) as part of its financial monitoring and control process  introduced a number of measures in September 2007.  These measures included: all recruitment be suspended for September after which the situation would be reviewed; all foreign travel was cancelled for the remainder of the year; all Hotel bookings for meetings etc. were cancelled for the remainder of the year; all &lsquo;non frontline&rsquo; expenditure be critically reviewed.  The intention was that these measures would <Col N="608"/>not impact on &lsquo;front line&rsquo; services which were to be maintained in line with the National Service Plan.  In fact at that time the HSE had exceeded its targets in certain services and had treated substantially more people than in the same period of the previous year. </P>
        <P>The recruitment pause put in place in September 2007 included a derogation process to deal with the filling of essential posts to protect front-line services and close to 900 posts were approved under this process. This temporary pause in recruitment ended on 31st December 2007 and any posts falling vacant from 1st January 2008 can be filled subject to the provisions of a detailed employment control circular issued by the HSE on January 8th.</P>

	<P>Demand for occupational therapy in the health services has been significant, hence the substantial investment which has been provided over the last number of years.  The number of occupational therapists employed in the public health service has grown from 287 wholetime equivalents in 1997 to 1,025 in December 2007.  This is an increase of 738 wholetime equivalents in that period which represents a growth of 257%. The Government has also committed to further investment in health services, such as disability, primary care and older persons services and this will result in a further increase in the occupational therapy resources available.</P>
        <P>A particular priority for the Department and the Department of Education and Science in recent years has been the expansion of the supply of therapy graduates, including occupational therapists.  Additional courses in occupational therapy were established in UCC, NUIG and UL with an initial intake of 25 places on each of the 3 courses.  The UL course is at Masters level and the courses in UCC and NUIG are bachelor degree programmes.</P>
        <P>The number of training places for occupational therapists has increased by 86 from 29 in 1997 to 115 in 2007.  This represents an increase of almost 297% in the past ten years. In <Col N="609"/>relation to the breakdown of the number of occupational therapist positions waiting to be filled nationally, the Deputy will be aware that it is a matter for the Health Service Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public. The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy.

        <Quest>  if she will make a statement on the recent Inhale report which stated that the reason Ireland had such a high level of respiratory disease was either genetic or possibly climate related, that health education was failing the socially deprived groups and that health prevention attempts had failed to reach these groups and had only been effective among middle and upper class sectors.  </Quest>

	<P>The study, which was prepared by the Irish Thoracic Society, has made an important contribution to our understanding of respiratory disease and the burden it poses on individuals and the healthcare system.  The report has identified the contribution that lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma make to the overall burden of respiratory disease.</P>
        <P>Lung cancer is the biggest cancer killer in Ireland with over 1,600 deaths in 2004 from cancer of the respiratory system.  A number of measures have been put in place with respect to cancer control including the appointment of Professor Tom Keane as National Cancer Control Director to oversee the delivery of cancer services and this year an additional &euro;35 million has been allocated for cancer control including &euro;15 million to support the initial implementation of the cancer control programme and the National Plan for Radiation Oncology.</P>
        <P>Tobacco control and reducing both the levels of smoking and the numbers of people taking up smoking continues to be a priority for my Department.  The Smoke Free At Work legislation is acknowledged by the Irish Thoracic Society as a successful initiative in reducing the impact of tobacco.</P>
        <P>The Irish Thoracic Society has also acknowledged and welcomed steps being taken to tackle respiratory disease including joint hospital/community initiatives such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) outreach programmes, pulmonary rehabilitation initiatives and the National Tuberculosis Advisory Committee which is working on measures to control tuberculosis.</P><Col N="612"/>
        <P>A national chronic obstructive pulmonary disease strategy is currently being developed by the Health Service Executive.  The work of the strategy group is well advanced and aims to provide a model of care which will provide an equitable, high quality, effective and efficient service to the population in the prevention and treatment of this condition.  The strategy group also aims to strengthen health promotion to prevent the development of COPD, including measures to reduce the rate of smoking.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the concerns of independent midwives in relation to indemnity insurance.  The Irish Nurses Organisation provides a certain level of insurance cover to independent midwives who are members of the organisation.  The INO has confirmed that this cover will be provided until the end of September.</P>
        <P>I support choice for women in childbirth.  The option of domiciliary births must only be provided in a safe and secure manner.  My officials are working with the HSE to put in place a robust national clinical governance framework in order to ensure that the practice of independent midwives is brought into close working relationships with maternity services currently delivered by the HSE and the voluntary maternity hospitals.  Subject to this being achieved it would then be the intention to bring the independent midwives within the scope of the Clinical Indemnity Scheme by means of extending the HSE cover under the scheme.</P>

	<P>The Primary Care Strategy aims to increase health service capacity through the development of services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of  general practitioners, nurses, home helps, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and others.</P>
        <P>It has been estimated that up to 95% of people&rsquo;s health and social services needs can be properly met within a primary care setting and the establishment of new Primary Care Teams can contribute greatly to enhancing community based health services.</P>
        <P>The provision of the appropriate infrastructure to facilitate the delivery of primary care services is being considered by the HSE, having regard to a number of factors.  These include the type and configuration of the services involved, the mixed public/private nature of our health system, the suitability of existing infrastructure and the capital requirements of the health services generally over the coming years.  I understand that in December 2007 the HSE sought expressions of interest from the private sector for the provision of the Primary Care Team infrastructure, with the HSE proposing to enter into fixed term leases with such providers.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 364 and 365 together.</P>
        <P>The role of the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) is to purchase treatment, primarily from private hospitals in Ireland, with the aim of reducing the length of time that public patients have to wait for surgery.  Taking both in-patient and out-patient activity, I am pleased to say that, to date, over 100,000 people have benefited from treatment under the Fund.</P>
        <P>On my instruction, the level of NTPF referrals to public hospitals has been capped since 2005 at no more than 10% of total referrals on the basis of inadequate capacity in private hospitals.  While, in many instances, a person will be referred by the NTPF for treatment to a hospital separate to the one on whose waiting list he or she is, it will sometimes happen that the required treatment will be sourced in the private system within that public hospital.</P>
        <P>Work necessarily undertaken under the NTPF initiative in public hospitals is on the understanding that it does not interfere with core funded activity and I am not aware that it is being disrupted in any hospital.</P>
        <P>With regard to the engagement of a public relations firm, the NTPF as a publicly funded body, is obliged to engage in public procurement.  I understand that its current communications contract is due to expire shortly and, in line with public procurement practice, it has initiated a public tender process to engage a suitable firm.</P>

	<P>Almost 130,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government&rsquo;s ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future.</P>
        <P>Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.  In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>Persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services qualify for a medical card, which entitles them to a range of health services free of charge.  In 2005, the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who did not qualify for a medical card, would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P>
        <P>The assessment of eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is statutorily a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE) and, with the exception of persons aged 70 and over, who have an automatic statutory entitlement to a medical card, is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants (income and relevant outgoings).  The GP visit card assessment threshold is 50% higher than the medical card threshold.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.  My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The rollout of a national cervical screening programme is the most efficient population approach to preventing and controlling cervical cancer.  The National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) is planning to roll out such a programme on a national basis around the middle of this year.  Women aged 25 to 44 years old will be screened every 3 years; women aged 45 to 60 will be screened every 5 years.  The service will be available free of charge to eligible women everywhere in the country.  Approximately 230,000 women will be screened annually, assuming an 80% take up by eligible women.</P>
        <P>All elements of the programme &mdash; call/recall, smear taking, laboratories, colposcopy and treatment services will be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated national service.  The NCSS has now completed a general consultation on the terms of a proposed contract to be offered to medical practitioners in primary care settings for the provision <Col N="621"/>of smear taker services nationally.  All consultation, discussion and agreement regarding the terms of the contract is conducted in accordance with guidance issued by the Competition Authority.</P>
        <P>The first draft of this proposed contract was substantially based on the smear taker contract of the Irish Cervical Screening Programme, Phase 1.</P>
        <P>Many medical practitioners, GP groupings and representative bodies participated in the consultation process.  The NCSS has advised the Department that there has been much positive response and interest from medical practitioners and the NCSS will accommodate a range of issues raised.</P>
        <P>Additional revenue funding of &euro;5.0m was allocated to the NCSS in 2007 for the roll-out of the programme and an additional &euro;15.0m has been allocated in 2008.  An additional 30 posts have been approved to facilitate integration and roll-out of the programme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 383 and 384 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy refers to the proposed legislation to ratify the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.</P>
        <P>The Convention and the legislation to ratify it is not aimed at preventing intercountry adoptions between countries.  The purpose of legislating and ratifying the Hague Convention is to protect children in the process of adoption.  The Hague Convention emphasises the importance of regulatory systems in protecting the fundamental rights of children, and in preventing the abduction, the sale of, or traffic in children.  Ratification of the Hague Convention puts in place the equivalent of a contract between states to regulate the standards that will apply in each jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>It is the intention that the proposed adoption legislation will ensure all intercountry adoptions meet standards of the Convention either through ratification of the Convention or through bilateral agreements which meet the standards of the Hague Convention.  In anticipation of that situation, I have asked officials to liaise with colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs with a view to assessing the readiness and appropriateness of entering discussions regarding bilateral agreements with a number of countries including Russia.  Every effort will be made to advance these discussions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 387 and 388 together.</P>
        <P>Tackling all Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs), including the norovirus infection continues to be a priority for this Government and for the Health Service Executive (HSE).</P>
        <P>Norovirus is a virus that causes one of the commonest forms of gastroenteritis.  Every year as many as 5% of the population will develop it.  Although it is known commonly as &ldquo;winter vomiting disease&rdquo; it occurs throughout the year.  In winter, people tend to be in closer contact indoors making spread more likely.  Outbreaks occur in hospitals, nursing and residential homes, nurseries, schools, hotels, cruise ships and places of employment &mdash; anywhere large numbers of people gather.  While it is not possible to prevent completely outbreaks due to norovirus, simple interventions can minimise its effects.</P>
        <P>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) has developed National Guidelines on the Management of Outbreaks of Norovirus Infection in Healthcare Settings.  These Guidelines have been disseminated to all hospitals and provide guidance on managing an outbreak, insti<Col N="623"/>tuting control measures and restricting the extent of the outbreak.  The Guidelines are for use and adaptation in hospitals and other healthcare settings.  Local arrangements can be put in place to match local needs, with the principles outlined in the Guidelines guiding decision making in all circumstances.</P>
        <P>The HSE issued National Guidelines on visiting policy to hospitals in September 2006.  These guidelines reflect a balance between the needs of patients, their visitors, hospital staff and hospital procedures which allow for the most effective delivery of safe healthcare services.  The guidelines state that the welfare of the patient must always be taken into consideration.  The need for privacy and the potential for the spread of infection means that continuous visiting hours are not in the best interests of all patients.</P>
        <P>In relation to the question on restrictions on the actual intake of patients and visiting in individual hospitals due to the norovirus, the information is not collected in the format requested by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>As part of the Multi-Annual Investment Programme 2006-2009 under the Disability Strategy, the Government provided the Health Service Executive with an additional &euro;75m in both 2006 and 2007.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which will invest &euro;575 million over 5 years, with &euro;358 million of this in capital grant aid for child care services.</P>
        <P>The NCIP came into effect from in January 2006, and aims to provide a proactive response to the development of quality child care supports and services, which are grounded in an understanding of local needs.  It is building on the success of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and incorporates among its key objectives: increasing the supply and improving the quality of early childhood care and education services.  Services eligible for support include those providing care for babies, full-day care, part-time, sessional play school and other pre-school places, school age child care including &ldquo;wrap around&rdquo; child care places, and childminding.  Special consideration is given to supporting services which provide a range of these services.</P>
        <P>Eligibility for capital grant funding under the NCIP is assessed under a number of criteria; chiefly the nature and extent of the need locally for the service proposed, the applicant&rsquo;s capacity to deliver the project proposed and value for money.  To comply with the criteria, services, including play school and other pre-school services, are expected to operate for minimum periods per day.  All proposals are expected to demonstrate how they will increase the supply of quality child care and community-based projects are expected to demonstrate a focus on disadvantage.  The maximum capital grants available under the scheme for the building or expansion of child care facilities are &euro;1.2 million per facility for community-based not for profit providers and &euro;100,000 per facility for private providers (subject to a maximum of 75% of the total cost) and a maximum of &euro;500,000 for multiple services in different catchment areas.  In addition, a small grant scheme is available for Parent and Toddler Groups.</P>
        <P>Applicants for capital funding under the NCIP first apply through their local City or County Childcare Committee (CCC), whose role it is to identify gaps in child care provision in their respective areas and to assist applicants to develop proposals to fill identified local needs. Capital funding under the NCIP is subject to the rules governing capital expenditure and the multi-annual investment framework, which are conditions of the sanction given by the Department of Finance each year for capital expenditure. To accord with these rules, the amount of capital available for allocation under the NCIP on the basis of portfolios submitted by CCCs in 2008, is expected to be in the region of &euro;120 million.  Each CCC has been allocated a portion of this figure, as an indicative budget for this year, which was calculated with reference to a number of factors, including the level of capital grant aid approved in the respective areas to date, the amount of capital grant aid remaining to be allocated under the NCIP and the child populations in the areas covered by the Committee in question. Where this resulted in a figure below &euro;1.5 million, the figure was increased to this amount. In terms of projects being <Col N="631"/>developed by each Committee, they are expected to prioritise these in the context of the funding available to their area.</P>
        <P>The following table shows the allocation of capital funding under the NCIP to each City and County Childcare Committee for their 2008 portfolios.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has designated St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital as the two cancer centres in the Managed Cancer Control Network for the HSE Dublin Mid Leinster Region, which includes Counties Offaly and Laois.  The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while at the same time allowing local access to services, where appropriate.</P>
        <P>Where diagnosis and treatment planning is directed and managed by multi-disciplinary teams based at the cancer centres, then much of the treatment (other than surgery) can be delivered in local hospitals.  In this context, chemotherapy and support services will continue to be delivered locally.  Cancer day care units will continue to have an important role in delivering services to patients as close to home as possible.</P>
        <P>The decisions of the HSE in relation to four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  Professor Tom Keane, Director of the HSE&rsquo;s National Cancer Control Programme, is currently engaging in detailed planning to facilitate the orderly phased transfer of services between locations.</P>
        <P>The specific question raised by the Deputy in relation to cancer services available to people in Counties Offaly and Laois relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the HSE under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this regard.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest> her views on making funding available toward the cost of childcare for working parents in view of the increasing cost of living here resulting from rising food prices, house prices and so on; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The main supports the Government makes available to parents to assist them with their childcare costs are Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement (ECS). The latter payment is the responsibility of my Office, and it alone is expected to amount to expenditure of over &euro;500m in 2008. The ECS increased from &euro;1,000 per annum to &euro;1,100 per annum in the December 2007 Budget. Both payments are universal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of childcare they choose.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, Government childcare policy has recognised the need to target additional supports towards disadvantaged families in addition to Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement which are made to assist parents with their childcare costs. These additional supports are provided by the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP) which will invest &euro;575 million over 5 years in developing childcare services.</P><Col N="635"/>
        <P>The NCIP came into effect in January 2006 and aims to provide a proactive response to the development of quality childcare supports and services, which are grounded in an understanding of local needs.  It is building on the success of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and has a target of creating 50,000 new childcare places, supported by capital grant aid.  Services eligible for support include those providing care for babies, full-day care, part-time, sessional playschool and other pre-school places, school age childcare including &ldquo;wrap around&rdquo; childcare places, and childminding.  Special consideration is given to supporting services which provide a range of these services.</P>
        <P>The NCIP provides for the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) which was introduced in January of this year.  The CCSS has an allocation of &euro;154.2 million over 2008-2010 and provides an effective framework for targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community-based childcare services generally. This is a significant increase above the allocation under the preceding scheme, the EOCP Staffing Grant Scheme, which amounted to &euro;37m in 2007. The level of grant aid which individual services qualify for will reflect the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  The subvention received by services is, in turn, reflected in reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the Scheme.</P>
        <P>Transitional arrangements have been put in place to facilitate services which were funded under the previous EOCP support scheme to adjust to the new arrangements.  As a result, these services will receive not less than 95% of their previous level of funding in 2008.  The Scheme recognises that in some cases, particularly in rural areas or on the islands, community-based childcare services may cater for small or fluctuating numbers of children, in which case a minimum annual grant level of &euro;20,000 can be awarded.</P>
        <P>In practice, this will mean that parents with children in such services and in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) or parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS), will have a weekly subvention paid to the service in respect of their child.  Each service will also receive a tranche of funding to subvent the costs of low income working families with incomes above the FIS threshold. A higher subvention will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under 1 year. The tiered fee structure is the most effective way of ensuring that the considerable and ongoing Government support for the community childcare sector, will be targeted at families who need it most.  It should also be noted that the cost of community not-for-profit services that have availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP, thus removing the requirement to cover rent or a mortgage, and which are run on a not-for-profit basis, should be significantly below the market price.</P>
        <P>It is considered that this combined approach of universal benefits and targeted subvention is the optimal method of distributing Exchequer funds and ensuring the most affordable childcare is available to families according to their means.</P>

	<P>The decisions of the Health Service Executive (HSE) in relation to the designation of four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  The HSE has designated University College Hospital Galway and Limerick Regional Hospital as the two cancer centres in the Managed Cancer Control Network for HSE Western Region, which includes County Sligo.  </P>
        <P>Where diagnosis and treatment planning is directed and managed by multi-disciplinary teams based at the cancer centres, then much of the treatment (other than surgery) can be delivered in local hospitals, such as Sligo General Hospital.  In this context, chemotherapy and support services will continue to be delivered locally.  Cancer day care units, including at Sligo General Hospital, will continue to have an important role in delivering services to patients as close to home as possible.</P>
        <P>I understand that in response to the Deputy&rsquo;s earlier question that the HSE wrote on the 18th February to advise that Professor Tom Keane had no scheduled visits to any hospitals outside the eight designated centres. The Deputy&rsquo;s current question in relation to Professor Tom Keane visiting Sligo General Hospital relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the HSE under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department  has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this regard.</P>

This brought the total funding available to support suicide prevention initiatives in 2007 to &euro;8 million and this level of funding continues into 2008.   This funding is being used to develop and implement national training programmes, complete the availability of self-harm services through A&amp;E departments, develop mental health awareness campaigns, implement recommendations arising from a review of bereavement services and support voluntary organisations working in the field of suicide prevention.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">It should also be emphasised that a  range of services such as mental health and primary care services is important in helping to prevent suicide.

	<P>As part of the Multi-Annual Investment Programme 2006-2009 under the Disability Strategy, the Government provided the Health Service Executive with an additional &euro;75m in both 2006 and 2007.  This funding included monies to provide new and enhanced services for people with disabilities, to implement Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005, which came into effect on June 1st 2007 for the under 5&rsquo;s and also for the continuation of the implementation of the transfer of persons with intellectual disability from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements.</P>
        <P>The Government is also honouring its promise in relation to the Multi-Annual Investment Programme for people with disabilities, with a further &euro;50m investment which was announced in the 2008 Budget.</P>

Significant additional funding of &euro;3.05 million was provided in 2006 and 2007 which brought the total funding available to support suicide prevention initiatives in 2007 to &euro;8 million.  This level of funding continues into 2008. Suicide prevention funding has been used to develop and implement national training programmes, complete the availability of self-harm services through A&amp;E departments, develop mental health awareness campaigns, implement recommendations arising from a review of bereavement services and support voluntary organisations working in the field of suicide prevention.</P>
        <P>It should also be emphasised that a range of services such as mental health and primary care services are important in helping to prevent suicide.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Data on suicide are collected through the Coroners Service and Garda&iacute; (Form 104) and published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO).    Data on alcohol related suicides and car related incidents are not routinely collected. However, a study by Bedford et al (2006) found that of the 31 suicide deaths, 56% tested positive for alcohol.  The relatively small study sample (129) limits the generalisation of these findings.</P>

	<P>The law provides that persons aged 70 years or more are required to undergo a medical review for driving licence renewal purposes.  This requirement is one which is determined by the Minister for Transport and is therefore outside my remit.</P>
        <P>In making arrangements for the provision of publicly funded GP services under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme, an agreement was negotiated between the Department of Health and Children and the GP representative body, the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO).  The provisions of this agreement took the form of the current GMS GP Capitation Contract.  This contract is a treatment-based contract and gives effect to the statutory requirement to provide GP medical and surgical services without charge to eligible persons; this includes persons aged 70 and over, who are automatically entitled to a medical card.  The contract stipulates that the fees paid to GMS GPs are not made in respect of certain certificates which may be required, for example, &ldquo;under the Social Welfare Acts or for the purposes of insurance or assurance policies or for the issue of driving licences&rdquo;.  As these non-treatment type services are outside the scope of the GMS GP contract, it is a matter between the GP and the person seeking the particular service to agree a fee.</P>
        <P>While certificates for various applications are provided by medical practitioners, they are not a medical treatment service and are not considered a core aspect of public health service provision.</P>

        <P>Road grants for works on regional and local roads are allocated annually to local authorities under a   variety of grant categories. These include, in the case of urban areas, road grants for specific improvement schemes, block grants and specific block grants for carriageway/footpath restoration, grants for safety measures at accident blackspots and grants for traffic management measures.  It is a matter for each urban authority to determine the priorities in the expenditure of the funds available to it, both from State grants and from its own resources, for works on regional and local roads.</P>

	<P>In September, 2004 the Government confirmed the Office of Public Works (OPW) as the State&rsquo;s lead agency in flooding, to be tasked with delivering an integrated, multifaceted programme aimed at mitigating future flood risk and impact.</P>
        <P>As regards flooding of roads, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is a matter for the relevant local authority, to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State grants. The initial selection of works to be funded from these grants is also a matter for the local authority. Funding of national roads is a matter for the National Roads Authority.</P>
        <P>When road grants for regional and local roads are allocated each year, my Department does not hold back a reserve allocation at central level to deal with weather contingencies.  Such an arrangement would mean a reduction across all local authorities in the road grant allocations to them at the beginning of each year.  Instead, the allocation made to local authorities is inclusive of the weather risk factor.  Local authorities are expressly advised that they should set aside contingency sums from their overall regional and local roads resources to finance necessary weather related works.</P>
        <P>In 2008, grants totalling &euro;30.092 million were allocated to Mayo County Council for works on regional and local roads. This included a Discretionary Maintenance grant of &euro;1.952 million and a Discretionary Improvement grant of &euro;1.651 million which are available at the discretion of Mayo County Council to fund contingency works arising from weather conditions.</P>
        <P>My Department would also be prepared to consider sympathetically any request from Mayo County Council to adjust its multi-annual Restoration Programmes in order to prioritise work necessitated by severe weather conditions. In 2008, Mayo County Council was allocated a Restoration Improvement grant of &euro;13.152 million and a Restoration Maintenance grant of &euro;5.614 million.</P><Col N="644"/>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 457, 464 to 466, inclusive, and 476 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the provisions of the Railway Safety Act 2005, the safety of the mainline railway network, including level crossings, is a matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in accordance with its Safety Case as accepted by the Railway Safety Commission under Section 46 of the Act.   The Act also places a general duty of care on any person being on or using the railway.</P>
        <P>The overall position regarding the closure or upgrading of level crossings is that, since 1999, over &euro;122 million has been invested in a prioritised programme for closing or upgrading level crossings under the Railway Safety Programme which is funded by my Department.  I am informed by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that a total of 581 level crossings have been closed and  373 upgraded under the Programme to date.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department has also committed to a &euro;55 million road-crossing automation programme under Transport 21.  Since this programme began in 2005, a further 34 level crossings have been automated at a cost of &euro;25.5 million.</P><Col N="645"/>
        <P>I also understand from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that there are currently a total of 1126 level crossings on in-service railway lines and that of these, 395 are road crossings (269 on public roads and 126 on private roads), 714 are field crossings and 17 are pedestrian only or staff crossings.  Of the 395 road crossings, 190 are user operated road crossings (also known as occupation crossings) at 12 of which Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann provide attendance.</P>
        <P>The level crossing upgrade programme is continuing in 2008 and I understand that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann intends to upgrade a further 28 crossings at a cost of &euro;4 million and to undertake minor upgrade works such as improvements to road surfaces, cattle grids and to sighting distances at a further 35 crossings.</P>
        <P>I will shortly be establishing a task force to develop the next Railway Safety Programme for the period 2009 &mdash; 2013.   The appropriate future level of investment for upgrading level crossings will be considered by this task force in that context.</P>
        <P>I am informed by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that over &euro;15 million has been invested on the Manulla Junction to Ballina line under the Railway Safety Programme on a number of measures to improve safety such as fencing, trackwork, signalling and structures as well as level crossings and that 16 occupation crossings remain on the Manulla Junction to Ballina line, representing 9% of all occupation crossings on the network.</P>
        <P>The level crossing at Straide, which was the location of the tragic accident in February, was categorised as a high-risk crossing in a review of railway safety carried out in 1998. Consequentially, improvement works were carried out on the crossing in 1999 which, I am informed, resulted in the crossing being re-categorised and assessed as a crossing which can be used safely.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am informed that an investigation by the Railway Accident Investigation Unit of the Railway Safety Commission is currently under way.  The results of that investigation, including any recommendations to be made, will be published in due course.</P>

	<P>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme element of Transport 21.   </P>
        <P>The implementation of individual national road projects, such as the proposed Dublin Eastern Bypass, is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Act, 1993 in conjunction with the relevant local authorities concerned.</P>
        <P>As I indicated in response to a similar Parliamentary Question on 12th February 2008, two reports were commissioned by the NRA in 2000 and 2002 on the feasibility of constructing the Eastern Bypass.  Copies of both reports were forwarded to my Department at the time.  The output of these reports consisted of a constraints study and preliminary cost and traffic reports.</P>
        <P>It was indicated at the launch of Transport 21 that feasibility study work would be undertaken on this route.  However, implementation of the project is not included in the Transport 21 financial envelope.</P>
        <P>The NRA subsequently engaged consulting engineers to update these two studies by undertaking a further engineering and feasibility study of the Bypass.  This study examines possible <Col N="646"/>route options, forecasts traffic demand and reports on scheme costs for the various options examined.  The Department was given a copy of this report by the NRA late last year and is considering it.</P>
        <P>The amount spent on the studies is a matter for the NRA in the context of their overall national roads programme budget.</P>

	<P>The study Bus-Based Park and Ride &mdash; A Pilot Scheme, published in 2002, was prepared by consultants from TAS for the Dublin Transportation Office (DTO).  This study concluded that bus-based park and ride had only a limited role to play in Dublin, and did not offer a strategic solution to transport problems in cities on the scale of Dublin, due to the population size and travel distances involved.  At the same time, the study concluded that there may be opportunities for &ldquo;satellite park and ride&rdquo;, through the provision of a series of smaller park and ride nodes on a corridor.  This form of park and ride is more appropriate where travel distances are great and demand is disparate.</P>
        <P>The TAS study forms one component feeding into park and ride strategy, and is complemented by a DTO study, endorsed by my predecessor in 2005, which addresses park and ride on the existing and planned future rail network in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA).  This second study identified 22 existing and future sites for the development of park and ride, on mainline commuter rail, on the Luas and on the Metro.</P>
        <P>Both of these studies have been considered by my Department, and have fed into my Department&rsquo;s policy regarding park and ride, including through the provision of funding under our ten-year investment programme, Transport 21.  A programme of works to upgrade parking facilities at mainline rail stations has been undertaken, and park and ride facilities are in operation along the Luas network.  Further park and ride facilities will be provided on the extended Luas network and the Metro as and when these projects become operational.</P>
        <P>In the light of the TAS study, I have also made funding available to local authorities in the GDA for the provision of bus-based park and ride facilities.  To date, there have been no applications for this funding.  A plan by South Dublin County Council for a park and ride facility close to the Lucan/Leixlip interchange, which would have been eligible for this funding, was refused planning permission by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in late January of this year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Agreed Programme for Government (June 2007) includes a commitment  &mdash; in the context of the National Roads Authority (NRA) programme &mdash; that Claregalway is to be by-passed by 2012 as part of the N17 Galway to Tuam road. The proposed bypass scheme is now being advanced as a motorway and the Motorway Order/Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was published at the end of 2007. The Oral Hearing into the Scheme commences on the 23rd April 2008. Subject to a favourable passage of the scheme through the Statutory Process, I am confident that the commitment in the Programme for Government will be delivered and that the Claregalway  will be bypassed by 2012.</P>
        <P>In addition to the development of the N17 Tuam Galway Motorway, which will provide considerable relief to the town of Claregalway, Galway County Council has approached my Department in relation to possible funding for an interim relief road. This proposal has been put forward on the basis that it would provide relief from traffic congestion, in advance of the motorway, and also because a new road in the area would open up land for housing and related development. A road designed to facilitate such development might qualify for funding under the Department&rsquo;s regional and local road strategic grants scheme.</P>
        <P>In December 2007, Galway County Council was asked by the Department to supply additional information to support the proposal for the proposed interim scheme. In particular, the Council was asked to give a breakdown of the estimated scheme&rsquo;s cost, including details of the land costs, construction costs, design, supervision and other costs. The Council was also asked to indicate the extent to which the scheme would open up land for necessary development and to indicate the financial contribution the Council would make to the scheme, including the potential income from development contributions arising from development supported by the proposed new road.</P>
        <P>A reply from the Council is awaited. When the information is received, it will be examined in my Department to assess whether the proposal would qualify for grant aid under the terms of the strategic grants scheme.</P>

        <Quest> the position regarding the proposed closure of Valentia and Malin Head coastguard stations; the number of jobs that will be affected by these closures; his views on announcements made a few years ago that Valentia and Malin Head would be upgraded and not closed; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>It is my intention that the Irish Coast Guard and Maritime Administration will be strengthened to meet the needs of this country well in the 21st century.  In doing so, I want to stress that no officer will be forced to move or lose their jobs.  Should the decision be to move from Malin Head or Valentia the possibility of keeping existing staff running their current watches from their existing stations is under evaluation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The issue of the number of centres was raised in a 2002 Deloitte &amp; Touche Irish Coast Guard Study.  The report recommended two Centres but did not identify where they should be. Over the years three possibilities have been put forward. The first was to close Dublin. The second was to close either Malin or Valentia.  The most recent proposal would in fact involve possibly relocating all three but leave one on the east coast, along with the Coast Guard and Maritime Administration headquarters, and one on the west coast.</P>
        <P>In relation to a west coast location, I have not finalised where that location should be but expect to be in a position to do so shortly.  The review of locations is currently under way and the possibilities have narrowed to a choice between a site in the Limerick/Shannon area or Malin or Valentia.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will understand that the Coast Guard restructuring that is being worked on is aimed at improving the overall quality and efficiency of a key public service.  The proposals will be considered in the context of the many comments I have received and also taking account of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s Budget Day request to each Department to undertake an efficiency review of expenditure.</P>

	<P>The Road Transport Act, 1932, as amended, provides the statutory basis for regulating the provision of public bus services by private bus operators.  In accordance with the legislation, private bus operators apply to my Department for licences to operate scheduled bus passenger services within the State.</P>
        <P>On the 20th February, 2007, my Department received an application from the operator referred to by the Deputy for a licence to operate bus passenger services between Dalkey and Dublin Airport.  At that time the applicant was advised that due to the presence of a prior application from another private operator for services on a similar route, the consideration of <Col N="654"/>his subsequent application would have to be held in abeyance until the prior application had been determined.</P>
        <P>On the 16th July, 2007 my Department was made aware that the operator concerned had commenced the operation of an unlicensed bus passenger service between Dalkey and Dublin Airport.</P>
        <P>The operation of a passenger road service without a licence issued by my Department is a criminal offence and the enforcement of such activity is a matter in the first instance for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>My Department immediately wrote to the Company advising it that the operation of such a service was in breach of section 7 of the Road Transport Act 1932.  The Company was also advised that failure to cease the operation of the service would result in the file being forwarded to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for appropriate action.</P>
        <P>The unauthorised service continued to operate and on the 15th August, 2007, my Department wrote to the operator and advised that the matter was being passed to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its investigation.  I understand from the licence holder that the new services will be introduced within weeks.</P>

	<P>I have been aware of difficulties surrounding a container of sporting goods which is being donated to the organisation &lsquo;Strips for <Col N="656"/>Africa&rsquo; in South Africa and, as a result, I instructed our Embassy in South Africa to pursue the matter with the relevant authorities there.</P>
        <P>The Embassy has made strenuous efforts to resolve the situation, including through a meeting with the Controller of Customs in Cape Town.  The Controller outlined the concerns of the South African Government regarding what they saw as the potential flooding of the market with donated second hand clothes from developed countries and thereby, he argued, possibly undercutting local production and employment.  For these reasons, he said that charitable donations of clothing into South Africa are not free from import regulations.</P>
        <P>The Customs Controller also emphasised that a once off concession, as provided for under the regulations, had already been made in respect of the beneficiary.  At that time it was made clear that further exceptions would not be made.  I very much value the work of groups in Ireland which send containers to the developing world for charitable purposes. However, I would ask them to check out local customs regulations in advance in order to avoid any disappointment or delay impacting on their generous efforts to support those in need.</P>

        <P>At the Madrid OSCE Ministerial last December, Ireland was pleased to be associated with a joint international statement on the Holodomor.  This commemorated the 75th anniversary of the event, paid tribute to the memory of the victims of this national tragedy of the Ukrainian people, and recognised the efforts undertaken in recent years to raise awareness of the Holodomor in international fora such as the UN and the OSCE.</P>
        <P>Looking ahead, the statement went on to stress the importance of raising public awareness of the tragic events of the past, promoting tolerance and non-discrimination, and strengthening the rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in order to ensure the prevention of such tragedies in the future.</P>

Applications may be made by express post through some 1,000 post offices across the state and some 70 post offices in Northern Ireland.  A guaranteed 10 working day service is available for such applications which are complete and in order.  Less urgent applications can also be made by ordinary post.</P><Col N="657"/>

Against the above background, the issue of opening additional offices in other locations will be kept under ongoing active review.</P>

	<P>I am deeply concerned by the situation in Tibet, and deplore the loss of life there and in other regions of China.  These concerns have been directly conveyed to the Chinese Ambassador in Dublin, and my Department has remained in close contact with the Chinese Embassy on this issue.</P>
        <P>I also met with representatives of the Tibet Support Group-Ireland on 1 April.  I have also carefully noted the contents of a letter of petition presented to my Department by members of the Tibetan community in Ireland on 31 March.</P>
        <P>I again call on all sides to exercise the maximum restraint and for the release of imprisoned peaceful protesters.  It is important that the facts of what has occurred are established and, in this regard, I would again strongly urge the Chinese authorities to allow full and free access by the media and independent observers.</P>
        <P>The EU Presidency, on behalf of the member states, also made clear in its concerns in a statement on 17 March.  Contacts with the Chinese authorities on this issue have continued in Brussels and Beijing.</P>
        <P>The unrest, and the regrettable violence directed at ethnic Chinese in Tibet, and their homes and business, shows the deep feelings of the people of Tibet and their wish to preserve their unique culture and identity, and to protect their basic human rights.  I have long advocated dialogue between the Chinese Government and representatives of the Dalai Lama as the best means to address issues relating to Tibetan religious and cultural identity. I would note, in this regard, the Dalai Lama&rsquo;s public commitment to non-violence and to the autonomy, not independence, of Tibet.  Now, more than ever, I believe that this dialogue should be stepped up.  This was also the main message from a substantial discussion of the situation in Tibet during an informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Brdo last weekend.</P>
        <P>Finally, I would note that our concerns regarding human rights in China are raised on a regular basis in bilateral contacts with the Government of China. In these discussions, we continue to raise our concerns about the practice of religion and the preservation of cultural identity in Tibet.</P>

Spaces are also allocated to those with a physical disability and, on a six-month temporary basis, to pregnant officers. Three spaces are reserved for the Department&rsquo;s Delivery Vans. Thereafter, spaces are allocated in accordance with a waiting list, with most officers waiting for a period of six years. Spaces are rotated when officers are posted abroad.

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The establishment and operation of the Irish Abroad Unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs has greatly enhanced our capacity to develop and implement policies to support the Irish community in Britain, in particular elderly people and those at risk of social exclusion. This has been, and continues to be, the key priority of the Government&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme.</P>
        <P>Britain is home to the largest and most significant population of Irish born people outside of our own island. They remain the recipients of the vast majority of the funding which the Government provides to assist our communities overseas. In 2007, total expenditure by the Department on emigrant support in Britain was almost &euro;11.5 million.</P>
        <P>In order to help further improve the range and quality of services offered to our emigrant community in Britain, I have recently approved the restructuring of the Government Emigrant Services Advisory Committee (D&iacute;on). The new Committee will be better regionally-balanced than heretofore, with its membership also continuing to reflect the wide range of experience, skills, dedication and involvement that has been the hallmark of past Committees.</P>
        <P>The primary emphasis of the Programme&rsquo;s funding is on supporting frontline welfare services. The organisations funded provide a range of services for the elderly, ranging from informal community networking groups for senior citizens to outreach services and advice in accessing entitlements.  This support is having a very tangible and positive impact, in particular on the lives of our vulnerable citizens.</P>
        <P>The extension of RTE and TG4 television programming to our emigrant community in Britain has been a key goal of the Irish Abroad Unit since its establishment in 2004, and was included as a commitment in the 2007 Programme for Government. Following a series of meetings between the Unit, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and RT&Eacute;, this service is now scheduled to be delivered by March 2009. It will provide the Irish abroad with a valuable link to home and will, I believe, be particularly welcomed by the more elderly and isolated members of our community in Britain.</P>
        <P>Other helpful measures introduced by the Government include the extension of eligibility for the Centenarian Bounty to include all Irish citizens born on the island of Ireland and living in Britain and elsewhere, the availability of the contributory pension scheme for people with pre-1953 social insurance contributions, and the provision of free passports for persons over 65.</P><Col N="659"/>
        <P>The &euro;15.183 million allocated for emigrant services worldwide in 2008 is the largest amount ever secured for the Programme. As in previous years, the bulk of this funding will continue to be allocated to support our emigrant community in Britain, in particular the elderly and those at risk of social exclusion.</P>

        <P>The publication of the Report on Irish Prisoners Abroad by Mr Chris Flood in August 2007 provided a welcome opportunity to review the needs of Irish citizens imprisoned overseas and the range of services we provide to these people. I believe that the Report&rsquo;s forward&ndash;looking approach provides a very helpful template for future Government action in this area.</P>
        <P>In his report, Mr Flood acknowledged the good support system offered over many years to Irish prisoners by my Department and made a number of recommendations on how this service could be further improved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While my Department already provides a number of the services recommended in the Report, I have asked my officials to examine how others might best be progressed. I am pleased to report that we are currently examining tender documents in respect of a Prisoner Case Management System - one of the key recommendations contained in the Report. This system will include a register with detailed information for each prisoner such as sentence, health status, last visit by a consular official. Once operational, this comprehensive database will enable my Department to assess the most effective way to implement the remaining recommendations.  The Government also continues to fund the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas in recognition of the frontline service they provide to Irish prisoners and their families. In 2007, my Department provided &euro;217,637 in funding to this organisation.</P>

	<P>Since becoming Minister of Foreign Affairs, I have not used a helicopter in the State, either hired or State provided. I understand that my colleague, the Minister of Defence, will shortly provide details of any travel undertaken by my Department using helicopters engaged by the Irish Defence Forces since 2002.</P>
        <P>There have been occasions where I, and officials from my Department, have been passengers on a helicopter provided by either another country or by an international organisation while engaged in official travel abroad. A recent instance was during my visit to Chad in mid November. On that occasion, a helicopter was used to take our party from Abeche to Goz Beida and back as there was no other practical option. There was no charge to the exchequer as the facility was provided gratis by the French military authorities. In Darfur, Sudan, helicopters have also been used to travel to areas where it is dangerous or impossible to move by road. These helicopters were provided gratis by the United Nations.</P>
        <P>In the time available, it has not been possible to carry out an exhaustive search throughout our network of 75 missions abroad. However, I can advise the Deputy that there has been a need for my Department to engage helicopter services on a number of occasions from 2002 to date.</P>
        <P>Helicopters were hired by my Department, as part of our EU Presidency obligations, for the official &lsquo;Day of Welcomes&rsquo; for EU accession States on 1 May 2004. These helicopters were used to transfer visiting Heads of State. The company used was Irish Helicopters and the cost <Col N="661"/>incurred was &euro;159,723. The company was chosen from an approved panel of three suppliers. The decision to use helicopters in the first instance and to engage Irish Helicopters was based on a variety of security and logistical needs.</P>
        <P>During a visit by the Advisory Board for Irish Aid to Cambodia on 20 March 2007 it was necessary for the delegation to travel by helicopter from Siem Reap to Boeng Ta Srei and back in order to see the de-mining activities of Halo Trust, which is in receipt of funding from Irish Aid. Helicopter transport was the only option in order to visit this remote area in the timeframe available. The helicopter was provided by Helicopters Cambodia at a cost of $3,649 USD and the delegation comprised three members of the Advisory Board and two officials from my Department.</P>
        <P>In March 2008 an Advisory Board for Irish Aid delegation of four members, accompanied by two officials, used helicopter transport from Freetown in Sierra Leone to the Airport. This was the only transport option available and the helicopter was supplied by the United Nations Integrated Office in Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL) at a cost of $870USD.</P>
        <P>Of all the Programme Countries in the Irish Aid programme, Lesotho is the country in which helicopter travel is most necessary, owing to the remoteness and inaccessibility by road of many locations. In most instances helicopter travel is provided by the Government of Lesotho Defence Air-force wing. Some of this transport is paid for by the Government of Lesotho and some charges fall to Irish Aid. For example, in February of this year helicopter transport was provided for an evaluation team to a number of facilities at a cost of &euro;930.</P>

	<P>The issue of civilian deaths attributed to the security forces in Colombia is the subject of ongoing action at EU and UN level. Most recently, the February 2008 annual report of the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights on the situation of human rights in Colombia notes that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in Colombia continues to receive reports of extrajudicial killings attributed to the security forces.</P>
        <P>In its report, the OHCHR in Colombia notes that the persistence of such extrajudicial killings has prompted the Government to strengthen control mechanisms, with a number of new directives produced in 2007 by the Colombian Ministry of Defence and military authorities. These directives are in line with the recommendations previously laid down by the OHCHR, and are due to be further developed in an integrated strategy on human rights and international humanitarian law which will be issued by the Colombian Ministry of Defence this year. Additionally, the OHCHR welcomes the creation of a dedicated unit within the Colombian Office of the Attorney General for the conduct of investigations into extrajudicial killings.</P>
        <P>The OHCHR in Colombia, whose mandate was renewed for a further three year period in 2007, will continue to closely monitor the implementation and results of Government initiatives to put an end to extrajudicial killings throughout 2008.  In relation to action at EU level, as the Deputy will be aware, the EU has expressed its support for the Colombian Government&rsquo;s policies aimed at ensuring the rule of law, legality, security of persons and human rights. The EU has also condemned systematic breaches of the most fundamental human rights, including the right to life and to liberty, in Colombia.</P>
        <P>The General Affairs and External Relations Council of the European Union most recently adopted Conclusions on Colombia on 19 November 2007. Ireland was actively involved in the <Col N="662"/>negotiation of these Conclusions, which expressed the EU&rsquo;s total solidarity with the Colombian people, its full support for the Colombian Government in its search for a negotiated solution to the internal armed conflict and underlined the importance the EU attaches to the ongoing implementation of the Justice and Peace Law.</P>
        <P>The Council encouraged the Colombian government&rsquo;s determination to improve the armed forces&rsquo; respect for human rights and welcomed the progress which has been made in this respect. However, the Council noted with real concern the persisting problem of human rights violations by some members of the security forces, including extra-judicial killings.  My Department continues to monitor the situation in Colombia through our Embassy in Mexico City, which is accredited to Colombia, as well as in cooperation with our EU partners with resident diplomatic missions in that country.</P>

	<P>My Department, through the Consular Section in Dublin and our Embassy in Madrid, has been in regular contact with the family of the person concerned since the beginning of this case in January. It is a deeply worrying situation for the family and I understand the acute distress they are under.</P>
        <P>Extensive physical searches of the area where the person mentioned was last seen have been conducted by specialist teams from the Spanish police. The Garda&iacute; have also assisted the Spanish police with their investigation. Unfortunately, I understand that no lead or breakthrough in the case has yet occurred.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach met with the family in Dublin on 5th March and shortly thereafter, on the request of the Taoiseach, the Irish Ambassador to Spain travelled to meet with high ranking police and political representatives in M&aacute;laga in relation to the case. The Ambassador and Consul were accompanied to the meeting by family members of the person concerned. The main purpose of the meeting was to obtain an updated account of the investigation and to keep the case alive in the public consciousness.</P>
        <P>The Embassy has been in regular contact since with the senior police officer leading this investigation and will continue to do so. He and the Spanish authorities have undertaken to keep the Embassy informed of any developments, which they are treating as a missing persons case, and of course any information received will be passed on immediately to the family both in Spain and in Ireland.

	<P>The Consumer Strategy Group in its report &ldquo;Making Consumers Count&rdquo; expressed the view that the consumer voice should be represented at the social partnership table. To that end the Group included a specific recommendation in its report that social partnership should be expanded to include consumer representation on both the Government and voluntary sides. The High Level Inter-Departmental Committee established to examine the recommendations of the Consumer Strategy Group noted that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment was already representing the consumer voice on the Government side in the Social Partnership process and that it was open to non Government bodies to apply for membership of the Community and Voluntary Pillar of the Partnership process.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for the individual bodies wishing to join the Partnership process to make application to the Department of an Taoiseach who will consider their applications having regard to a number of different criteria.</P>

	<P>The management of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s industrial property portfolio is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency, as part of the statutory responsibility assigned to it by the Oireachtas and it is not a matter in which I have a function.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by IDA Ireland that, in July 2006, it first received correspondence from the owner of the property in question in which he expressed an interest in purchasing the freehold interest of that property.  As it is IDA&rsquo;s policy to dispose of all property interests at open market value, the Agency obtained a valuation of its interest in this property in August 2006.  In October, 2006, the Agency issued a letter of offer on the freehold interest in the building to the owner at a price based on the valuation it had received.</P>
        <P>I understand that the owner of the property subsequently obtained separate valuations from two other valuers, both of whom valued the property at a considerably lower figure than the valuation provided by IDA&rsquo;s agent.</P>
        <P>Whereas there may have been disagreement between the parties as to the approach to the valuations and negotiations, it always was, and remains IDA&rsquo;s intention to seek agreement to sell its interest at current market value.  The Agency has informed me that it would welcome a meeting with the owner to discuss the outcome of the valuations received and the Agency is in the process of organising a meeting between the parties at an early and mutually convenient date to progress the issue.</P>

        <Quest> his views on maximising synergy with initiatives aimed at educational disadvantage and skill levels whilst working through existing delivery agencies in County Donegal in conjunction with LYIT and Magee University in Derry, in view of live register figures for Buncrana showing total unemployment for men under 25 is up 50% since April 2007; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The implementation of the National Skills Strategy and, in particular, the work of the inter Departmental Group now set up to oversee its implementation will contribute to maximising synergies on programmes that address educational disadvantage and upskilling needs.  These synergies will result from cooperative workings of the various education and training programmes provided through the agencies of my Department and those of the Department of Education and Science.  Such cooperative and cross-border endeavour is something that I fully support.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Quarterly National Household Survey that is collated and published by the Central Statistics Office measures unemployment.  The most recent such, deals with the fourth quarter of 2007 and indicates that employment has increased by 66,800 in that year.  The national unemployment rate is currently at 4.5%.  Unemployment in the Border region (which includes Donegal/Buncrana) stands at 5.5%.</P><Col N="665"/>
        <P>F&Aacute;S provides an integrated support service for workers made redundant.  This involves information sessions, skills analysis, training/re-training courses and job placement supports.  In the delivery of these services, F&Aacute;S liaises with other relevant agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and City/County Enterprise Boards.  It also works in close contact with the Department of Social and Family Affairs (DSFA).  Both organisations have particularly close working linkages in Inishowen and seek to jointly play a supportive and pro-active role in servicing the needs of those seeking work or further training or education.  In this regard eight Activation Seminars were held in the course of last year throughout Inishowen.  These centred on unemployment black spots as identified by live register figures. Such Seminars will be held again this year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On 5 March last both F&Aacute;S and the Department of Social and Family Affairs (DFSA) jointly organised a careers fair in Buncrana. This also had a cross-border reach with representatives from the Department of Employment &amp; Learning (DEL) in Northern Ireland, EURES and representative employer organisation being prominently involved.</P>
        <P>More than 950 job seekers in total attended this careers/job recruitment fair. There were 450 jobs on offer on the day involving 27 employers who were almost equally drawn from each side of the border.  In advance the DSFA jobs facilitator identified and contacted 561 people &mdash; all under 30 years old and living within the Buncrana employment exchange district. As follow-on, and in addition to the normal suite of training programmes, the F&Aacute;S Community Services Unit in the North-West region is currently supporting a Wider Horizons Programme for this age group.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition, F&Aacute;S and the Department of Education and Learning in Northern Ireland have jointly developed and are currently piloting a training programme that is named Workforce 21.  It is for workers at risk of becoming unemployed and those who are educationally disadvantaged through lack of relevant work skills.  The project focuses in the North West region, with special emphasis being placed on Border towns such as  Buncrana.  The programme comprises: Soft Skills Training; Individual Skill Audits; Aptitude Testing and; Specific Skills Training.  To date 190 participants from both sides of the Border have participated in Workforce 21, including participants from the Buncrana area.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science through their Further Education programmes also aim to enhance the employability of their participants. Its principle programmes include: the Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS); Youthreach; Traveller Training; Post Leaving Certificate Courses; The part-time Back to Education Initiative (BTEI).</P>
        <P>Other Further Education programmes, such as the part-time adult literacy and community education programmes, seek to relieve educational disadvantage.  County Donegal Vocational Education Committee provides these range of programmes in the Buncrana region to all those wishing to participate in them.</P>
        <P>In 2006 Strategic Innovation Fund was introduced to support projects to enhance collaboration in the education sector; to improve teaching and learning; to support institutional reform; to promote access and lifelong learning; and to support the development of fourth level education. It is envisaged that &euro;510m will be allocated for this fund between 2006 and 2013 to higher-education institutions.  The Letterkenny Institute of Technology is a collaborative partner in a number of new access, life-long learning and upskilling projects funded through the Strategic Innovation Fund.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Letterkenny Institute of Technology has recently secured funding from the Strategic Innovation Fund to lead a project with the University of Ulster entitled the North West Gateway Strategic Alliance Project. This will focus on developing increased opportunities for <Col N="666"/>cross-border collaboration.  A scoping study will be the basis on which the complete specification for the strategic alliance will be based.  The views of stakeholders, the needs of the North West Gateway region and the respective operating environments of partner institutions will inform this remit of the study.</P>

My Department, in cooperation with the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has been in consultation with USIT in relation to implementing new procedures for the operation of its Work In Ireland programmes to ensure the continuation of these programmes, as appropriate, in a way that benefits young Irish people and young people from those other countries to which these arrangements apply. Finalized new procedures were issued to USIT on 17 December by the Department of Foreign Affairs, which liaises with USIT regarding the operation of the programmes. I understand from that Department that applications to USIT for Summer 2008 travel and work programmes have recently begun and that no procedural difficulties have been indicated.</P>

	<P>Section 56 of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001 requires the liquidator of an insolvent company to provide a report to the Director of Corporate Enforcement in the form prescribed by Regulations.  There are no legal requirements on liquidators in relation to the disclosure or non-disclosure of such Reports or their contents and, accordingly, it is a matter for liquidators to determine whether to release all or part of a report to relevant parties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, it has generally been the practice of liquidators not to disclose the reports.  It is understood that this approach by liquidators reflects a number of concerns including, inter alia; <Col N="667"/>a concern that disclosure of the reports could compromise proceedings that liquidators may be taking, or contemplating taking, against officers of the company; a concern that a practice of disclosing reports could constrain liquidators' confidence in providing comprehensive, open and candid reports to the ODCE.</P>
        <P>The right of a liquidator to withhold a Section 56 report from the directors who were the subject of the report was considered in the case of Re Silken Construction Limited. The High Court Judgement of 14 November 2003 confirmed that liquidators are entitled to maintain the confidentiality of their reports and an Order for Discovery was allowed only in relation to the provisions in the report that would enable a company director to enhance his own case or save costs in defending a restriction application.</P>

        <Quest> the number of Industrial Development Authority initiated visits of potential investors or companies to Gorey over each of the past four years in an effort to bring jobs to the town in view of the fact that it has seen no job creation other than in the retail/service sector and the huge increase in population whereby it is acknowledged that Gorey is the fastest growing town in County Wexford; the dates of such visits; the results of discussions which have taken place; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its regions. The marketing of individual areas, including Gorey, for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency.  While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</P>
        <P>In line with the National Spatial Strategy, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for County Wexford is to concentrate resources on the Hub town of Wexford as the location with the greatest potential to develop first class facilities for attracting overseas industry.</P>
        <P>At present, there are 11 IDA supported companies in Wexford, New Ross, Enniscorthy and Gorey employing approximately 2,000 people.  The County has a strong base of manufacturing companies with the majority performing well in a challenging environment.  The Agency is actively engaged with its existing base of manufacturing companies in County Wexford, highlighting the ongoing importance of upskilling / reskilling and the need to add high-value activities in order to ensure their on going development and sustainability for the long term.</P>
        <P>In addition, through its network of overseas offices, IDA Ireland has been actively working to attract overseas companies in newer high-value sectors to Wexford and the profile of clients has been changing with Lake Region and Waters Corporation (Medical Technologies) and PFPC and Equifax (International Services) now firmly established in the County.  IDA Ireland is committed to the ongoing marketing of the County as a location for knowledge-intensive industries.  I am informed by the Agency that it has not hosted any site visits by potential investors to Gorey in the past four years.</P>

	<P>When job losses are announced, the relevant agencies under the aegis of my Department adopt a coordinated approach in dealing with the situation and in making the workforce aware of the supports available to assist in finding new employment or to start their own business.  The Industrial Training agency F&Aacute;S has written to both of these companies offering its services.  The agency will make its full range of services available to employees who wish to avail of these services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As regards the first company, Enterprise Ireland has been working closely with other interested parties to deliver a joint presentation on starting your own business, while F&Aacute;S plans to carry out a staff profile of all members of staff.  The latter agency&rsquo;s services can then be tailored to the requirements of particular staff.  Approaches were made to the company immediately following the job loss announcement and were repeated on 7 February last.  The company has said that agency services would be most effective if provided in mid to late April.  The first redundancies are not scheduled to take place until September.  The State Development agencies and other interested parties have been working together in preparation for a meeting later this month.</P>

	<P>The Employment Permits Section of my Department informs me that this application was refused on the grounds that it is current Government policy to issue new employment permits for highly skilled highly paid positions or for non-EEA nationals already legally resident in the State on valid employment permits.  Furthermore, the proposed employee is currently resident in the State on a Student Stamp and is, therefore, ineligible to enter full-time employment.  The employer was notified of this decision in writing by letter dated 8th February 2008.</P>
        <P>Section 13 of the Employment Permits Act 2006 requires that a request to review a decision of the Minister to refuse to grant an employment permit must be made within 21 days from the date of issue of the refusal letter.  As the request for a review was not received within this timeframe, the Employment Permits Section is not in a position to review this decision and a new application would now be required in this case.</P>

	<P>The situation with this company has not changed since the announcement, on 3 October last, of an indefinite postponement of its proposed Irish projects.  IDA officials maintain regular contact with the company executives.  The company has made no announcement regarding plans for the utilization or disposal of its site at Carrigtwohill, Co. Cork.  It is only six months since the company announced the postponement of the project and, given that the investment cycle of such projects is of the order of four years, it is too early to speculate what may happen on the site.</P>
        <P>There are several sites in the Cork area which are suitable for capital and utility intensive projects, and IDA Ireland is actively promoting the greater east Cork region to prospective investors across the full range of IDA targeted sectors, such as Pharmaceuticals, Medical Technologies, Information and Communications Technologies and Internationally Traded Services via its network of overseas offices and project divisions.</P>

        <P>Under the sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  Applications for funding under the 2008 programme were invited through advertisements in the Press on 13th and 14th of January and the deadline for receipt of applications was 29th February for paper-based applications and 7th March for online applications.  All applications received before the deadline are currently being evaluated against the programme&rsquo;s assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme.  I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.  In this regard, I must inform the Deputy that there is no record of an application being received under the name supplied.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I must also point out that the sports capital programme does not assist in the acquisition of sites or premises.

It allows for tax relief on donations made to approved sports bodies for the funding of sports capital projects, including the purchase of land or premises.  In this regard, the organisation should contact the Revenue Commissioners for further information or download the scheme guidelines from www.revenue.ie or www.dast.gov.ie.</P>

	<P>Department officials and I have met with the organisation in question to be briefed on the content of their Strategic Plan. The Deputy will be aware that the Irish Sports Council (ISC) has a statutory role in the development of sport in Ireland.  One of the ISC&rsquo;s primary functions, as set out in the Irish Sports Council Act, 1999, is to develop strategies for increasing participation in recreational sport and to coordinate their implementation by all bodies involved in promoting recreational sport and providing recreational facilities, which includes the funding of the recognised National Governing Bodies of Sport.  In pursuance of this function the Irish Sports Council provides funding on an annual basis to the National Governing Bodies of Sport including the organisation referred to by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>My Department funds the ISC on an annual basis and has allocated over &euro;57.3 million to the ISC in 2008, compared to just over &euro;13.2 million in 2000, its first full year of operation.  This represents an increase of 334%.  This significant level of funding ensures that the ISC can continue to embark on initiatives and programmes that increase participation in sport and physical recreation by people of all ages in the country.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive has advised that there is no record of an application for mortgage interest supplement from the person concerned. If the person concerned wishes to make an application for mortgage interest supplement then she should contact the community welfare officer at her local health centre who will assess her means and determine entitlement to mortgage interest supplement.</P>
        <P>The purpose of mortgage interest supplement is to provide short term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence. The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only. The capital element of the repayment is not taken into account in calculating the amount of supplement payable as it is not considered appropriate that the Exchequer should repay part of the initial loan and thereby provide assistance towards the accumulation of a capital asset on the part of the individual concerned.</P>
        <P>Under standard SWA rules, mortgage interest supplements are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution, currently &euro;13, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Many recipients pay more than &euro;13 because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional <Col N="678"/>assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their accommodation costs.</P>
        <P>Under this standard assessment, family income supplement is assessed as income in the same way as income from employment or part-time employment.  Where a person has an additional income as a result of participation on a training course or in part-time employment, the standard means test now provides that the first &euro;75 of any additional income in excess of the SWA rate can be disregarded in full with 25% of any additional income, with no upper limit, also disregarded for means assessment purposes.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 547, 567 and 591 together.</P>
        <P>In order to qualify for the maximum rate of the state pension (contributory) a person must, amongst other qualifying conditions, achieve a yearly average of at least 48 contributions paid or credited on his/her social insurance record over their working life. Reduced pensions are paid to those with yearly averages as low as 10 contributions. Arrangements are also in place to cater for those with social insurance contributions at different rates, with contributions from other EU member States or countries with which Ireland has reciprocal social security agreements and with pre-1953 contributions.</P>
        <P>The range of different payments available has made it easier for people to qualify for a contributory pension. Measures are also in place to protect the social welfare pension entitlements of those who leave work to care for sick or elderly relatives. People who qualify for payments such as carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit may, subject to conditions, qualify for credited contributions. The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. This scheme applies to people who take time out of the workforce for caring duties but who do not qualify for credits through the carer&rsquo;s allowance or benefit schemes.</P>
        <P>Any person, including a carer, may pay voluntary contributions once they satisfy certain qualifying conditions. Voluntary contributions allow a person to remain insured once they leave the compulsory PRSI system. A person may choose to pay voluntary contributions, provided <Col N="679"/>they are no longer covered by a PRSI scheme on a compulsory basis in Ireland, are no longer covered by a PRSI scheme on a compulsory or voluntary basis in any other E.U. country, are under age 66 and satisfy the qualifying conditions. Voluntary contributions provide cover for long-term benefits, such as pensions.</P>
        <P>To become a voluntary contributor a person must have paid at least 260 PRSI contributions in either employment or self-employment and apply within 12 months of the end of the contribution year during which they last paid compulsory insurance or were last awarded a credited contribution. The person must agree to pay voluntary contributions from the start of the contribution week that follows the week in which they left compulsory insurance.</P>
        <P>From June 2006 the number of hours a person can engage in employment, self employment, education or training outside the home and still be eligible for carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant was increased from 10 to 15 hours per week.  Where a carer remains in employment he or she will continue to pay the appropriate social insurance contribution.</P>
        <P>Overall, I am satisfied that adequate arrangements are in place to protect the pension entitlements of people who leave employment to provide full-time care so that they can qualify for a contributory pension. There are, of course, people caring who cannot benefit from these measures. The position of these, and others who are at present not receiving support through the social welfare pension system, is considered in the Green Paper on Pensions. A consultation process on the Green Paper is now underway and will remain open until end of May.</P>
        <P>The Government will respond to the process by publishing a framework for future policy on all aspects of pensions and I expect that this will be finalised before the end of the year. The position of those who are at present without a contributory pension entitlement will be considered in that context.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 548 and 590 together.</P>
        <P>Supporting and recognising carers in our society is, and has been, a priority of the Government since 1997. Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.</P>
        <P>Carer&rsquo;s allowance, in line with other social assistance schemes, is means-tested.  This ensures scarce resources are directed at those in greatest need. The primary objective of the carer&rsquo;s allowance is to provide income support to low income carers. The carer&rsquo;s allowance means test is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household incomes. It has been significantly eased over the years, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.</P>
        <P>Increases to the carer&rsquo;s allowance income disregard provided for in Budget 2008 mean that from this Thursday, 3 April, a single person can have an income of &euro;332.50 per week and a couple can have an income of up to &euro;665 per week and still qualify for the maximum rate of <Col N="680"/>carer&rsquo;s allowance. The previous levels were &euro;320 and &euro;640 per week respectively. This ensures that a couple can have an income in the region of &euro;37,200 per year and still qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance while a couple in receipt of an income of &euro;60,400 will qualify for a minimum payment, as well as the associated free travel, household benefits package and the respite care grant. This increase surpasses the  Towards 2016 commitment to ensuring that those on average earnings can qualify for carer&rsquo;s allowance. In addition, in Budget 2008 the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance was increased to &euro;214 per week for those aged under 66 and to &euro;232 per week for those aged over 66, with effect from January 2008.</P>
        <P>Budget 2007 provided for significant structural reforms to introduce new arrangements whereby people in receipt of a social welfare payment, other than carer&rsquo;s allowance or benefit, who are also providing someone with full time care and attention, can retain their main welfare payment and receive another payment, depending on their means, the maximum of which will be equivalent to a half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance. Similarly, people currently in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s allowance, who may have an underlying eligibility for another social welfare payment, can transfer to that other payment and continue to receive up to a half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance. These new arrangements came into effect in September 2007 and to date over 7,000 carers have benefited. In June 2006, the number of hours for which a person can engage in employment, self-employment, education or training and still be considered to be providing full- time care for the purposes of carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant was increased from 10 to 15 hours per week.</P>
        <P>From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full-time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income. Since then a grant is paid in respect of each care recipient. A carer who is caring for two or more persons is entitled to a full grant for each of the care recipients. Following Budget 2008, the rate of the grant will increase to &euro;1,700 per year from June 2008.</P>
        <P>I will keep the supports for carers available from my Department under review in order to continue to improve the schemes and ensure commitments on income support are delivered.</P>

	<P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of a Special Partial (self-employed) State Pension (Contributory), payable at &euro;111.70 per week.   Social insurance contributions (Class S PRSI) were introduced for self-employed people on 6th April 1988.  However the person concerned had reached age 56 by that date, and therefore did not qualify for a standard rate State Pension (Contributory), as he did not satisfy the condition of entering social insurance before age 56.  A Special Partial State Pension (Contributory) was introduced for this category of self-employed people, with effect from 9th April 1999, and the person concerned qualified for that pension.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 552, 553 and 557 together.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government states: &ldquo;The role and economic contribution of spouses working on the farm will be better recognised within the social insurance system, following on from Budget 2007 which allowed recipients of Farm Assist to make PRSI contributions for the first time&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>There are three situations where spouses may pay contributions.  Spouses who are actively engaged in a commercial partnership, including the operation of a farm, as opposed to simply being the joint owners of a property, are treated as individual self-employed contributors and are thus liable to social insurance contributions. These contributions &mdash; made under PRSI Class S &mdash; enable them to build up an insurance record in their own right and to receive accruing benefits. A partnership is commonly understood to be an association of two or more persons for the purpose of gain or of sharing in the work and profits of an enterprise. Liability for PRSI contributions is not contingent on the ownership of property but rather on the nature of the business arrangements between the couple. Co-ownership of property does not in itself create a partnership.</P>
        <P>In the situation where a family business or farming enterprise is incorporated as a limited company, spouses involved in the business can establish a social insurance record as either employees or as self-employed contributors &mdash; depending on whether a contract of service exists.</P>
        <P>Finally, a spouse engaged in &ldquo;off-farm&rdquo; employment, will pay social insurance contributions in his or her own right. This enables farming spouses who might otherwise not be insured to develop a social insurance record on the basis of their &ldquo;off-farm&rdquo; earnings. Under the provisions of the Towards 2016 social partnership agreement, an information leaflet is currently being developed between the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to set out the social welfare and tax implications of families co-working in a shared business. The views and input of the farming representatives have fed into this process to ensure that the new publication meets with their information needs and is customer orientated. The leaflet will be published shortly. It should also be noted that under the Programme for Government there is a commitment to improve the income limits associated with the qualified adult allowance to enable more people to qualify for it. The limits will be reviewed in the context of the budget.</P>

	<P>EU nationals who come to work in Ireland but whose families remain in their home country may have an entitlement to family benefits, e.g. Child Benefit, in Ireland under EU Regulation 1408/71.  Since 2005 the number of claims in respect of non-resident children of EU nationals has increased significantly.   This influx has resulted in delays in finalizing claims.  A number of measures has been taken to streamline and improve the processing of EU claims, amongst them being increases in the numbers of staff working in the unit. In September 2007, 10 additional staff were assigned to the area on a temporary basis. A review of processes in the unit has recently been concluded and further additional resources are to be assigned, bringing the staffing level including both permanent and temporary staff to some 47 posts (compared to 19 in 2005).  Included in the staff assigned to the unit are 3 native Polish speakers working on temporary contracts.  The increase in staff numbers, coupled with the judicious use of overtime and the implementation of a number of other process improvements, will result in an improvement in the work of the unit during 2008.  </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 559 and 560 together.</P>
        <P>The Child Benefit scheme has, in recent years, years experienced significant expansion in the volume of claims received, the rates of payment and the diversity of the customer base. Over the last five years, the rate of benefit has almost doubled.  The annual cost in 2008 will be in excess of &euro;2.3 billion and the payment is now made for children of some 180 nationalities living in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Against this background, the control policy for the child benefit scheme has been reviewed to ensure that controls against fraud and abuse of the scheme continue to be effective and relevant.  As a result of the review, enhanced and updated control measures have been devised.  These include the issue of certificates to sub-sets of selected groups of customers for completion and return to the Department to confirm that they continue to satisfy the conditions for receipt of Child Benefit.  Customers selected for the reviews have to date been selected by and large from non-Irish nationals in receipt of Child Benefit, both those with children resident in Ireland and those working here whose children are resident outside of Ireland. The review process will be expanded to include other customer groups in the future.</P>
        <P>In the case of non-Irish national recipients who are resident in Ireland with their children, certification is requested that the children continue to reside here &mdash; the proof of such residence can be provided via  details of the school or college their child attends or, if the child is not of school-going age, details of the doctor or cr&egrave;che they attend.  This information is used solely to verify that the children are resident in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In the case of EU nationals who are working in Ireland but who have qualified children living in another EU state, certification by their employer of continuing employment is requested.  This information is not used for any other purpose.  Where the required certification is not provided within the timescale requested (21 days) the payment of Child Benefit is suspended pending further enquiry.  If certification is subsequently provided any payments of child benefit which were suspended will be made in full.</P>
        <P>A percentage of all replies is checked to ensure the accuracy of the information provided, with cases referred to Social Welfare Investigators for follow-up action as necessary.  These reviews commenced in November 2007 and approximately 23,000 review letters have issued since then.  This number will increase in the coming months and it is expected that in excess of 100,000 customers will be reviewed in 2008 (this equates to 18% of all Child Benefit customers.)</P>

The Health Service Executive has advised that in December 2006, it refused a payment of rent supplement in this case on the grounds that the local housing authority had not certified that the person concerned has a housing need. The Executive has further advised that this decision has not been appealed by the person concerned. It has confirmed that it has not received a new application for rent supplement from the person concerned. </P>

	<P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the HSE, an exceptional needs payment (ENP) may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which the applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources. There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is determined by the Executive based on the particular circumstances of the case. Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health service executive payment.  Non payment of rent is not a case for making an exceptional needs payment.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has advised that the person concerned is in receipt of a rent supplement (in addition to a one parent family payment, and a reduced rate illness benefit payment) at the maximum rates payable appropriate to her circumstances.</P>
        <P>The Executive has further stated that the person concerned, on the advice of the Community Welfare Officer (CWO), met with a representative of the local Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), in January 2008 and also in early February 2008, in order to discuss her financial situation with a view to arranging a resolution to the issue. The CWO has been in contact with the person concerned following on from her meetings with the MABS office in order to examine her current personal circumstances and has advised that in his opinion the payment of an ENP is not warranted at this time.</P>

	<P>My Department provides a wide range of second chance education opportunities to equip people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.</P>
        <P>Attendance at approved full-time courses of education provides opportunity for personal development and progression to employment for those dependent on income support.  I consider that the existing arrangements applying to the back to education allowance (BTEA), which excludes distance learning courses, is best suited in meeting the objectives of the scheme namely, enhancing the employability skills of vulnerable groups who are distant from the labour market.</P>
        <P>Participants on the BTEA scheme are paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum personal rate of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies them for participation in the scheme.  In addition participants are paid an annual cost of education allowance, currently &euro;400.  For the 2008/09 academic year this allowance will be &euro;500.</P>
        <P>There are two strands to the scheme, a second level option and third level option. Under the second level option, a person may attend a second level course of study at any community, comprehensive, secondary, or vocational school.  The course being pursued must be a full-time day course of study that leads to a certificate that is recognised by the Department of Education and Science or validated by the Further Education Training and Awards Council (FETAC).</P>
        <P>The Third level option allows a person to attend an approved third level course of study at any recognised university or third level institution.  The course must be a full-time day course of study which is an approved course recognised by the Department of Education and Science for the Higher Education Grant Scheme, the Vocational Education Committee&rsquo;s Scholarship Scheme, the Third Level Maintenance Grant Scheme for Trainees or validated by the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC).</P>
        <P>I have no plans to extend the scheme to include distance learning courses within the scheme. I will of course continue to monitor the scheme but I believe that, overall, the current arrangements as provided by my Department&rsquo;s back to education allowance scheme are adequate and ensure that resources are targeted at those who are most in need.</P>

	<P>The customer in this case made an application for Old Age Non Contributory Pension on the 19th February 1990. At the time of application the customer declared that both she and her spouse were in receipt of a U.S. pension. Following an assessment by the Social Welfare Inspector a reduced rate of Old Age Non Contributory Pension, including an increase in respect of her spouse was awarded to the customer from the 18th May 1990. </P>
        <P>The customer&rsquo;s spouse subsequently made an application for Old Age Non Contributory Pension on reaching pension age on 29th January 1991. He was awarded a reduced rate Old Age Non Contributory Pension based on his declaration of means and continued to be paid until his death on the 1st April 2007.</P>
        <P>Following receipt of an enquiry from the solicitor acting for his estate, my Department requested a schedule of assets from the estate of the deceased pensioner. On receipt of this schedule it was shown that the estate consisted of property to the value of &euro;1,585,000 and savings of &euro;85,715. As the amount of savings was not consistent with the customer&rsquo;s rate of payment, the case was referred to the Social Welfare Inspector for investigation. The Solicitor acting for the estate was advised not to distribute the assets of the estate until the matter was finalised by the department.</P>
        <P>Following investigation it has been determined that a debt is due to the department and the solicitor acting for the estate was advised accordingly on the 8th February 2008. No monies have as yet been received in the department.  In view of the new information now to hand, this customers continued entitlement to pension is under review and a Social Welfare Inspector will be calling to interview her in this regard in the near future.</P>

	<P>The Social Welfare appeals system is quasi-judicial and the procedures involved are designed to ensure that every appellant gets full and fair consideration.  I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that, ordinarily, appellants are sent their decisions in writing within three or four weeks of an oral hearing.  In unsuccessful appeals, the Appeals Officers set out the reasons for their decisions.  </P>
        <P>In a small number of cases, for example complex legal cases where more research is required or cases whether further clarification is requested from the parties to an appeal, it may not be possible to adhere to these time limits.  There is no maximum length of time in which a decision must issue.</P>
        <P>I am advised that improving processing times of all aspects of the appeals process is a major objective of the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  However, it is necessary at all times to ensure that progress in this regard is achieved in a manner which is not in conflict with the demands of natural justice and the requirement that every appeal be fully investigated and examined on all its merits.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The persons concerned are married and each is in receipt of a farm assist payment.  The basis of the decisions to award them farm assist is currently under appeal.  A Deciding Officer assessed the means of the husband at &euro;89.47 from 20 February 2008.  The means assessed are halved, as his wife is in receipt of a social welfare payment in her own right, giving an effective weekly means of &euro;45.00 (rounded to nearest euro).</P>
        <P>His farm assist entitlement is subject to the limitation in the legislation which provides that, where one spouse is entitled to one of a number of Social Welfare payments, including farm assist and the other is also entitled to a Social Welfare payment, the total payable to them cannot be more than the married rate of allowance payable in each case.</P>
        <P>The maximum payment he can receive, if he were claiming alone for the family is &euro;239.10 (personal rate of &euro;197.80, plus Qualified Adult allowance of &euro;131.30, less &euro;90.00 means).  His means are derived from the benefit of spouse&rsquo;s off-farm employment and income from a holding.  Because his wife is also in receipt of a payment the limitation clause requires that the family rate be halved, giving him an entitlement of &euro;119.55.</P>
        <P>A Deciding Officer assessed the means of the wife, within the couple, at &euro;18.00 from 31 October 2007.  The means assessed are halved, giving an effective weekly means of &euro;9.00 (rounded to nearest euro).  The maximum payment she can receive, if she were claiming alone for the family is &euro;311.10 (personal rate of &euro;197.80, plus Qualified Adult allowance of &euro;131.30, less &euro;18.00 means).   Her means are derived from the benefit of earnings from a holding only.  The family rate is halved, giving her an entitlement of &euro;155.55.  This gives the couple a total entitlement of &euro;275.10 (&euro;119.55 plus &euro;155.55).</P>
        <P>Under Social Welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers.  These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

	<P>The person concerned originally applied for Disability Allowance on 25 November 2005.  The principal conditions for receipt of disability allowance are that the medical eligibility criteria are met and the means test which applies is satisfied.  The person concerned satisfies the medical eligibility criteria.

        <P>He appealed the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  Following an examination of the facts the Appeals Officer disallowed his appeal.  In giving a decision on 29 May 2006 the Appeals Officer indicated that the claimant&rsquo;s means exceed the limit for entitlement to an allowance.  An Appeals officer&rsquo;s decision is final and conclusive in the absence of new evidence or facts or any change of circumstances since the decision was given.</P>

        <Quest>  the progress made by his Department following the recommendations by the Irish Human Rights Commission in relation to a special pension for the self employed introduced in 1999; if the committee of experts has completed it&rsquo;s review of the matter in the context of it&rsquo;s annual report on compliance with the European Code of Social Security submitted by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[12009/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The case reported on by the Irish Human Rights Commission (IHRC) involves a couple who were over 56 years of age in 1988 when compulsory social insurance for the self-employed was introduced and who could not, therefore, satisfy one of the basic requirements for pension as they did not commence paying insurance 10 years before pension age.   </P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, a special pension paid at half the personal rate and requiring the payment of at least 260 contributions was introduced in 1999 to cater for such people. The IHRC recommended that a reduced benefit should also be paid to people who, because of advanced age, could not satisfy the conditions for this special pension. This would be a significant departure from the principles underpinning qualification for pensions, and other benefits, which require that a minimum level of contributions should be made before a person can qualify for a payment.</P>
        <P>In its conclusions on the provisions relating to the special pension for the self employed, the Irish Human Rights Commission (IHRC) placed particular emphasis on Article 29(5) of the European Code of Social Security.  This section deals with the situation where the beneficiary, because of his advanced age at the moment the pension scheme enters into force, is unable to fulfil the qualifying conditions.  In such circumstances, the Code provides for the payment of a reduced pension &ldquo;under prescribed conditions&rdquo; to be determined in national legislation.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, the views of the ILO Committee of Experts, which examines annual national reports on compliance with the European Code of Social Security on behalf of the Council of Europe, were sought on the conclusions of the IHRC report, and in particular whether the provisions of the Code require the payment of a pension in the circumstances, regardless of how few contributions have been paid by the person involved. The ILO Committee has recently been in touch with the Department in this regard and has indicated that Article 29(5) applies only to pension schemes &ldquo;conditional upon a minimum period of contribution or employment&rdquo;, which, by definition, do not require pension to be paid in all cases, regardless of how few <Col N="697"/>contributions have been paid by the person concerned. This response indicates that the Department&rsquo;s position in this matter is likely to be upheld.</P>
        <P>The report of the ILO Committee will be reviewed at the beginning of April by a Council of Europe Governmental Committee of Experts on Social Security tasked with the interpretation of the Code.  The IHRC has been informed of the up to date position.</P>

	<P>The national fuel allowance scheme assists householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive (HSE) payments with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season.  The allowance represents a contribution towards a person&rsquo;s normal heating expenses.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full. </P>
        <P>Improvements to the fuel allowance in recent years include an easing of the means test, extending the duration of the fuel season and an increase in the rates of payment.  Budget 2006 provided for an increase in the rate of fuel allowance of &euro;5.00 from &euro;9.00 to &euro;14.00 (&euro;17.90 in designated smokeless areas) and Budget 2007 increased the rate of fuel allowance by &euro;4 from &euro;14 to &euro;18 (&euro;21.90 in designated smokeless areas).  The cumulative effect of these two Budgets has seen a doubling of the fuel allowance in this period. The income threshold for eligibility to fuel allowance was also increased by &euro;49 from &euro;51 to &euro;100 above the state pension (contributory) rate.</P>
        <P>In Budget 2008 I have extended the duration of the payment by 1 week to 30 weeks in total. This extra week will be added on at the end of the fuel season in April.  This increase in the duration of the fuel season will cost an extra &euro;5.6m per annum bringing the estimated expenditure this year to &euro;167.1m for some 286,200 households that will benefit under the scheme.</P>
        <P>Any other changes in relation to fuel allowances would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of the resources available for improvements in social welfare generally.</P>

	<P>In assessing means deriving from payments received from EU Member States (including the U.K.) which do not form part of the EMU currencies, my Department uses the conversion mechanism provided for under Article 107 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 574/72 on Social Security for Migrant Workers. The exchange rates for converting Sterling and other non-Euro currencies are published quarterly in the Official Journal of the European Union.  </P>
        <P>Under this mechanism the conversion rate used for means testing purposes is derived from the average of the daily exchange rates in the first month of a quarter.  This rate is then used in all conversions made during the course of the succeeding quarter.  Alternatively the conversion rate applicable to the next succeeding quarter is used if it is found to be more beneficial to the customer.</P><Col N="698"/>
        <P>Generally, pensions are not reviewed specifically because of movements in the exchange rate as over time rate fluctuations tend to even themselves out.  The application of Rule 5 and similar disregards to State Pension means assessments over a number of years mean that it is very unlikely that these pensioners would qualify for an increase in pension.</P>

        <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance and applied for a Disability Allowance on 12th September 2007.

The person concerned will be notified of the date of examination in Belmullet; this would be during the early part of May next.  However, if the customer wishes to be accommodated for an exam in the Ballina area instead, this can be arranged.  There are examinations scheduled for Ballina on 10th April. If the person concerned wishes to attend this exam, arrangements will be made for his travel expenses to be paid by the Department.</P>

	<P>The Community Employment, or CE, scheme is designed to assist long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged persons by offering them part-time and temporary work positions in jobs based within local <Col N="699"/>communities. Following the placement, participants are actively encouraged to capitalise on the skills and experience that they have obtained through the scheme by seeking more permanent part-time and full-time opportunities within the mainstream workforce.</P>
        <P>Participants on the CE scheme are provided with an average of 39 hours of paid employment per fortnight for a one-year period. Income from this work is assessable for tax (PAYE) and liable to PRSI Class A contributions on all earnings above the PRSI-Free Allowance of &euro;127 per week.</P>
        <P>The obligation to pay PRSI Class A contributions was introduced by the Social Welfare Act, 1996, in a bid to enhance the working status of CE participants and to afford them the same level of social protection as fully insured workers.  This extension effectively placed these workers on an equal footing with PRSI Class A workers &mdash; both in terms of social insurance liabilities and benefits.</P>
        <P>The level of the weekly social insurance contribution that is payable is, for the most part, determined by both the level of reckonable earnings in that week and the appropriate PRSI rate. The PRSI exemption on low earnings has now been increased to &euro;352 per week (up from &euro;339 in 2007) &mdash; any earnings above this level are liable to an employee PRSI contribution rate of 4%. Above this threshold point contributors are entitled to a PRSI-Free Allowance of &euro;127 per week that reduces the &lsquo;step-effect&rsquo;, whereby an employee with gross weekly pay over &euro;352 could have lower net pay that an employee earning &euro;352 or less per week, of the threshold.</P>
        <P>Therefore, a person insured under PRSI Class A-8 with an income up to &euro;352 per week will have a nil liability whereas a person insured under PRSI Class A-9 with an income of more than &euro;352 per week will have a PRSI liability of 4% on the portion of that income above the &euro;127 PRSI-Free Allowance.</P>
        <P>This tiered system enhances employment incentives for low-earning employees by ensuring that they do not experience any financial difficulties from the payment of social insurance contributions. It is therefore fair to say that participants in the CE scheme are not being unduly disadvantaged over other workers with similar weekly earnings.  There are currently no plans to change the existing provisions.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>  the action he proposes to take to meet the increased rent support needs of private renting tenants where rent has been increased by the landlord but where the Health Service Executive acting on behalf have refused to increase the rent support thereby forcing such tenants into lower quality and unfit accommodation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

	<P>Rent supplement is administered on my behalf by the Health Service Executive (HSE) as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur.  Rent limits are set at levels that enable the different eligible household types to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State.  The objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation having regard to the size of the household. </P>
        <P>Expenditure on the rent supplement scheme in 2007 was almost &euro;391.5 million.  There are currently over 61,000 rent supplements in payment.  Some 52,000 have been awarded since the current rent limits were set in January 2007.  This suggests that the limits are set at reasonable levels at present.  Setting maximum rent limits higher than are justified by the open market would have a distorting effect on the rental market, leading to a more general rise in rent levels. This in turn would worsen the affordability of rental accommodation unnecessarily, with particular negative impact for those tenants on lower incomes, including people in low wage employment.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding these limits, under existing arrangements the Health Service Executive may, in certain circumstances, exceed the rent levels as an exceptional measure, for example:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />where the person concerned is entitled to an income disregard AND has sufficient income to meet his or her basic needs after paying rent, taking into account the appropriate rate of rent supplement that is otherwise payable in the case</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />where there are special housing needs related to exceptional circumstances, for example, disabled persons in specially-adapted accommodation or homeless persons,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />where the tenant will be in a position to re-assume responsibility for his/her rent within a short period</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This discretionary power ensures that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme and specifically protects against homelessness.</P>
        <P>In January 2007 a review was completed of the maximum levels of rent which a person may incur and still be eligible to receive rent supplement.  The purpose of the review was to inform the process of setting new limits, applicable from January 2007 until 30 June 2008.  The review included consultation with the HSE, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Central Statistics Office, the Private Residential Tenancies Board and voluntary agencies working in this area.  This process ensures that the new rent limits reflect realistic market conditions throughout the country.  Arising from the review, rent limits were adjusted upwards, from January 2007, for a number of household types in 14 counties at an annual cost of &euro;13 million.</P>
        <P>I intend to have rent limits reviewed this year with a view to implementing any revision found to be necessary, from 1 July 2008.  A consultative approach will be used to conduct his review.</P>

	<P>The Deputy refers to illness benefits and allowances which is taken to mean the Illness Benefit, Disability Allowance and Invalidity Pension schemes.  Where eligibility on medical grounds for any of these schemes is being reviewed, the case is referred to the Department&rsquo;s Medical Review and Assessment Service to be examined by a Departmental Medical Assessor.</P>
        <P>In the first instance, cases are reviewed by a Medical Assessor by way of examination of the papers and various reports submitted.  Following this review, should any question arise as to continued eligibility, the customer will be asked to attend for medical examination.  No Illness Benefit, Disability Allowance or Invalidity Pension cases are terminated without a medical assessment by a departmental Medical Assessor.</P>

	<P>Disability allowance (DA) is a weekly allowance paid to people with a disability who are aged between 16 and 66 years.  The disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to both a medical examination and a means test.  There are over 91,000 persons currently in receipt of DA &mdash; 54,800 male and 36,500 females (figures as at 28 February 2008). </P>
        <P>Illness Benefit (formerly known as Disability Benefit) is a payment for insured people who cannot work due to illness.  There are over 71,000 people in receipt of Illness Benefit &mdash; 25,800 male and 45,900 female (figures as at 28 February 2008).

	<P>I understand that the Deputy is seeking information on the number of payments that were terminated by my Department as opposed to payments terminated, such as, at the request of a customer or where entitlement ceased at the end of a defined period of entitlement.  The tabular statement sets out the number of payments that were either reduced or terminated in each of the past 5 years as a result of my Department&rsquo;s control work.  Information on the number of payments terminated by my Department in the past 12 months is not currently available.  It is not possible to determine the number of payments that were reduced or terminated and which subsequently gave rise to an appeal.</P>

	<P>Details of Respite Care Grant (RCG) applications received, approved and disallowed by month, for the 12 month period from April 2007 to March 2008, are shown in tabular form.  Differences between total applications received and those decided are due to the fact that some RCG applications are ultimately decided as part of a claim for Carers Allowance or Benefit.  In addition some cases require further enquiries to finalise entitlement. </P>

	<P>The organisation in question was awarded funding of &euro;70,090 under the Dormant Accounts Fund (DAF) to establish a Lifestart Programme in Mulhuddart to facilitate a home-visiting support service to families with young children.</P>
        <P>A further sum of &euro;22,600 was awarded to the organisation from the fund in 2007.  This was done to facilitate continued limited funding to first round projects which had demonstrated proven outcomes and where mainstreaming to relevant Departments/agencies had been applied for &mdash; and was under consideration &mdash; on the expiry of the additional Dormant Accounts funding.</P>
        <P>In recommending this additional funding, my Department was keen to ensure that eligible projects could remain operational whilst seeking appropriate mainstream support. The Deputy will appreciate that the DAF cannot, of its nature, be a source of indefinite funding for specific projects. I understand that at the time of the award of additional funding in 2007, an application from the organisation in question for mainstream funding was under consideration by the Health Service Executive.  My Department is prepared to facilitate a meeting of relevant stakeholders in the near future with a view to progressing the matter of funding for the organisation.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the closure of the petrol station on &Aacute;rainn (Inis M&oacute;r).  The current situation is that the carriage of petrol to the island is provided by the cargo ferry operator that is subsidised by my Department. The distribution of petrol on the island is more problematic, however, due to stringent health and safety regulations governing the carriage and distribution of such goods.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that my Department has no direct role in relation to the distribution of petrol.  However, my officials have held a number of meetings with the island cooperative, Comharchumann Forbartha &Aacute;rann Teo, and relevant State agencies in an effort to facilitate the safe distribution of petrol on the island.  Furthermore, my Department has indicated that it would be willing to consider an application to assist the development of a <Col N="707"/>suitable distribution facility for the island community.  To date, no such application has been received.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of contracts for ferry services agreed by my Department, it is the responsibility of operators, in the first instance, to develop procedures for dealing with customer complaints and to consult with islanders on matters affecting the quality of service provided. If, having followed these procedures, service users still have issues to be addressed, they are entitled to bring their grievances to my Department, either verbally or in writing. Any such grievances will be investigated in consultation with the operator and/or other relevant parties and replied to in an appropriate manner.</P>

	<P>I am informed that Waterways Ireland staff have met with the person in question on a number of occasions over the years and that the matter relates to the flooding of the towpath close to the person&rsquo;s house, rather than flooding of the house itself.</P>
        <P>Approximately 6 years ago, Longford County Council resurfaced the towpath accessing the house and the road was laid out to the edge of the canal bank.   After a period of time the water <Col N="708"/>run-off flowing down the bank caused a small section of the canal bank to collapse. Waterways Ireland carried out remedial works to the canal bank and Longford County Council agreed to drain the road.</P>
        <P>I am advised that the solution to the problem is to step back the road by about 0.5m to 1m from the edge of the canal bank, and to drain and kerb the road. Waterways Ireland assures me that it is satisfied that the proposed solution will address the ongoing drainage problem and it remains available to talk to the person in question at any time.</P>

	<P>The RAPID Programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within 46 designated RAPID areas nationally.  The Sports Capital Top-up Scheme has been operated annually with the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism since 2004 under which my Department provides an additional grant of up to 30% of the funds allocated under the Sports Capital Programme, subject to an overall limit of 80% of the project cost.  This scheme is one of several schemes I introduced in 2004 to provide financial support for small-scale projects in RAPID areas which are endorsed by the RAPID Area Implementation Teams.  These schemes are operated and co-funded with other Departments and Agencies.</P>
        <P>Under the 2004 Sports Capital Programme the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism allocated &euro;190,000 to the organisation in question.  In addition, my Department allocated an additional &euro;57,000 under the Sport Capital RAPID Top-up Scheme.  Following completion of the project, the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism paid the organisation &euro;190,000 in April 2007.   My Department paid the organisation the Top-up grant of &euro;57,000 in October 2007.</P>

	<P>My previous response to Questions Nos. 10 and 19 of 14 February 2008 refers.</P>
        <P>As indicated on that occasion, I hope to be in a position to commence the process of selecting the Local Action Groups to deliver the LEADER element of the Rural Development Programme for Ireland 2007-2013 in the near future.   The funding available for the delivery of LEADER-type activities under the Rural Development Programme for Ireland 2007&ndash;13 will amount to &euro;425.4 million &mdash; almost treble the &euro;150 million available for the 2000&ndash;06 period.  The new Programme will complement the other funding for rural development measures by my Department.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department has over the past number of years being pursuing a process of cohesion of local delivery structures in order to simplify and enhance the effectiveness of the delivery of a range of local development programmes.  Following extensive consultations with and between the local agencies to develop the most suitable configurations of groups, in the course of 2007, the Government decided on revised areas of coverage for local development groups and clarified the arrangements in relation to the membership of the boards of these bodies.  LEADER and Partnership groups have been asked to give effect to these decisions and my Department has provided detailed guidelines to secure this outcome.</P>
        <P>The realignment of local delivery structures will reduce the overall number of local development bodies from 94 to 55, comprising of 17 Partnerships in urban areas and 38 integrated LEADER/Partnership bodies in rural areas.</P>
        <P>My intention is to have the cohesion process completed in advance of the roll out of the new NDP programmes, including the LEADER programme. At this stage, local development bodies are in place in some 53 of the 55 operational areas agreed by Government.  The representative networks of LEADER and Partnership groups, whom I met on the 31st of January, have assured me that they are fully behind the Government&rsquo;s policy on cohesion and will endeavour to ensure that local delivery structures are in place across the full 55 areas in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>In one case, a LEADER group has made a complaint to the European Commission regarding the LEADER element of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 and in particular the Cohesion Process.  I am satisfied that our approach in this area is fully consistent with the European Regulations.  My Department is closely monitoring the position and anticipates a view from the European Commission on this matter in the coming weeks.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that an &lsquo;expression of interest&rsquo; has been received from this group under the 2007 Community Services Programme in respect of the community media scheme. The procedure involved in making an application for funding under this scheme has two stages:</P>
        <P>(1) <Miles com="ix" />Expression of Interest &mdash; applicants are requested to submit an expression of interest to their local intermediaries (i.e. Leader, Partnership Co. etc.). They select the groups which are then forwarded to Pobal to carry out an appraisal of each applicant. When the appraisals are completed, they are then passed to my Department for a decision as to whether they are to proceed to business planning stage.</P><Col N="712"/>
        <P>(2) <Miles com="ix" />Business Plan &mdash; the groups who are successful at stage 1 of the process are requested to prepare business plans, which are then appraised by Pobal who make recommendations to my Department, which ultimately decides on the groups to be funded.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The group&rsquo;s application is currently under consideration as to whether they can proceed to the business planning stage.</P>
        <P>The maximum amount of funding under this scheme is approx. &euro;100,000 p.a. Applicants must hold a broadcasting licence before they are granted funding by my Department. The granting of broadcasting licences is a matter for the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland.</P>

	<P>My Department published one Report, entitled &lsquo;Report of the Working Group on Drugs Rehabilitation, May 2007&rsquo;, in 2007, at a cost of &euro;17,479. The cost does not include preparatory work carried out by officials of my Department and officials of other Departments who formed part of the Working Group, as such work is part of the normal duties performed by officials, and it is not possible, with any degree of accuracy, to quantify the cost involved.  My Department has produced no report to date in 2008, which relates to the issue of drugs.</P>
        <P>The National Advisory Committee on Drugs (NACD), which operates under the aegis of my Department, was established to advise Government in relation to prevalence, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and consequences of problem drug use in Ireland, based on its analysis of research findings and information available to it.</P>
        <P>Details of NACD published documents, in 2007 and to date in 2008, are set out in the following table.</P>

	<P>Parliamentary Questions Nos. 316 to 320, inclusive, of 5 March 2008 were directed to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and a response was provided by that Department. <Col N="716"/> However, as my own Department provides funding for capital expenditure at various Local Authority owned harbours, I am providing a response to the above Parliamentary Question.</P>
        <P>My Department approved funding of &euro;15,000 towards the reconstruction of the slipway and safety works at Killurin Pier, Co. Wexford under the Fishery Harbours and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme for 2007.</P>
        <P>Total expenditure on the project in 2007 by Wexford County Council was &euro;2,420, of which my Department paid &euro;1,815.</P>
        <P>My Department received a further application from Wexford County Council for funding towards the completion of the slipway under the Fishery Harbours and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme for 2008. Funding of &euro;26,250 has been approved towards this project.</P>
        <P>I wish to explain that whilst my Department does provide funding to Local Authorities, at a maximum rate of 75% of total project cost, under the Fishery Harbours and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme, the responsibility for the management of the project lies with the Local Authority involved and any queries with regard to the work carried out should be directed to the relevant Local Authority.</P>

	<P>Regulation of developments and activities on the foreshore, which is defined as the area of seabed between the mean high watermark and the 12 nautical mile limit (22.2 km) is subject to the Foreshore Act 1933.  The Government decided on 2 October 2007 that responsibility for foreshore licensing functions under the Foreshore Act 1933 for all energy developments on the foreshore would transfer to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  My Department is currently putting in place the necessary arrangements to ensure the efficient and effective transfer of the appropriate legislation and associated functions.</P>
        <P>The authorisation of offshore energy projects under the Foreshore Act is dealt with in two distinct phases.</P>
        <P>Firstly an application must be made for a foreshore licence for a defined area of the seabed in which to explore the viability and environmental sustainability of the development.</P>
        <P>Secondly, where the site proves suitable, an application may be made within a defined time period for a foreshore lease.  The lease application process evaluates the project and its impacts in detail using specialist advisors and extensive direct and public consultation.  If it is deemed that the project should proceed, a lease agreement is made to allow the use of the foreshore for the project, subject to various conditions, including an annual consideration for rental of the site.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The current foreshore public consultation process requires that notices are published in local and national newspapers informing the public that an application has been made for a foreshore licence or lease, and that the application is available in a publicly accessible place (e.g. Garda station or library).  The period in which the public may submit comments on the application ranges from three weeks to two months depending on the complexity of the application concerned.  Consent under section 10 of the Foreshore Act 1933 is required for development on privately owned foreshore and is also subject to the public consultation process.</P>
        <P>The Government decided on 2 October 2007 that responsibility for foreshore licensing functions under the Foreshore Act 1933 in respect of port companies and harbour authorities governed by the Harbours Acts 1946, 1996 and 2000 and any other harbour or harbour related developments intended for commercial trade, and for all energy developments (including oil, gas, wave, wind and tidal energy) and aggregate and mineral extraction developments on the foreshore would transfer to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently putting in place the necessary arrangements to ensure the efficient and effective transfer of the appropriate legislation and associated functions.  In the interim, all foreshore functions under the Foreshore Acts 1933 to 2005 rest with my Department.</P>
        <P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will clearly assume a critical role in future proposals.  My Department will continue to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the context of progressing the various elements required to develop the appropriate coastal zone legislative framework.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 622 and 623 together.</P>
        <P>The percentage of agricultural land under energy crops in 2007 was less than 0.02% comprising some 9,000 hectares. Overall the area sown with energy crops increased by roughly 3,000 hectares compared to 2006. It is not possible at this stage to forecast the likely area sown in 2010. The future outlook depends on a number of factors, not least profitability at farm level.  Research undertaken by Teagasc indicates that the willingness of farmers to convert land to energy crops depends on a variety of circumstances including the efficiency and profitability of the farming enterprise and non-economic circumstances such as farm size etc. Existing specialist tillage farmers are more likely to consider energy crop production due to the similarities that exist between the production of cereals and energy crops in terms of machinery, soil type and agronomy skills.</P>
        <P>In terms of strategy, my Department has participated on a number of interdepartmental committees led by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on the development of Ireland&rsquo;s bioenergy resources. For example, my Department was represented on the Bioenergy Strategy Group, which was established to consider policy options and support mechanisms to encourage greater use of biomass for bioenergy. The Group published a report &lsquo;Bioenergy in Ireland&rsquo; which made a number of recommendations to promote the bioenergy sector in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In 2006, I participated in a Ministerial Taskforce, which agreed a National Bioenergy Action Plan to increase deployment of Ireland&rsquo;s bioenergy resources to 2020. In accordance with this plan, I subsequently launched a range of measures to stimulate production of energy crops. The measures include a new National Energy Crop Premium of &euro;80 per hectare to supplement the EU premium available under the EU Energy Crops Scheme. I also launched a new Bioenergy Scheme providing establishment grants of up to &euro;1,450 per hectare to farmers interested in planting willow and miscanthus. The second phase of the Scheme was launched in December 2007 and I have provided sufficient funding to support the planting of a further 1,600 hectares in 2008. Areas planted with energy crops can qualify for the Single Farm Payment.</P>
        <P>My Department is also funding research projects that relate directly to biofuels and energy crops through the Department&rsquo;s Research Stimulus Fund Programme. Under the 2005 and 2006 calls for proposals, five projects received grant assistance of &euro;1.5 million. I significantly increased the allocation under the 2007 Call for Proposals awarding some &euro;5.3 million over the next four years to a further seven research projects. The research covers a broad range of agri-energy topics including energy crop production.</P>
        <P>The development of Ireland&rsquo;s energy potential in relation to solar, thermal and wind is the responsibility of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. Any proposal to introduce a national farm energy calculation system is also a matter for the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources as they are the lead Department for the development and promotion of energy efficiency measures across all sectors of the economy including agriculture.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As regards aid for on-farm projects, my Department is supporting the development of anaerobic digestion facilities by providing grant aid to farmers for pilot projects under the Scheme of Investment Aid for Demonstration on Farm Waste Processing Facilities. Anaerobic Diges<Col N="719"/>tion is a proven technology that extracts energy in the form of biogas from organic waste. In 2007, ten projects were awarded grants under the Scheme. The maximum investment ceiling is &euro;1 million per project and the applicable grant rate is 40%.  The 2007-2013 Rural Development Programme provides for the continuation of a grant scheme for the development of such facilities.</P>

	<P>All fishermen are eligible to undertake Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) training programmes including those serving on vessels that are decommissioning. In this regard, BIM and F&Aacute;S have agreed to co-operate to provide training for fishing vessel crewmembers that find themselves without a job when their fishing vessel is decommissioned. Both agencies will work closely together to provide retraining, up-skilling or diversification opportunities in the seafood industry or elsewhere in the economy as required.</P>
        <P>In addition, funding will be provided within BIM&rsquo;s overall programmes to support the sustainable development and improvement of the quality of life in fisheries areas as part of an overall strategy that will support the implementation of the objectives of the common fisheries policy, in particular taking account of its socioeconomic effects.</P>
        <P>The measures for sustainable development of fisheries areas shall seek to:</P>
<P el="5">(a) <Miles com="ix" />maintain the economic and social prosperity of these areas and add value to fisheries and aquaculture products;</P>
<P el="5">(b) <Miles com="ix" />maintain and develop jobs in fisheries areas through support for diversification or the economic and social restructuring of areas facing socioeconomic difficulties as a result of changes in the fisheries sector;</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">It should also be noted that while the decommissioning scheme will remove some of the older and less economically viable vessels from the fleet right around the coast, the majority of the fleet will continue fishing and will continue to need crew.  At present many skippers are experiencing great difficulty securing crew, as there is an overall shortage of crew for fishing vessels.  In this situation there remains good opportunities for crewmembers whose current boats are leaving the fleet.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 627 and 629 together.</P>
        <P>It is no secret that I am dissatisfied with the current direction of the WTO negotiations. I have consistently expressed concern about the potential impact on Irish and EU agriculture of various proposals being put forward in these discussions.  I, and my ministerial colleagues, have spoken frequently and strongly on this issue in every available forum, and have sought, and received, support from other EU Governments.</P>
        <P>On the specific question of tariff cuts in the dairy and sheepmeat sectors, I have already said to this House that I have serious concerns about the range of tariff cuts proposed for agricultural products that are contained in the latest draft text from the Chair of the WTO Negotiating Committee on Agriculture.  Combined with associated proposals on the treatment of sensitive products and related tariff quota expansion, I believe these proposals would have a damaging impact on EU and Irish agriculture.  I have articulated these concerns clearly to the Commission and to other Members States as well as in this House.</P>
        <P>It is crucial, in my view, that the European agrifood sector is not sacrificed for the sake of a deal.  This is the position consistently taken by the Government and which has been and will continue to be strongly reflected at a variety of EU and WTO meetings.  I, and my colleagues in Government, have consistently pressed the Commission to strive for a balanced agreement <Col N="721"/>that is not at the expense of EU and Irish agriculture. The Government&rsquo;s intention is to continue this process.</P>
        <P>Intensive discussions are still taking place in Geneva on the most recent agriculture and non-agricultural texts and there are still many technical and political issues to be resolved, not alone on the agriculture dossier, but on the related issues of non-agricultural market access, services, rules and trade facilitation.  In short, at this point in time, we can only speculate as to the content of a final WTO deal, or indeed, whether such a deal will be concluded.  It would therefore be inappropriate, and unwise from a negotiating standpoint, to indicate what position the Irish Government will take on any possible final deal, the terms of which we do not yet know.</P>

	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that the obligations placed on farmers by EU Regulation 183/2005 on Feed Hygiene will not adversely impact on farm to farm trade. This Regulation lays down general rules on feed hygiene and traceability for all feed business operators, including farmers. These rules are aimed at ensuring safe production, trade and use of feed materials. Farm to farm sales are not specifically impacted except in so far as a requirement for keeping records and adhering to the general hygiene requirements for the production, storage and sale of primary feed materials.</P>
        <P>The obligations under the legislation are more onerous on other feed business operators such as mills, store owners and hauliers. This is because they have the potential, due to size, diversity of materials used and customer base to affect a large number of other feed business operators in the event of problems arising. In the case of all feed business operators, other than farmers, there is also a requirement for them to establish a quality system based on the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) principles.</P>

	<P>The most recent annual data available from the Central Statistics Office relates to 2007 when food and non-alcoholic beverages prices, as measured by the food price index, increased by 2.8% on average for that year. This is a lower level of increase than the overall annual rate of inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, which averaged 4.9% during the same year. More recent monthly data, for February 2008 indicate that food and non-alcoholic beverage prices increased by 1.8% in the month and by 8.5% in the year to February 2008. This compares to an increase of 1.1% for the year to February 2007 and mirrors the upward trajectory in food prices as evidenced globally and across Europe throughout 2007 and into 2008.</P>
        <P>Changes in food prices are primarily a function of market forces operating at international, EU and national levels. Consistently strong economic growth in developing countries is the main driver of changing world food demand towards high-value agricultural products and processed foods.  Slow-growing supply, low stocks, and supply shocks at a time of increasing <Col N="723"/>demand for feed, food and fuel have led to price increases globally. Biofuel production has also contributed to the changing world food equation.</P>
        <P>In addition, rising input costs, at both producer and processor levels have fed through to put upward pressure on food prices. Pressure on input prices, in particular energy and raw material including feed costs, has combined with strong competition on world dairy and cereal markets in increasing producer prices.</P>
        <P>In response to this situation the EU Council of agriculture Ministers has suspended set-aside, in order to increase cereal production, and has recently agreed a 2% increase in milk quota for 2008. Further measures are being considered in the context of the current discussions on the &ldquo;Health Check&rdquo; of the CAP.</P>

	<P>The Milk Rights Group was set up to lobby on behalf of its members for parity of treatment with plaintiffs whose cases were considered by the Supreme Court in 1997, and who were successful in their actions in relation to the method of quota allocation on the introduction of the milk quota/super levy regime in 1984.  My Department does not accept that it has any liability other than in cases that are already the subject of legal proceedings.</P>
        <P>Under a scheme announced in 2001, my Department allocated a significant amount of additional quota under the AGENDA 2000 agreement to persons, including members of the Milk Rights Group, whose circumstances were similar to those of the aforementioned plaintiffs.  These special allocations took account of the volume of extra quota that the High Court had determined might have been granted to producers in general who were pursuing dairy investment plans around 1984.</P>

        <P>In this case the REPS 4 contract commenced on 1 November 2007 and, assuming a valid application, payment in respect of 2007 will therefore be for 2 months.

As all REPS 4 contracts will have an anniversary date of 1 January, my Department will adjust the length of this contract so that the anniversary date will become 1 January 2008 and the contract will be valid for a further 5 years from that date.</P>
        <P>In 2008 the person named will receive 75% of a full year&rsquo;s REPS payment when all administrative checks for REPS and the Single Payment Scheme are completed.

	<P>An application under the 2007 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was received from the person named on 2 May 2007. One of the primary provisions of the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is that applicants must maintain a minimum stocking density on their holding of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare for at least three consecutive months.  However, where the holding of an applicant is identified as potentially not meeting this minimum stocking density requirement, the applicant is invited to submit evidence of satisfactory stocking i.e. Flock Register, Horse Passports. Alternatively the applicant may be considered for Derogation from the minimum stocking level of 0.15 livestock units per hectare in cases where a holding consists of Mountain type grazings and the applicant was a previous recipient under the Headage schemes.</P>
        <P>This case was identified as qualifying under Derogation and payment of  &euro;1,266.04 issued to the herdowner on 25 September 2007.  The payable order was cashed on 20 October 2007.</P>
        <P>The case was subsequently inspected on 26 October 2007 under the Single Payment/ Disadvantaged Areas Scheme.  The inspecting officer found the herd to be under the required 0.15 livestock units per hectare on the day and notified the herdowner of this finding of ineligibility.  This file was reviewed on return to the Inspection Section and it was established that Payment issued under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was valid.</P>

	<P>There were 2,500 hectares used for the production of bio-energy crops in 2005, 4,500 hectares in 2006 and 8,900 hectares in 2007.</P>
        <P>In 2007, I introduced a new National Energy Premium of &euro;80 per hectare and a new Bio-Energy Scheme to assist the development of the production of energy crops in Ireland. The &euro;80 National payment supplements the EU Premium of &euro;45 per hectare. The buoyant market for bio-fuels and the introduction of the &euro;80 incentive contributed to an increase in the area devoted to oilseed rape, which is used to produce bio-fuels.</P>
        <P>The Bio-Energy Scheme aims to encourage farmers to grow willow and miscanthus as a renewable source of energy.  These crops have considerable potential for heat and electricity generation and my Department is aiding establishment with grants of up to &euro;1,450 per hectare.  The introduction of this Scheme has been well received by farmers with some 800 hectares planted so far.  I have provided sufficient funding in 2008 to support the planting of a further 1,600 hectares. As a further support measure, land planted with energy crops can also benefit under the Single Payment Scheme.</P>
        <P>In advance of receipt of applications under the 2008 Scheme, it is difficult to estimate the number of hectares, which will be applied for in 2008, largely because of the dramatic price increase during 2007 for crops such as oilseed and the recently announced decision on the reduction of compulsory set-aside for 2008 to 0%.  While oilseed has been harvested for the production of pure plant oil and bio-diesel, it is currently attracting significantly higher prices when sold for food purposes. With the change in the set-aside rules, farmers in 2008 have much greater freedom as to the use they will make of lands which previously they were required to set-aside i.e. farmers will have the option of growing energy crops on lands previously set-aside.</P>

	<P>The total package negotiated in the context of the reform of the EU sugar regime was worth in excess of &euro;310 million to Ireland.  The first element is the compensation for the reduction in the minimum price of beet which is worth approximately &euro;123 million to Irish beet growers over seven years. It has been already incorporated in the Single Payment with effect from 2006.</P>
        <P>The second element is the EU restructuring aid which, at the outset, was worth &euro;145 million to Ireland.  Three parties benefit from this aid: the sugar processor, former beet growers and machinery contractors.  The first instalment of 40% (&euro;58 million) was paid to the beneficiaries in June 2007 and the balance of &euro;87 million was paid in February 2008.  However, an amending EU regulation in October 2007 had the effect of increasing the overall amount of restructuring aid available to Ireland and this increase, the amount of which has yet to be confirmed by the EU Commission, will be paid retroactively to the growers in June 2008.</P>
        <P>The third and final element of the package is the diversification aid worth almost &euro;44 million to the former beet growers.  The first tranche of 50% (&euro;22 million) was paid in September 2007 and payment of the balance to the growers got under way last month.</P>

	<P>In discussions with my officials, the European Commission have confirmed the new rules for applications and payments under REPS 4.  Payments will relate to the period in each calendar year during which a participant is in REPS 4 and will issue in two stages.  The first, which will be 75% of the total, will issue when all administrative checks for REPS and the Single Payment Scheme are completed.  In practice, this will be in early autumn.  The remaining 25% payment will go out when the last of the year&rsquo;s REPS on-farm inspections has taken place.  This means that these payments will be processed in December.</P>
        <P>Farmers who submitted valid applications in December 2007 will start their REPS 4 contracts on 1 January 2008.  They will receive 75% of a full year&rsquo;s REPS payment when all administrative checks for REPS and the 2008 Single Payment Scheme are completed.  The remaining 25% payment will go out when the last of the year&rsquo;s REPS on-farm inspections has taken place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The escalation of fuel costs, as a result of global economic and political conditions, remains a matter of concern <Col N="730"/>for all sectors of industry.  It is important to note that the fishing industry in Ireland already receives favourable treatment in the form of a full rebate on excise and VAT on marine fuel, if the enterprise concerned is registered for VAT.</P>
        <P>Fuel subsidies, in terms of operating aid for fishing vessels, are not permitted under EU State Aid rules and any such measures introduced by EU Member States would be in breach of EU law and subject to Infringement proceedings in the European Court of Justice.  It is understood that previous measures taken by France in relation to support to offset the difficulties faced by its industry arising from high fuel prices are the subject of infringement proceedings in the European Court.</P>
        <P>Within the EU State Aid rules and the funding available to each, it is a matter for each Member State to put in place measures to support and develop the fishing industry.  I understand that the main measures now being put in place by France include a tax on fishery products at the market place to fund the development and restructuring plan for the fishing sector.   We  have written to my French and Spanish colleagues to get more details about their plans.</P>
        <P>Under the National Development Plan 2007-2013, the Irish seafood industry will benefit from funding of &euro;216 million.  A further &euro;216 million may be made available on the basis of verified progressive change in the industry as set out in the national strategy for the seafood industry &mdash; Steering a New Course.  I believe that the most critical element in addressing the impact of high fuel prices is to make the fleet more profitable.</P>
        <P>The planned reduction in the size of the fishing fleet, through a decommissioning scheme which I launched in February, will increase the profitability of the vessels that continue to fish because they will be permitted to land higher quantities of quota stocks.  Funding under the NDP will also focus on increasing returns to fishermen through maximising the value of seafood at every stage from the sea to the table.</P>
        <P>I also consider that considerable research activity is required in order to identify the most fuel efficient equipment and practices and I will be pushing strongly for this area to be prioritised under the EU&rsquo;s Seventh Framework Programme for Research (2007-2013).  At present, Bord Iascaigh Mhara is making grant aid available to improve fuel efficiency on board fishing vessels.  I will keep this scheme under review to ensure that it covers best practice in the context of available research in the area.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Sheep Industry Strategy Development Group and the subsequent Implementation Group set the blueprint for the sector&rsquo;s future development. The sheep sector is an important part of the overall agri-food sector and its future depends on its ability to meet the needs of the market. Most of the Strategy Group&rsquo;s recommendations fall to be implemented by the industry itself but my Department and the state agencies under my aegis are also playing an active role in relevant areas.  Sheep farmers are major beneficiaries of various schemes being operated by my Department. Under REPS 4, a new mixed grazing measure specifically targeted at sheep farmers has been introduced and developments on this measure will be kept under review.</P>
        <P>Plans for the upgrading of a Sheep Genetic Improvement Programme are well advanced and I hope that agreement can be reached and a new programme put in place for the 2008/2009 sheep breeding year.</P>
        <P>Transparency on pricing is a pre-requisite for efforts to improve quality and respond to the needs of the market. Farmer confidence in the pricing system operated by plants will be improved if mechanical grading can be introduced. My Department is currently facilitating trials as a first step in establishing such a system.</P>
        <P>Teagasc continues to play a very constructive role and have developed a comprehensive plan to restructure their sheep support services, including a programme for Technology Evaluation and Transfer farms, which includes hill and lowland areas.  This approach will encourage the application of the latest management practices to sheep enterprises and identify research and development needs.</P>
        <P>Bord Bia is also playing a prominent part. The Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme was established in 2007 and my Department made available &euro;0.4 million to support inspections under the scheme and this funding has been repeated for 2008.</P>
        <P>In addition to the measures being taken at producer and processor level, promotional efforts are very necessary. Bord Bia will continue to organize strategic marketing campaigns marketing in selected European markets. The downward trend in lamb consumption in certain markets presents a real challenge. To address this, Bord Bia is collaborating with its French and British counterparts on a 3 year generic lamb promotion on the very important French market to promote lamb to younger consumers.</P>
        <P>I raised the development of the sheep sector at the EU Council of Agricultural Ministers meeting on 17th March. Other member states also intervened to underline the importance of the sector, particularly in disadvantaged agricultural areas. While definitive conclusions were not drawn on possible support action, the Commission undertook to keep the sector in mind in the on-going &ldquo;health check&rdquo; discussions concerning the Common Agriculture Policy.</P>

	<P>I assume that the question relates to raising the age limit for the removal of vertebral column from 24 to 30 months.

        <P>The proposal received unanimous support at a meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health on 3 October 2007. The proposal is currently under scrutiny by the European Parliament and I expect that the proposal will enter into force later this year.</P>
        <P>This increase will be of particular benefit to those butchers who are authorised to handle specific risk material (SRM) and who will then be able to sell beef on the bone from cattle up to 30 months of age and will also benefit those butchers who choose not to handle SRM, and who will be able to take in and sell beef on the bone from cattle up to 30 months of age.</P>

	<P>The existing requirement that all bovines over 30 months of age, slaughtered for human consumption, must be tested along with all casualty animals and all fallen stock over 24 months is provided for under Regulation (EC) 999/2001. I have been a consistent advocate of change in these age thresholds, based on the results of surveillance carried out here and the significant reduction in the incidence of the disease in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Under the recently amended TSE regulation, there is an enabling provision that allows Member States to seek amendments to their monitoring programmes (including changes to the age at which healthy slaughtered animals for human consumption must be tested for BSE) on the basis of applications to the Commission and in response to their improved BSE situation.</P>
        <P>The proposals tabled by the Commission late last year for possible revision of testing included the following options for slaughter cattle: to test all cattle over 42 months; to test all cattle born before January 1 2002 and 50 per cent of cattle born since and aged over 42 months; to test all animals born before January 1 2004 and none (or minimum sample size) for those born thereafter.</P>
        <P>Under each option, emergency slaughtered cattle and fallen stock over 36 months would require to be tested. In January 2008, the Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection indicated his support for the first of the three options referred to above and the Commission has since requested the advice of the European Food Safety Agency on the number of test scenarios. The agreement of the European Parliament will also be required for any change to the current regime.</P>
        <P>While Ireland would have favoured the third option, the option favoured by the Commission &mdash; to raise the testing age to 42 months &mdash; would still represent significant progress and would significantly reduce the amount of testing to be undertaken here.  I have continually urged the Commissioner to complete all outstanding issues quickly so that a new testing regime can be applied here from the earliest possible date and I will continue to press for an early resolution of the remaining issues.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In February 2007, I launched a new Bioenergy Scheme on a pilot basis to encourage farmers to plant miscanthus and willow for bioenergy purposes. The objectives of the Scheme are: to establish an agricultural sector involved in the growing of miscanthus and willow specifically to produce biomass suitable for use as a clean and renewable source of heat and energy; to increase the production of energy crops in Ireland and to encourage alternative land use options; to provide opportunities for farm diversification and downstream rural development and employment; to complement other Government measures in the area of renewable energy, such as those developed by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</P>
        <P>The scheme provides establishment grants for up to 50% of the costs of establishment, subject to a maximum payment rate of &euro;1,450 per hectare. Establishment grants are payments to cover part of the costs of establishing the crop. Eligible costs include ground preparation, fencing, herbicide control, purchase of planting stock, planting and first year cutback. The scheme was well received with some 700 hectares of miscanthus planted. The second phase of the Bioenergy Scheme was launched in December 2007 and I have provided sufficient funding to support the planting of a further 1,600 hectares of miscanthus and willow in 2008.</P>
        <P>In addition to establishment grants, farmers who grow miscanthus also qualify for an EU premium of up to &euro;45 per hectare under the EU Energy Crops Scheme and the National Energy Crop Premium of  &euro;80 per hectare. As a further support measure, areas planted with <Col N="735"/>miscanthus also qualify for the Single Farm Payment. I have also extended the aid paid under the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme to areas planted with miscanthus, subject to some restrictions on the areas planted.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the 2005 Single Payment Scheme National Reserve under Category D.  Category D catered for farmers who commenced farming after 31 December 2002 or who commenced farming in 2002 but who did not receive direct payments in respect of that scheme year.  As the person named received his herdnumber on 24 September 2001 he was not deemed eligible for this category.  The person named subsequently submitted an unsuccessful appeal against my Department&rsquo;s decision.</P>
        <P>However, the case has now been reviewed and since the person named only became the registered owner of a herdnumber late in 2001 and did not receive any direct payments in 2002, my Department accepts that he can be regarded as a New Entrant to farming.  The 2005 National Reserve application from the person named will now be processed and all payments due will issue shortly.</P>

        <Quest> if, in respect of cladding used for grant purposes in farm buildings which currently has to be of S/102 standard, her Department will approve BS/5502 Class 2 standard cladding which is widely used in the UK and available for import; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Standard BS 5502, part 21, is only a guide on best practice in relation to the selection of roof cladding materials for agriculture buildings, and as such it is not possible to have cladding sheets tested to meet its requirements.</P>
        <P>My Department developed a testing procedure, in association with cladding manufacturers, in the mid-1990s, and this system has remained unchanged since 1997.  The test procedures were developed following the premature failure of cladding sheets over animal housing in the late 1980s.  The tests that are required ensure that only quality cladding materials, which will last for at least 20 years, are used on grant-aided agricultural buildings.  My Department will examine any applications for inclusion of cladding sheets on its accepted list (S. 102) regardless of location of the company once the proposed sheets can be shown to meet the agreed requirements.</P>
        <P>Since April 2007, the number of accepted cladding manufacturers has increased by 40% and the number of accepted cladding sheets has increased by over 50% during the same period.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that I have responded to the joint letter from the five school patron organisations regarding primary school funding. This issue also features as part of my regular contact and discussions with the education partners.</P>
        <P>I want to assure the Deputy that the Government is fully aware of the funding pressures on schools. We are committed to doubling the primary capitation grant by 2012 and to significantly increasing the value of the ancillary services grant that is used by schools for the employment of support staff such as caretakers and secretaries.  These commitments are a direct follow-on from the clear thrust of Government policy over recent years to improve the position of primary schools in particular.</P>
        <P>Since 2001, the standard rate of primary capitation grant has been increased by 86%. In the same period, the value of the ancillary services grant has been almost doubled. In 2001, a primary school with 300 pupils was in receipt of less than &euro;52,000 to meet its day to day running costs. That same school today is receiving almost &euro;100,000.  This excludes the salary of teachers and Special Needs Assistants which are paid by the Department. By any standards this is a very significant improvement within a relatively short period of time.</P>
        <P>In 2008, primary schools are getting &euro;330 per pupil in such grants &mdash; &euro;21 more per child than they got last year. At a national level, this adds up to an investment of around &euro;167 million in standard day-to-day funding for schools. In addition to this, enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools.</P>
        <P>Extra funding is also being targeted at schools serving disadvantaged communities. Indeed, funding for additional grants for the most disadvantaged schools increased by 15% this year, reflecting the Government&rsquo;s determination to prioritise those that need extra resources the most.</P>
        <P>While we continue to make real progress we must also be aware of the changing global economic environment.  There is a need for careful management of the public finances in order to protect Ireland&rsquo;s prosperity in the period of slower (albeit still good) levels of economic growth.  This prudent approach is the best way of ensuring that funding improvements for our schools can be sustained into the future.  In the current economic environment, an extra &euro;690m in 2008 for the education sector was a real achievement and evidence of this Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to prioritising education.</P>
        <P>I do not for a moment suggest that there isn&rsquo;t a need for additional increases in funding for schools.  The legitimacy of the case for further increases is expressly recognised in the Programme for Government commitments. I am confident that over the course of this Government&rsquo;s term of office that it will be possible to build on the significant achievements of recent years and to do so in a manner consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 674 to 698, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available and would take an inordinate amount of administrative time to compile.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.  There are now in the region of 6,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002.  By the 2006/07 school year, we had reduced the average class size in our primary schools to 24, while the pupil teacher ratio was 16.4:1, including resource teachers etc.  In that year, schools were staffed on the basis of a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children.  Given that the national average was 24, many schools benefited from much more favourable staffing ratios than this.</P>
        <P>Extra teachers were provided by the Government for the 2007/08 school year to improve primary school staffing so that schools would generally get at least one classroom teacher for every 27 children.</P>
        <P>A further initiative in recent years that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools.  For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year.  Over 330 such posts have been sanctioned in the 2007/08 school year compared to 280 in 2006/07.</P>
        <P>Combined with the 6,000 more primary school teachers referred to and the extra teachers put in the current school year, the additional primary teachers planned for 2008/09 will mean this Government will be well ahead of target in relation to the Programme for Government commitment to hire 4,000 extra primary teachers between 2007 and 2012.  Indeed, 2,000 of these will be in place by next Spring.</P>
        <P>Over the lifetime of the Government, we are committed to providing more primary school teachers specifically to reduce class sizes.  We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P><Col N="742"/>
        <P>An independent staffing appeal process is available to Boards of Management of individual schools.  They can submit an appeal under certain criteria to an Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools.  Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> if there are exceptions to the provision in the higher education grants scheme which require that a student under 23 years is assessed on their parents&rsquo; income; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[11298/08]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Higher Education Grant Schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992.   These Acts define a mature student to mean a person &ldquo;of not less than 23 years of age, or such other age as may stand specified for the time being in regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, who have secured places in approved institutions and have reached that age on the 1st day of January, or such other date as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance in the year of entry to such institutions&rdquo;. The Acts further provide, inter alia, for the making of grants to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature students are dependent on their parents, do not exceed prescribed limits.</P>
        <P>Mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents/guardians from the 1st October preceding their entry to an approved course.  Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents/guardians income or address.</P>
        <P>When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the Acts specify that the students&rsquo; means and those of their parents/guardians must be below a prescribed limit.   This provision requires that the parents&rsquo; income be taken into account, irrespec<Col N="744"/>tive of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not an independent mature student.</P>
        <P>In exceptional cases, and only where compelling evidence of estrangement from parents/guardians can be provided, candidates who are under 23 may be assessed without reference to their parents/guardians income or address. An example of the type of independent verification/evidence required would be a letter from a social worker or other appropriate officer of the Health Service Executive explaining the circumstances under which the candidate is estranged from his/her parents/guardians. Confirmation that a candidate is living separately from parents/guardians is not sufficient in this regard.</P>
        <P>Where candidates are estranged from parents/guardians, the necessary evidence in support of their case should be submitted to the relevant Local Authority or Vocational Education Committee.</P>
        <P>In all other cases where a candidate is not at least 23 years of age on the 1st of January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course and in the absence of compelling evidence of estrangement from parents/guardians, details of parents/guardians&rsquo; income is required for the purpose of the means test under the student grant schemes.</P>

        <Quest> the financial assistance a person can apply for who attends a third level course, in addition to the higher education grants scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions:</P>
<P el="5">1. <Miles com="ix" />The Higher Education Grants Scheme;</P>
<P el="5">2. <Miles com="ix" />The Vocational Education Committees&rsquo; Scholarship Schemes;</P>
<P el="5">3. <Miles com="ix" />The Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Also under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s Free Fees Initiative the exchequer meets the tuition fees of full-time eligible students. The main conditions are that students must (a) be first-time undergraduates; (b) hold E.U. nationality: and (c) have been ordinarily resident in an E.U. Member State for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course. Students with official refugee status in State and who have three years residency in the State (from official date of lodgement of application for refugee status) may also be considered under the Free Fees Initiative.  Eligibility is determined at date of entry to the course of study.</P>
        <P>In addition to these schemes the National Development Plan 2007-2013 provides for a Third Level Access Fund.  A key goal of the National Development Plan 2007-2013 is to widen participation and increase student and graduate numbers at third level.  The Fund for Students with Disabilities, the Student Assistance Fund and the Millennium Partnership Fund, co-financed by the Government and the European Social Fund, form part of a strategy to achieve this goal.  The three funding programmes are administered on behalf of my Department by the National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education (National Access Office), with assistance from Pobal in relation to the Millennium Partnership Fund.</P>
        <P>The Fund for Students with Disabilities aims to assist students with disabilities in third-level institutions and PLC colleges to participate in further and higher education.  Grants are pro<Col N="745"/>vided for students who have serious sensory, physical and/or communicative disabilities.  Applications for funding should be made by the Disability/Access Officer in the Institution, or by the Principal in a PLC college.  Students should discuss their particular disability, and equipment or services required, with their institution/PLC College.</P>
        <P>In third level institutions there is a Student Assistance Fund (SAF).  The objective of the SAF is to assist students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise, because of financial reasons, suffer severe hardship or be unable to continue their third level studies.  Applications for funding should be made by the individual student to the Access Officer in their institution.  The SAF is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</P>
        <P>The final initiative under the Third Level Access Fund is the Millennium Partnership Fund for Disadvantage.  The objective of this Fund is to support students from disadvantaged areas with regard to retention and participation in further or higher education courses.  Partnership Companies and Community Groups manage the fund locally.  Under the fund, eligible actions may include the following but will be dependent on the individual Partnership or Community Group:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Financial supports to meet student participation costs;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Provision of information, e.g. guidance and mentoring;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Study supports including tuition, study skills.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Students may contact their local Area Partnership Company or Community Group for assistance (a list of the Partnerships and Community Groups is available from the Higher Education &mdash; Equity of Access Area of my Department).  As outlined in the current NDP and Towards 2016, these three funds will remain important elements of the Government&rsquo;s overall strategy to alleviate educational disadvantage and to promote social inclusion.</P>

	<P>I regret the delay in providing the previously requested information to the Deputy. This was due to pressure of work on my officials within the Department.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s records show that the number of unqualified persons currently on a regular teaching contract of employment within the primary sector is 620. While I am anxious to reduce this number it should also be viewed in the context of the major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. In fact there are now in the region of 6,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002, bringing the current total to over 30,000.</P>
        <P>Fully qualified second level teachers are paid at the appropriate point on the common basic salary scale for teachers together with appropriate qualification allowances. At present there are 274 teachers on a regular contract of employment within the post primary sector who are not in receipt of qualification allowances which indicates that they are not regarded as fully qualified for the teaching posts which they hold. The qualifications held by 143 of the teachers concerned are currently being assessed by the Teaching Council. The remaining 131 are not fully recognised either because of a lack of required training-in-teaching qualification in the specific subject(s) of the teaching post held.</P><Col N="746"/>
        <P>Over 45,000 teachers who were already teaching in schools on the establishment day of the Teaching Council (28 March, 2006), following verification of their details, were automatically deemed registered at that date and have since renewed their registration. These teachers were registered under Section 31(2) of the Teaching Council Act. A number of these are unqualified and while they can be registered their certificate will indicate that they are not qualified teachers.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that I am acting in a considered way to deal with this issue. Firstly, I intend to commence Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act later this year. The effect of this will be that only registered teachers will be entitled to be paid on an ongoing or open-ended basis.  Secondly, I will set out by regulation the restrictions to apply to the engagement of unregistered personnel. For the first time, schools will be legally required to use unregistered teachers only as an absolute last resort. I am also looking at the best manner in which this provision can be time limited.  And thirdly, I have already increased the number of primary teacher training places this year.</P>
        <P>I know that even with every possible measure taken to avoid the use of unregistered teachers, some schools may still need them to deal with emergency or short-term absences. But I believe that every child deserves to be taught by a qualified teacher and I am determined to keep the use of unregistered personnel to an absolutely unavoidable minimum.</P>

	<P>On the 1st February last I announced the first phase of projects that will commence construction during 2008 and 2009. My announcement included details of the 18 large scale building projects approved for construction and a further 30 primary school projects in rapidly developing areas. Details of the projects approved can be viewed under the Press Release section of my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie.</P>
        <P>This is the first phase of projects that will commence construction during 2008 and 2009. It is my intention to make a further announcement shortly to allow a further batch of schools to commence construction and to update progress on the new schools planned for September 2008 delivery in developing areas.</P>
        <P>The main emphasis in 2008 is on providing sufficient school places in rapidly developing areas as well as delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  The priority rating of each individual building project is established in accordance with the Criteria for Prioritising Large Scale<?oasys _jy ?>Projects (Primary and Post-primary) which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at<?oasys _jy ?>www.education.ie.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the criteria set down, each project is allocated to an appropriate priority band rating on the basis of objective criteria. A review of the criteria for prioritising large-scale projects was undertaken in consultation with the Education Partners in early 2004 to ensure that the criteria have the optimum precision and are fully tuned to meeting the priority accommodation needs of primary and post-primary schools. In general the feedback from the Education Partners to the review has been positive. The revised criteria have been seen as bringing <Col N="747"/>greater clarity and focus to the system. The amended criteria are applied to all projects that proceed to tender and construction.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department and the National Council for Special Education have been working hard to ensure that all autistic children have access to appropriate education.</P>
        <P>Whereas a few years ago, most parents of children with autism had no option but to send them to a special school, now they have three distinct choices available to them. Their child can either attend a mainstream class in their local school with additional supports as required, they can attend a special class in a mainstream school or they can attend a special school. While some children with autism can thrive in a mainstream class, special classes have been specifically designed to meet the needs of those who require more intensive support.</P>
        <P>Children in these classes benefit from having fully-qualified teachers who have access to training in a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA), the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS). Teachers who are familiar with different methods can tailor these to the needs of the individual child. Children in mainstream schools also have the option where appropriate of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.</P><Col N="750"/>
        <P>In excess of 285 autism-specific classes have now been approved around the country, twenty one of which are in the Tipperary area, while more are being set up as required. There is a maximum of six children in each special class with a teacher and at least two special needs assistants. Extra assistants are provided where the children need them on a case by case basis. In addition, there are in the region of 2,100 children with autism who are receiving additional teaching and/or special needs assistant support in mainstream schools.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Special Education will continue to establish additional autism classes in the Tipperary area where the need arises.</P>

        <P>My Department has made substantial capital investment in Cork Institute of Technology (CIT) in recent years with over &euro;70m being invested in projects delivered through direct exchequer funding since 2000 alone.  Funding of &euro;18 million has been provided for a new Tourism and Catering Building which assisted in relieving overcrowding throughout the Institute.  An investment of &euro;7.3 million was also provided for a new Administration building which now accommodates staff previously located in temporary accommodation.  My Department has also provided funding of &euro;4.4m towards the cost of the Student Services Building and Covered Courtyard and all of these facilities have been completed within the last three years. In addition my Department has provided ongoing funding for many other minor works projects at the Institute.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, significant capital investment has been provided for two major projects at CIT through the Public Private Partnership (PPP), the National Maritime College of Ireland costing &euro;52m and the School of Music at a cost of &euro;60m.  I recently announced approval for an extension to the Library at CIT to be delivered as part of the first bundle of PPP projects in the third level sector.</P>
        <P>Any further capital investment in CIT will be considered in the context of the prioritisation criteria which are being developed and mindful of other demands on the funding available under the NDP 2007-2013.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s Post Primary School Transport Scheme, a pupil is eligible for transport if s/he resides 4.8 kilometres or more from her/his local post primary education centre, that is, the centre serving the catchment area in which s/he lives.</P>
        <P>The scheme is not designed to facilitate parents who choose to send their children to a post-primary centre outside of the catchment area in which they reside. However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area &mdash; otherwise known as catchment boundary transport. These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to their &ldquo;own&rdquo; post-primary centre have been catered for.  Such children have to make their own way to the nearest pick-uppoint within that catchment area.</P>
        <P>Children from Caherconlish in County Limerick who enrol in schools in Limerick City or County will have their applications for school transport assessed in accordance with the terms of the scheme. The parents of these children should liaise with the relevant Transport Liaison Officers regarding their eligibility for school transport.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 724 and 725 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy knows, the Programme for Government includes a commitment to establish a Developing Areas Unit in the Department of Education and Science, dedicated solely to progressing school planning in rapidly developing areas, building on improvements that have already been made in recent years.</P><Col N="753"/>
        <P>This recently established Developing Areas Unit, in conjunction with Fingal County Council, has been working to identify and acquire sites, under the Fingal School Model, for rapidly growing areas, including Dublin 15.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Carpenterstown Education Together Parents Group that has been established, I understand that an application for recognition of a new school in Carpenterstown in September 2008 has been received by the New Schools Advisory Committee (NSAC).  The NSAC is an independent advisory group established to process applications for the recognition of new primary schools and to make recommendations to me. It is expected that the NSAC will report in April 2008.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Department is moving to acquire a site in Porterstown under the Fingal School Model Agreement. He will also be aware that Scoil Choilm was established in September 2007 under the temporary patronage of the Catholic Church to serve the Porterstown/Clonsilla parish in Dublin 15 and enrolled 3 streams of junior infants. The school is temporarily accommodated in the Institute of Horology, a V.E.C.-owned building, in Blanchardstown. Scoil Choilm will be relocated to a site in Porterstown for September 2008, subject to planning permission and completion of the legalities. The site will be temporary in the first instance and it is envisaged that the site will be expanded and made permanent in the short to medium term.</P>
        <P>Due to the level of demand emanating from the Dublin 15 area, the need to make further provision at primary level is being kept under continuous review by the Department. All options will be considered to ensure that there are enough school places in September 2008 and beyond. The provision of accommodation for Carpenterstown Educate Together will be considered once the NSAC makes its report.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> if her Department will be in a position to meet with a group (details supplied) in County Dublin, as per the request from 2007 in view of progress that has been made in securing a site in the Lucan south area. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department is conscious of the extent of housing developments in the Lucan area and the consequences which this has for school provision. Because of this, substantial additional accommodation has been provided in the area by my Department at both primary and post-primary level in recent years and this is set to continue for the foreseeable future.</P>
        <P>Based on current demographic trends, my Department anticipates that there will be a need for a further post-primary school in Lucan in the medium term and it has asked South Dublin County Council to identify a site for this development. A timeframe for the delivery of the school will be known when a suitable site has been identified and acquired. The local authority has a number of Local Area Plans in train and it is likely that we will be able to secure a site under this process. My Department is conscious of the lead-in period for the delivery of a post-primary school and it would be anxious to conclude the site issue as soon as possible. It will continue to engage with the local authority until this matter is resolved.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, my Department has increased capacity at the four existing post-primary schools to 3,000 places overall. The current combined enrolment is 2,500 which means that there is spare capacity for some 500 pupil places.  A building project which is in train for Lucan Community College will further increase capacity by 200 pupil places. In addition to this, a <Col N="754"/>building project for St Joseph&rsquo;s College has been assessed and the project brief, which will provide an additional 200 pupils places, has been agreed.</P>
        <P>The combined total of extra places which will be available when these projects are completed will be 900 which is the equivalent to the size of a post primary school in its own right.  These measures will assist in reducing pressure for pupil places in the short to medium term while the process of advancing the project for a new school continues.</P>
        <P>It would be premature for my Department to meet with the group referred to until such time as a suitable site has been identified and acquired.</P>

	<P>Vehicles operating under my Department&rsquo;s school transport scheme must be equipped with seat belts and pupils are required by law to wear these belts.</P>
        <P>The European Communities (Compulsory Use of Safety Belts and Child Restraint Systems in Motor Vehicles) Regulations 2006 &mdash; Statutory Instrument No. 240 of 2006, made by the Minister for Transport in May 2006, obliges owners of buses fitted with safety belts to ensure that passengers of such buses are informed of the requirement to wear safety belts while they are seated and the bus is in motion.  This obligation may be discharged by one or more of the following means &mdash; announcement by the driver or conductor, audio-visual presentation or signs or pictograms displayed at each seat.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department launched safety campaigns in 2006 and 2007 to make parents and children aware that it is the law to wear seat belts on school buses and to encourage children to behave in a safety-conscious manner on, and in the vicinity of, school buses. These messages were conveyed by way of television, cinema and radio advertisements. Additionally, a safety DVD and posters were distributed to all primary and post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>Bus &Eacute;ireann also issued a circular, at the beginning of the current school year, to parents of children travelling on school transport, inviting their co-operation, and that of their children, to help make the school transport journey as safe and comfortable as possible. This circular emphasised the importance of safety, the consequences of misbehaviour and the disciplinary measures which may be necessary.</P>

	<P>The compulsory school starting age in a National School is 6 years of age. Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not  obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000.</P>
        <P>Where a Board of Management refuses to enrol a student in a school, the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student  himself or herself, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with <Col N="757"/>within 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the Board of Management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</P>

        <Quest> if she is satisfied that appropriate procedures are in place in respect of Garda vetting of teachers having regard to vetting being a condition of employment of new teachers and other appointees who may have unsupervised access to children; the procedures in place in respect of long-standing teachers; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In the education sector, vetting is currently done in respect of newly appointed teachers via the registration process with the Teaching Council.  It is also done for prospective employees for posts that involve working with children such as Special Needs assistants (SNAs), bus drivers, bus escorts to children with special needs, caretakers and other ancillary staff.  As the expansion of service by the Garda Vetting Unit is rolled out my Department will be consulting the relevant stakeholders on how best to introduce vetting of existing teachers and other education staff working with children.</P>
        <P>Ensuring the protection, health and welfare of children is a key concern for this Government, for parents, for agencies that work with children and for society generally.  To this end, the Programme for Government provides for a proposed amendment to the Constitution which will further strengthen our ability to protect our children by allowing the Oireachtas to legislate for the exchange of information about suspected child abusers.  The Programme is committed to putting in place the necessary structures and systems to increase cooperation on vetting and the exchange of all relevant information about those who work or seek to work with children and vulnerable adults.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, there is a commitment to provide extra resources to the Garda vetting service and also that we will develop an all-Ireland approach to child protection.

	<P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on individual cases.</P>
        <P>As a general matter, however, appointing staff is the responsibility of the board of management and it is for the Board to satisfy itself that a particular individual is considered suitable for appointment.  Where facts or information comes to a Board&rsquo;s attention calling into question a person&rsquo;s suitability to work with children it is obviously for the Board to satisfy itself that the person is suitable to work in that capacity. This will naturally have to be assessed on a case by case basis.

	<P>There are no plans at present to include Irish sign language as a specific subject within the national curriculum in primary and post-primary schools in the Junior Certificate or established Leaving Certificate programmes.  Irish Sign Language is one of the optional modules available within the Leaving Certificate Applied programme.</P>
        <P>Irish sign language (ISL) has formal recognition in the Education Act 1998. Under that Act, it is a function of the Minister for Education and Science to ensure, subject to the provisions of the Act, that there is made available to each person resident in the State, including a person with a disability or who has other special educational needs, support services and a level and quality of education appropriate to meeting the needs and abilities of that person. This includes provision for students learning through ISL.</P>
        <P>A number of initiatives which seek to promote, develop and implement ISL in order that it will achieve greater recognition and use in the education system are currently in place. These include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />the special schools for the deaf have been encouraged in relation to the use of sign language in class.</P><Col N="759"/>

        <P>The Summer Works Scheme was introduced in 2004 with the purpose of devolving funding to primary and post-primary school to carry out works to school buildings with minimum interaction with the Department. Since then, over 3,000 projects costing in excess of &euro;300 million have been completed. With so many smaller projects having been completed over the past few years, I intend to focus on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008. There will not, therefore, be a new Summer Works Scheme as part of our building programme this year.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, in September 2007, the service provider in question extended its services to ensure that all children with severe and profound disabilities are in receipt of appropriate educational supports, including the pupil referred to by the Deputy. My Department provides the teaching and special needs assistant support. I understand from the service provider, that as part of the change process, it gave a commitment to families of children with severe and profound disabilities that their children would receive a support service during the school holidays equivalent to the level of support that was available in the previous system. This service has been planned and runs over most of the school holiday periods.</P>
        <P>I understand also that there have been some difficulties with recruiting suitable personnel for the support service. As a result, I am informed that the pupil in question did not receive a service for one day during Easter.</P>

Leave of absence for study purposes is for a period not exceeding one full school year commencing on 1 September and ending on the following 31 August.  This is to avoid disruption to the work of the school.  In exceptional circumstances one further year of paid leave of absence may be granted to complete a particular course of study.</P>

	<P>Under the EU Directives for the Mutual Recognition of Professional Qualifications, provisions are made whereby professionals qualified in one (home) Member State can seek professional recognition of their qualifications in another (host) Member State for the purpose of practising their profession in that host Member State. These Directives apply only where the profession is regulated in the host Member State, as teaching is in the UK.</P>
        <P>As the designated authority under the EU Directives, issues in relation to the recognition and registration of teachers in this jurisdiction are a matter for the Teaching Council.</P>
        <P>Teachers registered in the UK are currently eligible for registration as teachers with the Teaching Council subject to conditions relating to the Irish language requirement and probation.</P>
        <P>Learning support/special educational needs teachers in primary schools in Ireland are, first and foremost, qualified primary teachers. The appointment of teachers to special educational needs roles is a matter for schools themselves, taking intoaccount the needs of the student body and the qualifications of individual teachers.  There is no specific qualification required.  However, to be eligible for appointment to a Learning Support post, a teacher must be fully probated.</P>
        <P>My Department funds a number of avenues of continuing professional development for qualified teachers. Among these is the Combined Post-Graduate Diploma Programme of Continuous Professional Development for Teachers involved in Learning Support and Special Education. This is a one year part-time course for teachers in Special Education and Learning Support Posts. A circular and application form for the next available course will issue in January 2009 to all schools. For further details on the course, I refer you the last circular 0003/2008, available on the Departments website, <i>www.education.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>The primary responsibility of my Department in this area is the provision of school facilities for the effective delivery of the <Col N="763"/>curriculum. In addition, school authorities have a considerable degree of autonomy in relation to how their premises are managed and utilised at local level.</P>
        <P>However, I do recognise that there is a lack of recreational facilities for community use in certain areas which could be met if school premises were made available to the wider community. To encourage schools in this respect, my Department issued a circular to all school authorities in late 2005 urging trustees and Boards of Management to make their facilities available where possible for community education and recreation purposes. Decisions in relation to the use of school facilities remain entirely at the discretion of the school authorities, subject to the condition that the needs of the students attending the school are prioritised in the first instance.</P>
        <P>My Department has also progressed a number of school building projects within the Fingal and Adamstown areas of Dublin with local Authority/Developers to produce an integrated solution to education and community facilities that matches the delivery of new housing. I believe this model can be used to advantage across the country in future particularly in the area of shared community facilities.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s position generally is that the availability of such facilities should be self-funding i.e. adequate to cover the heat/light/caretaking arrangements as well as making some contribution to the repair of wear and tear on premises caused by increased use. Of utmost importance, schools should ensure that insurance and security are covered as it is unlikely that the school&rsquo;s insurance policy would cover non-school activities or that a caretaker would be routinely available to open/lock up premises.</P>

	<P>A 6-acre site for primary school provision in Tyrellstown has been identified and negotiations are ongoing with the owner. As the Deputy will appreciate, due to the commercial sensitivities attached to site acquisition, I cannot comment further on the matter at this time.</P>
        <P>Subject to legal acquisition of the site and a full review of other provision in the area, this site will be developed to provide accommodation for up to two 24 classroom schools, each of which would have a 3 stream junior infant intake. This equates to a pupil intake of 162 junior infants per year.  Any proposed development of the site will be considered in the context of the multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.	</P>

	<P>As part of the expansion of the Small Schools Scheme, a grant of &euro;484,000 was sanctioned in March 2007 for the school in question to enable the Board of Management to extend and modernise their school.</P>
        <P>The intention of the scheme is to provide funding to schools to enable them to undertake wanted building projects.  The scheme is not intended to leave schools with significant fundraising needs but for the school to tailor the scope of capital works commissioned to the available funding.  The decision on whether to continue participating in the scheme or to drop out, if the scope of build is more than the funding envelope permits, is a matter for each school authority.</P>
        <P>A central tenet of the devolved scheme is that the school, granted discretion and funding, must equally accept responsibility for prioritisation, adherence to statutory regulations, control of costs and ensuring value for money.</P>
        <P>The school was approved additional funding to cover unavoidable extra costs associated with the project.  They have submitted another appeal for additional funding and my Department will be in contact with the school in the matter in the near future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Comprehensive information is held on individual school files; however, my Department does not yet have these details available in a format that provides readily accessible cumulative information on the overall position regarding temporary accommodation. This issue is, however, being addressed as part of a general review of rental policy being undertaken. Information is being collated on schools which have received approval from the Department for temporary accommodation. It will be used to produce a database of information which will be maintained on an ongoing basis and I will ensure the Deputy receives the information sought relating to Co. Mayo once it is available.</P><Col N="766"/>
        <P Just="Left">In addition to developing a database, the review of rental policy will involve the development of new procedures for both short-term rental and purchase and a drawdown contract for supply and installation of temporary accommodation on a regional basis. Existing rental contracts will also be investigated with a view to establishing if there is potential for better value for money.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years, with the appointment of 6,000 extra teachers in the primary sector alone since 2002. Against this background, the Department has nonetheless managed to keep expenditure on temporary accommodation low and last year rental costs only amounted to 5% of the total investment in school buildings.</P>
        <P>Where accommodation is needed at short notice, however, a temporary solution can be the only option. Such accommodation may also be used where the need is short term, such as when a school requires a temporary building while it is awaiting the completion of construction of permanent facilities. However, the emphasis will continue to be on providing permanent accommodation where possible.</P>
        <P>This year more than &euro;586 million will be invested in school buildings and construction work will take place which is expected to provide permanent accommodation for approximately 20,000 pupils when complete. In the past, newly recognised schools have generally been required to open in temporary accommodation. I am anxious to move away from this approach in developing areas and this year my Department is working hard to open as many new schools as possible in permanent accommodation.</P>
        <P>Department officials have been working in partnership with local authority staff to acquire sites needed for new schools next September. The aim, where possible, is to put permanent solutions in place on a phased basis to meet the immediate September 2008 needs, with a second phase to follow as required. Permanent solutions will be possible where a long-term site has been secured. The Deputy will be pleased to learn that this ambitious programme is on target.</P>

        <Quest> if she will grant aid schools who might have difficulty paying new water charges, as according to EU policy the Government could pay these charges; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The cost pressures on schools are taken into account by my Department in determining the levels of annual increases in the capitation grants paid to schools to meet their day to day running costs. Primary schools are now getting &euro;178 per pupil to meet their day to day running costs &mdash; an increase of nearly 70% on the 2002 rate of &euro;105 and &euro;15 more per child than they got last year. Post-primary schools have also received this increase and now receive &euro;331 per pupil. As the Deputy will be aware, we are committed to doubling the capitation grant for primary schools over the next five years.</P>
        <P>In the context of reducing water costs for schools, it has been demonstrated that fitting simple water saving devices to toilets and sinks can reduce water consumption considerably at very little cost, as can other small works such as fixing easily identifiable leaks. Primary school authorities may use their annual minor works grant to fund such measures. The value of the minor works grant has increased by nearly 50% over the past two years and &euro;27 million in such grants issued to primary schools earlier this year.</P><Col N="767"/>
        <P>Second level schools benefit from more generous capitation funding and can use this for small works. My Department will consider applications for necessary large projects under the school building programme. Excellent materials and guidance in relation to water conservation by schools have been produced by Dublin City Council and are available to all schools on the internet.</P>
        <P>My Department is in close liaison with the Department of Environment and Local Government regarding water conservation and is supportive of any measures by it that will help reduce water costs for schools.</P>
        <P>For the transition period the Government agreed that non-fee paying recognised schools will pay a flat rate per pupil fee as follows:- 2007- &euro;3 per pupil, 2008 &mdash; &euro;3.50 per pupil and 2009- &euro;4 per pupil enrolled. For 2007, charges applied based on metering will be recalculated on the transitional flat rate with a credit given for any excess payment.</P>
        <P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will advise local authorities of the detailed arrangements which will be put in place to implement this decision.</P>
        <P>These new arrangements afford schools the opportunity to put in place the necessary water conservation arrangements and practices and undertake necessary works to ensure that when full water charges are introduced in two years time schools will have significantly reduced their water usage and, by virtue of good water conservation, be in a much stronger position to meet their water charges. Those schools with very high water consumption will be identified and contacted with a view to introducing measures to help them reduce water usage.</P>
        <P>An information package is currently being prepared for schools on the most appropriate measures to minimise excess consumption of water and to reduce wastage where it exists. As part of this exercise, technical guidance and specifications for the most common problems that are likely to arise in this area will be provided. In addition, water conservation issues will continue to be addressed by my Department as a matter of routine where new schools are being built or where major renovations are being carried out to existing schools under the schools modernisation programme.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Summer Works Scheme has, since its introduction just a few years ago, transformed the standard of existing school accommodation. With over 3,000 projects now having been funded under the scheme, the Department&rsquo;s intention is to concentrate the investment in school buildings this year on delivering as many large projects as possible. </P>
        <P>While there will be a focus on providing extra places in developing areas, the Department will also be delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country. The emphasis, however, will be on new schools, exten<Col N="769"/>sions and major refurbishments, rather than on smaller projects. At primary level schools may use their devolved minor works grant to address such works.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances, there will not be a new Summer Works Scheme as part of the Department&rsquo;s building programme in 2008. This being the case, details in relation to the number of applications received and cost have not been collated by the Department. I would also advise the Deputy that I announced at the teacher conferences last week that there will be a Summer Works Scheme in 2009.</P>

        <P>The Deputy will be aware of my position on the issues of litigation in special educational needs and assuming that this is the category referred to, the Deputy can be assured that neither I nor my Department take lightly any decision to defend cases concerning children with special educational needs. I should emphasise that my Department does not initiate any such proceedings and cases are generally only litigated where no potential settlement is acceptable to both sides and the Government&rsquo;s authority to decide issues of policy is in question. The State has an obligation under the Constitution to provide for primary education. In the context of children with special educational needs, that education must be appropriate to their requirements. The State decides on an appropriate form of provision, having regard to the advice available to it from relevant experts in the National Educational Psychological Service, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Inspectorate and independent experts. The Department is not complacent in dealing with these cases and attempts, wherever possible, to reduce the potential for litigation and the levels of legal costs where they arise.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Summer Works Scheme has, since its introduction just a few years ago, transformed the standard of existing school accommodation. With over 3,000 projects now having been funded under the scheme, the Department&rsquo;s intention is to concentrate the investment in school buildings this year on delivering as many large projects as possible. </P>
        <P>While there will be a focus on providing extra places in developing areas, the Department will also be delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country. The emphasis, however, will be on new schools, extensions and major refurbishments, rather than on smaller projects. At primary level schools may use their devolved minor works grant to address such works.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances, there will not be a new Summer Works Scheme as part of the Department&rsquo;s building programme in 2008. This being the case, details in relation to the number of applications received and cost have not been collated by the Department. I would also advise the Deputy that I announced at the teacher conferences last week that there will be a Summer Works Scheme in 2009.</P>
        <P>The Professional and Technical Reports provided by schools for 2008 can be used again for future projects so that schools will not be at the loss of expenditure on them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. There are now in the region of 6,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. By the 2006/07 school year, we had reduced the average class size in our primary schools to 24, while the pupil teacher ratio was 16.4:1, including resource teachers etc. In that year, schools were staffed on the basis of a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Given that the national average was 24, many schools benefited from much more favourable staffing ratios than this. </P>
        <P>Extra teachers were provided by the Government for the 2007/08 school year to improve primary school staffing so that schools would generally get at least one classroom teacher for every 27 children.</P>
        <P>A further initiative in recent years that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 330 such posts have been sanctioned in the 2007/08 school year compared to 280 in 2006/07.</P>
        <P>Combined with the 6,000 more primary school teachers referred to and the extra teachers in the current school year, the additional primary teachers planned for 2008/09 will mean this Government will be well ahead of target in relation to the Programme for Government commitment to hire 4,000 extra primary teachers between 2007 and 2012. Indeed, 2,000 of these will be in place by next Spring.</P>
        <P>Over the lifetime of the Government, we are committed to providing more primary school teachers specifically to reduce class sizes. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P>

        <Quest> the reason the summer works scheme in her Department was suspended; the funding available to schools to carry out small scale building works as per circular 0043/2007 projects; the way her Department assists with funding for such works; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The Summer Works Scheme was introduced in 2004 with the purpose of devolving funding to primary and post-primary school to carry out works to school buildings with minimum interaction with the Department. Since then, over 3,000 projects costing in excess of &euro;300 million have been completed. With so many smaller projects having been completed over the past few years, I intend to focus on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008. There is not, therefore, a new Summer Works Scheme as part of our building programme this year.</P>
        <P>Primary school authorities may use their annual minor works grant to deal with small scale projects. In November 2006 I increased funding for the minor works grant by 44% on the previous year. Around &euro;27m was paid out to primary schools throughout the country late last year to enable thousands of small scale works to be completed without the need to interact with my Department.</P>
        <P>Another avenue to claim grant-aid from my Department is the Emergency Works Fund. Grants from this fund are available for very urgent unforeseen works, primarily of a major health and safety nature, to schools that are in most need of resources for capital works. Funding will continue to be available for dust extraction projects in 2008.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware the Programme for Government commits my Department to establishing a Developing Areas Unit to identify where new schools are needed and to ensure that these schools are delivered in the fastest possible timeframe. </P>
        <P>The process of assessing the need for new or additional educational facilities at primary or post-primary level in any given area entails consideration of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for places.  Liaison with existing schools is also an important part of the <Col N="778"/>process.  In this way, every effort is made to ensure that there is adequate existing provision and that timely arrangements are made to extend capacity or provide new infrastructure where necessary.</P>
        <P>In addition, Local Authorities are obliged by statute to refer draft local area development plans to the Department for observation and comment so that lands can be zoned for future education use.  There are numerous sites reserved for education purposes, particularly in the rapidly developing areas, under this process so as to ensure that there will be sufficient land set aside and available for the future development of education infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Over and above the statutory consultation provisions in relation to local authority draft area development plans, my Department has in recent years worked to strengthen contacts with local authorities to enable informed decisions to be made in planning future educational provision.</P>
        <P>My Department also makes extensive use of data from the Census of Population for a variety of purposes including long-term projections of enrolment at national and local level.  The census results for 2006 are of use in identifying broad trends in total population by county and local area.  My Department also uses census data when drafting its own area development plans and planning school provision for likely enrolment at local area level.</P>
        <P>My Department is satisfied that the approach which it is now taking to the identification and delivery of extra school places in rapidly developing areas will help to ensure that those places will be provided when and where they are needed.</P>
        <P>Specific areas currently being addressed by my Developing Areas Unit are as follows:</P>
<P el="5" LI="1">Newbridge, Naas, Maynooth, Celbridge, Athy, Kill, Skerries, Swords, Balbriggan, Lusk, Phoenix Park, Dublin 15, Greystones, Rochestown, Carrigaline, Midleton, Belmayne, Tallaght, Lucan, Saggart, Newcastle, Athlone, Kinnegad, Mullingar, Enniscorthy, Gorey, Portlaoise, Carlow Town, Tullamore, Tramore, Trim, Kilcock, Ratoath, Ashbourne, Duleek, Dunboyne, Doughiska in Galway, Drogheda and Dundalk.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the correspondence referred to by the Deputy which relates to class sizes in the school.  As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. There are now in the region of 6,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. By the <Col N="781"/>2006/07 school year, we had reduced the average class size in our primary schools to 24, while the pupil teacher ratio was 16.4:1, including resource teachers etc. In that year, schools were staffed on the basis of a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Given that the national average was 24, many schools benefited from much more favourable staffing ratios than this.  Extra teachers were provided by the Government for the 2007/08 school year to improve primary school staffing so that schools would generally get at least one classroom teacher for every 27 children.</P>
        <P>A further initiative in recent years that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 330 such posts have been sanctioned in the 2007/08 school year compared to 280 in 2006/07.  Over the lifetime of the Government, we are committed to providing more primary school teachers specifically to reduce class sizes. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P>
        <P>An independent staffing appeal process is available to Boards of Management of individual schools. They can submit an appeal under certain criteria to an Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</P>

	<P>The compulsory school starting age in a National School is 6 years of age. Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000.</P>
        <P>Where a Board of Management refuses to enrol a student in a school, the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student himself or herself, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with within 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the Board of Management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</P>

My Department has applied for planning permission for the first phases of the two primary schools consisting of 8 classrooms each.

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Summer Works Scheme has, since its introduction just a few years ago, transformed the standard of existing school accommodation. With over 3,000 projects now having been funded under the scheme, the Department&rsquo;s intention is to concentrate the investment in school buildings this year on delivering as many large projects as possible.  While there will be a focus on providing extra places in developing areas, the Department will also be delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country. The emphasis, however, will be on new schools, extensions and major refurbishments, rather than on smaller projects. At primary level schools may use their devolved minor works grant to address such works.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances, there will not be a new Summer Works Scheme as part of the Department&rsquo;s building programme in 2008. This being the case, details in relation to the number of applications received and cost have not been collated by the Department. I would also advise the Deputy that I announced at the teacher conferences last week that there will be a Summer Works Scheme in 2009.  The Professional and Technical Reports provided by schools for 2008 can be used again for future projects so that schools will not be at the loss of expenditure on them.</P>

	<P>The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant assessing authority. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is required. Under the existing appeal process my Department has reviewed the case referred to by the Deputy and a decision issued to the student in question.  The student is not in receipt of an eligible social welfare payment as specified in the scheme as at the 31 December 2006.  Therefore she does not qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant.  The appeal cannot be considered further unless additional relevant information, not previously available, is submitted to my Department by the candidate concerned.  I have no plans at present to depart from the terms and conditions of the scheme. </P>

	<P>The position is that the Law Reform Commission published a Consultation Paper on Multi-Unit Developments in December 2006. It identified a broad range of regulatory and other issues arising in relation to such developments, including problems relating to the structure and governance of property management companies and the manner in which company law currently applies to them.  The Law Reform Commission has indicated that it will publish, as soon as possible, its Report on Multi-Unit Developments which, following an extensive consultation process, will contain definitive reform proposals concerning the regulation and governance of property management companies. The Government has already directed that early action be taken by the relevant Departments to address the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations; the types of action to be taken will, of course, be dependent on the form that the recommendations take. </P>
        <P>A high-level interdepartmental committee, under the chairmanship of my Department, comprising representatives of relevant Departments and Offices has been established to assist in the development of a coherent and comprehensive response to the problems arising in relation to multi-unit developments. A key task of this committee will be to identify the legislative and administrative actions to be taken in response to the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations and to determine a timescale for their implementation. This committee is reporting to a Cabinet Committee whose membership comprises the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Environment, Heritage and Local Government; Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Attorney General.</P>

	<P>A C Visit Visa is granted for visits of less than 90 days.  As a consequence it is not the general policy to extend permission to remain to persons who are admitted initially for a period of 90 days or less on a C Visit Visa, save in very exceptional and unforeseen circumstances.  The person concerned entered the State on foot of a C visit visa. An examination of the papers in relation to the visa application indicates that the person referred to by the Deputy guaranteed that upon termination of her visit and prior to the expiration of her permission to remain, she would return back to India.  Her son also guaranteed that she would return to India on termination of the visit.  The person concerned must leave on or before the expiration of the 90 day period and reapply  for the appropriate visa through her nearest Irish Embassy from outside the State.</P>

My Department has not provided funding to this organisation in the past and I understand there are no applications for funding on hand at this time.  Services like these, which are focused on the inclusion of all communities, encourage integration and form part of the Government&rsquo;s policy on mainstreaming services for immigrants. In that context, any specific decision on funding must continue to rest with the appropriate mainstream service provider and must be taken in the light of competing funding priorities.  I understand that the HSE has agreed to provide funds which will ensure that this very worthwhile organisation can continue to provide their services to the community in Mulhuddart.</P>

        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of murder and manslaughter offences which involved the use of a firearm recorded from 1 June, 1997 to 31 December, 2007 and in 2008 up to 25 March was 157. The number of convictions to date in respect of these offences is 26.  The number of murder and manslaughter offences involving the use of a knife or a sharp instrument recorded for the years 2000 to 2007 and in 2008 up to 25 March is 190. The number of convictions to date in respect of these offences is 95.  Figures for murder and <Col N="793"/>manslaughter offences by weapon type, other than a firearm, prior to 2000 are not readily available and would require a disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources to collate.</P>
        <P>The detection rate for murders and manslaughters offences by its nature increases over time as Garda investigations progress. It is anticipated that the number of convictions obtained will increase as Garda investigations are concluded and the number of proceedings commenced are finalised by the courts.</P>

	<P>I have been advised by the Garda authorities that funding has been ring-fenced from the Garda Budget for 2008 to ensure that Garda activities under Operation Anvil, which is augmented by other operations and initiatives both locally and nationally, will continue within all units and sections of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil commenced in May 2005 in the Dublin Metropolitan Region and was extended countrywide in 2006. The primary focus of Operation &lsquo;Anvil&rsquo; is the disruption of serious and organised criminal activity. In this regard Operation Anvil consists of intelligence-led targeted operations on the one hand and an increased overt visible Garda presence on the other. The Garda Commissioner has already publicly re-affirmed his absolute commitment to the objectives of Operation &lsquo;Anvil&rsquo;, which is but one tool used by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the fight to combat crime.  The total Garda budget for 2008 stands at a record &euro;1.6 billion, underpinning the Government&rsquo;s commitment to provide the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the necessary resources it requires to carry out its functions.</P>

        <P>To date, almost 14,000 applicants have been granted  renewal of their IBC/05 permission for a further three years.   In addition some 2,000 Romanian and Bulgarian citizens who were granted permission to remain in the State under the scheme, do not now have to apply to have their permission renewed.</P>
        <P>The detailed information sought by the person concerned in relation to the housing, social welfare and medical card costs generated by the persons approved under the IBC/05 Scheme cannot be isolated and aggregated by the various government departments and agencies provid<Col N="794"/>ing these services.

	<P>In Ireland the Gaming and Lotteries Acts, 1956-86, cover gaming and lotteries other than the National Lottery, which is covered by the National Lotteries Act 1986 with the Betting Act 1931 governing all matters relating to betting.  These Acts govern activities whether online or offline.  In general, all forms of gaming are illegal in this jurisdiction except where specifically permitted.  In terms of enforcement, in Ireland, as well as in most jurisdictions, what is illegal off-line is considered illegal on-line.</P>
        <P>The Internet, however, is an international and world-wide phenomenon.  It has no borders and no single organisation controls it.   Measures to combat illegal materials and activities on the Internet are therefore hampered by a multiplicity of jurisdictions, differing legal systems, and differing societal norms.  Combating illegal use of the Internet thus requires responses at national, EU and international levels.</P>
        <P>Under a Code of Practice and Ethics agreed by the Irish Internet Service Provider Industry in 2002, material or services that are illegal under Irish law will not be carried on Irish servers, and if such is found they will be removed immediately under agreed protocols.  Unlike child pornography, however, where there is almost universal agreement, online gaming/gambling is not illegal in many jurisdictions, and these services can be accessed via the internet from this jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may also be aware that in August, 2006, the Government agreed to the proposal of my predecessor for the establishment of a Committee (the Casino Regulation Committee) to report on the possibilities for a legislative basis for the strict regulation of casino-style operations in the State.  The Casino Regulation Committee completed their Report in April last <Col N="797"/>year.  It is a lengthy document which deals with a range of complex and inter-related public policy issues which are now being considered.</P>
        <P>Following consultation with my colleagues in Government I intend to publish the Report in question shortly.  On publication I will be in a position, also, to announce the steps I intend to take to advance the situation in relation to the complex public policy issues surrounding gaming in general in the most appropriate manner.  Needless to say, I do not propose to comment on the Report or any of its recommendations in advance of its publication.</P>

The scheme operates at two levels: initial funding for the assessment of needs (Stage 1) and substantive funding for fully developed proposals (Stage 2).  Matching funding for RAPID areas is available from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Pobal has been engaged to administer the Scheme on behalf of my Department.</P>
        <P>I am advised that stage 1 funding of &euro;5,000 was approved for a community group in the area referred to by the Deputy. This will enable the group to investigate the need for CCTV in their area and complete a detailed proposal for substantive funding.</P>

	<P>Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007. Part 13 of the Act relating to anti-social behaviour by children was commenced on 1 March, 2007.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and to the making of a behaviour order by the Children&rsquo;s Court.</P>

The claim was assessed by the Refugee Applications Commissioner who concluded that the person concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee. The Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendation was communicated to him by letter dated 24 July, 2007. This communication advised the person of his entitlement to appeal the Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendation to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which he duly did.</P>
        <P>The Refugee Appeals Tribunal considered the person&rsquo;s appeal, following which the Tribunal affirmed the Commissioner&rsquo;s earlier recommendation to reject his claim.

The Deputy will, however, be aware that the Garda National Immigration Bureau and the British authorities work closely together and run regular intelligence led operations aimed at interrupting illegal immigration flows within the Common Travel Area.  These joint operations, targeting illegal movement between Britain and Ireland, including through the North, continue to successfully disrupt the illegal carousel of movement between the two jurisdictions. </P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength (all ranks) of the Wicklow/Wexford Garda Division on 28 February, 2007 and on 29 February, 2008 (the latest date for which figures are readily available) was 346 and 363 respectively. This represents an increase of 17 (or 4.9%) in the number of Garda&iacute; allocated to the Division since that date.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, an unprecedented increase in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is continuing in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, with an intake of  approximately 1,100 recruits per annum.  In addition, there is a significant expansion under way in the number of civilian staff being made available to the Commissioner.</P>
        <P>I recently approved the 2008 Garda Annual Policing Plan and laid it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It sets out the Commissioner&rsquo;s proposals to realign the boundaries of Garda Divisions around the country to make them coterminous with local authority boundaries.  Included in this is a plan to establish a Garda Division in Wexford. The planned changes will bring about greater efficiencies and effectiveness in facilitating the establishment and functioning of Joint Policing Committees.  A detailed programme of work is currently being developed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to implement these planned changes for various Garda Divisions.  This programme of work will also examine the geographical areas of district and sub-district stations arising from the regional and divisional boundary realignments set out in the plan and will set out a timetable for the establishment of the new divisions.</P>
        <P>The policing priorities which I set for the Garda&iacute; for 2008 under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005 have been reflected in the Policing Plan for 2008.  The first priority deals with targeting gun crime, organised crime and drug trafficking.  It refers to the use in particular of specialist units and targeted operations such as Operation Anvil, profiling, intelligence gathering and threat assessments in relation to individuals and groups involved in this type of crime.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking everything into account. In that regard, the needs of the Garda Division referred to by the Deputy will be fully considered by the Commissioner within the overall context of the needs of Garda Divisions throughout the country.</P>

	<P>The persons concerned applied for asylum in the State on 20th January 2005. Their applications were refused and deportation orders were made in respect of them on 23 November 2005. The applicants instituted judicial review proceedings on 13 January 2006 challenging the decision to make deportation orders in respect of them. The proceedings  were determined on 30 January 2008 when the reliefs sought were refused by the High Court. The applicants were refused a certificate to appeal this decision to the Supreme Court on 13 March 2008.</P>
        <P>The persons in question submitted applications for subsidiary protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 S.I. 518 of the 2006 (&lsquo;the Regulations&rsquo;) on 3 March 2008. These applicants are persons in respect of whom deportation orders were signed before the coming into force of the Regulations on 10 October 2006, and as such are not automatically entitled to apply for Subsidiary Protection under the Regulations.  In situations where an individual does not have an automatic right to apply for subsidiary protection but has identified new facts or circumstances which demonstrate a change of position from that which pertained at the time the deportation orders were made, I may exercise discretion under Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 S.I. No. 518 of 2006 to accept and consider an application for Subsidiary Protection.</P>
        <P>Following consideration of the information submitted by the applicants, it was concluded that they have established no grounds to show that there are new or altered circumstances from the time the deportation orders were made. The applicants were informed by letter dated 19 March 2008 that I had decided not to exercise discretion pursuant to Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 &mdash; S.I. 518 of the 2006 to accept and consider applications for subsidiary protection from them. The applicants instituted judicial proceedings on 20 March 2008 challenging that decision. As the matter is sub judice, I do not propose to comment further.	</P>

	<P>The person referred to by the Deputy arrived in the State on 13 March 2002 and applied for asylum. She was refused refugee status in the State following consideration of her case by the Office of the <Col N="803"/>Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. She was informed of these recommendations by letters dated 10 October 2002 and 10 February 2003 respectively.</P>
        <P>A notification under Section 3(3)(a) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, issued to the person concerned on 28 March 2003 advising her of the Minister&rsquo;s decision to refuse to give her a declaration of refugee status and setting out the options open to her at that point; i.e. to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a deportation order or to make written representations within 15 working days to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform setting out reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
        <P>Her case was examined under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, (Prohibition of Refoulement). Consideration was given to the representations received on her behalf from her legal representatives. On 11 May 2005, my predecessor refused temporary leave to remain in the State and instead signed a deportation order in respect of her.  She was notified of this decision by letter dated 10 June 2005. That letter made her aware that she was required to present herself, on 16 June 2005, at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau in order that arrangements could be made for her removal from the State. She presented as required and was given further presentation dates which she kept. She is due to present again on 24 April 2008.</P>
        <P>The person concerned arrived in the State as an adult, accompanied by her parents and they all independently applied for asylum. Currently her parents are judicially reviewing the negative recommendation made in respect of them by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. In addition the person concerned has applied for the revocation of her deportation order so that she may remain in the State and care for her parents, who are in poor health, for as long as they are permitted to remain in the State.  In view of the foregoing, a stay has been put on the Deportation Order in the case of the person concerned until the outcome of the Judicial Review proceedings instituted by her parents is known.</P>

	<P>The use of the poor box has evolved over the years and, while each court of first instance (High, Circuit and District) has used the system on occasion, it is mainly used in the District Court where, typically, the judge may order the defendant to pay a donation into the court poor box in lieu of a criminal conviction.  Payments made to the Court poor box are accounted for in the Court office concerned and the accounting procedures are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Monies paid out of the Court poor box are at the discretion of the Judge.  The Courts Service maintain a full record of all receipts and payments in each local Court Office.  In the main, monies are paid out to charities, schools, youth organisations and the Probation Service.</P>
        <P>In 2005, the Law Reform Commission published a report entitled &lsquo;The Court Poor Box: Probation of Offenders&rsquo; which recommends that reform of the system should take place in the context of the introduction of an expanded range of non-custodial sanctions and the poor box should be replaced by a statutory fund to be known as the Reparation Fund.  My Department is examining the report.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of the Mayo Division as at 29 February 2008, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 315.  The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day, personnel strengths of individual divisions, districts and stations may fluctuate due, for example, to promotions, retirements and transfers.</P>
        <P>The unprecedented increase in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is continuing in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, with an intake of  approximately 1,100 recruits per annum.  In addition, there is a significant expansion under way in the number of civilian staff being made available to the Commissioner.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking everything into account. In that regard, the needs of the Garda Division referred to by the Deputy will be fully considered by the Commissioner within the overall context of the needs of Garda Divisions throughout the country.</P>

	<P>Separate information on revenue accruing on foot of payments from fixed charge notices and court fines with which penalty points were imposed since their introduction is not readily available and could only be obtained by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time and resources. <Col N="808"/> Responsibility for the collection of payments under the Fixed Charge Processing System (FCPS) was outsourced to An Post in January 2006.  I can inform the Deputy that in 2006 &euro;14.3 million was collected by An Post in respect of fixed charge notices and in 2007 &euro;22.9 million was collected. It should be noted that not all fixed charge notices attract penalty points.  The revenue accruing to the Courts Vote under the Road Traffic Acts in 2006 was &euro;13.4 million and in 2007  &euro;12.8 million was collected. These amounts are in respect of all offences under the Road Traffic Acts inclusive of fixed charges.  All monies received are surrendered to the Exchequer as extra exchequer receipts and are accounted for in the Appropriation Accounts.</P>

An external evaluation of the funding initiative has been commissioned as part of the normal review of funding programmes.</P>

	<P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received in the Citizenship section of my Department in September 2007.  Officials in that section are <Col N="809"/>currently processing applications received in August 2005 and have approximately 14,400 applications on hand to be dealt with before that of the person concerned. These are generally dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. There is nothing contained in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question that warrants taking the application out of chronological order and treating it expeditiously.  It is likely, therefore, that further processing of the application will commence in early 2010. I will inform the Deputy and the person in question when I have reached a decision on the matter.</P>

	<P>Following the submission in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, it was decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose. Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics since the third quarter of 2006.  I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.</P>

        <Quest> if he has responded to the offer by the developers of a local office for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at block one of the new urban region being developed in Clongriffin, Dublin 13; if he will use this facility as the commencement process for the long-promised Garda station in Donaghmede which is adjacent to the North Fringe and Clongriffin; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>In accordance with section 22 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, proposals in relation to the opening and closing of Garda stations are a matter, in the first instance, for the Garda Commissioner in the context of the Annual Policing Plans.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that local Garda management are satisfied that a full and comprehensive policing serving is delivered to the Clongriffen area.  The area is policed primarily by Coolock Garda Station which forms part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region, North Division. The personnel strength of the Dublin Metropolitan Region, North Division as at the 29th February last was 742 of which 116 serve in Coolock Garda Station. The area receives additional patrols from personnel attached to the District Detective Unit, Divisional Task Force, Divisional Traffic Unit and the Community Policing Unit. </P>
        <P>I am further advised by the Garda authorities that the opening of a new Garda Station in the area would be incompatible with overall policing policy in the Division and would result in the deployment of Garda personnel away from outdoor operational policing to administrative duties.  Garda management will keep the matter under review and when additional resources <Col N="810"/>next becomes available, the needs of Coolock station and the Dublin Metropolitan Northern Division will be fully considered in the context of the overall requirements throughout the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>To date, 100 Garda Youth Diversion Projects have been established nationwide. Most recently, in October of 2007, I announced the establishment of 7 Garda Youth Diversion Projects which fulfilled the commitment made by my Department to have 100 projects in operation by the end of 2007. </P>
        <P>There are 31 projects operating in Dublin, 11 in Cork, and 6 each in Kerry and Limerick.  There are 5 projects in Waterford and 4 each in Galway, Louth and Tipperary.  Offaly and Wexford have 3 projects.  Clare, Donegal, Kildare, Laois, Mayo, Meath, Westmeath and Wicklow all have 2 projects while Carlow, Cavan, Kilkenny, Longford, Roscommon and Sligo and Monaghan all have one.  Further details are set out in the attached table.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to increase the number of Garda Youth Diversion Projects  to 168 in the lifetime of this Government.   On this note, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that additional resources have been allocated to fund the further expansion of these types of projects in 2008.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, it is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to decide on the prioritisation and allocation of resources within the force. In the time available to answer the question it was not possible to establish the total number of Garda&iacute; involved with Garda Youth Diversion Projects.</P>
        <P>There are currently 100 Garda Youth Diversion Projects operating throughout the country and this number will be extended to 168 in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government.</P>
        <P>The work in a Garda Youth Diversion Project (GYPD) is primarily carried out by a project coordinator/youth worker, who operates under the guidance of a project/management committee. The project/management committee membership generally includes a representative from the relevant youth organisation/employer, who chairs the committee,  the local Inspector, Juvenile Liaison Officer, Community Garda and local community representatives. The committee may also include representatives from other relevant bodies, for example, Health Services Executive, Probation Service, local school, etc.</P>
        <P>Some Garda Districts have more than one project in operation and therefore some Garda&iacute; are active in the operation of more than one Garda Youth Diversion Project. The local Inspector has responsibility, as project treasurer, for the administration and management of project funding.</P>
        <P>The local Juvenile Liaison Officer (JLO) sits on the Referral Assessment Committee operated by each project.  The Referral Assessment Committee assesses the benefits of admission to the project for each young person referred by the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme.  As of 31 December 2007 there were 93 Juvenile Liaison Officers country wide. The Garda Commissioner has given a commitment to appoint an additional 28 JLOs by 2010.</P>
        <P>In addition to the JLO and Community Garda&iacute;, other local Garda&iacute;, including, where appropriate, Garda&iacute; from specialist units, also get involved in the work of GYDPs. The Garda Community Relations Section (GCRS) of the Garda National Juvenile Office based in Harcourt Street coordinates the administration of these projects. The Irish Youth Justice Service, with an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, will evaluate the effectiveness of existing GYDPs, develop new guidelines for them, promote best practice and expand the number of projects available.</P>

	<P>By 31 December 2007 there were 100 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) in existence, 29 of which were established during 2007. In the time available it was not possible to establish the total number of young persons currently engaged with Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs). I will forward the most recent figures to the Deputy  in writing as soon as they are available. </P>
        <P>It should be noted that the needs of the young people participating in a project will differ from time to time. In addition the capacity of a project over a particular period will also depend on the group dynamic of those participating. It is necessary for projects to continually review their capacity based on the needs of the young people involved. The Garda Youth Diversion Projects focus on the quality of the work/intervention with the project participants. In these circumstances, it is not possible to fix a figure for the maximum number of young people that can be catered for by the existing Garda Youth Diversion Projects.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 5 November 1999 and claimed asylum. His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>The person concerned was informed by letter dated 1 March 2002 that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him and afforded him three options in accordance with Section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999(as amended) namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a Deportation Order or to submit, within 15 working days, written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State, that is, why he should not be deported.</P>
        <P>His case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations submitted on his behalf for permission to remain in the State. On 10 March 2003 my predecessor refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of him. Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to present himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau on Thursday 15 May 2003 in order to make travel arrangements for his removal from the State. He failed to present as required and was classified as evading his deportation. He subsequently came to the attention of the Garda&iacute; and was removed from the State to Kosovo on 5 June 2003.</P>
        <P>On 26 May 2003 a Section 17(7) application was received from his legal representatives seeking re-admittance to the asylum process. The application was refused and the person concerned was notified of the decision by letter dated 4 June 2003. An application under Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), seeking revocation of the Deportation Order <Col N="815"/>was lodged by the person concerned on 14 January 2008. The application was refused and the Deportation Order was affirmed. The person concerned was notified of this decision by letter dated 12 March 2008.  The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must remain out of the State.</P>

His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 16 March 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.

	<P>I refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Questions No. 485 of Tuesday 18 December 2007, No. 249 of Wednesday 5 December 2007 and No. 122 of Thursday 4 October 2007 and the written Replies to those Questions.  The person concerned arrived in the State on 4 May 2004 and made an application for asylum on 5 May 2004.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 30 January 2006, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned.</P>
        <P>On 10 October 2006, regulations known as the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006) came into force.  An application for Subsidiary Protection in the State has been received on behalf of the person concerned, his wife and their dependents.  However, this application was signed by only one of the adult applicants and as such is deemed to be invalid without the signatures of both adult parties to the application.  This was made known to the legal representative of the person concerned, by letter dated 1 October 2007.  This communication also advised the legal representative in question that as they were not the solicitor on record, it was necessary for them to submit a signed letter of authority from the person concerned.  However, to date, no completed Subsidiary Protection application has been received on behalf of the person concerned.  Neither has the required letter of authority been received from the legal representative in question.  The case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will be carefully considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement in advance of the file being passed to me for decision.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 896, 905, 910, 911 and 917 together.</P>
        <P>In order to deal comprehensively with the matters raised in these questions, it is firstly necessary to give some background to the issue of accommodating asylum seekers.  The Reception &amp; Integration Agency (RIA) was established on 2 April, 2001 under the aegis of my Department. It replaced the Directorate of Asylum Support Services (DASS) and the Refugee Agency.  The reception function of the Agency has as its principal task the provision of accommodation to asylum seekers while their applications for asylum are processed.</P><Col N="822"/>
        <P>RIA is also responsible for the co-ordination of the delivery of other services (including health, social welfare and education) to them.  RIA accommodates asylum seekers, principally in accordance with the policy of direct provision.  Direct provision is the means by which the State discharges its obligations to provide for the basic requirements of asylum seekers.  For the most part, this involves a cashless system with the State assuming responsibility for providing suitable accommodation on a full board basis, together with certain exceptional needs welfare payments.  Direct provision was introduced on 10 April, 2000 and brought Ireland into line with other EU Member States.  All accommodation costs, together with the costs of meals, heat, light, laundry and maintenance are paid directly by the State.</P>
        <P>To achieve its objective, the RIA is required to source accommodation throughout Ireland for accommodating asylum seekers.  There are currently 62 such centres (including two Reception centres) in 22 counties in the State.  In seven such centres the land and buildings are owned by the State but in all other cases the land and buildings are owned or leased by private companies.  The day-to-day running of all RIA accommodation centres is carried out by commercial operators under contract to RIA.  The RIA does not &lsquo;lease&rsquo; or &lsquo;purchase&rsquo; premises from commercial operators.  Rather it &lsquo;contracts-in&rsquo; a comprehensive range of services, which include accommodation, catering, housekeeping, etc., for a fixed period of time.  In July 2006, the RIA placed a national advertisement seeking expressions of interest from persons who could offer suitable accommodation for asylum seekers.  A similar advertisement was placed in January of this year.  In fulfilling its remit to provide accommodation for asylum seekers, the RIA examines all offers of accommodation as to their suitability and decisions on the possible use of individual premises are taken on the basis of current needs at any particular time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The RIA endeavours to achieve the best value for money for the taxpayer in its ongoing negotiations with commercial organisations which provide services for asylum-seekers.  It must be understood that, in most cases, contract negotiations between RIA and service providers are still in play right up to the point where the contract is signed. It is normal for asylum seekers to be placed in such centres immediately after the signing of the contract.  It is acknowledged that this results in very short notice to other State service providers such as social services, health and other services.</P>
        <P>It cannot be emphasised enough that RIA is a demand driven organisation and operates in an environment akin to a &ldquo;just-in-time&rdquo; supply organisation.  There are currently 6,709 asylum seekers in RIA accommodation. In the past twelve months, an additional 920 persons had to be accommodated by RIA.  This equates to approximately 18 new bed spaces per week.  RIA is required to provide accommodation based on what is actually on offer arising from the advertising process cited above.  The percentage of asylum seekers in particular counties may rise and fall but it is the overriding aim of RIA to ensure that dispersals to counties outside Dublin are allocated proportionately over time.</P>
        <P>In relation to the premises which is the subject of the questions, no contract has been signed between RIA and a service provider in relation to the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers.  It is, moreover, the practice not to comment on any issues regarding procurement for asylum seeker accommodation given the commercial sensitivities cited above.  As to the statistical element of these questions, I attach to this answer a table showing, by county, the percentage of asylum seekers in the direct provision system in relation to the county population as a whole as recorded in the 2006 Census.  There is no legal requirement for recognised refugees to reside in a particular place so statistics are not available as to the number of refugees resident in each county.  Statistics are not available in relation to asylum seekers resident in each county who do not available of accommodation provided by RIA.</P><Col N="823"/>
        <P>There are currently two accommodation centres in County Mayo, viz., the Old Convent, Ballyhaunis and the Railway Hotel, Kiltimagh, which currently accommodate 309 and 76 persons respectively.  As can be seen, the current percentage in relation to Mayo is 0.31%.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 897 to 902, inclusive, together.</P><Col N="825"/>
        <P>I can confirm that I am fully supportive of Government policy in relation to decentralisation which is of course a voluntary process for civil service staff and I am pleased to note that, with two years of my Department&rsquo;s programme still to run, close to five hundred posts have now been transferred, representing 50% of my overall commitment.  While I am responsible to Government for delivering this programme &mdash; which involves 12 separate organisations including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission &mdash; I do not oversee the filling of each individual vacancy within that cohort of posts.  I am aware that the Office of Public Works are looking at a number of possibilities in relation to the provision of permanent office accommodation for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in Roscrea in order to meet the target date for the movement of staff by mid-2009.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, I recently performed the official opening ceremony for the new decentralised Irish Prison Service Headquarters in Longford town and I can confirm that the Commission have been allocated office space in that building.  I understand that the precise staffing structures for the Longford office are still being worked out by the Commission as part of their evolving decentralisation strategy in the context of their implementation plan. I have no involvement in any review in that regard or in any deliberations by the Ombudsman Commission on the correct balance between Head Office and decentralised posts. That is a matter for the Ombudsman Commission. I am aware that since October 2007, the Commission has been actively recruiting additional investigative and administrative staff but I have not been, and do not expect to be, briefed on the impact of each individual appointment.</P>
        <P>With regard to the issue of the processing of complaints by the Ombudsman Commission, I can confirm that I am in receipt of the Report by the Commission into its effectiveness and the adequacy of its functions and also its Second Annual Report.  Section 80 of the Garda Siochana Act 2005 obliges the Ombudsman Commission to report to me in a specific manner and those reports form part of that mechanism.  I am obliged by law to lay each report before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I intend to do so in the near future.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, applications for refugee status in the State are determined by an independent process comprising the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted.</P>
        <P>While it is not the practice to comment in detail on individual asylum applications, I would point out to the Deputy that delays in finalising cases can occur for a variety of reasons, including giving applicants and appellants the fullest opportunity possible to present their cases and the determination of Judicial Review proceedings, where appellants pursue such a course of action.</P>
        <P>Where the latter is relevant, the time taken to discharge any proceedings is a matter for the Courts and is not something that I, as Minister, can comment on.  It is, of course, open to the applicant or the appellant to withdraw any Judicial Review proceedings which they may have instigated and this would allow for their appeal to be processed in the normal manner.  A final decision on this application will be made upon receipt of the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>

        <P>Officials in that section are currently processing applications received in August 2005 and have approximately 12,000 applications on hand to be dealt with before that of the person in question.

It is likely, therefore, that further processing of the application will commence in early 2009.  I will inform the Deputy and the individual in question when I have reached a decision on the matter.</P>

        <P>In all instances, processing arrangements are kept under ongoing review and steps are taken to ensure that applications are dealt with as quickly as possible having regard to overall resources across the full range of services provided by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.  I understand that following the redeployment of resources within the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, additional personnel have recently been assigned to deal with applications for long term residency.

	<P>As the Deputy will appreciate, policing operations and the deployment of Garda resources are matters for the Garda Commissioner.  It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel within the Garda organisation on a priority basis in accordance with overall policing requirements. The area referred to is in Tallaght Garda District, which I am informed by the Garda authorities has a dedicated Drug Unit, consisting of one (1) Sergeant and ten (10) Garda&iacute;, an increase of 20% on 2007 personnel resources.</P>
        <P>I am further advised that the District Drug Unit is very active and runs local operations and initiatives targeting the sale and distribution of drugs within the District, assisted as required by the Garda National Drugs Unit.  An increase in the number of drug seizures has been recorded in the District compared with the same period in 2007, including the number of detections of Simple Possession (Section 3, Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977/84) offences. Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from Tallaght also give talks and participate in discussions at local schools and events organised by various residents&rsquo; and other community-based groups, where advice on drug abuse is provided for parents and young people.</P>
        <P>All members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are tasked with enforcing legislation, including drug-related legislation. They also participate in various continuous development programmes and other in-service training programmes, including those run by the Garda National Drugs Unit in the area of test purchasing.  This facilitates the running of initiatives under Operation &lsquo;Cleanstreet&rsquo; which targets on-street drug dealing within Tallaght Garda District.  Finally, I am assured by the Garda authorities that personnel strengths are kept under regular review by local Garda management in conjunction with crime trends, including drug-related crime in the area and other demands on the Garda service.</P>

        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day, personnel strengths of individual divisions, districts and stations may fluctuate due, for example, to promotions, retirements and transfers.  It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking everything into account.  In that regard, the needs of the Garda District referred to by the Deputy will be fully considered by the Commissioner within the overall context of the needs of Garda Districts throughout the country.</P>

	<P>The persons concerned applied for asylum in the State on 20th January 2005. Their applications were refused and deportation orders were made in respect of them on 23 November 2005. The applicants <Col N="833"/>instituted judicial review proceedings on 13 January 2006 challenging the decision to make deportation orders in respect of them. The proceedings  were determined on 30 January 2008 when the reliefs sought were refused by the High Court. The applicants were refused a certificate to appeal this decision to the Supreme Court on 13 March 2008.</P>
        <P>The persons in question submitted applications for subsidiary protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 S.I. 518 of the 2006 (&rsquo;the Regulations&rsquo;) on 3 March 2008. These applicants are persons in respect of whom deportation orders were signed before the coming into force of the Regulations on 10 October 2006, and as such are not automatically entitled to apply for Subsidiary Protection under the Regulations.  In situations where an individual does not have an automatic right to apply for subsidiary protection but has identified new facts or circumstances which demonstrate a change of position from that which pertained at the time the deportation orders were made, I may exercise discretion under Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 S.I. No. 518 of 2006 to accept and consider an application for Subsidiary Protection.</P>
        <P>Following consideration of the information submitted by the applicants, it was concluded they have established no grounds to show that there are new or altered circumstances from the time the deportation orders were made. The applicants were informed by letter dated 19 March 2008 that I had decided not to exercise discretion pursuant to Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 &mdash; S.I. 518 of the 2006 to accept and consider applications for subsidiary protection from them. The applicants instituted judicial proceedings on 20 March 2008 challenging that decision. As the matter is sub judice, I do not propose to comment further.</P>

	<P>Following the submission in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, it was decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose. Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics since the third quarter of 2006.</P>
        <P>I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics since 2003 sought by the Deputy directly to him. Statistics for years prior to 2003 are available in the relevant Annual Reports of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas library.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 4 August 2005 and applied for asylum on 11 August 2005. Owing to doubts as to the age of the person concerned at that time, she was initially assessed to be an adult but this position was revised following a review of the case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Health Services Executive. As a result of this review, the person concerned was accepted as being a minor and permitted to re-apply for asylum which she duly did on 19 May 2006. Her asylum application was refused following the consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 5 March 2008, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within <Col N="835"/>15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).  While no response has been received to date, the Deputy might note that the 15 working day period referred to has not yet elapsed.</P>
        <P>The position in the State of the person concerned will be considered further upon receipt of a response to my Department&rsquo;s letter of 5 March 2008.</P>

        <P>The applicants in question submitted an application for subsidiary protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 S.I. No. 518 of 2006 (&rsquo;The Regulations&rsquo;) on 9th January, 2007. They were informed on 19th January, 2007 that their application was invalid as deportation orders had been made in respect of them prior to the coming into force of the Regulations on 10th October, 2006. Judicial review proceedings challenging this decision were instituted on 22nd February, 2007.</P>
        <P>These Judicial Review proceedings were settled following the Judgment of Mr. Justice Feeney in the cases of Hila and Djolo, where he determined that under Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 S.I. No. 518 of 2006 the Minister has discretion to accept and consider applications for subsidiary protection from persons who do not have an automatic right to apply but who have identified new facts or circumstances which demonstrate a change of position from that which pertained at the time the deportation order was made.</P>
        <P>The applicants submitted an application pursuant to Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 S.I. No. 518 of 2006 on 26th November 2007, requesting that I exercise discretion to accept and consider an application for Subsidiary Protection under the Regulation. Following a consideration of the material submitted by the applicants, it was concluded that the applicants had established no grounds which would enable me to exercise discretion under Regulation 4(2).  The applicants were notified of my decision on 14th March 2008.</P>
        <P>The Judicial Review proceedings challenging the validity of the Deportation Orders are still on going and as that  matter is sub judice, I do not propose to comment further.</P>

        <P>Grant aid in respect of 161 playgrounds has been awarded to local authorities by my Department under the 2004, 2005 and 2006 playground schemes. Progress with the completion of these projects is a matter for the individual local authorities and time scales have varied considerably due to a range of planning and procurement issues locally. Consideration of a scheme in 2007 was deferred to allow local authorities to make progress with over 80 outstanding projects.  I expect to make an announcement regarding a new scheme shortly.</P>

        <P>The facility in question is provided for in the Dublin regional waste management plan for which the four Dublin local authorities have statutory responsibility under the Waste Management Acts. Section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act, 1996 precludes the Minister from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance by a local authority of a function conferred on it under the Act.</P>
        <P>In view of the project&rsquo;s status as a prospective public private partnership, my Department was involved in certifying that the procurement was conducted in accordance with public policy on the procurement of infrastructure in this way. The Department by letter dated 14 September 2005 advised Dublin City Council, which acts as lead authority for the project, that having considered the submissions received in respect of the procurement process there was no objection to Dublin City Council proceeding to enter into contractual arrangements with the selected private partner. My Department and the NDFA had representation on the project board established to manage the procurement process. The project board did not have a role in regard to the contractual arrangements subsequently entered into by Dublin City Council. My Department is not a party to this contract and has no further role in the matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government </TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 936, 975 and 976 together.</P>
        <P>Standards for rental accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993, made under section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992. All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations. Failure to do so is an offence, subject, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000, or a term of six months in prison or both and &euro;250 for each day of a continuing offence. Responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by my Department.</P>
        <P>As I have no function in relation to staffing arrangements for inspection purposes, information on the number of inspectors employed by each local authority for this purpose is not available in my Department.</P>
        <P>Details of the numbers of private rented housing registrations and local authority houses let are published in the Annual Housing Statistics Bulletins, which are available in the Oireachtas Library and on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.environ.ie.  Details of the numbers of inspections of private rented accommodation carried out in 2005 and 2006, the number of dwellings inspected which did not meet the statutory standards and the number of prosecutions taken are also included in these publications. Similar information in respect of 2007 is not yet available.</P>
        <P>The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 provides for a registration fee of &euro;70 per tenancy where the tenancy is registered within one month of the commencement of the tenancy and a fee of &euro;140 where the tenancy is registered after this period. The Act also provides for a composite fee of &euro;300 for multiple tenancies in one building, which is not available to late registration of multiple tenancies. &euro;50 of each &euro;70 fee is used to support local authorities in performing their functions in relation to the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993 and the Housing (Rent Books) Regulations 1993 and other provisions of the Housing Acts relating to private rented accommodation.</P>
        <P>The allocation of additional funds from other local authority sources towards inspections is a matter for individual authorities. Information on the average cost of carrying out an inspection is not available in my Department.</P>
        <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 140 of 10 October 2007 in relation to the funding allocated to local authorities in 2004, 2005 and 2006 from the proceeds of tenancy registration fees. Details of the first tranche (&euro;1.5m) of funding in respect of 2007 inspection activity are set out in the following table. The second tranche (&euro;1.5m) of this funding will issue shortly to <Col N="839"/>local authorities based on their inspection outturns. Given that allocations are increasingly linked to inspection performance, where a particular authority&rsquo;s inspection activity is low relative to others, this is reflected in reduced allocations.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 937 and 970 together.  </P>
        <P>My Department is working with Limerick County Council to advance the sewerage schemes approved for Co. Limerick as quickly as possible.  Details of these schemes are set out in my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2007 &mdash; 2009 which is available in the Oireachtas Library.  The most up to date information in relation to the current status of each scheme is available from Limerick County Council as procurement authority.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest> his views on establishing a national standard on the quality and standard of roads and footpaths in urban environment here against which councils should report local performance in the same way as national standards have been set in respect of other aspects of council business </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Responsibility for roads policy, including quality standards for roads and footpaths, is primarily a matter for the Minister for Transport and the National Roads Authority under the aegis of his Department.</P>
        <P>Insofar as my Department is concerned, on 10 February 2008 I published draft planning guidelines on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas for public consultation, together with an accompanying best practice Urban Design Manual which illustrates how these guidelines can be implemented.  These new draft guidelines, which are being issued under section 28 of the Act, are intended to replace the 1999 Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Residential Density, and are focused on creating sustainable communities by incorporating the highest design standards and providing a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of essential infrastructure and services.</P>
        <P>Chapter 3 of the draft guidelines outlines, <i>inter alia</i>, the role of streets in creating the urban fabric and a sense of place, and they highlight that the design of residential streets need to strike the right balance between the different functions of the street.  The balance between the various functions of a street should help to determine appropriate design speeds, road geometry and the level of adjacent development.  I look forward to submissions and comments on these draft guidelines by the closing date of 6 May 2008.</P>
        <P>Since 2004, local authorities have reported on performance in relation to 42 indicators of service, covering all aspects of local authority activity.  One of these indicators relates to the maintenance of local and regional roads, and local authorities supply data annually on this.  The published reports on service indicators, 2004-06, are available in the Oireachtas library.</P>

	<P>The provision of accommodation by approved voluntary and co-operative housing bodies is an integral part of my Department&rsquo;s overall response to delivering on social housing need.  Local authorities and approved housing bodies are working in close co-operation to deliver an expanded range of social housing options and a wide range of accommodation types to meet the needs of low-income families and persons with special housing needs.</P>
        <P>There is no provision at present in the voluntary housing schemes sector for the purchase of individual houses by tenants.  However, the Government&rsquo;s housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, indicated that consideration would be given in consultation with the voluntary and co-operative sector, to piloting a tenant purchase scheme for some new voluntary homes based on the incremental purchase model.  The issues arising in relation to the introduction of such a scheme, including any legislative supports, are being considered in consultation with the Irish Council for Social Housing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 942, 959, 961, 962 and 983 together.</P>
        <P>Protection of conservation sites of European importance is required under the EU Habitats Directive 1992, which was transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997, as well as the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000.  In accordance with the Directive, Ireland has nominated certain raised and blanket bogs, which are priority natural habitats under the Directive, as candidate Special Areas of Conservation (cSACs).   All raised and blanket bog cSACs are listed in the table below.</P>
        <P>In order to protect the designated bogs, the ending of all peat extraction was originally proposed.  However, a derogation period of up to 10 years was allowed from 1999, in respect of domestic turf cutting from 32 raised bogs designated before 1999.  This derogation expires at the end of this year.  A similar 10 year derogation period currently applies to any bog cSACs designated after 1999.</P>
        <P>My Department operates a generous compensation scheme for persons who agree to stop turf cutting in designated raised bogs. This covers both cSACs and Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs).</P>
        <P>At present domestic turf cutting is not prohibited in any blanket bog cSACs or NHAs, although the use of &lsquo;sausage cutting&rsquo; machines is not allowed.  Large-scale peat extraction works may require planning permission, with an associated environmental impact assessment, under the planning code.</P>
        <P>I have no current proposals either to designate any further bogs or to control the harvesting of peat on undesignated bogs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 190 of 27 February 2008.  </P>
        <P>As indicated in that reply, the certification of products is the responsibility of the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI).  When the issue of pyrite arose, and following an intervention from my Department, the NSAI moved quickly to reconvene their Aggregates Panel to give urgent consideration to publication of additional guidance in relation to appropriate protocols for testing underfloor infill material. My Department is represented on this Panel, as is the construction industry.</P>
        <P>Following a public consultation process, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) has now published a new Standard Recommendation, which is a definitive amendment to SR 21 &mdash; Guidance on the use of (Irish Standard) I.S. EN 13242:2002 &mdash; Aggregates for unbound and hydraulically bound materials for use in civil engineering work and road construction, and incorporating amendment 1:2007.  The Standard Recommendation came into effect on 7 December 2007 and the intention is that it will address the quality standards of new homes insofar as problems relating to pyrite are concerned.  It is now my intention urgently to adopt this NSAI Standard Recommendation in the relevant Technical Guidance Document to the Building Regulations.</P>
        <P>The national Building Regulations set out the legal requirements for the construction of houses. The related Technical Guidance Documents (TGD) provide technical guidance on how to comply with the Regulations.  Responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations rests with the builder and the owner of the building.</P>
        <P>Enforcement is a matter for the 37 local Building Control Authorities, which are empowered to carry out inspections and initiate enforcement proceedings, when considered necessary.  I understand that Fingal County Council has been in direct contact with the developers and the quarry concerned in relation to problems encountered following the use of pyrite as an underfloor infill material in certain developments.</P>
        <P>Having consulted the statutory Building Regulations Advisory Body, my Department issued a circular letter, BC 6/2007, to each County Manager and local Building Control Authority, on 16 August 2007, to bring the issue to their notice and to request their co-operation in the enforcement of the relevant requirements. The Circular letter also brought to their attention a notice issued by Fingal County Council on 26 July 2007 on this matter.</P>
        <P>Any problems arising between home owners and their builders are ultimately matters for resolution between the parties concerned &mdash; the homeowner, the relevant developer and the builder&rsquo;s insurer.  Where the construction of a house is the subject of a contract between the client and the builder, enforcement of this contract is a civil matter.</P>

	<P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 518 of 11 March 2008.</P>
        <P>Under section 28 of the Derelict Sites Act 1990 an offender, on summary conviction, is liable to a fine or fines not exceeding &euro;1,250 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or, at the discretion of the court, to both fine(s) and imprisonment.</P>
        <P>On conviction on indictment, an offender is liable to a fine not exceeding &euro;31,750 (together with a fine not exceeding &euro;2,500 per day in the case of a continuing contravention) or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or, at the discretion of the court, to both fine and imprisonment.</P>
        <P>Local authorities have been requested to provide statistical information regarding derelict sites within their functional areas.  Available data on the numbers of derelict sites registered by local authorities at end-2007 are set out in the following table.</P>

These provisions do not apply to a residents association, who, as a third party, may only take a case to the PRTB against a landlord, where the landlord has failed to enforce tenant obligations.</P>
        <P>Standards for rented accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations, 1993.  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations.  Failure to do so is an offence, subject on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000, or a term of six months in prison or both and &euro;250 for each day of a continuing offence.  Responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority supported by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by my Department.</P>

        <P>Retrospection prior to 2008 would not be practical as there are no authenticated CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> data for the majority of the existing fleet.  The CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> values on the Revenue and NVDF systems, in respect of new cars only, have not heretofore been used for any business purpose, have not been collected as the basis for a fiscal charge and, accordingly, have not been authenticated to any degree.

        <P>The clear objective of the new motor tax system is to influence the purchasing decisions of consumers.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 954 to 956, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The development plans of the relevant local authorities provide the primary land use protection policies for the Liffey Valley.  In addition, parts of the Liffey Valley are already covered by special designations.  The area between Chapelizod and Lucan is protected by a Special Area Amenity Order (SAAO), and part of the valley is designated as a proposed Natural Heritage Area.</P>
        <P>As indicated in the reply to Question Nos. 544 and 545 of 4 March 2008, it is an objective of South Dublin County Council&rsquo;s current Development Plan to investigate the feasibility of extending the SAAO to further lands, including part or all of St. Edmundsbury and Woodville lands.  The protection of the Liffey Valley which is a major amenity for the people of Dublin and the extension of the SAAO are objectives which I share.</P>
        <P>The extent and location of the land to be covered by any SAAO would be affected by the measures required to give effect to the recommendation of the Affordable Homes Partnership to use lands at St. Edmundsbury and Woodville for affordable housing.  In that regard, the <Col N="853"/>County Council has progressed a Strategic Environmental Assessment of the Development Plan variation recommendation, on foot of which I understand the matter is currently the subject of further discussions between the Partnership and the landowner concerned.  I understand that these discussions are expected to conclude very shortly.</P>
        <P>In accordance with Part II of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended by the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2002, the making, reviewing and varying of development plans are reserved functions of the elected members of a planning authority.  Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Development Plans were published by my Department in June 2007 to assist planning authorities in carrying out their responsibilities in these regards.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for South Dublin County Council and its elected members in the first instance to consider whether they wish to vary their development plan, having due regard to the proper planning and sustainable development of their area and to Government policy, as appropriate.  As a consultee in respect of all development plans, I make my views known as appropriate through the statutory variation process.</P>

	<P>An accommodation taskforce for students does not come within my Department&rsquo;s remit.  Student accommodation is primarily the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science and the Third Level Colleges.  In so far as tax incentives for the provision of student accommodation are concerned, these are a matter for the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s involvement with student accommodation is limited to its overall responsibility for the regulation of the private rental sector.  Following a meeting with student representatives in October 2007, I am exploring, with my colleague the Minister for Education and Science, the feasibility of carrying out a study with that Department on the availability of student accommodation in the Dublin Region.</P>

	<P>Legislative provision to facilitate arrangements under which a local authority could agree to its clawback charge ranking in second place behind a new or topped-up mortgage charge, thereby facilitating persons in affordable housing wishing to re-mortgage with a private lender, is being considered in the context of the Social Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which is currently being drafted.  I expect that this Bill will be published in the current D&aacute;il session.</P>
        <P>The requirement for a clawback is necessary to ensure there is no short-term profit taking on the resale of houses provided under the various affordable housing schemes at a discount <Col N="854"/>from market value.  There are no plans to rescind the clawback arrangements under the existing schemes.</P>
        <P>The various affordable housing schemes are designed primarily to assist first-time purchasers.  I will continue to monitor the affordable schemes closely to ensure they continue to meet the needs of the target groups for which they are designed.</P>

        <Quest> if he will explain the criteria relating to the designation of coastal locations under the EU Bathing Water Directive 79/160/EEC as bathing areas; his views on designating Tr&aacute; Inis Oirr in the Aran Islands, County Galway under the directive in order that it might be eligible for submission by the local authority as a blue flag beach or green coast award; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The most recent designation of bathing areas by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government under the EU Bathing Water Directive 76/160/EEC was made in 2001.  No designations have been made since that time having regard to proposals then being brought forward by the European Commission for revision of bathing water governance.</P>
        <P>In December 2000 the Commission adopted a formal communication on developing a new bathing water policy and initiated a large-scale consultation of all interested parties.  This led to the publication, in October 2002, of a proposal for the revision of the 1976 Directive (Directive 1976/160/EEC) and ultimately to the adoption in February 2006 of a new Directive (Directive 2006/7/EC) concerning the management of bathing water quality.</P>
        <P>The identification of bathing waters is now a matter for local authorities under the Bathing Water Quality Regulations 2008 (S.I. No. 79 of 2008) which I made recently to transpose into Irish law the EU Bathing Water Directive 2006.  These Regulations establish more stringent water quality standards for protection of the health of bathers, place stronger emphasis on public information and the management of bathing waters, and require increased public participation particularly in relation to the identification of bathing waters.  The Regulations assign to local authorities the duty of annually identifying all bathing waters in relation to the bathing season in that year.  Accordingly, I do not envisage making any further designations of bathing waters under the Quality of Bathing Waters Regulations 1992, which are being superseded by the new Regulations.</P>
        <P>I understand that Galway County Council has recently made an application to An Taisce for a Green Coast Award in relation to Tr&aacute; Inis Oirr.  Beaches with Green Coast Awards are mainly rural beaches.  They are not required to have the same level of infrastructure, facilities and services as Blue Flag beaches and are not required to be designated under the Bathing Water Regulations.  The Green Coast Awards recognize excellent water quality, high environmental standards, good management and community involvement.  I have this year provided additional funding to An Taisce for the purpose of administering the Green Coast Award, and for expanding this programme nationwide, where previously it applied only to eastern and south eastern regions.</P>

        <P>Actions against illegal waste activity are a matter for the local authorities and the Office of Environmental Enforcement (OEE).  I am satisfied that appropriate powers are available to these enforcement authorities.  The OEE&rsquo;s 2005 report, The Nature and Extent of Unauthorised Waste Activity in Ireland, identifies the unauthorised collection and fly-tipping of waste as one of the problem areas in regard to waste management which need to be further tackled.  The report draws attention to the measures already being taken, including the appointment of 120 additional enforcement officers across the local authorities funded by my Department, and the increased enforcement activity generally being led by the Office and the local authorities.  The report also identifies additional actions which would further support the effort to stamp out this socially and environmentally unacceptable practice.  The implementation of these actions is being coordinated by the OEE through its National Enforcement Network.</P>
        <P>Data from the OEE show that in 2006 there were 32,048 inspections of which 21,823 related to illegal dumping (mostly litter and fly-tipping).  There were 26,038 on the spot litter fines issued, and 531 litter prosecutions secured.  There were in excess of 2,186 non-litter waste enforcement notices and 350 non-litter waste related prosecutions.  This represents a very significant quantum of enforcement and has resulted in a substantial reduction in major illegal activity.  In addition, local authorities have since 2004 reported on their performance in relation to 42 indicators of service, covering all aspects of local government activity.  There are specific service indicators on litter prevention and enforcement, and environmental complaints and enforcement.  The indicators are at present being refined for 2008 further to improve the capture and monitoring of data in these areas.  Data collected for 2006 (the most recent available) indicate that some 65,000 environmental complaints were investigated and 9,878 enforcement procedures were taken.</P>

	<P>Under the Building Control Regulations, it is mandatory to obtain a Fire Safety Certificate prior to commencing construction of non-residential buildings, including apartment blocks.  A Fire Safety Certificate certifies that the building, if constructed in accordance with the plans submitted, is in compliance with the requirements of Part B (Fire Safety) of the Building Regulations.  Compliance with the Building Regulations is primarily the responsibility of the <Col N="857"/>builder and the owner of the building.  Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the local Building Control Authorities.  My Department and the City and County Managers Association have adopted a minimum target inspection level of between 12% and 15% of buildings, including dwellings, covered by valid Commencement Notices served on each Building Control Authority.  In the first half of 2007 &mdash; the latest period for which statistics are available &mdash; all 37 Building Control Authorities carried out inspections and 89% of Authorities met the agreed target.  I hope all Authorities will have achieved this target by the end of the year.  As enforcement of the building code is a matter for the Building Control Authorities and enforcement of the Planning Acts is a matter for the Planning Authorities, I have not issued any requests for random checks to be carried out specifically on private rented accommodation.</P>

	<P>Standards for rental accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993, made under section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992.  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations.  Failure to do so is an offence, subject, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000, or a term of six months in prison or both and &euro;250 for each day of a continuing offence.  Responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by my Department.  The Regulations are being reviewed with a view to updating them as part of an Action Programme to promote improvement in standards of rental accommodation.  The introduction of requirements in relation to smoke alarms is being considered as part of this review.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 971 and 1012 together.</P>
        <P>I have received the correspondence referred to in the question and a reply will issue shortly from my office to the correspondent.  In the reply to Question No. 679 of 19 February 2008, which related to previous correspondence, I set out the position in regard to waste water treatment systems under the national building regulations.  Part H of the Building Regulations (Drainage and Waste Water Disposal) sets out the requirements for the treatment of effluent from waste water systems.  The relevant Technical Guidance Document H provides guidance on how to comply with the requirements of Part H and calls up, <i>inter alia</i>, Irish Standard Recommendation SR:6 of 1991 &mdash; Recommendations for Domestic Effluent Treatment and Disposal from a Single Dwelling House, issued by the National Standards Authority of Ireland.  Technical Guidance Document H also acknowledges that waste water treatment systems other than septic tanks may be used.  Such systems are accepted as satisfactory if it can be shown they are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are used.  Part D of the Building Regulations (Materials and Workmanship) specifies alternative ways of proving compliance, including compliance with appropriate product standards or being subject to certification by an appropriate national certification body.</P>
        <P>The Irish Agreement Board is the national and European recognised body for certifying new building products or systems for which national standards do not exist.  The board is an independent body which operates under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  A new European Standard (EN 12566-3) for small waste water treatment plants has been introduced and is now in the transitional phase of implementation.  The need for new systems to comply with this standard was brought to the attention of Local Authorities in my Department&rsquo;s Circular Letters BC16/2006 and BC 2/2008, dated 8 November 2006 and 28 January 2008 respectively.  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is finalising a revised edition of its Manual on Waste Water Treatment Systems serving Single Houses in consultation with all interested parties.  It is understood that the EPA Manual will refer to relevant European Standards and that the National Standards Authority of Ireland proposes to withdraw SR6: 1991, in favour of the proposed new edition of the EPA Manual, when available.  My Department plans to amend Technical Guidance Document H to call up the EPA Manual and to consider any related issues at that time.</P>

	<P>As Minister, I am precluded under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 from exercising any power or control in relation to any individual planning application or appeal with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be concerned.  However, in the <Col N="859"/>event that an application is received in respect of the project referred to, the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 requires the Board to notify Dublin City Council, as the planning authority within whose area the proposed project would be situated, that an application for strategic infrastructure development has been received.  The Act requires the Manager of the relevant planning authority to prepare a report on the likely effects of the proposed development on the proper planning and sustainable development of the area.  The views of the elected members of the planning authority must also be sought and attached to the Manager&rsquo;s report. In making a determination on such an application, the Board is required to consider this report.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that the Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish a Dublin Bay Area Task Force to maximise the potential of the Bay for the people of the capital city.  The terms of reference of the Dublin Bay Task Force will encompass a broad range of environmental, economic, social and heritage issues and should build on and take account of the work undertaken by Dublin City Council and relevant stakeholders in relation to Dublin Bay.  Any relevant decisions of An Bord Plean&aacute;la in relation to Dublin Bay will be taken into account by the Task Force in due course.  The Government commitment in the National Development Plan 2007-2013 to undertake a comprehensive study of the role of Dublin Port &ldquo;in the context of overall ports policy on the island of Ireland, wider transport policy, urban development policy, the National Spatial Strategy and national economic policy&rdquo;, which will be led by the Department of Transport, is also relevant in this regard.  The advertisement for the appointment of consultants to undertake the study was issued on 14 March 2008.</P>

	<P>I have significantly increased the budgetary allocations in respect of the work undertaken by my Department&rsquo;s national parks and wildlife service (NPWS) including work in relation to the Birds Directive and the Habitats Directive.  The 2008 allocation for the service is &euro;46.66 million, an increase of 31% on last year&rsquo;s allocation and this provision compares with &euro;16.81 million in 2001.  The NPWS discharges its obligations under the Habitats and Birds Directives in a wide variety of ways including work carried out directly by Department staff, outsourcing of work especially scientific and survey measures, purchase of land and turbary rights and agreements with landowners which protect habitats and species.  Over 300 permanent staff and up to 70 seasonal staff are normally deployed to carry out NPWS responsibilities including designation <Col N="860"/>and protection work required by the Habitats and Birds Directives.  At present the obligations which arise in relation to implementation of the two Directives are priorities in the work of NPWS.  We have made significant progress on the implementation of the Directives.  The designations for the Habitats Directive are largely complete, with 423 candidate Special Areas of Conservation transmitted to the European Commission last year.  A small number of marine sites remain to be designated.  Following the ruling by the European Court of Justice in December 2007 in relation to Ireland&rsquo;s compliance with the Birds Directive, some additional areas will be required to be designated as Special Protection Areas for certain species of birds.  A programme of designation is being developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders and the Commission.</P>

	<P>Under the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2006, any person or body is entitled to participate in the planning process; the process provides for third party participation at all stages i.e. forward planning, development management, and appeal stages.  Ireland is one of the few EU Member States to have a third party appeal system. </P>
        <P>With regard to planning applications for strategic infrastructure developments, there is also a provision for pre-application consultation with the public under Section 37B(1) of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006.  This provides for mandatory pre-application consultation between a prospective applicant and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  In this regard, regulations made under the act give the Board powers to require a prospective applicant to undertake a full public pre-application consultation.  In practical terms this enables the Board, under article 210 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2006, to oblige a prospective applicant to do one or more of the following in advance of making an application proper: erect site notices; provide a specific place or a specific website to make available the application, environmental impact statement and any other relevant documentation for inspection or purchase at a fee not exceeding the reasonable cost of making a copy; use national or local media; and hold public meetings.</P>
        <P>In relation to the specific issue raised in the question the Planning and Development Acts provide that representative groups can make third party submissions and appeals on applications for development.</P>
        <P>I do not think it would be either appropriate or practical for pre-application consultations to become a mandatory requirement for all prospective developments.  The provisions in relation to pre-application consultations between planning authorities and prospective applicants already contained in Section 247 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, combined with the very extensive public notification and participation provisions set out under planning legislation provide a robust framework for addressing the concerns raised.  There is nothing preventing discussions between a planning authority and representative groups at a pre-planning stage.  I have no proposals, therefore, to amend the existing legislation.</P>

	<P>Under Section 126 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, An Bord Plean&aacute;la has a statutory objective to determine appeals within 18 weeks.  Where the Board does not consider it possible or appropriate to reach a decision within 18 weeks (e.g. because of delays arising from the holding of an oral hearing), it will inform the parties of the reasons for this, and will indicate when it intends to make the decision. </P>
        <P>Record levels of case intake over successive years 2004 &mdash; 2006 and the assumption of significant new functions under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 challenged An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s ability to achieve its statutory objective. According to the Board&rsquo;s annual report for 2006, the 18-week statutory objective was met in 52% of all cases, compared to 78% in 2005.</P>
        <P>However, in recognition of the key role the Board plays in relation to delivery of local and national infrastructure and of the demands arising from sustained record levels of appeals over recent years, sanction was given in 2007 for an additional 35.5 permanent staff, bringing the total complement to 172.  As a result, I expect to see a significant improvement in the Board&rsquo;s performance levels in relation to its statutory objective targets during 2008.</P>

	<P Just="Left">My Department has improved, and continues to improve, the national Building Regulations in respect of buildings, including hotels.  The Building Regulations (Amendment) Regulations 2005 introduced energy performance standards so as to limit the amount of energy required for the operation of a building and the quantity of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions associated with such use insofar as is reasonably practicable.</P>
        <P>The Regulations require that these targets be met by:</P>
<P el="5">(a) <Miles com="ix" />limiting the heat loss and, where appropriate, maximising the heat gains through the fabric of the building;</P>
<P el="5">(b) <Miles com="ix" />providing energy efficient space and water heating services, including adequate control of these services;</P>
<P el="5">(c) <Miles com="ix" />ensuring that the building is appropriately designed to limit the need for cooling and, where air-conditioning or mechanical ventilation is installed, that installed systems are energy efficient, appropriately sized and adequately controlled;</P>
<P el="5">(d) <Miles com="ix" />limiting the heat loss from pipes, ducts and vessels used for the transport or storage of heated water or air;</P>
<P el="5">(e) <Miles com="ix" />limiting the heat gains by chilled water and refrigerant vessels, and by pipes and ducts that serve air conditioning systems; and</P>
<P el="5">(f) <Miles com="ix" />providing energy efficient artificial lighting systems (other than emergency lighting, display lighting or specialist process lighting) and adequate control of these systems.</P>
<P el="5" FLI="0">The European Communities (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2006 also introduced a number of provisions in relation to new buildings.</P>
        <P>The Regulations require the designers of large buildings, including hotels, with a total useful floor area of more than 1000 m<?oasys _cf7- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>, to consider, during the design stage, the economic, environmental and technical feasibility of installing alternative/renewable energy systems, including combined heat and power (CHP), district or block heating, if available, and heat pumps. This requirement has applied to large buildings for which planning permission is applied on or after 1 January 2007.</P>
        <P>The Regulations also require, subject to certain transitional arrangements, the Building Energy Rating of new non-domestic buildings commencing on or after 1 July 2008 and existing buildings, when let or sold, on or after 1 January 2009. Further Building Regulations will introduce a methodology for this purpose with effect from 1 July next. I will also be very shortly introducing an amendment to Part G (Hygiene) of the Building Regulations to provide for greater efficiency in the use of water by the mandatory installation of dual flush toilets both in new buildings and in existing buildings where WCs are being replaced.</P>
        <P>Finally, I propose to prioritise work through the statutory Building Regulations Advisory Body to establish realisable targets for reductions in primary energy and CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions for non-domestic buildings, with a view to setting new standards in 2010.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 993 to 996, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The WEEE Monitoring Group, which is made up of representatives from the relevant industry and public sector stakeholders, oversees the implementation and operation of the WEEE Directive in Ireland. Following the successful implementation of the scheme in Ireland, which has been yielding very high take-back rates, the Group is now prioritising the development of guidance on the reuse of collected WEEE products having regard to the waste hierarchy, sustainable environmental best practice and/or health and safety requirements.  The Department has also had meetings with a wider group of stakeholders engaged in reuse of WEEE.</P>
        <P>The WEEE Directive, while setting out technical requirements for storage and treatment of WEEE, does not lay down technical standards for reuse of appliances.  The proposed protocol on reuse will include requirements to meet quality control standards and to comply with relevant legislation concerning the placing of electrical and electronic equipment on the market such as the Safe Products Directive, the Low Voltage Directive, the Directive on Electromagnetic Compatibility, and the Directive on the Restriction of Certain Hazardous Substances Contained in Electrical and Electronic Equipment.  It is envisaged that this process will be completed in 2008 and will form the basis of statutory guidance in the matter as provided for in Article 41 of the Waste Management (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) Regulations 2005.</P>
        <P>My Department has no enforcement role in regard to the WEEE Regulations; this responsibility rests with the Environmental Protection Agency and local authorities.</P>
        <P>The WEEE Directive also allows producers to display Environmental Management Costs (EMCs) which are included in the price of various products to fund the recovery and recycling of historic WEEE which was put on the market before 13 August 2005. These EMCs are approved by the industry-based WEEE Register Society Limited which has an independent Committee of Management.</P>
        <P>This body is monitoring implementation of the scheme and has adjusted the EMCs periodically to ensure that the not-for-profit principle is observed and that the EMCs only cover the costs incurred in the environmentally sound management of WEEE. The EMCs are not <Col N="867"/>imposed by or remitted to the Government; they are remitted by producers to the two approved collective compliance schemes operating in Ireland, WEEE Ireland and ERP.  A percentage is also remitted to retailers to cover their costs.  This, however, is a matter between producers and retailers and my Department has no function in that regard.  The retail price must be inclusive of the EMC which is an input cost in the same way as material, labour and transport. It is an offence for a retailer to add an EMC to the price quoted.</P>
        <P>The WEEE Register is currently carrying out a comprehensive review of EMCs and it is expected that this will be completed in the first half of 2008.  A full list of EMCs can be obtained from the WEEE register at www.weeeregister.ie</P>
        <P>The value of a product, whether new or refurbished, is a matter for the market.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the environmentally sound management of household WEEE from designated collection points onwards rests with the producer compliance schemes. The overall scheme has been operating very successfully and a collection rate of 7.4 kg/inhabitant was achieved in 2006, well in excess of the 4 kg/inhabitant that must be achieved by end 2008 in accordance with the Directive.</P>

	<P>In the course of an Additional Reasoned Opinion received in June 2007 the European Commission expressed its view that under the requirements of the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive a new environmental impact assessment (EIA) should have been carried out before a decision was taken on how to proceed in relation to the newly discovered National Monument at Lismullin, County Meath, on the route of the M3 motorway.</P>
        <P>On 31 August 2007, the Irish authorities responded in detail to the concerns raised by the Commission in respect of the National Monument at Lismullin, stating, in the course of that response, that they considered that the provisions of EU and Irish Law were fully complied with in this case and that they are supported in that view by legal advice from the Attorney General as well as judgements from the High and Supreme Courts.</P>
        <P>In a press release dated 17 October 2007, the European Commission stated that it had decided to refer Ireland to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in a case concerning European Community (EC) legislation on environmental impact assessments and, inter alia, provisions of Irish legislation governing the removal of important archaeological sites. To date the Irish authorities have received no notification from the Court of any such referral.</P>

	<P>The provision of accommodation by approved voluntary and co-operative housing bodies is an integral part of my Department&rsquo;s overall response to delivering on social housing need.  Funding of up to 100% of the approved cost is available for the provision of permanent accommodation for low-income families and groups with special housing needs, including the elderly, the homeless and persons with an intellectual or physical disability.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s involvement with the voluntary and co-operative housing schemes relates primarily to the provision of funds for individual projects. The administration of the schemes and the certification that particular projects comply with the terms of the funding schemes, are the responsibility of the local authority.</P>
        <P>In the interest of adopting a more integrated approach to meeting housing needs in individual local authority areas, my Department is moving towards a system of allocating the funding available under the Capital Loan and Subsidy Scheme on a local authority basis. These allocations are additional to, and will remain separate from, allocations made to local authorities for their own social housing programmes and will be devoted solely to voluntary and co-operative housing activity within individual local authority areas.</P>
        <P>Overall, this year, my Department is providing a record &euro;290 million for the voluntary and co-operative housing sector. The entire allocation is ring-fenced for projects being advanced by approved housing bodies and I have no proposals to change this arrangement.</P>

	<P>The facility in question is provided for in the Dublin regional waste management plan for which <Col N="869"/>the four Dublin local authorities have statutory responsibility under the Waste Management Acts. Section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act, 1996 precludes the Minister from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance by a local authority of a function conferred on it under the Act. </P>
        <P>In view of the project&rsquo;s status as a prospective public private partnership, my Department was involved in certifying that the procurement was conducted in accordance with public policy on the procurement of infrastructure in this way. The Department by letter dated 14 September 2005 advised Dublin City Council, which acts as lead authority for the project, that having considered the submissions received in respect of the procurement process there was no objection to Dublin City Council proceeding to enter into contractual arrangements with the selected private partner. My Department is not a party to this contract and has no further role in the matter.</P>
        <P>However, in 2007 my Department was advised that the selected private partner, Elsam, had been subsumed by Danish Oil and Natural Gas (DONG) leading to a corporate restructuring which has also involved extending the partnership to include Covanta, a US firm. In light of the corporate restructuring the project board, which in accordance with normal practice and procurement policy oversaw the procurement process, was reconvened.</P>
        <P>The board included representatives from the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) and my Department. Following technical and legal examinations by the consultants acting for Dublin City Council as a Client&rsquo;s Representative, a standard feature of PPP projects, a meeting of the board was held on 14 May 2007.  On the basis of the advices available to it the board concluded that the proposed revised arrangements to reflect the restructuring on the side of the private partner were not materially different from those which were originally envisaged and are the product of the procurement process which the NDFA and my Department validated. My Department noted and concurred with this decision and consequently the need for any further certification did not arise.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1002 and 1003 together.</P>
        <P>The facility in question is provided for in the Dublin regional waste management plan for which the four Dublin local authorities have statutory responsibility under the Waste Management Acts. Section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act, 1996 precludes the Minister from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance by a local authority of a function conferred on it.</P>
        <P>In view of the project&rsquo;s status as a prospective public private partnership, my Department was involved in certifying that the procurement was conducted in accordance with public policy on the procurement of infrastructure in this way. The Department by letter dated 14 September 2005 advised Dublin City Council, which acts as lead authority for the project, that having considered the submissions received in respect of the procurement process there was no objection to Dublin City Council proceeding to enter into contractual arrangements with the selected private partner. My Department and the National Development Finance Agency had representation on the project board established to manage the procurement process. The project board did not have a role in regard to the contractual arrangements subsequently entered into by Dublin City Council. My Department is not a party to this contract and has no further role in the matter.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance in his response, in April 2007, to the recommendations in the Committee of Public Accounts report took the view that this recommendation would need to be considered by the relevant sponsoring agency on a case by case basis, having regard to protecting the State&rsquo;s negotiating position and the statutory, civil and legal rights of contracting parties. He also noted that all of the PPP documentation and analyses are available to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
        <P>In the case of this project Dublin City Council is the relevant sponsoring agency, and the Council has not made any proposal to my Department to release the Public Sector Benchmark.  My Department is aware that independent statutory processes are still in progress in regard to the project, and any issues which arise in that context with implications for the contract are a matter for Dublin City Council.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1014 and 1015 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland has long been concerned about the threat posed by the nuclear site at Sellafield.  Our concerns in relation to the site have been consistently articulated to the UK Government at political, diplomatic and official levels.</P>
        <P>In 2001, in response to the imminent commissioning of the MOX plant at the site, Ireland instituted legal proceedings against the UK under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).   Pending the hearing of the case, Ireland applied for and received a <Col N="873"/>Provisional Measures Order, which ordered a review by Ireland and the UK of the mechanisms for inter-governmental notification and co-operation.  Arising from this, a series of co-operative measures was developed, agreed and put in place.</P>
        <P>These measures are valuable from Ireland&rsquo;s viewpoint, are working well and represent distinct real added value to the necessary co-operative relationship between the two countries.  The Bi-Lateral Agreement on Early Notification of a Nuclear Incident, direct access to the UK Radiation Monitoring System (RIMNET), access for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to Sellafield, access for the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) to Sellafield and other facilities, significantly improved information exchanges, co-operation on emergency planning with the UK, and improved and ongoing contacts at regulator and official level on nuclear issues, all provide objective evidence of real improvements.</P>
        <P>In relation to the recent leak at Sellafield the relevant UK agencies have advised the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) that, on 19 March 2008, around 30,000 litres of low level liquid waste spilled from a holding tank in the Sellafield Effluent Treatment Plant (SETP) into the surrounding concrete compartment. Some liquid seeped into an access corridor.</P>
        <P>The UK Environment Agency has advised the RPII that the indications are that there was no environmental impact and no additional discharges to the environment as a result of the event.   Accordingly no implications arise for Ireland.  I have been advised also that the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate and the Environment Agency will conduct a joint investigation into the matter shortly in accordance with normal practice.   However, the incident is further confirmation that the concerns we hold in relation to the site are legitimate and we will continue to press for higher standards and adherence to best international practice in relation to the orderly operation of the site.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to pursue all political, diplomatic and, where necessary, legal options to secure the safe and orderly decommissioning of the Sellafield facility.  I consider that the ongoing discussions between the two administrations in relation to Sellafield have resulted in increased recognition by the UK Government of the depth of Ireland&rsquo;s concern about Sellafield and of the priority accorded to the issue by the Irish Government.</P>
        <P>Ireland has supported and will continue to support efforts by the European Commission to develop an increased safety role within the European Nuclear Industry.  Adoption of recent European Council Conclusions in regard to the establishment of the EU High Level Regulators Group is a significant development in the area of nuclear safety.  In Ireland&rsquo;s view, the transboundary risks and impacts arising from nuclear installations must be fully reflected in the instruments, structures and institutions of the EU.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1020 and 1021 together.</P>
        <P>The House of Tomorrow programme opened in 2001 and by July 2007 had committed grants to housing developments comprising around 6,000 units.  The programme closed for applications in June 2007, arising from a Government commitment to revise Part L of the Building Regulations, to require energy and CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> performance levels in new homes similar to those which had been demonstrated through the House of Tomorrow programme as being achievable, or a strengthening by some 40% relative to the current regulations.</P>
        <P>The proposed revisions to the regulations, complete with these new performance requirements, were published in September for consultation by the Department of the Environment Heritage and Local Government, with a view to becoming mandatory over the period 2008-09.</P>
        <P>In that context, it was decided not to continue to grant aid new projects in respect of standards that are imminently to become mandatory.</P>
        <P>The significant interest in the House of Tomorrow programme in the period prior to the closure meant that there was a very large number of grant applications still in process which constituted a significant level of oversubscription.  The September announcement by the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, also affirmed a commitment to review the regulations in 2010 to 60% above current levels, with the ultimate aim of achieving a zero carbon standard for new houses in the medium to long term.  On this basis, the project applications in hand were subject to detailed review to establish whether, on the basis of possible achievement of such a 60% performance level, support could be warranted.</P>
        <P>Any applicant who did not qualify for funding under the scheme would have received a letter from Sustainable Energy Ireland outlining the reasons for the decision.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1023 to 1041, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  I have no function in the matter of the enabling of exchanges owned by private companies.  However, it is hoped that the facilitation of greater competition in the sector via the introduction of broadband from different technology platforms, will encourage more rapid enabling of all exchanges for broadband.</P>

Phase II of the scheme <Col N="878"/>was opened on 1 October 2007 with assistance still provided under the above mentioned headings.</P>
        <P>The objective in Greener Homes Phase II is to consolidate the market, underpinning it with quality standards and training and providing for a long-term future that is not grant dependent.  The aim is to ensure that the market for these products, services and fuels continues to develop strongly in a robust manner and that consumers continue to be guided towards discerning choices.  Continuing the scheme is helping secure a range of objectives including more competitive offerings, revised product standards, improved training standards and stable growth across the renewable heating industry.</P>
        <P>The Greener Homes Scheme will continue to be kept under review and will continue to evolve in light of the maturing technologies and market developments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the primary motivation in aligning the future management of the wild salmon fishery with the scientific advice and the introduction of the appropriate regulations to cease mixed stock fishing is the conservation of the wild salmon stocks.  It is vital to afford every protection to the remaining salmon stocks and to clearly prioritise conservation over catch.  We must fulfil our obligations under the Habitats Directive, namely to maintain or restore fish stocks to favourable conservation status.</P>
        <P>There is no question of relaxing the conservation measures other than in rivers where stocks recover and it is established from the results of the Genetic Stock Identification project that significant numbers of fish destined for other rivers are not intercepted.  It is not envisaged, however, that drift netting in the open seas will be licensed in the future due to the constraints of the Habitats Directive.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the impact of the cessation of the seasonal wild salmon fishery on island communities and this is reflected in the allocation of funds being made available through Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann in their administration of the Community Support Scheme funded from the Salmon Hardship Fund.  This scheme is specifically directed at the development of additional economic opportunities where commercial salmon fishing has been a well-<Col N="880"/>established activity and where its withdrawal demonstrably impacts on the economic and social fabric of the communities.</P>

	<P>In January last, I announced a major initiative to support the development of ocean energy technologies in Ireland.  The programme includes a budget for 2008 of &euro;2 million to support the development of a full-scale wave energy grid connected test facility at Annagh/French Point County Mayo.  The development of this facility will be overseen by the new ocean energy development unit, which is being located in Sustainable Energy Ireland.</P>

	<P>Capital grants are not available for the construction and operation of micro-scale wind-turbines in domestic and residential settings.  I am firmly committed to the accelerated development of micro-generation, in line with the Programme for Government and the Energy Policy White Paper, underpinned by appropriate cost efficient support measures.</P>
        <P>A successful micro-generation support programme requires a soundly based operational and regulatory environment.  At my request, Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) is working in conjunction with the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) to deliver this environment with the objective of establishing an appropriate micro generation support programme in the coming weeks.</P>

	<P>Details of car parking spaces assigned or available to my Department, which has a staff complement exceeding 300 people are as follows:</P>
        <P>There are 65 car parking spaces available at my Department&rsquo;s HQ building on Adelaide Road, Dublin 2.</P>
        <P>There are 55 spaces shared between my Department and Labour Court/Labour Relations Commission staff at Tom Johnson House, Beggars Bush, Haddington Road Dublin 4.  There are 19 official Geological Survey of Ireland vehicles using these spaces also.</P>
        <P>The Department shares a building at Leeson Lane, Dublin 2, with the Department of Transport, the Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Food and the Office of the Comptroller and <Col N="881"/>Auditor General.  The Department of Transport is the main tenant at that location.  There are 42 parking spaces under the building with an additional five on the surface.  The spaces are shared between the staff of each Department and none of these spaces is specifically assigned to my Department.  There are 22 parking spaces at Elm House in Cavan.</P>
        <P>All of the buildings are State owned or leased through the Office of Public Works (OPW).  Any costs associated with car parking facilities, whether State owned or incorporated into lease agreements, as is the case in Adelaide Road and in Cavan, is a matter of the OPW.</P>
        <P>The issue of accommodation, including car parking arrangements, for State agencies is a day to day operational matter for the agencies themselves and one in which I have no function.</P>

        <Quest> the date for commencement of the national broadband scheme; the qualifying criteria and application process for areas currently not served by broadband; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of broadband services is, in the first instance, a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).</P>
        <P>Although broadband is now widely available in Ireland there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  These areas are being addressed by the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), which will provide broadband services to areas that are currently not served and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband are met.</P>
        <P>A complex mapping exercise was undertaken in order to identify all areas where broadband services are and are not available.  My Department and ComReg contacted service providers and requested details of their current and planned broadband coverage.  The decision with respect to areas that are not currently served but are expected to be served in the near future will be made in July 2008.  Any area not served by 1 July 2008, will fall under the scope of the NBS.</P>
        <P>The first phase of the NBS procurement process (Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ)) is now complete, and four candidates pre-qualified to enter the next phase of the procurement process.  Following the withdrawal of the IFA/Motorola Consortium as a candidate the remaining three candidates have now commenced &ldquo;Competitive Dialogue&rdquo; with my Department and are developing their proposed solutions to meet my Department&rsquo;s requirements for the delivery of broadband to the areas of the country not served.  It is anticipated that a preferred bidder will be selected and appointed in June 2008, with rollout to commence as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

	<P>A helicopter was used on 20th December 2007 to view the site of works on the East West interconnector.  The location visited was the site of the marine seabed survey in the Irish Sea.</P>
        <P>The helicopter carried an official from EirGrid, a photographer, my Press Advisor and me.</P>
        <P>The procurement of the helicopter for this occasion was dealt with by EirGrid, a commercial agency under the aegis of my Department.  The supplier, cost, and the question of quotations and distance travelled would be a day-to-day operational matter for that agency and I have no function in that regard.</P>
