      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by Córas Iompair Éireann that the number of passengers travelling by the evening trains to Sydney Parade and certain other stations on the Westland RowBray line have recently been very small.  In present circumstances when the operating speeds are comparatively low, due to fuel difficulties, the stops have involved delays to the longer distance passengers who have not frequent alternative tram and bus services.</P>
      <P>I understand that following consideration of representations made to them by the users of these services the company have decided to restore the stops at Sydney Parade and Salthill on the 10.53 p.m. train from Amiens Street.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in the compilation of the official itemised estimates of outlay for the new Family Budget Inquiry, Church dues will be included; and if so, if he will state how the amount of such contributions will be ascertained, and how the publication of such estimates is justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of a family budget inquiry is to ascertain the values (and, where applicable, the quantities) of the objects of family expenditure, in full detail in the first instance.  The particulars will be ascertained by means of a printed family budget inquiry form on which the various items of expenditure will be distinguished. While the scheme of inquiry has not yet been worked out in detail, it may be stated that a large number of householders throughout the country, selected at random, will be asked to fill up the form for certain specified weeks during the period of inquiry.  It would not be practicable, or desirable on statistical grounds, to publish the values of items of expenditure in full detail, so that, in many cases, the values of cognate items will be grouped under general headings, for instance, Church dues will be included in some general description which will also cover such matters as contributions to charity, etcetera.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, the Minister for Industry and Commerce indicated last week that it was intended to have Church dues included in the statistics.  I think the inclusion of such dues would cause very grave concern to most people who are interested in religious liberty in this <Col N="296" /> country.  If, however, the proposal is to include Church dues under the heading of charity, it might not be open to such a serious objection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that the price of bacon pigs has been steadily falling, for the past five weeks; that the present high prices of feeding stuffs operate as a hindrance to pig production; and if he will stabilise the price of feeding stuffs in relation to the prices obtainable for pigs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there has been a seasonal decline in the price of pigs.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's suggestion that the price of feeding stuffs should be related to the market price of pigs is not considered to be practicable.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that five weeks ago bacon pigs were making £7 5s. per cwt live-weight and that to-day they are only making £6 16s.?  The pig producers are still paying 31/- per cwt. for pig meals. Surely, if you want them to produce more pigs they will not continue to do that at a big loss, because pigs cannot be fed at the present price of feeding stuffs.  If you want to increase the production of pigs, you will have either to raise the prices of pigs or reduce the price of feeding stuffs.</P>

Following subsequent consultation between the Dublin County Commissioner and the Dublin Corporation, it has been decided that the improvement of the property can best be secured by having it taken over by the Dublin County Council as a housing area.  Agreement has been reached as to the precise property which will be transferred and my consent to the transfer has been given. The Dublin County Commissioner is having some modifications effected in the plans already prepared for the installation of sanitary accommodation in these cottages, and expects to be in a position to put the work in hands when the property is transferred to the county council which I understand will be in about a month's time.</P>

When reasonable progress has been made with the groups of cottages mentioned, it is intended to formulate a scheme for the provision of rural cottages which according to the 1943 survey are needed to the number of 620.  The rural housing scheme will include suitable provision for the north-west part of the county.  The carrying out of the schemes will depend on securing tenders at reasonable prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether his attention has been called to a statement in which it is alleged that, at the annual meeting of St. Peter's Fianna Fáil Cummann, <Col N="305" /> Drogheda, he stated that, if the situation improved, there might be a reduction of the tax on stout and tobacco; whether this statement is an accurate report of his speech; whether it represents Government policy; and whether he is prepared to indicate when proposals will be introduced for the purpose of giving effect to this policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the account of the meeting of St. Peter's Fianna Fáil Cumann, Drogheda, held on Sunday the 16th ultimo, which contained the words quoted by the Deputy that I said: &ldquo;If the situation improved there might be a reduction of the taxes on stout and tobacco.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My remarks were much fuller and more satisfactory to an audience concerned with the economic situation than the forecasting of a possible reduction of taxation in unspecified circumstances in the unknown future. A full and accurate account of what I said on that occasion in Drogheda, and on many other occasions in public and private from the introduction of the Supplementary Budget until it became law, would include at least the following points: That the Government introduced the Supplementary Budget in order to meet the increased subsidies out of taxation, because any attempt to meet them by increasing the national debt or inflating the currency would be disastrous, particularly to the poorer sections of the community; that no change could or would be made in the Budget proposals regarding the increased taxation on tobacco, beer, spirits, wines, cigarettes, entertainments, incometax, etc.; that any alteration in the rates of taxation in a future Budget would depend upon the conditions at the time of its preparation; that the lowering of the general rates of taxation in future Budgets would depend upon an increase in national production which would have the effect of increasing revenue yields and of decreasing prices and lowering the cost of subsidies, which at present rates would amount to £15,000,000 in a full year; and that those who pretended that the easy cure-all for shortages of goods was a coalition of groups with <Col N="306" /> divergent views upon everything, except, perhaps, inflating the currency, were attempting to lead the people towards the chaos and disaster that followed like movements in other countries.</P>
    <P>The answer to the last part of the Deputy's question is that my remarks in Drogheda do not in any way lend substance to the charge made by his colleague in another place that he was &ldquo;assured&rdquo; that I had given &ldquo;an assurance&rdquo; at the meeting in question that the duty on beer &ldquo;is coming off&rdquo; and again &ldquo;that the duty on beer and spirits was to be reduced&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he received representations that the capitation grant payable to the Monastery Schools, Ferrybank, Clonmel, and similar schools at Upton and elsewhere is inadequate; whether he will state the date on which the present sum was originally fixed; whether he has taken any action to secure an increased grant, reasonably adequate to the needs of these schools; whether he is aware that, because of the inadequacy of the capitation grant, tradesmen employed by the Clonmel School are paid £2 a week and upwards less than the local town rate, and that the school authorities are unable to pay those men a better wage because the payments made to them by his Department do not permit them to do so; and whether he is now in a position to state when the capitation grant will be suitably increased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that this question refers only to those monastery schools which are certified industrial schools.  The present combined capitation grant paid to these schools by the State and the responsible local authorities is at the rate of 15/- per week; this rate was brought into operation as from 1st October, 1942.  An additional capitation grant at the rate of 1/- per week to defray the expense of building repairs and equipment was introduced as from 1st October, 1946, but owing to the conditions attached thereto this <Col N="307" /> grant has not been availed of by a few schools, including the two mentioned in the question.</P>
      <P>Arrangements have also been made under which my Department has accepted responsibility for the payment of the salaries of the ordinary teachers (as distinct from trades' teachers) employed in these schools. Prior to 1st April, 1941, the managers of the schools had to pay these salaries; between that date and 1st April, 1946, part of the cost was refunded by the Department and since the latter date these teachers are paid by the Department on the same basis as teachers in national schools.</P>
      <P>Representations were made to me by the Association of Resident Managers of Reformatory and Industrial Schools that the present incomes were not sufficient to defray the increasing cost of maintaining the schools, and asking that the grant should be increased.  In order that their claim might be properly considered the manager of each school (there are 55 of them) was asked to furnish a return of receipts and expenses for the year ended on 31st March last.  These returns have been received and examined in my Department, and while they reveal a considerable difference in the expenses of comparable schools they have satisfied me that an increase in the present rate of grant is desirable.  I have arranged, therefore, to increase grants payable both by the State and the local authorities, and an early announcement will be made to the managers on the subject.  The increase in the State grant will apply as from 1st January next, and in the local authorities' grant as from 1st April next.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to confirm or deny the reference in the question to the wages of tradesmen employed at the school mentioned, and I suggest that this is a matter for arrangement with those directly concerned.</P>

Why does he date the giving of additional financial assistance as the 1st January next year for State grants and the 1st April next year for local grants?

      <P>I understand that herrings are shoaling fairly heavily off the coasts of Donegal and other counties and that relatively good landings are being made.  I am not aware that any special difficulty is being experienced in disposing of the Donegal catches. The processing of herrings, whether by pickling, kippering or canning, is a matter for private enterprise.  According to my information, salt is available for curing but there is a shortage of fish barrels, mainly due to the difficulty of procuring material for hoop making. There are several kippering plants in Dublin and other parts of the country and all of them appear to be working to full capacity at present.  The position as regards the canning of herrings is that at least one factory is ready to start production as soon as the cans now on order have been delivered.</P>

      <P>Go ndaingneofar Scéim Aoisliúntas na Múinteoirí Scoile Náisiúnta (Leasú), 1947, a rinne an tAire Oideachais le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais faoi Acht Aoisliúntais na Múinteoirí, 1928 (Uimh. 32 de 1928).</P>
      <P>That the National School Teachers' Superannuation (A m e n d m e n t) Scheme, 1947, made by the Minister for Education with the consent of the Minister for Finance under the Teachers' Superannuation Act, 1928 (No. 32 of 1928), be confirmed.</P>
      <P>Is é fáth na scéime seo socrú a dhéanamh maidir le háireamh pinsean agus aisce i gcásanna áirithe a tharla de bharr na hÉigeandála, stailc na múinteoirí, agus lán-deontas-i-gcabhair a thabhairt do Scoileanna Náisiúnta na Scol Ceartúcháin agus na Scol Saothair; sin agus socrú a dhéanamh chun athrú a chur ar an mbun-mhodh atá ann le háireamh a dhéanamh ar an meán-tuarastal bliantúil i gcóir críocha aoisliúntas agus chun leasú a dhéanamh ar an gcóid atá ann fá láthair maidir le pointí áirithe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>O thaobh na hÉigeandála tá socrú déanta i Mír 5 den Scéim go n-áireofar mar sheirbhís in pinsin i gcóir críocha na Príomh-Scéime seirbhís a thug múinteoir cáilithe sna Fórsaí Cosanta i rith na tréimhse ón 2ú lá de Mheán Fómhair, 1939, go dtí an 11ú lá de Bhealtaine, 1945.  Má tharla, ar <Col N="316" /> chríochnú a sheirbhíse san arm, go raibh sé deacair ar mhúinteoir post fháil mar mhúinteoir scoile náisiúnta, féadfar an t-achar a chaith sé ag lorg poist a áireamh mar sheirbhís inphinsin. Ní áireofar, áfach, ina leithéid sin de chás, tréimhse is faide ná trí mhí.  Más rud é, le linn dó a bheith san arm, go raibh múinteoir eile ar fostú aige mar ionadaí, beidh seirbhís an mhúinteora ionaid inphinsin, freisin.</P>
    <P>Cinntítear i Mír 10 go n-áireofar i gcóir pinsin suim iomlán an Bhónais Éigeandála a híocadh le múinteoirí náisiúnta a bhí, freisin, ina mbunmháistrí poist.  Go dtí an lú lá d'Aibreán, 1946, ba as an Vóta i gcóir Poist agus Telegrafa a híoctaí cuid den bhónas seo.  As an Vóta i gcóir an Bhun-Oideachais a híoctaí an chuid eile.  Fán gcóid atá ann fá láthair ní féidir pinsean múinteora a áireamh ach ar an íocaíocht a fuair sé as an Vóta i gcóir an Bhun-Oideachais. Cinntítear sa leasú seo go n-áireofar i gcóir pinsin an íocaíocht a fuair sé mar mhúinteoir náisiúnta agus suim iomlán an Bhónais Éigeandála don tréimhse go dtí an lú lá d'Aibreán, 1946, is cuma cia acu an Roinn Oideachais nó an Roinn Poist agus Telegrafa d'íoc an bónas leis.  Níl aon deacracht ag baint leis an mBónas Éigeandála a híocadh tar éis an lú lá d'Aibreán, 1946, mar socraíodh gurb i an Roinn seo agamsa a díocfadh iomlán an bhónais ón dáta sin go dtí an 31ú lá de Dheireadh Fómhair, 1946, trá a dtáinig na scálaí nua tuarastail i bhfeidhm agus ar cuireadh ar ceal an Bónas Éigeandála a bhí iníoctha leis na Múinteoirí Náisiúnta.  Tá socrú déanta sa leasú maidir le múinteoirí atá imithe amach cheana ar pinsean.</P>
    <P>O thaobh stailc na múinteoirí tá socrú déanta i Mír 6 i gcás múinteora a fuair bás le linn dó a bheith ar stailc. Ina leithéid sin de chás beidh ionadaithe pearsanta an mhúinteora mhairbh i dteideal an aisce bháis atá ag dul, fá na Scéimeanna Aoisliúntas, do mhúinteoir a bhí ar fostú le linn dó bás d'fháil.  Tá socrú déanta i Mír 7 i gcóir ban-mhúinteoir a phós le linn di a bheith ar stailc.  Beidh a leithéid i <Col N="317" /> dteideal an aisce phósta atá ag dul fá na Scéimeanna Aoisliúntas, do mhúinteoir a bhí ar fostú le linn pósadh di.</P>
    <P>Sa mblian 1941 a tugadh cabhair den chéad uair do na Scoileanna Ceartúcháin agus do na Scoileanna Saothair as an Vóta i gcóir an Bhun-Oideachais, ach níor tugadh dóibh, an trá sin, an chabhair go hiomlán a bheirtear do na gná-bhunscoileanna.  Is é an fáth ar reachtaíodh Scéim Aoisliúntas na bliana 1942 chun cearta pinsin a thabhairt do mhúinteoirí tuata a bhí ar fostaíocht sna scoileanna úd maidir leis an tréimhse seirbhíse a bhú tugtha acu roimh an mbliain 1941 agus i ndiaidh na bliana sin.  Ón lú lá d'Aibreán, 1946, ámh, tá na scoileanna seo ar aondul leis na gná-bhunscoileanna.  Ar an abhar sin, bíonn an tseirbhís a bheirtear iontu inphinsin fán ngná-chóid. Fágann sin nach bhfuil riachtanas feasta le Scéim na bliana 1942 i gcás seirbhíse a tugadh tar éis an lú lá d'Aibreán, 1946, agus níonn Mír 8 athghairm uirthi féin dá réir.</P>
    <P>Gná-bhunscoileanna atá fá stiúradh na n-ord crábhaidh, tá sé de roghain acu cabhair ón Stát fháil do réir bun-mhodha na caipitíochta, .i. deontas do réir an aonaid de ghná-thinnrimh, sin nó do réir bun-mhodha na haicmíochta. Sa dara cás seo íocann an Roinn Oideachais a thuarastal pearsanta le gach ball den fhoirinn.  Nuair a cuireadh na scoileanna ceartúcháin agus na scoileanna saothair ar aonchéim leis na gná-bhunscoileanna ón lú lá d'Aibreán, 1946, hiarradh ar na stiúrthóirí roghain a dhéanamh idir an dá mhodha íocaíochta.  Sna cásanna ina ndearna na stiúrthóirí roghain de mhodh na haicmíochta is inphinsin fá na Scéimeanna atá ann fá láthair an tseirbhís a chuir baill den ord isteach mar mhúinteoirí ar an bhfoirinn aitheanta ón lú lá d'Aibreán, 1946.  Ach ní foláir socrú fá leith a dhéanamh lena chinntú go mbeadh an chreidiúint chéanna i gcóir pinsin le fáil acu agus atá le fáil ag múinteoirí tuata ar son seirbhíse a thugadar i Scoileanna Ceartúcháin agus i Scoileanna Saothair roimh an dáta sin.  Tá an socrú sin déanta i Mír 9.</P>
    <P>(a) Tá socrú déanta i Mír 11 chun athrú a chur ar an tréimhse tri mblian as a mbaintear leas ag áireamh an <Col N="318" /> mhean-tuarastail bliantúil i gcóir pinsin agus i gcóir aisce pósta agus aisce báis. Go dtí seo ba é an 31 ú lá den Mhárta a bhí ann roimh ré ba chríoch don tréimhse trí mblian sin i ngach cás, ach as seo amach beidh críoch ar an tréimhse an lá deireannach den cheathrú, más é sin an lá a théas an múinteoir ar pinsean, a phósas an múinteoir nó a gheobhas an múinteoir bás.</P>
    <P>Munar ar an dáta sin a tharlas aon cheann de na neithe úd beidh deireadh na tréimhse ann an lá deiridh den cheathrú a bhí ann roimhe sin.  I ngeall air sin beidh méadú, tríd is tríd, ar an meán-tuarastal bliantúil.</P>
    <P>(b) Ar theacht i bhfeidhm do na scálaí nua tuarastail ar an 31ú lá de Dheireadh Fómhair, 1946, múinteoirí ar bith a bhí le dhul ar pinsean fán teora aoise roimh an 31ú lá de Mhí na Nollag, 1947, ceadaíodh dóibh leanacht orthu sa tseirbhís go dtí an dáta sin. Do réir an tsocruithe atá déanta sa mír seo is ar an meán-tuarastal a fuaireadar i rith na dtrí mblian dar críoch an 31ú lá de Mhí na Nollag, 1947, a háireofar a bpinsean.  Dá réir sin beidh tréimhse 14 mhí acu ar na scálaí feabhsaithe fá chóir crícheanna pinsin. Ina theannta sin, múinteoirí a rachas ar pinsiún fán teora aoise i rith an dá bhlian seo ag teacht beidh síneadh ar an tréimhse seirbhíse i gcóir pinsin a bheas acu ar na scálá arda.  Iad seo a rachas ar pinsean an 31ú lá de Mhí na Nollag, 1949, nó am ar bith ina dhiaidh sin is ar an meán-tuarastal a fuaireadar i rith trí mblian iomlán ar na scálaí nua a haireofar a bpinsean.  Marach an socrú atá déanta sa mír seo ní bheadh sin amhlaidh go dtí an lú lá d'Aibreán, 1950.  An t-athrú a nítear ar mhodh áirimh an mheán-tuarastail bhliantúil rachaidh sé chun tairbhe, freisin, dóibh seo a bheas i dteideal aisce pósta nó aisce báis.</P>
    <P>Níl aon mhór-thábhacht i Míreann 12 agus 13.  I ngeall ar an nganntán múinteoirí a bhí ann le blianta gairide bíonn cásanna ann agus iarrann an bainisteoir ar mhúinteoir a bhí ar pinsean a theacht ar ais ag teagasc i rith tréimhse áirithe nó go gceaptar múinteoir seasmhach.  Ina leithéidí sin de chásanna stadann pinsean an mhúinteora agus bheirtear <Col N="319" /> pinsean as an nua dhó ar chríochnú a sheirbhíse shealadaí.  Tharlódh go mbeadh an pinsean as an nua so níos lú ná an pinsean tosaigh agus is é is aidhm le hAlt a 12 ná féachaint chuige nach dtarlóidh amhlaidh.  Tá socrú déanta i Mír 13 chun an pinsean a chur fionraí nuair nach mó ná trí mhí an tréimhse ath-fhostuaithe agus nach gcuireann sé isteach ar shuim an phinsin.  Go dtí seo níorbh fholáir ar dtús an pinsean a chur ar ceal agus pinsean nua den tsuim chéanna a dheonadh arís.</P>
    <P>Fá na scéimeanna atá ann fá láthair ní foláir an pinsean a íoc uair sa mí ach ba mhaith an rud é dá mb'fhéidir é íoc an trá a measfaí ab fheiliúnaí ina chóir ó am go ham. Bheirtear cumhacht chuige sin i Mír 14.</P>
    <P>Do hiarradh orm i roinnt cás pinsean a íoc fá dhó sa mí agus mar adúirt mé ar ócáid eile tá mé toilteanach an moladh a bhreithniú má bheirtear fianaise dhom go bhfuil aon éileamh mór go ndéanfainn amhlaidh.</P>
    <P>Chun freastal ar chás fá leith cruatain a cuireadh Mír 15 isteach. Chuir a lán daoine an cás os mo chomhair. Is é an cás é, ban-mhúinteoir a rugadh sa mbliain 1877, agus a thug seirbhís leanúnach i Scoil Saothair ón mbliain 1913, agus a bhí ag múineadh roimhe sin féin.  Thug Scéim Aoisliúntas na bliana 1942 creidiúint fá chóir pinsin dá leithéid sin i gcás seirbhíse a tugadh go dtí an bhliain 1941, ach, de bhrí nár fheagair an múinteoir áirithe seo don tsainmhíniú ar &ldquo;mhúinteoir&rdquo; atá ag gabháil leis an bPríomh-Scéim ní raibh sí i dteideal pinsin. Cuirfear an scéal ina cheart sa mír seo. Is éard atá ar intinn a dhéanamh aitheantas mar &ldquo;mhúinteoir&rdquo; a thabhairt di go foirmiúil ar feadh tréimhse gairid agus ansin í a chur ar pinsean ar an bpointe cuí.</P>
    <P>Ní mheasaim go bhfuil aon abhair conspóide sna moltaí seo agus iarraim ar an Dáil an rún a rith go foirmiúil ag daingniú na Scéime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a question on this pension scheme.  Deputies will observe that this scheme is <Col N="320" /> designed largely to provide for non-recurring anomalies which it is deemed expedient to clear up.  In addition to that, there are provisions of a permanent character.  I am a great believer in letting justice be done, and nothing is more exasperating to the average individual than to have anomalies redressed, but when an exactly similar case presents itself that it should be excluded from redress.  I recently directed the attention of the Minister for Education to such a situation, the facts of which are these: a young girl presented herself for the qualifying examination for the position of junior assistant mistress, and at the time she undertook the examination Euclid and geometry were compulsory subjects. Well, she did not take Euclid and geometry and so she was not awarded the necessary certificate to qualify her to serve as a junior assistant mistress. Very shortly after she took the examination Euclid and geometry ceased to be obligatory.</P>
      <P>If she had done her examination 12 or 18 months later she would have qualified.  In these circumstances, the manager of the school inquired of a person whom he believed to be well informed and was told that in all human probability the Minister would waive the point about lack of qualification for the failure to take Euclid and algebra inasmuch as nobody was now required to take these two subjects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  The manager of the school referred to a person whom he believed to be a knowledgeable person. This person said the Minister would probably waive the point.  He therefore appointed the girl to be a junior assistant mistress in the school. No sooner was she appointed than reference was made to the Department. After some time the Department said they would not waive the point.  Then began one of these interminable wrangles and tangles.  The parish priest went, the bishop went, but the Minister remained firm in his decision. For almost nine years this girl taught in the school and, according to the principal's report, taught extremely well.  At the end of nine years, seeing she never had any salary during the whole period of her operations, she retired from the school.  An application was then made to the Minister to give her some compensation or pension. That was turned down on the grounds that she had no position in the school at all.  Very well.  Not 30 miles away from that school there was a junior assistant mistress.  She went in for an examination in Irish and she got 2 per cent.  The Minister, apparently, gave her every opportunity to qualify.  The best she could do was to get 2 per cent. so he withdrew recognition and said she was not qualified to teach as a junior assistant mistress.  Her ladyship then staged a sit-down strike. Devil out she would go at all.  Being of a strong-minded disposition, for a protracted period she sat in the school without any pupil at all.  After three or four years, or maybe longer, she struck oil.  She was not as unfortunate as the lady who taught for nine years because, steaming across the Border, <Col N="322" /> there came a well-known and enthusiastic supporter of the Government who said that his experience was that if you shouted loud enough the Minister for Education became a more reasonable man.  He said he would go down to Marlborough Street&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This scheme concerns people whose pension rights were affected as a result of their pensionable service being broken by the teachers' strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My submission, Sir, is that the lady who had nobody to speak on her behalf, who spent nine years teaching, who did not have a Boanerges from the North to come and speak for her, is entitled to the same benefits as the lady who had.  All I am asking is that in this pension scheme a provision will be inserted whereby any person who comes within the general description of the circumstances so eloquently advocated by the Boanerges from the North will be entitled to the same benefits.  Is that an unreasonable request? Is it not an anachronism that one lady who has an advocate who can bellow like a bull is to have a pension while another lady, who has not, has to do without it?  I do not live anywhere near the neighbourhood concerned. The only persons I know in this connection are the manager who appointed the lady to work nine years and the Boanerges from the North.  All I want is justice.  If the lady who sat for five years unqualified because she only got 2 per cent. in Irish is to have compensation, surely to God the girl who had all the qualifications that a junior assistant mistress now requires and who taught, according to the principal of her school, excellently for nine years, who went in, not because she thrust her way in but because she and the manager who appointed her believed that in all the circumstances recognition would be forthcoming and who continued to hope the recognition would be forthcoming and whose hope that recognition would be forthcoming was sponsored not only by her manager but also by the bishop of <Col N="323" /> the diocese, ought to get no more consideration, but no less consideration, than the lady who knew she was not qualified, who was asked to leave the school but who would not leave the school, and who, for some time, had no pupils in the school but staged a sit-down strike.  <i>Fiat justitia.</i>  I confidently look to the Minister for Education to deal as liberally and as justly with the girl whose case was advocated by no one more formidable than the manager and the Bishop as he did with the case which was presented to him by the Boanerges from the North who had no direct interest in the matter at all except his professed ability to put behaviour on Deputy Derrig, the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>Let me say quite frankly that my experience of the Department of Education has been that an appeal for justice and fair play is more usually listened to in that Department than are blustering and threats.  I would find it very hard to believe that the woman whose case was sustained by blustering and threats would be more liberally dealt with than the woman who depends on nothing but the bare justice of the case she makes.</P>

      <P>As this is an amending scheme, to provide for cases which were omitted, I think I am in order in asking the Minister to give attention to what I conceive has been an omission.  I can give him the full names and other details subsequently. Other people in other parts of the country of whom I have no knowledge may also be affected in the same way as the case to which I shall refer. Briefly the facts are as follows&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The case I wish to mention is a simple one.  Certain junior assistant mistresses were employed in convent schools in positions which were not pensionable and which carried no pension rights. Subsequent to the founding of this State these people were brought in under a pension scheme with certain salary adjustments.  In fact, from the time they were included under that scheme, they remained for a period of almost ten years on the same salary scale.  Their salaries were not brought up to the level of the other teachers but there was an immediate deduction made from them in respect of pension. When they came to pensionable age only a portion of their service was taken into consideration.  Now, there are only a few such teachers involved and I think it would be well to remove the existing anomaly.  The case made against them is that they were for such a long period in unpensionable service. The answer to that is that their remuneration was at a lower rate and for that reason they might be said to have constructively paid into a pension fund because of their lower salary scale, though in actual fact they did not so contribute.  There is one case of a lady of 38 years' service who is now being pensioned on the basis of 20 years' service.  I think the position should be examined by the Minister in view of the amendment contemplated.</P>

      <P>I wish to draw attention to the fact that the Minister spoke in <Col N="325" /> Irish.  Now, you, Sir, are responsible for the regulation of the House.  There are some of us who do not speak Irish. A statement was issued in English to a privileged few and I think it is unfair to the rest of us that this privileged few should be supplied with the document in advance.  I would ask that, in future, if a statement is going to be given it should be given to every member of the House because every member is entitled to the same privileges. I do not know a word of Irish.</P>

      <P>That is all I want &mdash; consideration in the future.  I directed my protest, Sir, on a point of order.  Might I <Col N="326" /> now ask the Minister if, in an amending scheme like this, consideration should not be given to those very elderly teachers who were not recognised up to 15 or 20 years ago?  I have in mind a former member of this House, who was responsible in a large measure for the establishment of the House and who took a very active part in the building up of the State.  He was only recognised some 20 years ago.  He is about to go out on pension after a loyal service of 50 years' duration.  His pension will amount to 30/- per week.  I appeal to the Minister for consideration in cases such as his.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a scheme in 1934 under which, I think, the class to which Deputy Byrne has referred would come.  These people were given two-thirds credit for previous recognised and paid service.</P>
      <P>The position in these schools which came definitely under the Department of Education in 1925 is being considered and it is probable that a scheme will be introduced dealing with certain matters which have arisen, including those referred to here to-day.  The position is being examined sympathetically. But I have to secure the sanction of the Department of Finance.  If sanction is accorded we shall probably have an amending scheme dealing with such cases.</P>
      <P>The particular scheme now before us deals with matters arising out of the emergency &mdash; teachers who were members of the Defence Forces, teachers who were sub-postmasters, teachers who married or died while on strike, and industrial school teachers.  The latter are brought in in order to ensure that those who were teaching in what are called classification schools will receive exactly the same treatment as teachers in capitation schools.  In other words, members of Orders in industrial schools now fully recognised as national schools will receive precisely the same treatment in their pension rights as teachers in other schools.</P>
      <P>In regard to Deputy de Valera's point, the question of junior assistant mistresses does not, therefore, arise under this scheme.  This scheme deals only with the specific matters to which I have referred.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Dillon is correct in suggesting that under paragraph 15, which deals with the particular case of an industrial school teacher excluded by reason of the fact that she did not come under the legal definition of teacher, the terms of paragraph 15 can be stretched so as to include all classes.  These teachers were awarded pension rights in 1934 and to raise that question means opening up the whole question of teachers' pensions generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that I do not seem to be familiar with or I cannot recollect the particular case that Deputy Dillon referred to.  I think that it was not a case, as he stated and as he believes, that some teacher, through bluster and threats by some person, succeeded in getting certain advantages.  I think it was probably remuneration for service which the teacher could argue had been given.  In this amending scheme, we are dealing with superannuation.  The superannuation rules are laid down by statute.  The pensions awarded are subject to examination by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  The rules are published and if, at any time, a teacher feels that he or she is being wrongfully excluded, the teacher should get in touch with the Department.  I do not think, however, that that is what happened in this case.  I have experience of a number of cases of that kind, and I think that what probably happened is that a teacher remained on in a school, we will say, after a certain date and the Department could, on technical grounds, have refused to pay the teacher beyond that date.  We would be very reluctant indeed to admit that, having fixed a certain date for the retirement of the teacher, she would be paid beyond that date.  If it were a case of a pension, of course we need not pay her a pension beyond the retiring age of 60 or 65, whatever it might be.  If it is a case of service that is claimed to have been rendered and if there is a <i>prima facie</i> case that one teacher in somewhat similar circumstances succeeded in getting payment for a period of service where another <Col N="328" /> one was refused, I will certainly go into the matter, but I think there must be other considerations in question.</P>

I believe that what the Minister for Justice said to me was that the matter of my query was more a matter for the Minister for public Health.  In fact, I think, the Minister for Justice is mistaken.  My submission is that provision ought to be made in any Garda Síochána Bill introduced at this time which would cover the anomaly that exists in regard to widows' pensions.  I find myself being made the victim of a not infrequent inter-departmental device and that is being sent running from one Minister to the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> Ordinarily, members of the Garda Síochána would be people who would stamp national health insurance cards. But, when the Garda Síochána Act was passed in 1925, for some good and sufficient reason it was decided to exclude them from that scheme; I suppose because there was a scheme within the force for the protection of their health.  But it was not anticipated then that, linked up with the national health insurance scheme, would be the widows' and orphans' pension scheme.  Garda widows' pensions were fixed on a certain basis in relation to the pay of the Gardaí, but, whereas every other analogous employee acquires, by virtue of his national health insurance stamps, the right to a contributory pension under the widows' and orphans' pension scheme, all reference to the income of a Garda's widow is left out.</P>

    <P>As will be apparent, each of these Acts with the exception of the Local <Col N="331" /> Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act, 1925, is portion of a code scattered through many statutes and their replacement by permanent legislation must necessarily from part of the wider work of consolidation of the various statutes relating to electoral law, housing, sanitary services, or borrowing by local authorities as the case may be.  The House may rest assured, however, that no avoidable delay will be suffered in presenting proposals for permanent legislation to replace the enactments now appearing on the Schedule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that there is a radical alteration in the method adopted for electing aldermen in this section.  Lest I may be charged with not putting down an amendment, I think I should preface my remarks by saying that we have had recently so much legislation and so little information as to when different items were likely to be taken, it is often difficult to get an amendment in in time.  I cannot see the wisdom of an arrangement whereby the elected members of a local authority will themselves, on the basis of voting by proportional representation, elect aldermen.  I think that before the Local Government Act of 1925 came into operation, under the Act of 1898 elections of aldermen were <Col N="332" /> held either annually or every couple of years.  That system was probably cumbersome and subsequently the present system, whereby the person who headed the poll in a particular area or a particular ward was elected alderman, was adopted.  It is not clear why the present system is being departed from.  Surely the people entitled to elect a person to be regarded as the senior representative for a particular area and thereby entitled to rank as alderman, are the electors themselves?  Assuming that particular groups in a corporation, if they have a sufficient number of elected representatives in their group, can elect certain individuals as aldermen, it may well be that the electors themselves would not elect the same individuals if they were given the opportunity.  While it is technically a fact that the electors will be electing the aldermen through their elected representatives, the better system I think is that the people themselves should be given the privilege and the right to designate the person or persons whom they regard as entitled to the description of aldermen. I would suggest that the Minister should consider an amendment to this section on the Report Stage which would leave the present system in force and allow the electors themselves to decide who would be the aldermen, namely the senior elected representatives in each area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended to raise the same point as that mentioned by Deputy Cosgrave.  I should like the Minister to give some explanation of his reasons for the proposed change. Why does he want to give into the hands of the elected representatives the power to appoint aldermen and to take that power from the people?  The people of this country, up to now, have had the power to elect their own aldermen. I notice the Minister for Local Government is copying the English system which never suited this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will know that I can put forward a case.  Take my own case as an example.  It may not be quite proper to put forward one's own case, but I think it is better to be frank <Col N="333" /> about this matter.  Any time I faced the electors there were various Parties contesting the election and the rule was that whoever headed the poll was the choice of the people for the position of alderman.  It was my good fortune, thanks to the people, to get an aldermanship for the past 34 years.  I can see that, following the system of election in this new Bill, various groups will get in and these groups, under proportional representation, will nominate their own candidates.  The Independents, those who faced the electors as independent candidates, will have no group in the municipal council to support them.  I know I would fall, because each Party would seek their own aldermen.  Fianna Fáil, with 19 members in the corporation, would look for at least three aldermen; the Fine Gael Party would look for three; the Labour Party would get at least one and the Independents would get none.  I am waiting for the Minister to listen to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I must protest at that remark of Deputy Byrne.  I was listening to him, but I submit I am entitled to consult my advisers without having any reflections made upon me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely stopped for a few moments while the Minister was listening to his advisers.  If the Minister wants to know why I am raising this matter, I feel that the Independents would have no chance.  At the moment there are three aldermen in the Dublin Corporation, Alderman Belton, Alderman Byrne, senior, and Alderman Byrne, junior.  None of the three would be selected by the other groups, so therefore the public will have no say in the matter of electing their aldermen and we three would be knocked out of our positions as aldermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may ask why I am so sure of that and could I not appeal, under proportional representation, to the majority of my colleagues in the corporation.  I have had one experience in that connection.  I was for 30 years a member of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  Under the new Harbours Bill, there will be one member less from the corporation on the Dublin Port and <Col N="334" /> Docks Board.  The caucuses met in the corporation and the Fianna Fáil representatives wanted two members on the Port and Docks Board; Fine Gael was entitled to at least one representative and Labour, by reason of the number of representatives they had on the corporation &mdash; nine members &mdash; were entitled to one representative.  The Independents, having only three members, would have no claim at all.  I have been 30 years on the Port and Docks Board and I will say, in fairness to one of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, that he thought I should go back.  A vote took place and Fianna Fáil and Labour combined.  Fianna Fáil said: &ldquo;Give us two and we will give Labour two&rdquo;.  That was done and Alfie Byrne fell, after 30 years' service on the board.</P>
    <P>I suggest the same will happen in the case of an aldermanship.  The same caucuses can meet and agree to drop the representative of the smallest group.  I admit that so far as having powers in the corporation as an alderman and a councillor is concerned, it is just as nice to be a councillor as an alderman.  I merely raise the matter here in order to show what can be done by the political Parties.  I am not pointing to any one Party.  They will meet and select their members and arrange with one another to drop the Independents, as in the case of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  Fianna Fáil and Labour combined to give Labour, with nine members, two seats and Fianna Fáil, with 19 members, only two seats.  Fine Gael got one and that ended it and Alfie Byrne, after his 30 years' service on the Port and Docks Board, was dropped.  That will happen when appointing aldermen.  The public who elected Alderman Byrne, senior, and Alderman Byrne, junior, and Alderman Jack Belton, will have no say because the heads of the groups will choose their own representatives.  That is not right or proper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That was an excellent electioneering speech.  I must confess that I have a great deal of sympathy with the point of view the Deputy has expressed, but I am up against a very practical problem.  The House has approved a system of <Col N="335" /> election which will give us in the City of Dublin no less than 15 electoral areas.  If we are to say that the first person elected will be an alderman, then we will have no less than 15 aldermen in the City of Dublin.  Previously there were five, later there were eight and now, under this proposal, we would have 15 and the honour and glory of being an alderman, if you like to put it that way, is going to be halved.</P>
      <P>I suggest there is no reason to regard this as a matter of principle; it is really a matter of expediency and convenience. Under the proposal in the Bill, there will be nine aldermen in the City of Dublin.  In connection with this matter we have to remember that the only thing which the office of alderman confers is the right to be styled an alderman.  An alderman has no powers other than those possessed by an ordinary member of the corporation; he has no other functions whatever; he has just the right, perhaps, to wear a different coloured garment on ceremonial occasions and perhaps an extra row of fur.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>For that reason we have had this long discussion this evening and this display of indignation on the part of Deputy Alderman Alfred Byrne.  I do not wish to see the Deputy dispossessed of the civic dignities and honours which have been conferred upon him, but I suggest there is a very practical matter to be dealt with here in a practical way.  If we want to have 15 aldermen in the City of Dublin &mdash; and I suppose we may have that if we are forced &mdash; I do not think there can be any objection to the method we have proposed in the Bill, that the representatives of the citizens &mdash;and the councillors will represent the citizens &mdash; should meet and decide who are to be aldermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not take the same cynical view of his colleagues on the corporation as the Deputy.  I am perfectly certain when they meet in that way that Party divisions and Party membership will not be made the predominant considerations. They have not been so <Col N="336" /> made in respect of the higher offices in the corporation.  Already we have seen that the Lord Mayoralty tends to go around and it is generally accepted by the members of the corporation that it should go around.  Occasionally there will be differences of opinion as to what particular person should be selected, and we have seen coalitions in the corporation where the principle of allowing the office of Lord Mayor to be held by the representatives of various Parties and by Independents has been challenged&mdash;we have seen coalitions formed to uphold that principle. I am perfectly certain that when a corporation meets to select its alderman, they will have due regard for the confidence which his own constituents have reposed in a certain councillor and for his period of service.  Having regard to all these facts, I will ask the Alderman and Deputy Cosgrave not to press the matter with regard to this section.  I can assure the Alderman and Deputy Cosgrave that this was certainly not conceived in a Party spirit but in order to meet the present difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with the Minister in regard to the revisionary character of this measure but I think that he should not depart from the existing practice.  The elected representatives have the right to elect their chairman, mayor or alderman, but the position of alderman does not derive from them but from the fact that the gentleman got the highest vote in the area, ward or borough.  If you take that away there is no sense in having the position of alderman at all. There is no reason to call a person an alderman and create the anomaly which has been pointed out by Deputy Byrne.  If this goes through, somebody who got the highest vote of the citizens, showing their feelings regarding him, because he is not in a certain group cannot hope to become an alderman. If an alderman is not elected for the old reason, that he got the highest vote from his constituents, it would be better to drop the position of alderman completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no special powers or functions attaching to the position.  It is <Col N="337" /> only an honorific position and its sentimental value only comes from the fact that the alderman has got the largest number of votes.  Take that away and there is no purpose in continuing the position.</P>
    <P>What advantage is sought in this? Could the Minister point out the advantage?  I do not think he could. If it is going to be dropped nothing will happen, but why not continue it? By this change you will only cause unnecessary friction among the members who will be fighting over the position of alderman.  That could be avoided by leaving things as they were or by dropping the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an old style title of sentimental value and I did not want to interfere with tradition in that matter.  The position is purely traditional and honorific and no functions of any sort attach to it but I wonder what criticism I would get if I proposed to abolish it altogether, and I am not certain what the legal effect on certain documents might be.  In order not to interfere with precedent and perhaps with the legal position, it has been decided that it will have to be retained.  It occurred to me, however, that there might be a way to settle the question other than the present way. There has been an objection that the City of Dublin should have 15 aldermen and make the office less spectacular and honorific than it is at the moment. Dublin should have nine aldermen, Cork should have five as it stands at the moment, and Limerick and Waterford should have five each.  In the case of Dublin we might suggest that the nine councillors who in the various electoral areas got the greatest number of first preferences, should be regarded as aldermen.  That might meet the position.  I had hoped that we would get through all the stages of this Bill to-day but if we take the Report Stage to-morrow I will put down an amendment something on those lines.</P>

      <P>I would appeal to the Minister not to make any alteration in this for if he does he will have to change other legislation.  An alderman signs leases and documents in addition to two councillors and a town clerk. <Col N="338" /> There is nothing to be gained except that if we leave the choice of aldermen to councillors we might eliminate the canvass, even by Party members, before an election.  This was often indulged in by both Parties and Deputy Keyes will agree that that will happen even in Limerick.  A member goes forward on a certain ticket and proceeds to canvass in the wards.  The Minister would be well advised to leave the choice of aldermen unchanged. Nothing is achieved by removing that power.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(d) where he has made an Order under paragraph (a) of this section in relation to the council of a county, the Minister shall by Order fix the day on which any election to be held in the year 1950 of the members of the corporation of a borough, council of an urban district or commissioners of a town situate in the county shall be held and such election shall be held on the day so fixed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is necessary to deal with the position under the Local Elections Act, 1927, which requires that elections for town commissioners or an urban council be held on the day fixed for the election of county councillors. As the position stands urban elections are subject to Section 4 and must be held in 1950.  Therefore the elections of members of Dublin County Council or Kerry County Council could not be held before or after 1950.  There is a doubt whether urban elections should be held in the same year as county council elections are held, and if not, <Col N="339" /> at what other time they should be held. According to the amendment the elections shall be held in 1950 on a day fixed by Order of the Minister.</P>

      <P>To add to the section the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) Where, by reason of the members of the council of a county being removed from office, the day on which any such election as is referred to in sub-section (2) of Section 5 of the Local Elections Act, 1927 (No. 39 of 1927), cannot be ascertained pursuant to that sub-section, the election shall be held on such day as the Minister fixes by Order.</P>
      <P>The House will recollect that we amended Section 12.  This is the general case of which the amendment of Section 12 is a particular case. If members of a county council are removed from office there is a doubt whether the day on which the ordinary elections should be held would be the day on which the urban elections are held.  Since the urban elections are to be held on the date fixed for the county council elections this amendment removes the doubt by deciding that the urban elections will be held on the date fixed by Order of the Minister for Local Government.</P>

If the sheriff sends out polling cards to the people of that area they are not now there to receive them because the site is derelict.  Perhaps the Minister can suggest a remedy.  A number of his Acts are now being amended in certain sections &mdash; I think 15 &mdash;and I suggest that the sheriff or whoever is responsible for sending the cards out should have some way of having these cards brought back and readdressed to the new addresses.  I have in mind Bride Street and Seán McDermott Street.  That area has been demolished and the people have gone to live elsewhere.  I do not want polling cards addressed to those people to go to waste simply because they need to be readdressed.  That is a matter in which all Parties are interested.  If possible, the cards should be brought back to the sheriff who should see that they are delivered to the correct addresses.  This matter affects all parts of Dublin and every member of the House.

    <P>(4) Where three or more nominating bodies are entitled to propose for nomination to a particular panel, each shall be entitled to propose for nomination to the panel&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  if the number obtained by dividing the appropriate number by the number of the nominating bodies is two or less &mdash; two persons, and,</P>

    <P>This is a new section in substitution for Section 26.  This section can best be <Col N="347" /> considered along with the new Section 28 and the amendment of Section 34.  In order that the election may be a real election the voters must have a number of names from which to choose.  That arises from the fact that there are two parties to these elections &mdash;not merely nominators but also the special electorate which has been chosen.  It is felt that in order to give full effect to the recommendations of the committee the electorate should have an excess of candidates from which to select &mdash; that is to say, there should be more candidates put before them than there are places to be filled. The purposes of the provisions set out here, particularly sub-sections (2) and (3), are to ensure that there will be a sufficiency of candidates nominated irrespective of the number of nominating bodies; that is to say, where there is only one nominating body there should be at least three people selected by it.  It is also felt that if there is only one or two nominating bodies they should not be given the right to present the electorate with a <i>fait accompli,</i> by nominating just as many candidates as there are vacancies.  It is an important element in the election of the Seanad that the special electorate should be given its right to vote and, accordingly, provision is made here that where there are only one or two nominating bodies additional candidates may be added by the Taoiseach. That does not mean that these candidates will have any prior right over anybody else but it does mean that the electorate will have the right to exercise a choice.</P>

    <P>(a)  the proposal shall be made in writing on a proposal for nomination paper in the prescribed form;</P>
    <P>(b)  the nominating body shall propose by one and the same proposal for nomination paper all the persons which it is entitled to propose;</P>
    <P>(c)  the proposal for nomination paper shall contain the particulars required by the prescribed form of proposal for nomination paper to be stated therein (including a statement of the qualifications of every person thereby proposed for the panel to which he is proposed) and shall be signed by the nominating body;</P>
    <P>(d)  where the nominating body is a body corporate, the proposal for nomination paper shall be signed by the body by affixing to such paper the seal of the body in the manner and with the counter-signatures required by the constitution, articles of association, or other regulations of the body;</P>
    <P>(e)  where the nominating body is not a body corporate, the proposal for nomination paper shall be signed in the name of the body by some person having authority to sign in that name.</P>
    <P>(3) In the case of the Irish County Councils' General Council and in the case of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, the persons to be proposed for nomination to the administrative panel by those bodies <Col N="349" /> respectively shall be chosen by the members of the body voting on the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote.</P>
    <P>(4) A proposal for nomination paper which purports to be sealed with the seal of a body corporate which is a nominating body and to be countersigned shall, until the contrary is proved, be deemed to have been so sealed in the manner and with the counter-signatures required by the constitution, articles of association, or other regulations of the body.</P>
    <P>(5) A proposal for nomination paper which purports to be signed in the name of an unincorporated body which is a nominating body shall, until the contrary is proved, be deemed to have been so signed by a person having authority to sign in that name.</P>
    <P>(6) Where a nominating body purports to propose for nomination by a proposal for nomination paper either more persons or less persons to a panel than the body is entitled so to propose, the proposal for nomination paper shall be wholly void.</P>
    <P>(7) The Seanad returning officer shall furnish free of charge on request to a nominating body such number of forms of proposal for nomination paper (in addition to the form which he is required by sub-section (1) of this section to send to the body) as the body reasonably requires.</P>
    <P>The only purpose of this amendment is to set out the different sections at length so that they might be clearly grasped; and the only difference is that the amendment proposes to substitute a new section for the existing Section 27 making it clear that nominating bodies do not nominate but propose for nomination.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="350" /> Before Section 28 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>28. &mdash;(1) A proposal for nomination paper by which a person or persons is or are proposed for nomination at a Seanad general election by a nominating body shall be delivered or sent by post to the Seanad returning officer.</P>
    <P>(2) Immediately after the expiration of the time for general panel proposal nominations, the Seanad returning officer shall prepare, in respect of each panel, a list (in this Act referred to as a nominating bodies list) in the prescribed form of the persons in the respect of whom he has received, before the expiration of the said time, proposals for nominations to such panel by nominating bodies.</P>
    <P>(3) If, when the provisions of sub-section (2) of this section have been complied with, the number of persons included in a nominating bodies list does not equal or exceed the appropriate number, the Seanad returning officer shall report to the Taoiseach the deficiency in such list and furnish him with copies of the nominating bodies lists.</P>
    <P>(4) Upon receiving a report under sub-section (3) of this section, the Taoiseach shall propose for nomination to every panel in respect of which he receives the report such number of persons as will be sufficient to bring the number of persons on the relevant nominating bodies list up to the appropriate number (and no more).</P>
    <P>(5) A proposal for nomination made by the Taoiseach under this section shall be made in accordance with the following provisions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the proposal for nomination shall be made in writing on a proposal for nomination paper in the prescribed form;</P>
    <P>(b)  the proposal for nomination shall be made by a separate proposal for nomination paper;</P>
    <P>(c)  the proposal for nomination paper shall state the sub-panel in respect of which the proposal is <Col N="351" /> made and shall also contain the particulars required by the said prescribed form of proposal for nomination paper (including a statement of the qualifications of the person thereby proposed for the panel to which he is so proposed) and shall be signed by the Taoiseach;</P>
    <P>(d)  the proposal for nomination paper shall be delivered or sent to the Seanad returning officer and shall be so sent or delivered that it is received by him within ten days after the expiration of the time for general panel proposal nominations.</P>
    <P>(6) On receipt of proposals for nominations under sub-section (4) of this section in respect of a panel, the Seanad returning officer shall prepare, in respect of the panel, a list (in this Act also referred to as a nominating bodies list) in the prescribed form of the persons in respect of whom he has received proposals for nominations to such panel by nominating bodies or the Taoiseach and such list shall have effect in substitution for the previous nominating bodies list in respect of the panel.</P>
    <P>(7)  In preparing the nominating bodies lists, the Seanad returning officer shall not&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  include the name of a person whose proposal for nomination has been received after the expiration of the time for general panel proposed nominations,</P>
    <P>(b)  include the name of a person whose proposal for nomination is declared by the Act to be wholly void, or</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 31 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>31.&mdash;Where the Seanad returning officer receives a proposal for nomination paper or a nomination paper at a Seanad general election (other than a paper declared by this Act to be wholly void or a paper so received after the time limited by this Act for such receipt)&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  the Seanad returning officer shall forthwith post up, in such public place in the county borough of Dublin as he considers most suitable, a notice stating the fact of the receipt by him of the paper and the name, address and description (as stated in the paper) of the person purported to be proposed or nominated by the paper and the panel <Col N="353" /> to which such person purports to be so proposed or nominated,</P>
    <P>(b)  the Seanad returning officer shall hold the paper available for inspection by candidates between the hours of 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. on week-days during the period beginning on the day after the day of the receipt of the paper and ending on the day before the day of the completion or resumption of the completion (as may be appropriate) of the panels.</P>
    <P>The existing Section 31 prescribes that public notice be given in a public place of every nomination received.  This public place hitherto has been the main hall in the General Post Office, by permission of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  The new section also provides for that, but it authorises the returning officer to allow a person nominated to a panel to inspect any nomination for that panel.  I understand that at previous elections this question has arisen and the returning officer, by reason of the fact that he was not specifically empowered by statute to permit inspection, felt that he was not in fact able to do so.  This new section will now permit a candidate on a panel to inspect any other nomination on the panel.  The amendment is inserted for the protection of the returning officer.</P>

      <P>This amendment arises in this way.  If in respect of any panel there are only one or two nominating bodies and that they in fact make all their nominations, it is not necessary to have a meeting of the nomination committee and, accordingly, a meeting of a nomination committee is only necessary when there happens to be three or four nominating bodies.

      <P>This amendment is designed to meet what was the general feeling of the committee that we do not have too large a sub-panel and this fixes the number of candidates that must be nominated for a nominating bodies sub-panel at twice the number of candidates that may be elected to that particular panel in accordance with Section 51.  In fact, it strengthens the position of nominating bodies and allows the electorate to make its choice from twice the maximum number of candidates that may be elected for any sub-panel.</P>

      <P>I think we can take amendments Nos. 25, 26 and 27 together.  They all have reference to the ruling on nominations. It is felt that if candidates are allowed to inspect the nomination papers they should, in turn, give to the returning officer notice of any question that they propose to raise at the sitting for the completion of panels, since it is only proper that the returning officer should have some opportunity to consider the questions in advance.  It is felt that this notice should be given also for this reason: that the time allowed by the Constitution for the completion of a Seanad election is limited and, accordingly, we could not have a long adjournment. For that reason, we feel that notice should be given, not merely if a candidate desires to raise any question of qualification, but of disqualification. In preceding elections, the text of the existing statute did not permit a question of disqualification to be raised, and it is felt it is only right that that in fact should happen, as otherwise the election might prove to be abortive.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might amplify something I said on the Second Reading.  This section relates to the taking of the poll.  I might mention that the electorate for the next election will number about 965 persons, on the assumption that the former members of the Dublin County Council who were elected in 1934 will not be electors for the purposes of the next election.  If we have a total electorate of about 965, <Col N="358" /> then the quotas for the various panels will run as follows:</P>
      <P>For the Cultural Panel it will be in excess of 160 but it will not be 161.  For the Agricultural Panel the quota will be in excess of 80; for the Labour Panel it will be in excess of 80; for the Industrial Panel it will be in excess of 96 and for the Administrative Panel it will be in excess of 120.  I think it is necessary that I should repeat that in order to correct any misapprehensions which members of the Oireachtas may be under by reason of certain erroneous statements which appeared in the Press in relation to this matter when the Bill was first issued.</P>

Copies of the necessary forms will be sent to the authorised officer and the authorised officer, when he is satisfied that in fact the person who tenders the ballot paper to him is the person who is entitled to have the ballot paper, will then hand to the elector, the person in possession of the ballot paper, a form of declaration of identity which the elector himself must fill up and which he will then show to the officer when he has then completed his ballot paper.

      <P>Before Section 49 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>49.&mdash;(1) On the day appointed for the issue of ballot papers at a Seanad general election the Seanad returning officer shall send by registered post to each person whose name is on the electoral roll for that election at the address stated on such electoral roll a ballot paper for each panel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) Whenever a person to whom ballot papers for a Seanad general election should be sent under sub-section (1) of this section states in writing to the Seanad returning officer that more than 24 hours have elapsed since such ballot papers should have been delivered to him in the ordinary course of post and that he has not received such ballot papers and that he desires duplicate ballot papers to be issued to him, the Seanad returning officer, if such statement is received by him not less than 48 hours before the close of the poll at the election, shall forthwith <Col N="360" /> or, if such statement is received by him less than 48 hours before the close of the poll at the election, may send by registered post to such person at the address mentioned in sub-section (1) of this section a ballot paper for each panel all of which, by being printed on paper of a special colour or otherwise, are clearly distinguished as duplicates of the ballot papers originally sent to such person.</P>
    <P>(3) The Seanad returning officer shall, when sending out ballot papers in pursuance of this section, observe the rules contained in the First Schedule to this Act.</P>
    <P>This new section together with the proposed amendment to Section 50 and the alternative rules proposed for rules 1 to 17 embodied in the First Schedule of the present Bill, sets out the procedure for the issue, marking and receipt of ballot papers.  Ballot papers will be issued by registered post to the elector at his address.  The outer envelope will bear a warning to him to keep the envelope until he has voted. He will produce that envelope to one or other of the officers authorised to witness the declaration of identity. That will be either the local superintendent of the Gardaí, the county registrar, the Clerk of Dáil Éireann, the Clerk of Seanad Éireann or the returning officer.  He will show the ballot papers unmarked.</P>
    <P>The voter will be given by the authorised officer a declaration of identity which he must sign, adding to it the number of the ballot paper which is on the back of the ballot paper.  The superintendent will then witness the form and hand it to the voter.  The voter will then mark his papers in the presence of the authorised officer but not in such a position as will permit the authorised officer to see how he is marking his ballot paper.  He must then place his ballot papers, whether they are marked or unmarked, in the envelope, together with the declaration of identity and he will put the envelope containing the ballot papers and the declaration of identity in what is known as the outer envelope.  He will then seal that and produce it to the authorised officer who will affix on the flap of the envelope a special lable.  It will bear also a special certificate that <Col N="361" /> this process was completed in his presence by the voter who signed it.  The voter will then take the packet containing the essential documents and will post it by registered post to the returning officer.  In that way we ensure that the ballot papers do not get into the hands of any unauthorised person, that the marking of the ballot paper is not done by any unauthorised person and that all the ballot papers are accounted for.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that it puzzles me to know why it is necessary to send the ballot paper to the elector.  I think that is going to cause a certain amount of trouble everywhere. If we could have a system by which the ballot paper could be issued at a polling booth, I think it would be much more satisfactory.  The Seanad electors, we may be sure, will be getting quite a lot of election literature and there is a very great possibility that some electors will discard these envelopes assuming that they are the ordinary kind of election literature.  In the event of an elector losing his ballot paper, or mislaying it, has he any redress?</P>

      <P>Yes.  If he applies to the returning officer with a statement that the ballot paper has not been delivered in the ordinary course of events, he will be able to get what is known as a duplicate ballot paper.  I should like to emphasise that the ballot papers will come in a special envelope addressed to the elector and delivered to him by registered post.  Some person will have to sign for it.  In addition, this envelope in the registered packet will contain a warning that the envelope itself must not be destroyed. We have to recognise that we are dealing with a special electorate, intelligent men, and I am perfectly sure they will be aware of the necessity for complying with the required procedure.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="362" /> To delete sub-section (1) and substitute the following sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Every person entitled to vote at a Seanad general election shall be entitled to vote at that election in the following and no other manner, that is to say, by marking one or more of the ballot papers sent to him under Section 49 of this Act and returning by registered post to the Seanad returning officer all of those ballot papers together with the form of declaration of identity, furnished to him pursuant to the rules contained in the First Schedule to this Act, duly made and completed by him.</P>
    <P>(2)  Whenever a person entitled to vote at a Seanad general election states in writing to the Seanad returning officer that he duly returned by registered post to the Seanad returning officer the ballot papers and a form of declaration of identity and that the same does not appear to have been delivered to the Seanad returning officer and that he desires duplicate ballot papers to be issued to him, the Seanad returning officer, if such statement is received by him not less than 48 hours before the close of the poll at the election, shall forthwith or, if such statement is received by him less than 48 hours before the close of the poll at the election, may send by registered post to such person at his address as stated in the electoral roll a ballot paper for each panel all of which, by being printed on paper of a special colour or otherwise, are clearly distinguished as duplicates of the ballot papers originally sent to such person.</P>
    <P>This is a consequential amendment on Section 49.  In addition, it will be necessary on Report Stage to have a minor amendment to Section 49 just to clarify the wording in the third and fourth line of the amendment.  The intention is to require all the ballot papers whether they are marked or unmarked to be returned to the returning officer in order to safeguard against the possibility &mdash; I do not say the probability, but the possibility &mdash; that a person may be induced for an improper consideration not to vote.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 43:</P>
      <P>Before Section 84 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>84.&mdash;(1) The following provisions shall, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act, have effect in relation to any Seanad general election held consequent on dissolution of Dáil Eireann occurring during the period beginning on the passing of this Act and ending on the publication under Section 15 of this Act of the register of nominating bodies:</P>
      <P>(a)  the register published in the <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i> under Section 19 of the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act, 1937 (No. 43 of 1937), on the 25th day of March, 1947, shall be deemed to be the register of nominating bodies;</P>
      <P>(b)  that register shall, for the purposes of Sections 21 and 22 of this Act, be deemed to have been published on the passing of this Act;</P>
      <P>(c)  the person who, immediately before the passing of this Act, stood appointed under Section 5 of the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act, 1937, shall be deemed to be the Seanad returning officer, but if that person is unable through illness, absence or other cause to fulfil his duties, such person as may be appointed in that behalf by the Minister shall be deemed to be the Seanad returning officer;</P>
      <P>(d)  the Clerk of Seanad Éireann shall not later than 30 days after the dissolution of Dáil Éireann send to the Seanad returning officer a statement of the names, addresses and descriptions of the members of Seanad Éireann who are entitled to be members of the electorate at the Seanad general election;</P>
      <P>(e)  the Clerk of Seanad Éireann shall be deemed to be an authorised person for the purpose of rule 8 of the rules contained in the First Schedule to this Act;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> (f)  the Seanad returning officer shall, in lieu of retaining the duplicate certificate referred to in rule 21 of the rules contained in the First Schedule to this Act, send such duplicate to the Clerk of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>(2) The following provisions shall, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act, have effect in relation to any Seanad by-election held consequent on a notice of a casual vacancy sent or deemed to be sent to the Minister during the period beginning on the passing of this Act and ending on the publication under Section 15 of this Act of the register of nominating bodies:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the register published under Section 19 of the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act, 1937 (No. 43 of 1937), on the 20th day of March, 1947, shall be deemed to be the register of nominating bodies;</P>
    <P>(b)  that register shall, for the purposes of Sections 21 and 22 of this Act, be deemed to have been published on the passing of this Act;</P>
    <P>(c)  the person, who, immediately before the passing of this Act, stood appointed under Section 5 of the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act, 1937, shall be deemed to be the Seanad returning officer, but if that person is unable through illness, absence or other cause to fulfil his duties, such person as may be appointed in that behalf by the Minister shall be deemed to be the Seanad returning officer;</P>
    <P>(d)  if the election is to fill an Oireachtas sub-panel casual vacancy and it is adjourned for the purpose of taking a poll&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the Seanad returning officer shall forthwith on the adjournment inform the Clerk of Seanad Éireann in writing of the adjournment, and send to him a copy of the list of candidates, and the said Clerk shall, not later than four days after being so informed, furnish to the Seanad returning officer a statement of the <Col N="368" /> names, addresses, and descriptions of all the members of Seanad Éireann who are then entitled to sit and vote in that House,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the said statement and the statement furnished by the Clerk of Dáil Éireann pursuant to sub-section (1) of Section 68 of this Act shall together be deemed to be the electoral roll constituted under the said Section 68 for the election;</P>
    <P>(e)  the Seanad returning officer shall, in lieu of retaining the duplicate certificate referred to in rule 23 of the rules contained in the Third Schedule to this Act, send such duplicate to the Clerk of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>(3) A notice sent under Section 5 of the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) (By-Elections) Act, 1940 (No. 20 of 1940), during the six months ending on the passing of this Act shall be deemed to be a notice of a casual vacancy sent to the Minister under this Act on the passing thereof.</P>
    <P>(4) Notwithstanding Section 44 of this Act, a person shall not be a member of the electorate at a Seanad general election by reason only of the fact that he was a member of the council of the county of Dublin at any time before the passing of this Act.</P>
    <P>This is a transitory provision whereby the Act can become operative to the fullest extent possible on the day it becomes law.  At the first election the returning officer will not be the Clerk of the Seanad, as recommended by the committee, but will be the officer who, immediately before the passing of this Act, stood appointed under Section 5 of the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act, 1937, to be the Seanad returning officer.  If he is unable, through illness, then any person appointed by him.  It is felt it would be unfair to ask the Clerk of Seanad Éireann to undertake the responsibilities of returning officer at the first election under this measure without any experience of procedure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="369" /> The other main proposal is to make the existing register of nominating bodies the nominating body for the purpose of the Act.</P>

    <P>(e)  the number on the back of the ballot papers shall be marked upon the outside, and the elector's said number upon the inside, of an envelope (hereinafter referred to as the ballot paper envelope) in the prescribed form;</P>

    <P>(h)  when the foregoing provisions of this Rule have been complied with in respect of all the electors whose names are on the electoral roll, all the said closed outer envelopes shall be collected, counted, and posted.</P>
    <P>5.  Every request for the issue of duplicate ballot papers shall, when received by the Seanad returning officer, be endorsed by him with the day and hour of the receipt thereof by him and with a consecutive number, and duplicate ballot papers issued in pursuance of any such request shall be issued in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing Rule so far as the same are applicable save that, in lieu of the number on the electoral roll, there shall be marked on the counterfoils of such ballot papers the consecutive number endorsed on the request in pursuance of which such ballot papers are issued and that when such <Col N="371" /> ballot papers have been issued the said request shall be disposed of in like manner as the marked copy of the electoral roll is required by these Rules to be disposed of.</P>
    <P>6.  The Seanad returning officer shall post the said closed outer envelopes by delivering them to the nearest head post office, or such other office as may be arranged with the head postmaster, and the postmaster at such office shall stamp with the post office date stamp a form of receipt to be presented by the Seanad returning officer stating the number of envelopes so delivered, and shall immediately forward such envelopes by registered post for delivery to the persons to whom they are addressed.</P>
    <P>7.  The Seanad returning officer, as soon as practicable after the completion of the issue of the ballot papers and in the presence of such candidates and agents as are in attendance, shall make up in separate packets, sealed with his own seal and sealed by such of the said candidates or agents as desire to affix their seals, the marked copy of the electoral roll and the counterfoils of the ballot papers.</P>
    <P>8.  (1)  The following procedure shall be followed in connection with the marking of ballot papers:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the elector in the presence of an authorised person (no other person being present) shall do the following things in the following order:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  he shall produce to the authorised person the following documents sent to him under these Rules:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  the outer envelope,</P>
    <P>(II)  the ballot papers (as respects which the authorised person shall satisfy himself that they are five in number, that they are unmarked and as to whether they are or are not duplicate ballot papers),</P>
    <P>(III)  the covering envelope,</P>
    <P>(IV)  the ballot paper envelope,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="372" /> (ii)  the elector shall mark the number which is on the back of the ballot papers on a form of declaration of identity in the prescribed form furnished to him by the authorised person and which, in case such ballot papers are duplicates, shall be marked by the authorised person with the word &ldquo;duplicate&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>(iii)  the elector shall make and complete the said form of declaration of identity,</P>
    <P>(iv)  the elector shall hand the declaration of identity to the authorised person who, if he is satisfied that the person who made it is the person to whom the outer envelope is addressed, shall sign it and return it to the elector,</P>

    <P>(vi)  the elector shall place the ballot papers, whether marked or unmarked, in the ballot paper envelope,</P>

    <P>(2)  For the purposes of this Rule, each of the following persons shall be an authorised person:</P>
    <P>(a)  the Seanad returning officer,</P>
    <P>(b)  the Clerk of Dáil Eireann,</P>
    <P>(c)  the county registrar for the county or county borough in which <Col N="373" /> is situate the premises the address of which is stated on the outer envelope,</P>
    <P>(d)  the sheriff (if any) for the said county or county borough,</P>
    <P>(e)  the under-sheriff (if any) for the said county or county borough,</P>

    <P>9.  The Seanad returning officer shall provide a ballot box marked &ldquo;Seanad ballot box&rdquo; for the reception of the covering envelopes when returned by the voters, and on the completion of the issue of the ballot papers the Seanad returning officer shall show such ballot box open and empty to the candidates and agents (if any) present, and shall seal such ballot box with his seal and shall make provision for the safe custody of such ballot box.</P>
    <P>10.  The Seanad returning officer shall forthwith place unopened in the Seanad ballot box every covering envelope received by him before the close of the poll and shall seal up unopened in a separate package all covering envelopes received by him after the close of the poll and shall also seal up unopened in a separate package all outer envelopes returned to him as undelivered.</P>
    <P>11.  Not less than three days before the close of the poll, the Seanad returning officer shall send by post to every candidate at his address as stated in the panels of candidates notice in writing of the time and place at which he will open the Seanad ballot box and count the votes.</P>
    <P>12.  As soon as conveniently may be after the close of the poll, the Seanad returning officer shall open the Seanad ballot box and count the votes.</P>
    <P>13.  The Seanad returning officer and his assistants, any candidate and <Col N="374" /> any agent appointed by a candidate, and no other person, except with the permission of the Seanad returning officer, may be present at the opening of the Seanad ballot box or the counting of the votes.</P>
    <P>14.  When the Seanad ballot box has been opened the Seanad returning officer shall do the following things:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  take all the covering envelopes out of the Seanad ballot box and count and note the number thereof;</P>
    <P>(b)  examine separately each such covering envelope and mark with the word &ldquo;rejected&rdquo; any such covering envelope&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  which is not registered,</P>
    <P>(ii)  to which there is not affixed in the prescribed manner the label provided for by Rule 8 of these Rules bearing a certificate duly completed by an authorised person within the meaning of that Rule,</P>
    <P>(iii)  which is open, or</P>
    <P>(iv)  which in his opinion has been opened after it was first closed, or has been attempted to be opened after it was closed;</P>
    <P>(c)  open each such covering envelope not marked as aforesaid and segregate any of those envelopes containing a declaration of identity marked &ldquo;duplicate&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>(d)  take up separately each of the said covering envelopes not so segregated and examine the declaration of identity therein and compare the number on such declaration with the number on the ballot paper envelope in such covering envelope;</P>
    <P>(e)  if the said numbers agree and the declaration of identity is found to be duly completed and made, he shall place the declaration of identity and the ballot paper envelope in separate receptacles;</P>
    <P>(f)  if he is not satisfied that the declaration of identity has been duly completed and made, he shall mark the declaration of identity with the words &ldquo;vote rejected&rdquo; and shall attach thereto the ballot <Col N="375" /> paper envelope, without opening such envelope, or if there is no such envelope, the ballot papers or paper;</P>
    <P>(g)  if he finds that the numbers on the declaration of identity and on the ballot paper envelope do not agree, or if the envelope has no number on it, he shall open the envelope, and if there are five ballot papers therein and the number thereon agrees with the number on the declaration of identity, he shall place the ballot papers respectively in the appropriate one of the special receptacles provided by him for ballot papers;</P>
    <P>(h)  where there are five ballot papers and the number on the ballot papers does not agree with the number on the declaration of identity, he shall replace the ballot papers in their envelope, if any, attach such envelope or ballot papers (as the case may be) to the declaration of identity, and endorse the declaration of identity &ldquo;vote rejected&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>(i)  if the number of ballot papers is not five, he shall replace the ballot papers or paper in their or its envelope (if any), attach such envelope or ballot papers or paper (as the case may be) to the declaration of identity and endorse the declaration of identity &ldquo;vote rejected&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>(j)  where a declaration of identity does not appear to accompany the ballot paper envelope, he shall open the ballot paper envelope, and if it is found to contain the declaration of identity, he shall deal with such declaration and ballot paper envelope in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Rule;</P>
    <P>(k)  he shall mark with the word &ldquo;rejected&rdquo; every declaration of identity which is not accompanied by a ballot paper or which does not bear the number of a ballot paper and every ballot paper which is not accompanied by a declaration of identity;</P>
    <P>

      <P>I would like to make a statement in regard to amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (4) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( ) Whenever a yacht or pleasure boat club is situated in Irish waters it shall not hoist on its club premises, or on the craft of persons who are members of such club, any flag distinctive of nationality other than the national flag, or such specified flag in lieu thereof as may be authorised under warrant in accordance with sub-section (3).  &mdash;(Mr. O'Neill.)</P>
      <P>There are obvious reasons why this amendment could not be accepted.  It proposes to regulate the flying of flags on buildings and premises and this is not appropriate to a Merchant Shipping Bill.  The flying of the national flags of other countries on yacht club premises would have to be considered in regard to the general question of the flying of these flags throughout the State.  There is no legal prohibition on the flying of flags on buildings provided it is not likely to lead to a disturbance of the peace.  It is well known that on the occasion of visits of people from other countries or on the occasion of a competition which would involve the attendance of competitors from other countries, the flying of the flag of those countries as a mark of honour and courtesy is a normal procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the flying of flags on ships, under Section 3 of the Bill Irish-registered or Irish-owned vessels are prohibited from flying any flag other than the Irish national flag or a yacht <Col N="380" /> club ensign approved by the Minister. There is no necessity for an amendment to secure that result.  If the amendment was proposed to ensure that Irish-owned yachts registered in Britain would not be entitled to fly any other flag, it would be difficult to secure by our legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The measure is called the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Bill, but it might be better described as the Hope Deferred Act.  As Deputies will remember, when we enacted the measure last year and extended, until the 31st December, 1947, certain of the powers conferred upon the Government by the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, and the Orders made thereunder, it was hoped that emergency conditions would have largely passed by this date.  It is now obvious that this hope has not been realised.</P>
      <P>Emergency conditions persist in many directions and, in some degree, have even become accentuated during the past 12 months.  There are still world shortages of many vital commodities, notably wheat, oils, fats and sugar and, as Deputies will have learned from recent discussions, there are growing currency difficulties which may give rise to further supply problems in the course of the next few months.  In these circumstances it is obviously necessary that the Government should be enabled to retain powers of control over essential supplies and services. The Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946 (Continuance) Bill, 1947, provides for the continuance of such of the emergency powers as are still necessary for a further period of 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the original Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946, came into force the Government has made every effort to implement its undertaking to abandon all emergency powers which are not essential in present circumstances or to enshrine in permanent legislation those which it <Col N="382" /> has considered desirable to continue. A similar policy in the matter of the shedding of powers no longer required has been followed by individual Ministers in exercise of the functions conferred upon them by the main Orders.</P>
    <P>It would, perhaps, be optimistic to express the hope that this Bill will be required for another year and no longer &mdash;that this time next year we can dispense with rationing and the other controls which will be exercised under it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only two observations to make.  Last year when the Bill, which subsequently became enacted in its present form, was issued, a number of Orders, or the gist of certain Orders that were being maintained, were published and an explanatory memorandum was issued showing what Orders were being continued.  I do not suppose there has been any great change or variety in the extent of any of these Orders since, but very often, when Orders are made, the fact is published in the papers but the actual Orders are not available for quite a considerable time.  These Orders are circulated to Deputies.  I have noticed that very often an Order is made, say, in August which Deputies do not get until October.  Some effort should be made to enable people to become aware of the Orders.  It is true that they are published in the Press but considerable delay takes place between the actual signing of the Order and the time it is issued to Deputies, and very often also to the Government Publications Sales Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point deals with a specific case.  It is one which has been raised on a number of occasions and which is being continued, or the circumstances surrounding it are made possible by virtue of the fact that emergency provisions concerning it continue.  I refer to the question of fresh bread in Dublin and Bray.  An Order is at present in force which prohibits the sale of fresh <Col N="383" /> bread in Dublin and Bray.  I cannot, and anyone familiar with the facts cannot, understand why the people in Dublin and Bray are not able to secure fresh bread.  As I understand it, it has not been found possible to reach agreement between the bankers and the unions concerned.  In a matter of that kind emergency provisions should not be continued.  I understand that the Minister has informed them that this Order will lapse when the present Act lapses but if this particular Act were not passed now the Order would lapse.  I think the Minister should seriously consider the revocation of that Order and thereby make available to the people in Dublin and Bray fresh bread just as in the rest of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in complete agreement on the question of the speedy publication of Orders.  It is very desirable that these Orders should be available to members of the public as quickly as possible after being made. I understand that practical problems are encountered by the Stationery Office in doing that.  It has been their practice to provide stencilled copies where Orders are likely to be required by members of the public engaged in business who are anxious to know the precise terms of the regulations.  Very careful consideration has been given by the officials of the Stationery Office as to the methods that might be adopted for the speeding up of Government publications generally and the publication of Orders in particular.  Certain action has been taken by the Government to facilitate the Stationery Office in that matter.  I am sure there is still some delay although everybody shares the Deputy's anxiety to eliminate it as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Fresh Bread Order, I felt that it was a provision which could be dispensed with also.  It was made in relation to particular circumstances which arose during the emergency and which, I thought, no longer existed; and that given due notice, the bakery trade in Dublin could reorganise itself so as to avoid the necessity for the Order.  It is an Order I dislike because there are many practicable difficulties in enforcing <Col N="384" /> it.  The matter was discussed with both the master bakers and the unions representing the men employed in the trade and at a stage I met both of them myself.  I was convinced by them that the repeal of the Order now would create new difficulties for the bakers in maintaining adequate supplies with present equipment.  They felt that when it becomes possible for them to enlarge their equipment these difficulties would be reduced but that in present circumstances with present equipment they would have problems in maintaining the increased supply of bread required to meet present demands.  It will be appreciated that the demand for bread because of cooking difficulties and other causes is very much higher than normal, particularly in Dublin, even with rationing.  On the other hand, the representatives of the union catering for bread-van drivers also convinced me that the repeal of the Order would impose considerable hardships on their workers who are, at the present time, unable to complete their rounds as expeditiously as in normal times because of the requirements of the rationing scheme, the obligation to collect coupons, check rations and so on.  It appears that, if hot bread were made available, people would buy it even though it is not more economical or better for them but merely on the ground that, because it is hot, they know its exact age.  Therefore, the demands for hot bread would create an increasing problem for bakers in maintaining supplies and a problem for the van men in getting their rounds completed in a reasonable time.  I felt it would be undesirable, therefore, to revoke the Order.</P>
    <P>I told the parties, however, that the Order was not one which could be continued in permanent legislation.  It has defects as an Order, particularly the outstanding defect from my point of view of exceptional difficulty in enforcing it.  But they would have to face the fact that at some stage the Order would cease to operate.  They now know that that will be so in the future. I hope it will be so in 12 months' time and that the Supplies and Services Act will no longer be required.  In that way they are given sufficient time to <Col N="385" /> adapt themselves to meet the situation when it arises.  I think 12 months is ample notice and I am sure they will settle down to the task.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Supplementary Estimate&mdash;Vote 55 (Industry and Commerce).</Title>
    <P>The Dáil, according to order, went into Committee on Finance to consider a Supplementary Estimate for the service of the year ending 31st March, 1948.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £6,089,375 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31 March, 1948, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain Services administered by that Office and payment of certain Subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Estimate is necessary to give effect to the new subsidies which were brought into force recently and which were fully debated in the Dáil at the time.  The total amount required is as follows: For flour subsidy £3,965,000; for batch bread subsidy £100,000; for tea subsidy £730,000; and for sugar subsidy £440,000.  That is a total of £5,325,000.  There was a small saving of £5,000 on the wheat meal subsidy and, as I informed the Dáil recently, we are at present subsidising oatmeal, so as to keep the price unchanged, which it is estimated will cost about £40,000, so that the total expenditure under these headings will be £5,270,000.  So far as wheat is concerned, the new subsidy which reduced the price of flour and bread only accounts for a small portion of the additional sum now being voted. Even if there had been no decision to reduce the price of bread and flour a further Vote of about £3,000,000 would have been required to maintain flour and bread at the previous prices.  The <Col N="386" /> Estimate for flour and bread subsidy introduced at the beginning of the year was £2,000,000 and that was in a sense only a token Estimate as it was then quite impossible to make even an approximate guess as to what the position during the year was likely to be.</P>
    <P>As it turned out, there was a very substantial rise in the cost of imported wheat.  We had to use in this financial year a substantial quantity of imported flour in substitution for wheat, which we could not obtain, and the imported flour cost relatively more than the imported wheat.  There was also in this year a much higher proportion of imported wheat and flour in the grist because we were forced, towards the end of 1946, to use a very high proportion of native wheat due to the fact that imported supplies were not then available.  The native wheat stocks became exhausted early in the year and the proportion of imported wheat and flour in the grist expanded much beyond normal.  Of the total of £3,965,000 now required for flour and bread subsidy we estimate that £3,035,000 would have been required in any event to have kept the price of flour at 63/6 per sack and the price of bread in relation to that price of flour. The decision to reduce the price of flour by 19/3 per sack involves in this financial year further £930,000, which makes up the total sum.  There is an additional vote of £100,000 required for batch bread subsidy.  That is a liability which has accrued.  Under the new system the batch bread subsidy is not payable.  The price of flour has been reduced and the price of bread is related to that reduced price of flour.  There is no special subsidy paid to bakers.  The whole system has been changed; but during the course of the year there accrued this liability to bakers in respect of batch bread subsidy in excess of the amount provided in the Estimate mainly due to increasing costs in bakeries because of higher wages during the year.  The other amounts required here are £730,000 for tea subsidy, which has now come into force and which reduces the retail price from 4/10 to 2/8 per lb., and that amount is what it will cost in this financial year.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the retail price of <Col N="387" /> sugar from 6d. to 4d. will cost in the financial year £440,000, which is also being asked for.  The wheatenmeal subsidy will cost slightly less than anticipated. The new oatmeal subsidy will cost about £40,000.  The price of oatmeal was based upon an average price of oats of 38/- per barrel.  The price of oats has risen substantially above that this year.  The Government considered whether the price of oatmeal should be increased or whether we should hold it at its old figure by a subsidy.  We decided in favour of a policy of subsidy.  It is difficult to say to what extent the problem of maintaining an adequate supply of oatmeal at that price will be increased or diminished by reason of the subsidy policy, but the decision to pay it is in accordance with the general line of policy announced by the Taoiseach last October.</P>
    <P>There is also an additional Estimate in respect of the operations of Bord na Móna.  Because of the complete exhaustion of our turf stocks last spring and a considerable drop in production on account of the unavoidable late start this season, it became evident early in the year that, even with the arrangements which had been made to acquire stocks of firewood, it would be necessary to supplement these fuels with coal in order to obviate a possible repetition of the extreme hardships experienced by householders last winter. It was arranged, therefore, early this summer to procure coal for household use in the United States, which was the only available source of supply of household coal, and as a result it has been possible to include an allowance of coal in the household ration as from 1st October.  Chiefly because of the enormous transport costs in bringing coal from the United States, it would not be possible to retail it at a price less than about £8 15s. per ton.  It was considered that that price would be too high to charge for domestic coal and the Government decided to subsidise it to the extent of bringing the price down to £7 per ton.  The amount of the subsidy required during the present financial year is estimated at £130,000.</P>
    <P>The provision of £1,500,000 already included as fuel subsidy in the Vote <Col N="388" /> for the current year was based on the sales figures of turf and firewood in the previous years.  The non-availability of the expected supplies of turf and the consequent reduction in the turf ration have resulted in a considerable saving on the Estimate and it is hoped that the saving will cover the greater part, if not the whole, of the losses on the sale of household coal.  It is, however, necessary to introduce a special sub-head for coal in the Vote and in the circumstances it is proposed to make a token provision of £5.</P>

Having imported it, they sell it at a price to the millers which enables the millers to produce flour at a fixed price.  That naturally involves a loss to Grain Importers, Limited, and the whole of this amount is required to make good that loss.  It is at that point that the subsidy is injected into the price.</P>

    <P>( ) No contribution under Section 29 of this Act shall, during the appropriate period, be required from a person who is appointed after the commencement of this Part of this Act to be a pensionable officer of a local authority as a result of an examination (whether by way of open competition or otherwise) held before such commencement if any <Col N="401" /> other person was appointed before such commencement to be a pensionable officer of the local authority as a result of that examination.</P>
    <P>In this sub-section, the expression &ldquo;the appropriate period&rdquo; means, as respects a person appointed to be a pensionable officer of a local authority, the period of continuous service of such person beginning when he takes up duty following such appointment.</P>
    <P>Certain anomalies would be created if officers recruited from the same examination were appointed, some before the commencement of the Act and some after it, and the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that that anomaly will not arise.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 55:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (8), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( ) Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a person died on or after the 1st day of January, 1947, and before the commencement of this Part of this Act,</P>
      <P>(b)  such person was, immediately before his death, a pensionable officer of a local authority, and</P>
      <P>(c)  such person, if he had not died and if he had remained in the service of the local authority, could have applied to have his name entered under sub-section (1) of this section,</P>
      <P>the local authority shall have power, which shall be exercisable at their discretion and as respects which, notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, there shall be no appeal, to grant under Section 26 of this Act the like gratuity (if any) as if this Part of this Act had commenced immediately before the death of such person and his name then stood entered under sub-section (1) of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Representations have been made that the dependents of persons who died before the commencement of the Act should be given a lump sum equivalent to one year's salary.  It was decided <Col N="402" /> that the same principle should be followed in this case as in the case of the age limit of existing officers, that is, that we should accept the 1st January, 1947, as the limiting time, and three conditions must be fulfilled.  Firstly, that the death should have occurred on or after the 1st January, 1947. Secondly, that the deceased officer should have reached pensionable status at the time of his death and that the deceased should have reached the age of 60 on the 1st of January, 1947.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  Where, as respects an established servant of a local authority having less than five years of pensionable local service, it is ascertained after any particular year (being a year beginning on the day on which he first became such servant or any anniversary of that day) that he has not worked for the local authority as a permanent servant on two hundred or more days in that year, the local authority shall remove his name from the register and shall <Col N="403" /> inform him of such removal and the reason therefor.</P>
    <P>This is an amendment designed to meet public criticism.  As the sub-section stands it provides definite cancellation of previous pensionable service if, having less than ten years' service, an officer fails to attain 200 days employment in a particular year.  Thus a person with nine years' service might be at a loss and it is proposed to reduce the period of ten years to five years.  It deals with Deputy Larkin's amendment. As will be seen from the terms of amendment No. 62, we propose that the person concerned shall be informed of his removal and the reasons therefor. He will be notified.</P>

      <P>The section, as it stands, enables regulations to be made to deal with the case of an officer of a vocational education committee who, before he was appointed, had teaching service as a primary school teacher or a secondary school teacher.  Unfortunately the officer to whom I think this amendment would apply had a rather more complicated career.  First of all, he was a secondary teacher in a certain town; then he was a technical instructor for a considerable number of years; he then became a secondary teacher in another town; and since &mdash; and for some 17 years or so &mdash; he has been employed by the County Carlow Vocational Education Committee.  Now, under the section as it stands, he will be able to reckon only the last two of these services &mdash; that is to say, the service with the Carlow authority and the service as a secondary teacher in Cork.  To go further back than that would bring in another urban authority responsible <Col N="415" /> for no less than 11 years.  It happens that this urban authority has been complaining very recently about the burden of its pensions and I think I could not, in view of their attitude and against their will, decide to saddle them with the burden of providing for the officer concerned.  I may say that there is nothing to prevent the present employers from adding years to the officer's service on his retirement but, in that event, they would have to bear the cost of such added years subject to the recoupment of 50 per cent. of the added years by the Minister for Education. I do not think I can deal with this case at all.  I am told it is the only case of its kind.  If I were to deal with it I should find it very hard to resist other amendments designed to deal with the personal circumstances of particular officers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

      <P>It is not so much a matter as to whether the particular local authority to whom the Minister has referred is prepared to foot the Bill or not.  I think it is a matter of justice. This teacher has given continuous service in one category or another.  It is true that he left a particular service to go to Cork to take out his degree, but at no time did he break his service and he has given to that particular local authority 11 years' efficient service.  I think purely as a matter of equity the Minister must agree that he is entitled to be considered and that it should not matter whether he was a vocational, technical or secondary school teacher. I think his case should receive sympathetic consideration.  I am sure the Minister is prepared to consider it sympathetically. If he is not prepared to make a final decision on it now, perhaps he will allow it to stand over until the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I wish to appeal to the Minister to give the benefit of this section to the three widows of the fire brigade men who lost their lives in the Pearse Street fire.  That happened some 12 years ago.  At the time the whole country showed its sympathy to these widows and expressed its amazement that there were no pensions available for them other than workmen's compensation.  A good many Deputies and members on the Government Front Bench expressed their sympathy and their regret that nothing could be done. These three widows had a very hard struggle to bring up their families since their husbands were killed when attending to their duties.  Within ten minutes of their leaving Tara Street fire brigade station a terrific explosion took place in Pearse Street which alarmed thousands and ended the lives of these three splendid officers.</P>
      <P>I make an appeal to the Minister in this matter because I believe his sympathy lies in that direction.  It might be in his power under sub-section (5), which says that the Minister may make regulations for the purposes of this section, to do something in connection with these cases.  I appeal to him to send out a Christmas message to these widows that something will be done for them and that they will be included in the Bill.</P>

If I were to make the Bill retrospective for the number of years that Deputy Byrne wishes <Col N="417" /> me, the burden on the local authorities would be an impossible one.  When making these pleas, we ought to act with some responsibility.  The widows concerned in this matter have already got compensation.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister should get into a huff because I put the matter to him in the way that I did. I appealed to him to include these people and he says that I should act with some responsibility.  I hold I am acting with responsibility because I was encouraged by the sympathy expressed from the Government Front Bench at the time the men were killed.  Their dependents received the sympathy of the country and of the Government and the Government expressed regret that they could do nothing for them.  There was a public appeal made and everybody who helped on that occasion expressed amazement that nothing was being done for the widows of these three brave men who gave their lives in the exercise of their duty.</P>
      <P>This clause would not be in the Bill at all only for the agitation that was created following the death of these three men.  These widows have had a hard time since their husbands died leaving them with families to rear. They have reared their families very well.  I feel sure that my appeal to the Minister to include these three widows will be supported by every Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has suggested that the dependents of the men who lost their lives in this unfortunate occurrence have not received compensation. The fact is that the following compensation was paid: Mrs. McArdle and her children, £600; Mrs. Anne Malone and her son, £500; Thomas and Mrs. K. Nugent, father and mother of one of the deceased, £100.  The firemen concerned paid a weekly contribution of 4d. under the Widows and Orphans Pension Act and the payment to the widows commenced on 6th October, 1936.  The payment to Mrs. McArdle was at the rate of 35/- per week, which has been increased since, and to Mrs. Malone at the rate of 15/- per week.  It must be obvious to everyone what a hollow sham and humbug the Deputy's <Col N="420" /> action is, because he knew that the persons for whom he spoke had already received compensation.  Yet, as I have said, in order that he may be able to stand up in this House as their champion and to point to me as the person who refused to listen to his <i>ad misericordiam</i> appeal, as the hard-hearted Minister, he makes this public demonstration, knowing well that neither I nor any other person with a sense of responsibility to the citizens and ratepayers of the City of Dublin could grant it.</P>

      <P>Before Section 75 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Where an officer of a local authority to whom Part IV of the Local Government Act, 1925, applies, ceases to hold office during the period commencing 1st November, 1946, and ending on 31st March, 1950, the expression &ldquo;yearly salary and emoluments&rdquo; shall for the purposes of the said Part IV of that Act, be deemed to mean salary, fees and emoluments of which such officer is in receipt at the time he ceases to hold office.</P>

    <P>(2)  Where an officer of a local authority &mdash; or an officer of the Electricity Supply Board who had been transferred to the service of that board from a local authority and had not elected to be deemed to have surrendered the superannuation benefits to which he was entitled by virtue of his transfer to the service of the board &mdash; ceased to hold office at any time prior to 1st November, 1946, and was granted an annual allowance for life in relation to his having so ceased to hold office, such allowance shall, if it is an allowance which is variable from time to time in accordance with the average cost of living in Éire, be increased as follows, and shall be deemed to have been so increased as from 1st November, 1946:&mdash;the variable <Col N="423" /> element therein shall be adjusted to the cost-of-living index of 270 and the Local Authorities (Cost-of-Living) Act, 1940, and the Local Authorities (Cost-of-Living) (Amendment) Act, 1945, shall be amended accordingly.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where an officer of a local authority &mdash; or an officer of the Electricity Supply Board who had been transferred to the service of that board from a local authority and had not elected to be deemed to have surrendered the superannuation benefits to which he was entitled by virtue of his transfer to the service of the board &mdash; ceased to hold office at any time prior to 1st November, 1946, and was granted an annual allowance for life in relation to his having so ceased to hold office, such allowance shall, if it is an allowance which is not variable from time to time in accordance with the average cost of living in Éire, be increased as follows, and shall be deemed to have been so increased as from 1st November, 1946:&mdash;the allowance payable as at 31st October, 1946, shall be deemed to have been calculated in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (2) of Section 46 of the Local Government Act, 1925, on a cost-if-living index of 175 and the variable element so ascertained shall be adjusted to a cost-of-living index of 270.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make provision for the cases of officials who retired before May, 1940.  I feel that they should have their pensions adjusted to meet the increased cost-of-living inasmuch as they are faced with exactly the same adverse circumstances as all other local government pensioners.  The majority of them are older, and some of them have smaller pensions, than their colleagues who retired at a later date and their expectation of life is naturally shorter.  They are not a very large body and the cost of granting their just claim would not be a heavy burden on the ratepayers. The justice of their claim has been admitted by representatives of all political parties and by Independents.  Press comments, too, have been most favourable. In view of the consensus of public <Col N="424" /> opinion in their favour, there is surely no valid reason why the Government should hesitate to meet their case by embodying the requisite clause in the Bill.</P>

On the other hand, the allowance is just sufficient to prevent their qualifying for any other benefits or services administered by the Department of Local Government or the Minister for Social Welfare.  These men and women are suffering very great hardships and I think the Minister should accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is necessary to accept the amendment in view of the amendment which I have just moved.  The new section is very wide in its terms and it will allow all that the Deputy desires.  With regard to sub-section (2) of the amendment which deals with the question of adjusting the variable elements, so as to bring them into some relation to the cost-of-living index, I am taking this question of the cost-of-living bonus on existing pensions into consideration, and I may move an amendment on the Report Stage to deal with it.  I cannot, however, do anything to deal with the position of those persons who retired before the emergency, and I do not think I should, in a Bill of this kind.  Accordingly, as far as sub-section (3) is concerned, I think I would not be able to meet the Deputy in any way.</P>

I should like to say, as I have already indicated, that I may be in a <Col N="425" /> position to move an amendment on the Report Stage dealing with the position of persons who retired on pension between the 1st July, 1940, and the 31st of October, 1946, with pensions based upon the cost-of-living bonus.</P>

      <P>(2) Where, as respects a person who holds an established position in the Civil Service of the Government on the passing of this Act, the following conditions are complied with, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  immediately before he commenced to hold such position, he held an established position in the Civil Service of Saorstát Éireann for a period,</P>
      <P>(b)  immediately before the period mentioned in paragraph (a) of this sub-section, he held a temporary position in the Civil Service of Saorstát Éireann for a period,</P>

    <P>the periods mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (d) of this sub-section may be aggregated and deemed to be service for the purposes of the Superannuation Acts as applying to such person.</P>
    <P>We have used the term &ldquo;Civil Service&rdquo; throughout the Bill and in Section 2 we have defined it by reference to certain other Acts.  We want to make it quite clear here that, in the particular cases of these officers, some of whom held temporary positions in the service of Saorstát Éireann and some of whom held temporary positions in the service of the Provisional Government or otherwise, they should all be regarded as having served in the Civil Service and that their service should be aggregated for pension purposes. I want to reconsider the amendment and it is probable that on the Report Stage I will bring in an amendment to delete paragraph (c) of this amendment.  I do not think it is altogether necessary.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 132:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 81, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>81.&mdash;(1)  Where a servant of the corporation was absent from duty during any period in respect of which this section applies and the period of absence would, but for this section, be regarded for the purposes of the pension enactments as breaking the continuity of his service with the corporation, the following provisions shall have effect for those purposes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the period of absence shall be regarded as not breaking the continuity of his service with the corporation, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="427" /> (b)  notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing paragraph, the length of the period of absence shall not be taken into account in reckoning the length of his service with the corporation nor, where an allowance for life or a gratuity is granted to him, in reckoning the amount thereof.</P>
    <P>(2) In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;the corporation&rdquo; means the mayor, aldermen and burgesses of Limerick;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;period in respect of which this section applies&rdquo; means any period beginning on or after the 30th day of June, 1944, and ending before or on the 6th day of July, 1944;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;the pension enactments&rdquo; means, in relation to a servant of the corporation, the enactments (including this Act) governing the grant to him on ceasing to be employed of an allowance for life or a gratuity.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have approached me from time to time regarding the position of the servants of the Limerick Corporation during the period of the emergency.  They took strike action and, in doing so, they lost their pensionable service.  Representations were made to me from time to time to restore the continuity of service.  In general, I am very strongly against that, because I think people who are in the public service and are in the enjoyment of secure employment with pensionable rights ought to think twice before they decide to dislocate the public service.  In this particular case action was taken by a certain section of the employees of the Limerick Corporation which might have endangered the health of the citizens.  For that reason I would have been even more obdurate than normal in refusing to restore them to the position which they forfeited by their own action.  However, as we are passing this superannuation code, which will apply in general to the whole country, I am prepared to allow these people to make a fresh start and to restore the pensionable service which they enjoyed prior to the occurrences of June and July, 1944.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 133:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 81 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Any superannuation allowance granted by the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of Cork to any of their servants during the period which began on the 9th day of September, 1926, and ended on the 31st day of March, 1948, shall be valid in all respects and payment of such allowance may accordingly continue to be made after the passing of this Act.</P>
      <P>This is to cover the cases of certain employees of the Cork Corporation. During the period from 9th September, 1926, up to the present, certain employees of the Cork Corporation were paid small weekly retiring allowances. These were people who retired on the ground of permanent infirmity.  The corporation so far has not had any power to superannuate these employees and accordingly it is questionable whether the payments were legal or not and we have decided that the payments should be regularised so that the persons concerned will not be open to further surcharge.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;An officer of a local body in relation to whom Part IV of the Act of 1925 or any Act passed before the Act of 1925 and relating to superannuation applies shall be entitled to reckon as service for the purposes of the said Part IV or the said Act passed before the Act of 1925 any period during which he held a pensionable position in the service of a harbour authority.</P>
