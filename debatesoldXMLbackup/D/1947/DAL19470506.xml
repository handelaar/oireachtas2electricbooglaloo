      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state the number of persons leaving Ireland, in each month subsequent to April, 1946, to take up employment in the mining industry in Great Britain.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to furnish the figures required by the Deputy.  The travel permit application forms, on the basis of which the available statistics are compiled, show the previous occupation of the applicant in this country, but not the precise nature of the employment in Great Britain to which he is proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Are no records kept of the type of vocation which the person proposes to follow?  In other words, has the Department here not to be satisfied as to the character of the person's employment in Great Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  I am not aware that it has.  It is a very elaborate form as it is and if we were to try to change it to include information of the type the Deputy wants it would make it still more elaborate. Then it would be no use because the person could change the week after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally, before a person can get a permit to leave this country he has to have an approved offer of work from the British Ministry of Labour.  That approved offer of work comes through the Department of Industry and Commerce here.  Is any <Col N="2060" /> record kept of the character of the vocation which our people follow when they leave here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not think so.  It must be obvious that we cannot control the person after he leaves this country.  The moment they leave the country they are completely free to go to any work.  We can ask, and we do ask, in some form like this, what their previous occupation here has been and in general terms the purpose of their journey abroad but they will only reply that it is to get work, or something like that.  Any statistics that we could get would not be worth while.</P>

      <P>Whilst the manuscript tables of the <i>Statistical Abstract,</i> 1946, were sent for printing at the usual time&mdash;July-August&mdash;there has been considerable delay in obtaining printers' proofs, presumably because of pressure on printing facilities.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received applications for supplementary bread rations from persons employed at the Lullymore Briquette Factory.  I have granted extra rations to persons who were engaged at the time of their applications in categories of employment to which the supplemental scheme then applied, which did not include the production of turf.  Some applications from workers at Lullymore were accordingly refused.  I am now prepared to reconsider these cases and treat them on the same basis as turf workers, but it is necessary that the applications should be renewed.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the proposed new maternity hospital to replace the Erinville Lying-In Hospital.  Before that project could proceed it was necessary to make arrangements for the integration of the hospital services for maternity cases provided in Cork by voluntary effort and by the local authorities.  For this purpose the trustees of the Erinville Lying-In Hospital submitted an application for an establishment Order under the Hospitals Act, 1939.  In view of the local objections to the application, it was decided to defer making an Order pending further review of the <Col N="2065" /> general position.  The secretary to the hospital authority was so informed on the 28th January last.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, steps were recommended to be taken towards the provision by the South Cork Board of Assistance of additional temporary accommodation for maternity patients in the Cork area.  Proposals submitted in this connection by the local authority were referred by my Department to the Hospitals Commission. The report of the commission is at present being examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if a decision has yet been reached on the proposed sanatorium at Santry Court; and if so, the nature of such decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a question on this subject on the 27th March I intimated that work under the site development contract had been suspended pending consideration of the advisability of proceeding with the establishment of the sanatorium on the Santry Court site.  I added that certain circumstances arose which prevented the work being carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The circumstances referred to are the unforeseen development of air traffic at Collinstown Airport which has rendered it necessary to provide facilities for the accommodation of aircraft of the heaviest type.  This has necessitated the provision of new and extended runways to permit transcontinental aircraft to land and take off at the airport.  Santry Court is located within a few miles of Collinstown. The extension of the runways and the use of them by very heavy aircraft might involve danger to the patients in a sanatorium in close proximity to the airport in the possible event of any aircraft meeting with mishap.  It is clear, however, that the noise caused by heavy aircraft passing frequently over the sanatorium at low altitudes would be injurious to the health of patients suffering from a disease for which rest is of primary importance.  I have carefully considered these matters and I am advised <Col N="2066" /> that I would not be justified in establishing the sanatorium in such close proximity to the extended airport.</P>
    <P>Negotiations for the acquisition of an alternative site are at present in progress. While the abandonment of Santry Court will result in delay in the completion of the work, such delay will not be as great as might appear, since it is considered that the buildings designed for the Santry Court site should require no extensive modifications if they are located on the alternative site, the acquisition of which is being negotiated.</P>
    <P>In view of the delay which has occurred, I have taken special measures to provide at an early date additional patients' accommodation in existing institutions.  This additional accommodation will total approximately 370 beds.</P>
    <P>The plans of the pavilions which have been completed in the Department have been placed at the disposal of the authorities of Peamount and Newcastle Sanatoria and it has been agreed that three such pavilions, containing a total of 120 beds, will be provided at Peamount Sanatorium, while two more, containing 80 beds, will be erected at Newcastle.  Tenders for the work at Peamount have been accepted and the contractor has undertaken to complete the work in stages, so that one pavilion will be completed in six months, while the entire work will be completed in approximately 15 months. It is expected that the 80 beds at Newcastle will be completed in approximately the same time.</P>
    <P>Sixty extra beds will be provided for tuberculous persons in the Hardwicke Hospital.  The plans for the work have been approved and tenders will be invited within a week or so.  The estimated time for completion is nine months.  A further 43 beds are being made available in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Dún Laoghaire.  The plans have been completed and tenders for the work invited so that the project will proceed almost immediately.  The Dublin City Manager has intimated that he proposes to take immediate steps to accommodate 64 extra patients in the new ward block at Rialto Hospital.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2067" /> Every effort will be made to expedite the completion of the regional sanatorium but it will be appreciated that very considerable difficulties are being encountered in carrying out building projects of this nature.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that, under the 1920 Insurance Act, clerical workers in receipt of wages in excess of £5 a week are excluded from receipt of unemployment benefits when unemployed; that, as a result of recent increases in wages given to meet the increased cost of living, many thousands of clerks and others engaged in semi-clerical employment, who were in insurable occupations and had many years' contributions to their credit, are now being informed that the recent increases in wages place them outside the class of persons entitled to receive unemployment benefits; and if he will make a statement on the position in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that non-manual workers remunerated at a rate in excess of £250 per annum are not insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  While I have little evidence of a general desire amongst such persons to be brought within the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Acts nevertheless I have under consideration the question of promoting legislation for the purpose of raising the existing limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should mention, however, that non-manual workers who, by virtue of increases in remuneration, cease to be insured under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, will retain all their benefit rights until a whole insurance year from October to October during which no contribution is paid has elapsed.  This period may extend to almost two years when the last contribution is paid in the first or an early week of an insurance year.  It is only when no contribution is paid during a period of five insurance years that the contributions previously paid cease to be available for benefit.  If at any time during these five years 12 contributions <Col N="2068" /> are paid all the contributions to credit become available for the contributor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand that the Minister agrees with the question that there are many thousands now going out of unemployment insurance simply because they got an increase in wages to meet the increased cost of living, and does he intend to introduce legislation to bring them back into insurance and put them in the same position they were in up to now?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1920, £5 was the limit.  That, in 1947, with war increases to meet the increased cost of living, brings the £3 10s. a week man up to £5 and that man now is being put out of insurance.  I appeal to the Minister to introduce legislation to bring him back into full insurance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">

      <P>I am aware that the County Meath Vocational Education Committee recommended the closing of the day classes at the three schools mentioned for the reasons stated in the Deputy's question.  That recommendation referred only to the whole-time day classes, and the schools in question would continue to be used for evening classes.  The adverse conditions of recent years, and especially of the past year, have interfered seriously with the attendance at day technical schools in rural districts.  For instance, the harvest conditions during last autumn delayed or prevented <Col N="2070" /> enrolments, and the unusually severe weather during February and March prevented the attendance of pupils who live at a distance from the schools. In the circumstances, it is rather premature to say that the schools in question have proved failures.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that there is any need to hold a formal inquiry, such as the Deputy appears to suggest, in connection with the position of those schools, as the Department is already aware of all the circumstances, and I understand the vocational education committee proposes to reconsider its recommendation regarding them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether, and if so when, it is proposed to relieve urban authorities, who have established vocational schools, from liability to bear 50 per cent. of the retiring allowances and gratuities payable to teachers in such schools; and also, if he will state the reasons for continuing to impose upon rating authorities such an obligation which, in the case of primary and other teachers, is accepted as the sole responsibility of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The obligation of local authorities, including urban authorities, for the retiring allowances and gratuities of teachers and other pensionable officers employed by the vocational education committees appointed by these authorities, is fixed by Section 25 of the Vocational Education Act, 1930.  Under subsection (3) of that section the local authorities are refunded by means of a State grant one half the cost of these allowances and gratuities, and it is not proposed to alter that arrangement. The teachers in question are local officers, appointed and employed by the local vocational education committees, and it is in accordance with the normal practice that the obligation for their pensions and retiring gratuities should be borne by the local authorities.  It is not correct to assume that this obligation is accepted as the sole responsibility of the State in the case of all other teachers, as the pensions of secondary teachers are paid <Col N="2071" /> from a pension fund to which the schools managers and the teachers contribute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The reception which this Bill has received is a tribute to the value of the consideration which the previous Bill got here.  The fact that there were so many amendments on the Order Paper for consideration when the last Bill was withdrawn amply demonstrates the useful nature of the discussions which took place here and the advantages which can be derived from discussing, even at length, a measure of this kind.  The Minister's introductory speech augurs well for the consideration of this measure and, I may say, augurs well for the schemes that are envisaged in it.  Therefore I should like to deal with certain aspects of this Bill rather than anything that preceded it either here or elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important aspect of the Bill and of the various schemes under it, in so far as it affects people other than the medical profession or patients, <Col N="2098" /> will be the cost.  So far the Minister has not given any indication of the cost of the particular services which are envisaged in the Bill.  I appreciate that it would be difficult at this stage to give anything other than a rough estimate of the total cost but I did hope that the Minister would indicate to the House the personnel and the cost of the particular personnel required for schemes which may be expected to be put into operation in the near future.  Many Deputies in considering the Bill have come to the rather rapid conclusion that immediately on its enactment we shall have entirely different health services available. I think anyone who has come to that conclusion takes an optimistic view of the services provided in the Bill or the services which may be provided, but which may not be fully organised for years to come.  A few years ago legislation was passed here dealing with regional sanatoria but I think up to the present any work carried out in these sanatoria has been of a very limited character.  Some of them have not even been started.  I only hope that when this Bill is passed, rapid development will take place on the various schemes.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give the House an indication in his reply of the extent to which facilities will be available, assuming that this measure is brought into operation by the end of the year.  So far as my information goes, the present supply of medical men in the country&mdash;certainly the numbers engaged in local health services or as county medical officers&mdash; will be insufficient to cope with the increased services provided under this Bill.  I think that some consultation should take place between the Department and these medical practitioners, in regard to the increased work which must fall on them when the new services are in operation.  As the Minister is aware the pay and allowances of dispensary doctors are at present on the meagre side and are barely sufficient to enable them to run their cars and furnish them with the smallest amount of necessary equipment.  If these men are to operate more extensive schemes, such as mother and <Col N="2099" /> child welfare and school medical inspection, they will be called upon to shoulder much heavier responsibilities than they have had to bear in the past. Unless these doctors are suitably provided for by way of increased salaries, it will scarcely be possible to get applicants for these positions as they fall vacant in future.</P>
    <P>I think that an indication should be given by the Minister to the profession in general that he has had this matter under consideration, that any views which they may put forward in connection with it will be considered, that a system of consultation will be provided under which the medical officers can make any representations they wish or, alternatively, that some scheme of compensation will be made available for dispensary doctors and other medical officers who suffer as a result of this Bill.  So far as I can see, there are two likely results.  One is that existing practitioners may find that when these services are instituted, patients they formerly treated will no longer come to them as they will find that their needs may be met by the new services which may be made available. In that way many doctors will lose a considerable portion of their practice.  On the other hand, private practitioners who are available at the moment for child welfare and various other services for which this Bill will now cater, will find that their practices have decreased.  I think that the Minister must either provide some compensation for these people or make the terms of appointment for new positions so attractive that such doctors will be attracted to them, so that not merely will it not be necessary to compensate any existing practitioners but that they will be able to assist in carrying on the new services under conditions which will take due cognisance of the fact that they had in the past depended on private practice which to a large extent is now being destroyed by the schemes made available under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to indicate what are his proposals concerning the isolation of certain patients.  The particular patients I have in mind are <Col N="2100" /> those suffering from tuberculosis.  As I understand the matter, many of the general hospitals or the voluntary hospitals dealt with all forms of disease but had separate wings or apartments for tuberculosis and other infectious cases.  Proper segregation was provided and precautions were taken to ensure that no person suffering from an infectious disease came in contact in any way with other patients.  At the same time, in teaching hospitals students were able to carry out a clinical examination of patients in the different stages of particular diseases. They were able to see patients before they were sent to a particular wing or before they were segregated.  I understand that it is proposed in this Bill to segregate all cases of infectious disease in separate hospitals.  While considerable support may be forthcoming for that particular method of treatment, from the point of view of the teaching hospitals I understand it is undesirable that students should have to be brought into separate hospitals where they know, before they enter these hospitals, that the patients are suffering from a particular disease. If some patients of that type were housed in a general hospital where other patients are also treated, the students could more readily appreciate the difficulties associated with diagnosis. I would suggest to the Minister that permission should be afforded the teaching hospitals to continue the existing system where they think it desirable provided they satisfy the Minister and his medical officers that adequate precautions are being taken to prevent the infection spreading.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides ample machinery for school medical inspection and sufficient machinery for informing the school manager that inspection is to be carried out but no provision is made in the Bill for informing parents. There is, of course, the fact that the manager may inform the children and, in that way, the children may inform their parents.  The Minister appreciates, as the House must also appreciate, that very often children to not tell their parents, and, if they do tell them, their parents do not heed them.  Frequently, although not as frequently now as in the past, parents object to <Col N="2101" /> a general medical inspection, and some provision should be inserted with regard to giving adequate notice to parents and with regard to allowing parents who are prepared to have their children inspected or treated separately, the option of doing so, with the proviso that they produce satisfactory evidence that the child has been or will be inspected at intervals as frequent as the normal routine medical inspection in the schools.</P>
    <P>The most welcome feature of the Bill is the provision in Section 39 for a maintenance allowance to a patient and the dependents of a patient, in the event of that patient being unable, because of infectious disease, to provide for his or her family.  The House is aware that in the past one of the greatest worries of tuberculosis sufferers has been the fact that, while they are ill, their families or dependents were unable to provide adequately for themselves, and in many cases a patient's recovery has been delayed because of worry and anxiety in that connection.  In Section 39, provision is being made whereby a local authority can pay either a particular sum, a salary, to a patient or defray the cost of the employment of another person who will carry on the patient's work while he is sick.</P>
    <P>I do not know what consideration the Minister has given to the rate of benefits which will be allowed.  As I understand from a body which has had close association with tuberculosis sufferers, one of the worries was the fact that up to this no indication was given that there would be a general level standard throughout the country, that the standard might be set by each local authority, and that each local authority would decide for itself the particular rate of benefit.  I think it is advisable that a uniform rate of benefit should be payable, with possible provision for the difference in the cost of living in urban and rural areas. Apart from that, there is no case for having one rate payable by one local authority and another rate by a different local authority.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister has altered the original Bill to provide that half the cost may be borne by the State. <Col N="2102" /> That is desirable, because under the schemes which will be put into operation, it is obvious that the cost to the local authorities will be quite considerable. I do not know whether the Minister can give any indication on the basis of the number of patients at present suffering from tuberculosis, but in Sweden, for the first six months, the patient suffering from an infectious disease is allowed two-thirds of his salary and, after that, half his salary while incapacitated.  I do not know whether these allowances were arrived at after consideration of the cost of living there, but that scheme has been operated in Sweden successfully for quite a number of years, and the Minister might well consider the advisability of adopting a similar scheme or a similar standard here.</P>
    <P>One matter on which the Minister dwelt briefly is the necessity for a very large increase in the number of nurses available.  I do not think the Minister has any idea as to how sufficient nurses can be provided if this Bill is operated fully and all the schemes envisaged put into operation.  Last year certain discussions took place between nursing associations and the Minister's Department. Some of these associations were very perturbed by the possibility that, once the scheme was put into operation, the voluntary nurses or the nursing associations which receive small State grants and which depend mainly on voluntary contributions might find themselves in difficulties. The Minister will realise that, for many years to come, there will be work for these voluntary nursing associations and the Minister should reassure the members of these associations, and in particular the nurses who work under them, that not merely will they be required, but that every assistance will be given to provide them with the necessary equipment and with sufficient salaries to enable them to continue their work.</P>
    <P>I refer in particular to the Jubilee Nursing Association.  That association was founded many years ago, and, in the western areas, in Donegal and some of the other congested districts, has done very valuable work.  There are <Col N="2103" /> at present about 260 nurses working. Some of these are members of the Queen's Institute of District Nursing and others of the Jubilee Nursing Association.  These titles may at present seem rather out of date, but nevertheless the nurses give the service, and I think their services are appreciated by the people of these districts.  Every effort should be made to facilitate these associations in future, and not merely should they be facilitated, but there should be the fullest co-operation between them and the Department.  If co-operation can be secured between these associations and the Department, I feel that not only will the future of the nursing associations be assured but the working of the proposed schemes may well be simplified, and the difficulties in many districts of securing nurses lessened by taking into consideration the existing services and, if necessary, extending them, or working these existing services into the new services envisaged in the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to institutions which may be taken over or set up by local authorities after a local inquiry, the Minister referred to the fact that a local authority could set up an institution, and, on his direction, must set up an institution after the holding of a local inquiry.  Many of these old institutions, set up under former régimes in entirely different circumstances from those which exist at present, have far outlived their usefulness. Many of them have been modified, extended and improved, but nearly all have attaching to them the stigma which attached to the old workhouse, and I suggest that every effort should be made to provide new buildings. Some Deputies express surprise that an institution like St. Kevin's should not be acceptable to many people, but anyone with any experience of the old St. Kevin's Institution, with its severe drab buildings and its historical background, cannot fail to realise that there is good reason for that dislike.  While rapid strides and great development have taken place there under the commissioner, nevertheless the institution is <Col N="2104" /> unsuited to present-day needs.  The buildings are depressing and do not lend themselves to easy adaptation and in general the institution has the flavour of the institutions so well described by Dickens.  I suggest to the Minister that no effort should be spared to urge on local authorities the necessity for providing modern, up-to-date institutions.  It is true to say that some of these institutions can be adapted, at any rate for particular patients or particular types of patients, but, in general, the gathering together of acute and chronic cases, which has been the system at St. Kevin's in the past, is objectionable.  Anybody with experience of it must look forward to the day when those patients will be segregated either by providing one institution for acute and another for chronic cases or by providing an entirely new institution.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give the House some information as to the personnel of the health council.  As I understand, a temporary council is operating at present.  Will the Minister continue that council on a permanent basis or will he provide branch councils or an entirely new council?  Can the Minister say what arrangements are contemplated for the calling together of members of the council?  How frequently will the council meet?  Will the calling of it depend on the Minister and will it just consider matters referred to it by the Minister?  Or will the council exercise its own discretion so far as general matters of health are concerned and the number of occasions on which it will meet?</P>
    <P>The provision concerning food and drink in Part V is welcome.  In many cases that provision is, I think, necessary. Part VI, which deals with proprietary and standard medicines, is also welcome.  Doctors consider that many of these medicines confer considerable benefit.  Some of them are useless but some of them are effective in minor ailments&mdash;if only psychologically.  The Minister should make regulations under the section providing that the ingredients of these medicines be shown on the container and that those ingredients be available to purchasers.  It is desirable to have such a safeguard. <Col N="2105" /> Many of these medicines do give on the bottle particulars of the ingredients but many others do not.  It should be compulsory on all proprietary medicine manufacturers to indicate to the public the nature and quality of the substance which they produce and sell.</P>
    <P>The only other matter to which I should like to refer goes to the root of the public health services.  Has the Minister carried out a nutritional survey?  While Deputies praise the provision which is being made in the Bill for health services and the provision which was available in the past, I think that much of our trouble from tuberculosis is attributable to lack of proper nutrition.  Many of our people are obliged to live to a standard lower than that which would afford them proper food, with the necessary health-building properties.  If people are obliged to live to a standard beneath that on which they can properly maintain themselves, it is inevitable that a disease such as tuberculosis will occur. The Minister should, as a prerequisite to consideration of any schemes in the future, hold a nutritional survey and, on the strength of that survey, adopt certain standards.  Unless that be done, we are bound to have recurring tuberculosis.  While we may provide for that in Bills, we are failing in our first duty&mdash;to provide a sufficient standard for the wage-earning families of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my appreciation of the welcome which the general principles of this Bill received from the various Parties in the House.  There was some criticism of the clauses.  Deputies expressed a desire to have some of the clauses amended.  I have no objection to that I should like to have the co-operation of all Parties and I promise to give every consideration to any constructive amendment which may be proposed. If we can succeed in bringing the Bill nearer to perfection as we go through the various stages, I shall be very glad, indeed.  There is no necessity to dwell on the aim or main principle of the Bill&mdash;to improve the health of the people.  Naturally, every Deputy agrees that that should be done and <Col N="2106" /> that we should make the necessary provision to that end so far as we can. As to what should be done, there is, admittedly, great room for difference of opinion.  It would, probably, be impossible to get any two Deputies to agree to every little detail of a Bill of this kind.  All I can hope for is to get the general consensus of opinion of the Dáil on the Bill as it goes through its various stages.</P>
      <P>I was asked whether or not we had consulted various interests before bringing in this Bill.  A Minister is in a difficulty in doing that.  I did consult the medical profession on certain principles of the Bill at one meeting.  I had to explain to them that I was not at liberty to circulate a copy of the Bill, that members of the Dáil must be the first to see a Bill.  I was, therefore, not in a position to go into great detail but I did explain to the medical gentlemen I met what I thought we should aim at and what, roughly, were the proposals we were putting up to that end.  I had their views.  It might be said that they differed on some of these matters, just as we differ here. On the whole, I think I might say that the medical men would take much the same view as the members of the Dáil. They all agreed that we should do everything possible to improve the health of the people but they, probably, would not agree on the various clauses we were inserting in the Bill. Some of them might agree to some clauses and others might disagree. One of the points of which I took note at the conference was raised here by the last speaker, Deputy Cosgrave.  I shall refer to it later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having got agreement on the principle at which we should aim, we draft a scheme for dealing with people and their health.  It is a simple thing to say that everybody comes under a certain scheme and, if we depart from that, we must give some sort of reason why we stop at a certain stage.  Take mother-and-child welfare.  We might say that it applies to those who are not able to afford to look after themselves. In a scheme of that kind, it is extremely difficult to apply a means test.  From the administrative point of view, it is much simpler to say that <Col N="2107" /> they are all entitled to free treatment. We go a bit further in this Bill and say that, if they satisfy the medical officer of the district that they have looked after themselves by employing a private practitioner, then we are satisfied&mdash;for the moment, at any rate.</P>
    <P>As regards infectious diseases, there is a principle to be determined.  We all start off by agreeing that it is desirable to stamp out infectious disease, but how far we should go in interfering with individual liberty in our efforts is something we have to decide.  I am not very much impressed with the talk of certain Deputies about individual liberty, as it is just whatever we are accustomed to that we put up with.  For instance, if a man goes mad and becomes a menace to himself or to his neighbour or to property, the law is that he can be put into an asylum and kept there by compulsion and I suppose we all agree that that is a good law.  None of us would have the temerity to propose that the law should be changed and that that man should have his individual liberty and be allowed to kill himself or his neighbour or burn his neighbour's house if he so desired.  That is because it is a long established practice and we all agree with it.  If, however, a person gets a very infectious disease like typhus, we say we must deal with that person, if he is unreasonable and is not going to protect himself, as he will die from typhus if he will not take treatment.  We say we must not allow that person to spread typhus to his neighbours as he will not stay in the room where we want to isolate him, neither can we allow him to do damage of any kind; and we say we must apply compulsion where necessary.</P>
    <P>I cannot see very much difference between a person suffering from typhus or a man who has become a lunatic, as if the sufferer from typhus is not reasonable and does not take advice from the medical profession, he is just as great a menace to himself and his neighbour as the lunatic.  We have to deal with them and the question is how far we should exercise compulsion. Every Deputy will agree that we should <Col N="2108" /> try to have the dangerous case of infection isolated&mdash;and isolated in his own house, if possible.  If he is agreeable to that, I do not see any necessity for any powers to remove that man from his own house and put him into an institution against his will.  If there is no opportunity of isolating him in his own house and if he is unreasonable and negligent of his own life and that of his family and his neighbours, the question is whether we should have some powers to deal with him or not. That question of compulsion is one that arose more in the discussion than any other and I may come back to it again when I am dealing with the points made by individual Deputies.</P>
    <P>The Dáil lays down the principles and I have to make as good a case as I can for the powers I need to deal with the problems coming before us in this Bill.  If I can persuade the Dáil to give me certain powers, then it is for me and for my Department and for the medical officers acting under this Bill throughout the country to use those powers in a sensible and a commonsense way.  I met the medical profession and discussed with them certain principles in the Bill, but I could not deal with the details.  I explained to them that when the Bill was passed, its implementation would be done mostly by regulation and, the Bill having been published and everyone having seen it and the Dáil having given its imprimatur to whatever final form may be agreed upon, I would be quite free to come to the medical profession and say I would like to discuss the regulations with them.  I am sure they will be only too willing to help me as far as they can and that we will get co-operation on the regulations from the profession and from any other interests that may be concerned.</P>
    <P>In my speech on the Second Reading, I spoke of the method of implementing this Bill.  If it is passed through both Houses, the next steps I will have to take will be to find how far I can give effect to the approved policy of the Oireachtas through the machinery we have at the moment.  Then we will have to make up our minds as to what changes may be necessary in that machinery.  I told the House, when <Col N="2109" /> moving the Second Reading, that there is a survey being made of the dispensaries throughout the country. That survey has been undertaken by the Department of Health and when the report comes in we will be in a very good position to make up our minds whether the existing machinery is adequate to carry out the principles laid down in the Bill or whether it must be amended, or whether we must add new machinery.  Having decided on that and having made whatever changes may be necessary, a very big cog in the whole machinery will be the medical profession.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies spoke about the salaries paid to dispensary doctors and other members of the medical profession and I think it was the general opinion that they should be treated a bit more generously, if possible. Naturally, I will have to meet the medical profession.  I said on the Second Reading that I had met them and agreed that I will sanction an increase in the salaries of dispensary officers and other classes of the profession working in the public service up to a certain percentage over what they had pre-war but I pointed out to them that that was merely to compensate them for the increased cost of living and that, if and when the Health Bill was passed and if additional duties were being put on their shoulders, I would meet them again and discuss with them what increased remuneration would be fair to cover the increased duties they would have to undertake.  Deputies need not be unduly worried about the medical profession&mdash;like most of the other professions, they are able to make a good case for themselves.  The only fear I have is that I may not be able to deal with them on my side as well as they are able to deal with their own case.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that this is largely an enabling Bill, enabling the Minister to do so-and-so and enabling local authorities to do so-and-so, and most of the clauses will have to be followed by regulations.  There is no doubt that it will take a long time to implement all its provisions.  When moving the Second Reading, I pointed <Col N="2110" /> out that we had to go on with this Bill with the implements we had at our disposal. I am not satisfied and neither are the officials of the Department of Health that the institutions we have are adequate for all purposes.  None of us is satisfied with the dispensary buildings throughout the country.  I think we are all agreed that we must have more medical men than we have in the dispensary service at the moment to carry out the additional duties along with what they are doing at present. As was pointed out by many speakers, including the last speaker, Deputy Cosgrave, we must have many more nurses, but the fact is that we have not got ideal buildings, or the fact that we have not got, or cannot get maybe, the number of nurses that we would like to have, should not prevent us from going on as well as we can with the implements at our disposal and gradually improving the service until we have all the buildings and all the personnel that will be needed for the new service.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the point that Deputy Cosgrave raised with regard to these nursing organisations throughout the country.  I think we would be very foolish not to try to get these organisations to co-operate with us in implementing the provisions of this Bill.  In view of the fact that there is a scarcity of nurses at the moment, and probably will be for some years to come, we would be only too delighted to meet these various organisations, and make use, as far as we can, of their staffs in carrying out this Bill. We can go along with the means we have at our disposal, making the best changes we can at the moment and making regulations to deal with the position as it comes in our way.  The Bill gives us an opportunity of being flexible in the application of the provisions because we foresee, naturally, that it is not possible to have the buildings, the equipment, the trained personnel and so on that will eventually be necessary to carry out the full provisions of the legislation.</P>
    <P>One of the points that was more discussed probably than anything else was the compulsory inspection of children and the compulsory detention <Col N="2111" /> of children.  I can quite well understand Deputy O'Higgins holding the opinion that he does&mdash;that he was able to carry on in the County Meath and never needed that power of compulsion. He gave us some instances of how he was up against difficulties and how, in the end, he succeeded in getting a child to go to an institution&mdash; that it was happy in going in&mdash;and how he got the parents to agree.  Well, now I feel, whether I am right or wrong, that if I was in charge like Deputy O'Higgins neither would I ever use compulsory powers, but still I do not see why we should not have these powers if they are ever necessary. They will not be used unless they are absolutely necessary.  Deputy O'Higgins suggested that they might be made adoptive, that is, that they might be applied to certain counties where the position was difficult.  That is the idea in the Bill.  It is laid down in the Bill that a provision like this can be applied either to the whole country or to certain counties or to a number of counties, so that we need never probably apply its provisions to a county like Meath if Deputy O'Higgins does not wish to have it.  We can apply it to any county if the county medical officer of health says that it is necessary and that he cannot get on without it.  I would be very glad indeed if the provision were not necessary.  I want to say this to Deputies that, if they agree to this power being maintained in the Bill, it does not mean that they will lose entire control over any supervision that they would like to keep on this particular section, because this power will have to be extended to counties by regulations and the regulations will have to be laid on the Tables of the Houses.  Therefore, any Deputy can raise at any time an objection to the application of a regulation which proposes to extend this power to any county or to the whole country as the case may be.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins said on this point that he was quite satisfied with the way in which children were presenting themselves for medical inspection in the schools, and quite satisfied with the way in which parents were sending <Col N="2112" /> their children along.  I asked for the reports of the medical officers of health from all the counties and I find that a number have complained and that they do not agree with Deputy O'Higgins.  A number of these county medical officers of health have complained about the laxity of parents, in certain cases, in not presenting their children for inspection.  Some have complained that the percentage which is presented for inspection is far too low, and they make the point that, usually, it is the children of parents whom they would like to examine that are not presented: in other words, the children of parents whom they might suspect would be likely to be found with disease.</P>
    <P>I think that, if one were to make up his mind on the reports of the county medical officers of health, he would inevitably come to the conclusion that there should be a residual power there for compulsory school medical attendance, at least in certain areas at certain times.  While I say that, I am very much in favour of a persuasive system as far as we can possibly go with that.  I mentioned, when moving the Second Reading of the Bill, that we hoped to have nurses appointed in all the districts.  When I speak of a district I mean, roughly, a dispensary district, although some of these may be slightly changed in area, but as time goes on we hope to have a nurse allocated for each district.  One of the duties of that nurse will be to visit the houses in it.  The nurses will use persuasion with the parents and try to reason with them as to how valuable and important the school medical inspection is.  They will try to get these parents to send their children along for medical inspection.  I think when we have the scheme in full operation that the compulsory power will be very seldom needed, but the fact that it may be seldom needed is perhaps the greatest argument why it should be put into the Bill, because if there were only a few people left in the country who were not ready to comply, one would like to see that they were made toe the line under a scheme which practically everybody approves of.</P>
    <P>As regards these compulsory powers, <Col N="2113" /> the next question that arises is one that relates to detention for infectious diseases.  Again, many Deputies spoke against this power of compulsion.  I do not see why a person suffering from an infectious disease should be permitted to continue to be a danger to himself and his neighbours if he becomes recalcitrant and will not agree to have himself properly isolated either at home or in some institution.  I think that Deputies are allowing their hearts to get the mastery over their heads when they talk about the freedom of the individual in cases of that kind. The peculiar thing, though, is that many Deputies while regretting the necessity for, as they called it, dragooning people into compulsory detention, compulsory immunisation and compulsory detention as regards infectious diseases, also regretted the fact that we were repealing the vaccination laws.  Under this Bill we are putting vaccination against smallpox on the very same level as vaccination or immunisation against any other infectious disease.  We are very lucky in this country in that we have had no smallpox for many years.  We have had many deaths here from, say, diphtheria, and if we were to go on statistics alone here of the number of deaths from diphtheria and the number of deaths from smallpox there would be an overwhelming case for having compulsory immunisation against diphtheria and not bothering about smallpox at all.  We are not going that far in the Bill.  We are only going this distance: we say that all the infectious diseases&mdash;diphtheria, scarlatina, tuberculosis, smallpox&mdash; are all on the same level, that we can make regulations if necessary, to have everybody vaccinated against smallpox in a particular area where there is danger as we can make regulations to have everybody immunised against diphtheria under similar circumstances. If any Deputy has a feeling that we should not interfere with individual liberty to the extent of vaccination or immunisation against a particular disease, we are making provision for that in the Bill.  As a matter of fact, we are allowing a certain amount of individual liberty there but, surely, a person who has a conscientious <Col N="2114" /> objection to vaccination or immunisation has just the same objection whether it is against smallpox, diphtheria or any of the other diseases and it is only fair that they should all be put on the same level.</P>

      <P>While saying that, I do not want Deputies to come to the conclusion that we are in any way forgetting the terrible danger of smallpox if it should occur.  We are leaving the facilities for vaccination against smallpox there.  We will encourage medical officers of health of the county and of the district to try to get everybody to agree to be vaccinated against smallpox. We will do that just as strongly as we would encourage them to try to get everybody to agree to immunisation against diphtheria and we will try, if we can, to get the practice carried on of vaccination against smallpox as it has been carried on in the past.</P>
      <P>This Bill contains adequate powers for enforcing the necessary vaccination against smallpox or diphtheria as the case may be.  So that those Deputies who have regretted the abolition of the Vaccination Acts need not have any fear because any Minister for Health at any time can enforce vaccination under this Bill just the same as was done in the past, if he so desires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Higgins referred to the incidence of diphtheria in the County Meath, which was higher after immunisation against diphtheria had been carried out than it was before. That is possible.  But I think Deputy Dr. O'Higgins may have given a wrong picture of the situation or may have given rise to a wrong inference being taken from the case he made.  For one thing, the statistics show that in this country, since 1935, there has been a gradual and a marked decrease in the incidence of diphteria.  That is subject to correction but, taking it as a whole, since 1935, there has been a big decline.  1942 was exceptional. There was a bit of a jump in 1942 and in 1944-45 there was what amounted <Col N="2115" /> to an epidemic but that epidemic was common to the whole of Europe, excluding Great Britain.  That epidemic in 1944-45 was particularly severe in the City of Dublin and the City of Dublin is very close to the County Meath and the County Meath may have suffered from this world epidemic in 1944-45.  I would like to draw attention to a question which I answered in the Dáil on the 24th April.  A question was put down by Deputy Larkin with regard to the number of cases of diphtheria, the number immunised, the number of deaths.  The reply was very detailed and occupied some columns of the Official Report but if any Deputy cares to study the figures given in that reply he will find a convincing argument for immunisation against diphtheria, because the number of deaths was negligible practically in those that were immunised while it was comparatively high in those that were not immunised.</P>
    <P>Another thing that we should remember is that for some time after immunisation against a certain infectious disease commences there is quite a number of people who are not immunised and who will get the disease if it comes along.  It is only when immunisation is in operation for some years that we may expect to get the benefit and I am quite sure that that will be found in this country as years go on.</P>
    <P>I need hardly assure the House that on that point also I mean to keep in touch with the medical profession as regards the efficacy of immunisation against the various infectious diseases and I do not think that there need be any fear that we are going to embark on any sort of new-fangled ideas in this country unless they are fairly well established by the medical profession in general.  Deputy Dr. O'Higgins thought that we should wait, as he said, until the thing was tried on the big fellow before we apply it to this small country.  That is generally what we are doing, but, on the other hand, we should not discourage our own medical men if they are anxious to make progress&mdash;not at the expense, of course, <Col N="2116" /> of our people&mdash;in the medical profession in general.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Higgins said that compulsion and medicine are completely incompatible, which is quite true. Anything in regard to health must be done practically entirely on a voluntary basis and by persuading the people that it is good for them and getting them to adopt it, but it may be necessary to deal with a few recalcitrants that are causing a great deal of harm in the country and, therefore, these compulsory powers must be got. Deputy O'Higgins must find it hard to reconcile his views on vaccination with the view he expressed that medicine and compulsion are incompatible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Higgins made a suggestion that we should make the provision for compulsory detention of a person suffering from infectious disease adoptive, that is, it should be applied to each county as the county may require it.  That is not easy in this particular case, I am afraid. There have been compulsory powers of this kind vested in the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and then in the Minister for Health under an Emergency Powers Order made in 1940, and since that 38 Orders have been made under that particular Order and these Orders covered 14 different counties&mdash;counties as far apart as Kerry and Sligo, Galway and Dublin, Roscommon, Westmeath and Wexford, so that you cannot say that this thing is necessary only, say, in the north-west or the south-east or in the big cities.  It appears to be necessary in a great variety of places&mdash;in fact, practically everywhere.  There is no large region which one can say is immune and, therefore, it would be impossible to say that we will apply this to certain counties and not to others.</P>
    <P>A better way to approach it if we want to keep it as confined as possible, would be to say: &ldquo;Well now, let us not confine it on the geographical basis but let us try to confine it on the number of diseases to which it might apply.&rdquo;  I think Dr. Ward, when speaking on the Public Health Bill last year, said it was proposed to apply <Col N="2117" /> it to typhus, typhoid and paratyphoid, smallpox, scarlet fever, diphtheria, acute anterior poliomyelitis, which means infantile paralysis, encephalitis lethargica (sleeping sickness), cerebro spinal fever or what is usually called meningitis, anthrax, tuberculosis, venereal disease, dysentery.  I think we could cut that down a good bit.  I think for a start we could cut it down to five or six&mdash;smallpox, open tuberculosis, venereal disease, typhus, enteric typhoid, diphtheria and infantile paralysis.  It would be very difficult to remove any of those I have mentioned in this smaller list because any one of those could become a terrible menace to a whole area if we did not control the outbreak with the greatest possible despatch.  I just mention that list for Deputies to consider, as I am sure this matter will be raised in more detail when we come to the clause on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Commons suggested that appeals from persons compulsorily detained should be considered by a consultative council.  Deputies will remember that if a person is detained compulsorily under this section he can make an appeal and that appeal goes to the Minister and the Minister either says that the appeal is granted or that it is turned down.  Deputy Coburn thinks that appeal should go to the consultative council.  I do not agree with that at all&mdash;whether he means the present consultative council or the health council which I mean to deal with later, it is just the same as far as my arguments are concerned&mdash;because for one thing, there would be people on these consultative councils from all over the country, many of them very busy men, to whom we must really feel grateful for giving us a day of their time as often as we may require them, say every two or three months and we could not possibly expect them to come along in a judicial capacity every time an appeal is made under this section. Apart from that objection I think it is essentially a matter for the administration to decide rather than anybody else; that is, that it must be decided by the Minister because the Minister is the person in particular who knows the gravity of the situation that exists <Col N="2118" /> and whether very drastic steps will have to be taken or not.</P>
    <P>Listening to this debate by the Deputies in this House about personal liberty and so on, reminds me of a position I was in five or six years ago, as Minister for Agriculture, when there was an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.  I remember and Deputies will remember it too&mdash;if not they should go back and read the debates which they will find very interesting&mdash;that I was vehemently attacked because I did not take sufficient measures to stop the outbreak.  I remember being pressed on more than one occasion by Deputies to stop football matches.  I said I was advised by my technical advisers that there was no danger of the spread of foot-and-mouth disease by people going to football matches.  Deputies wanted them stopped, anyhow.  I did not stop them.  I think the experience of every Minister is that when he is bringing a Bill to the Dáil he has arguments from Deputies saying that he is taking too many powers but when he is up against a crisis they tell him to go and do the thing whether he has the powers or not, and they do not bother about powers.  I am sure there would be very little talk about personal liberty if there were an outbreak of smallpox in this city.  I think Deputies should not be in any way apprehensive of allowing this power of detention.  It will be very seldom used&mdash;only when it is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies spoke of financial implications.  These new services will be financed practically altogether on the basis of 50-50, that is 50 per cent. from the local authority and 50 per cent. from the Department.  I should say, first, that capital expenditure will to a great extent, as in the past, come from the hospitals fund, so that the local authorities will not have to bear any bigger share than they have borne in the past, as far as capital expenditure is concerned.  Deputies are more concerned with the year-to-year charges.  Section 23 provides for a grant of 50 per cent. of the cost of mother and child services.  Whatever they cost, 50 per cent will be recouped to the local authority.  Section 39 protratio <Col N="2119" /> vides for a grant of 50 per cent. of the cost of maintenance allowances for persons and dependents suffering from infectious disease.  That clause has been referred to by some of the speakers. The dependents of a person who is ill with an infectious disease will be looked after by the local authority and the local authority will get 50 per cent. of the cost.  I intend to say something more about that clause too, later on.</P>
    <P>There is another point which is not mentioned in the Bill upon which I might reassure Deputies, and that is the cost of tuberculosis services, including the cost of the actual operation of the tuberculosis scheme which will be administered under the provisions of this Bill in local institutions which will include regional sanatoria, when they are ready&mdash;that is, under the 1945 Act.  The cost of that scheme will be recouped to the local authorities on a 50 per cent. basis. The three big items in this Bill will be recouped to the extent of 50 per cent.  I do not know what the complete programme may cost.  I did give figures that were already mentioned with regard to the building of all institutions that are still required in this country.  We may leave that capital sum aside because we are not concerned with it for the present.  As regards the three matters I mentioned, I think Deputy O'Higgins is probably about correct when he assumed that the mother and child welfare scheme, when it is fully operating, would cost about £500,000 a year.  The estimate that we made in the Department for allowances to patients or to dependents of patients suffering from infectious disease is that it will be about £300,000 a year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It includes all infectious diseases, of course, but particularly tuberculosis.  The third item&mdash;extension of tuberculosis schemes with regard to regional sanatoria&mdash;may cost another £500,000.  It is very difficult to give any sort of a firm estimate for any of these cases at the moment. The estimates I am giving now apply <Col N="2120" /> to the scheme when it is fully working. Of course, it will not cost nearly as much as that for the next year or two because it will take a few years to get these schemes into full working order.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins stated that this Bill bore the evidence of being prepared by people who were working at a desk rather than in the field.  I do not think that is fair criticism, because I think everybody knows that, so far as the medical staff in the Department of Health are concerned, they know a great deal about the field work.  Some of them were doing field work before they came into the Department, but, whether they did or not, they know a good deal about it.  The same applies to the administrative staff.  In preparing these Bills, we invariably get the advice of men who have experience of field work in order to get their opinion on the various provisions.  As I said already, it is an enabling Bill, and before regulations are drawn up under any of the sections the field staff will be consulted as well as members of the medical profession in general.</P>
      <P>Before I leave this question of compulsion, I must say that personally I am very much against it in the medical line as well as in everything else.  But I do see the necessity for having the residual power there to deal with people who are so unreasonable that they will not fall in with what is for their own good as well as for the common good.  You must keep in mind that individual laxity&mdash;it is called individual liberty by some people&mdash;may be a great menace to the community and we may have to deal with it.  We are dealing now with what is known as public health or, as it is called by some people, social health.  In dealing with that we must remember that we are looking to the future and trying to lay down a good foundation for the health of the coming generation as well as the present one, and we cannot have people being so lax and unreasonable that they will not fall in with some parts of the scheme.  I have no intention whatever, nor have I any wish, to dragoon either the medical profession or the general public in a scheme of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan referred to Most Rev. Dr. Dignan's plan.  That plan, which I <Col N="2121" /> do not intend to go into fully at this stage, dealt with both public health and social insurance.  I informed the Dáil a few days ago that I hoped to have a White Paper on social insurance prepared within the next 12 months. Of course, the preparation of a complete social insurance plan is a very big job.  That White Paper will deal with social services so far as this Government can foresee the future.  I also promised that a White Paper dealing with public health will be presented very much sooner, probably within a month or two.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin said that he had always advocated a contributory scheme for health services, but I do not agree with that.  I think that health services will have to be freely put at the disposal of people and that we can leave contributions out of that. On the other hand, so far as social services are concerned, I believe they should be contributory so far as we can possibly make them so, so that we will have a very clear divorce between the health and the social services. Public health or the prevention of disease is quite a different thing from sickness benefit, which is a social service and should go with such things as unemployment, widowhood and all these other things.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  At the present time, as the Deputy knows, there are medical benefits attached to the national health insurance scheme.  I think these will disappear, because I think that when a social insurance scheme is properly co-ordinated and our health services are properly built up everybody under a certain income will be entitled to these medical benefits which are now applicable to national health insurance members.  I do not see why national health insurance members should pay for benefits that are free to everybody else.  Therefore, they should get the same treatment so far as that goes.  These are matters to be dealt with in the White Papers which I expect will be prepared&mdash;one <Col N="2122" /> on health and the other on social insurance.  They are matters for the future.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke asked for a provision for after-institutional care.  Where dependents of a person in a sanatorium or a fever hospital are getting a certain allowance from the local authority while he is in the institution, Deputy Burke made the point that when that person came out of the sanatorium or fever hospital he was not in a position to work, perhaps, for a few weeks and that this payment should continue. Deputy Burke is quite right there.  As a matter of fact, we did intend to include in the Bill the period of rehabilitation but, through an oversight, it was not covered.  We will, however, deal with that on the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke also asked about the training of mental defectives.  There is a scheme being hatched, if you like to put it that way, but it has not come to maturity yet, to deal with this whole question of mental defectives. First of all, we must get the buildings and then we must get the personnel to look after the patients.  They will have to be a highly-trained personnel to look after these mental defectives.  The scheme is being considered both by the Department of Education and the Department of Health.  We mean to do something about it as soon as we possibly can.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes referred to the wide powers taken to make regulations dealing with infectious diseases.  As a matter of fact, the powers that I have at the moment under the 1878 Act are wider.  I did not know that until Deputy Hughes made the point.  I looked it up and I said: &ldquo;Why did I change it, anyway?  I should have left it as it was.&rdquo;  We had wide powers under the 1878 Act.  There are wide powers taken here, but there are limits put to them, because the regulations have to be laid on the Table. However, I do not mind having surrendered, if you like, a certain amount of power to the Dáil.  But there is that difference anyway, that the regulations must be laid on the Table and the Dáil will have power to object to them if it likes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>To put all the things necessary to be covered by regulations in the Bill would, I am sure, take 1,000 sections.  It would be very difficult to have the matter dealt with in that way. As I explained already, we must have a flexible procedure, because you do not know what you may be up against. You may be up against a desperate situation from time to time in a particular area and you want wide powers to deal with that desperate situation and authority to withdraw the powers from the medical men concerned and to allow them to carry on in the normal way afterwards.</P>
      <P>Another point made by Deputy Hughes was that of choice of doctor. That will not be easy in a country place.  The Deputy knows that in a country place at the moment you have no choice.  There is one doctor there and, so far as the people are concerned, he is the medical man and they have to put up with it.  It would be very difficult to alter that under any scheme, because you cannot maintain two medical men in a country place.  There is only a living for one, only work for one, and it would be extravagant to pay two of them so that the people could have a choice.  There are other instances where people have not a choice.  There is a growing practice of going into maternity homes amongst women.  They go into these homes knowing that there is no choice of doctor.  The person dealing with maternity cases in that institution is the person they must go to and they cannot go to anyone else.</P>

      <P>They have as good a choice under this scheme as they have at present.  It has been put to me by the medical profession that there are certain practitioners who may suffer under this scheme.  I have undertaken to examine that and, if it is possible to fit these men in, or to fit in some of them&mdash;I do not know whether or not it is possible&mdash;it will be done.  In that <Col N="2124" /> way, in towns there may be a choice, and in fair-sized villages, if it is a populous area; but in the sparsely-populated rural areas there will be no possibility of giving a choice.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bartley asked about nurses for the Gaeltacht area.  There is a scheme for training girls in nursing in the Gaeltacht and that will be continued. We will need to have a number of these girls trained for our schemes in the Irish-speaking districts when those schemes are being put into operation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Roddy raised a question about borough corporations and he thought the health administration should be left to them, because it was so very efficiently carried out in boroughs like Sligo.  There are a number of boroughs in the same position as Sligo, for instance, Dún Laoghaire, Kilkenny, Drogheda, Galway, Clonmel and Wexford.  There is this point to be considered, that they had only the powers of an ordinary urban district council and I think, so far as the few powers they have are concerned, it is not worth while leaving them there.  It is much better to have a uniform scheme under which the counties and county boroughs will administer all the health services.</P>
      <P>It was Deputy Roddy who asked if the health authorities could be consulted with regard to health regulations. That would be a difficult matter. There will be 31 health authorities and it will be difficult to consult them all. In practice it would mean sending down a copy of a proposed regulation to have it discussed at the meeting of the health authority, and it would be very difficult to know whether it was approved or not.  The medical officer of health will be consulted and he will know the local conditions better than anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Roddy and McCann said they thought it was a pity that charges should be made in these institutions against people suffering from infectious diseases.  So far as the public assistance authorities are concerned, they have been circularised to the effect that no charge should be made.  We saw that there was no necessity to <Col N="2125" /> make a charge in the case of people going in with an infectious disease. Deputy McCann apparently had in mind Cork Street Hospital.  That is in a different position.  It is not under a public assistance authority.  Its expenses are very high and they are trying to make ends meet as well as they can.  There will be something done about that as soon as possible. Section 15 provides for this charge and we do not intend that it should be construed harshly against any patient.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the desirability of a nutritional survey. That is proceeding as energetically as possible and it is proceeding successfully. We hope to get a great lot of information through this survey and to be able to base advice and instructions on the data gathered.  The Deputy also asked about St. Kevin's Hospital.  I spent half a day there recently and I was very impressed with the accommodation for acute cases and with the service the staff are giving there.  We intend to give all the assistance we can to the commissioner to improve the hospital for acute cases even more and there is no reason why it should not be made at least as attractive as any of the voluntary hospitals; both from the point of view of the accommodation there, the nursing and the medical attendance, it should be just as attractive as the voluntary hospitals and quite as good work should be done there.  I think we can reach that position before very long.</P>
    <P>As regards the chronic patients, in what might be described as the county home part, I am very much in favour of removing those patients to another place which would be more congenial. I do not like the institutional atmosphere that those old people have to endure for the rest of their lives.  It has the old workhouse form of architecture and I would like very much to get those old people to a more open site where there would be buildings scattered all over the place, where they could have fresh air and, let us hope, a bit of scenery.  We are working towards that end, to get those people changed from that particular institution.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked about the personnel of the health council.  The consultative council is a medical consultative council and it really deals with medical matters, matters that the medical profession would be personally interested in, particularly with reference to their own conditions.  Constituted as they were, I consulted them about certain clauses of the Health Bill.  The health council would be a different body.  I did not give it as detailed thought as I hope eventually to be able to give it, but the intention is that the health council will consist of all the interests concerned&mdash;medical, dental, nursing and other professions of that kind&mdash;and on the administrative side there will be representatives of the local authorities and the voluntary institutions.  We must keep in mind the total number; that must be kept within reasonable limits, but we must try to have representation of all those interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be by selection.  In the case of the medical profession there are a couple of organisations and we shall ask them to nominate a panel. In the other cases we can do that as far as possible.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked how would the rates of maintenance for the dependents of patients be determined.  It is laid down in the section that the Minister could prescribe minimum and maximum standards.  What I was afraid of&mdash;and I would like to be frank with the Dáil&mdash;was that some local authorities might look on it as just a public assistance service.  I do not want it to be regarded as an outdoor relief scheme.  It is much more general than that.  On the other hand, there might be some who would go far and away above the other counties and say that a man would be entitled to his full salary.  As regards a person earning a substantial salary, that would be going too far.  Keeping those two extremes in mind, I put it in the Bill that I could fix minimum and maximum limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2127" /> Deputy Cosgrave raised a question as to the necessity of notifying parents in regard to school medical inspections. I think that is fairly well provided for. Advertisements can be issued, school teachers will be told, so that they can make announcements to the children and I think in most cases the teachers will probably send word to families whose children are not present on the particular day on which the notification arrives.  Of course, when nurses are appointed in the various areas that is the sort of duty which we can rely upon the nurse to discharge.  She will look up families that may not have got word and endeavour to have the children present when the inspection takes place.</P>
    <P>One point raised by Deputy Cosgrave was also mentioned by some members of the medical profession.  A section of the Bill gives the Minister power to compel hospitals to refuse to take certain types of cases.  The point made by Deputy Cosgrave, which, as I say, was also made by some medical men, was that a hospital should have some say in the kind of case it would accept, especially the teaching hospitals. The Deputy mentioned that some of these hospitals had special wards for dealing with infectious diseases.  I am afraid that, as the section stands, it may not be possible to make a regulation that would fit the position by allowing a certain ward to be set aside for dealing with a particular disease.  It may be necessary to amend that section on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>You take power to ensure that only special diseases would be treated in certain hospitals.  That might give rise to difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Power is taken to prohibit hospitals from taking in infectious diseases.  There is very good reason for that.  Hospitals may not be able avoid it in certain cases but they will have to try to avoid it, so far as they can.  There have been instances, probably very few, where hospitals took in open tuberculosis cases and put them beside surgical cases.  That is a very dangerous thing.  I think hospitals in general would welcome a provision of <Col N="2128" /> this kind because it would enable them to refuse cases which they did not want to take in.  There was one instance of a children's hospital which took in a case of gastro-enteritis without isolating it.  That is a very dangerous disease amongst children and is very infectious.  Grave damage might be done by taking in children suffering from gastro-enteritis and putting them alongside other children in the same ward.  We require powers to deal with cases of that kind.</P>
      <P>Some Deputy stated that he did not think that it was a good idea to make the dispensary doctor the medical officer of health.  I think it is a splendid idea because everyone is aware of the difficulties mentioned by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins.  For instance, Deputy O'Higgins mentioned the inconvenience associated with dragging a medical officer from town to town when there is a prosecution under the Public Health Acts.  The dispensary doctor, however, will not have to leave his own district and he will not have to under-go the inconvenience mentioned by Deputy O'Higgins.  He will have to deal only with his own district and prosecutions will be heard in the nearest court area to that district.  That will be one advantage.  Apart from that, I think that it will be helpful when we can say to a medical man: &ldquo;There is your area; you must not, as far as you can prevent it, allow any disease to come into it, and if it does come in, you must get rid of it as soon as possible.  That is your responsibility&rdquo;. That man knows that he has nobody to fall back upon.  If things are not done as well as they should be, he knows that he alone is responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again the dispensary doctor will have an opportunity of inspecting the children in his area fairly frequently. Usually there are only five or six schools in a dispensary area and it should be no great trouble to a doctor to inspect these children two, three or four times a year.  As we know under the old system, the county medical officer of health could get round to each school only every few years. Under the system now proposed the doctor can visit each school two or three times a year at least and he will <Col N="2129" /> be able to look after the health of the children more closely than in the past. He is responsible for seeing that the children are reared in a healthy manner and for guarding them against infectious disease by providing for immunisation, or any other measures that may be necessary.  If disease breaks out in spite of his efforts, he is the man responsible for trying to stamp out that disease and for seeing that it is kept out.  It may, of course, be said that everybody is not bound to come to him.  People, if they like, can go to a private practitioner.  If they say they are going to a private practitioner and that they are getting the necessary service from him, the dispensary medical officer must accept that statement, and these people are exempt from the obligation of going to him.</P>
    <P>I think this is a really good scheme. So far as I know no other country has a scheme of this particular kind because no other country has had the opportunity of adopting it.  They had not the foundations to build on that we have.  I think that on the whole we were very fortunate in having the dispensary system on which to build this scheme.  I have every confidence that the scheme will be a success when these new district medical officers have the authority that this Bill gives to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's remarks seem to suggest that it will be necessary to increase the number of dispensary doctors considerably.  It may be necessary to employ 300 or 400 more doctors.  Do I understand that new dispensary districts will be created, or that in some existing dispensary districts it may be necessary to have two doctors?  Will all the doctors in these districts be directly responsible to the Minister?  If that be so, what will be the function of the county medical officer of health and his assistants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The dispensary doctor will become the district medical officer. There is the fact that certain dispensaries are too big.  In the cities, they are very big, and it may be possible to put extra men into some of these dispensaries. In many country places, <Col N="2130" /> however, it will not be necessary to employ a second man but it may be that a bit will be taken off, say, three dispensary districts to create a new dispensary district.  If we find that we shall have to employ additional doctors to provide necessary staffs, they will be employed.  As I said, each district medical officer will be responsible for the health of his district.  The county medical officer of health will, as it were, be the general in charge.  After all, he is the link between these men and the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not be aware that in Dublin City at present there are sometimes two or three doctors in one dispensary district.  The duties are theoretically divided between them.  We shall probably have to intensify that system.  If we put up clinical buildings, it would be much better to have a building where, say, four men could attend than to have four separate buildings.  The same thing will apply in fair-sized country areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter which would require a lot of discussion and it took me quite a long time to discuss it with the medical profession.  There are various aspects of it.  I could argue, and, I think, fairly convincingly, that the private practitioner will not lose by this scheme, because if every child must be inspected every quarter, the parents will probably avail of his services and so he will get more work instead of less.  The same applies to immunisation.  If children must be immunised, the parents will probably avail of the private practitioner's services also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not made the position clear to me.  If there is a man designated for the particular work of the mother and child service and paid on a salary basis, does the Minister anticipate that a very big number of people will decide not to avail of that service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.  The Deputy must realise that in, say, the City of Dublin, there are numbers of doctors doing private work at fairly low fees. They are making their living entirely from people who are entitled to free medical service, but who do not avail of it.  When you go higher in the scale, to the people with £1,000 and £2,000, they are entitled to free maternity treatment, but they will not avail of it. They must, however, get the necessary certificate, so that the scheme will put more, rather than less, money into the pockets of the private practitioner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £780,150 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1948, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Offices of the Minister for Lands and of the Irish Land Commission (44 &amp; 45 Vict., c. 49, sec. 46, and c. 71, sec. 4; 48 &amp; 49 Vict., c. 73, secs. 17, 18 and 20; 54 &amp; 55 Vict., c. 48; 3 Edw. 7, c. 37; 7 Edw. 7, c. 38 and c. 56; 9 Edw. 7, c.42; Nos. 27 and 42 of 1923; No. 25 of 1925; No. 11 of 1926; No. 19 of 1927; No. 31 of 1929; No. 11 of 1931; Nos. 33 and 38 of 1933; No. 11 of 1934; No. 41 of 1936; No. 26 of 1939; and No. 12 of 1946).</P>
      <P>The net Estimate for Lands for the financial year 1947-48 represents an increase of £44,510 over the amount voted for last year.  This increase is almost entirely accounted for in sub-heads A and D.  Apart from these increases, the items in the present Estimate closely correspond with last year's provisions, the greatest disparities being the decrease of £2,000 in sub-head B, for travelling expenses, and the increase of £500 in sub-head N, for advances to provide funds for the maintenance of embankments or other works.  Last year's provision for travelling expenses, £29,000, represented an increase of £4,000 over the preceding year's figure.  It proved to be in excess of requirements.  The reduction of £2,000 this year is proposed solely as a measure of more precise estimation.  It in no way implies a decrease in activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase of £500 in sub-head N is required to meet the initial cost of certain embankment maintenance funds which are in process of creation in connection with land-purchase proceedings. Advances from sub-head N are repaid by tenant purchasers in the <Col N="2133" /> same way as advances for the purchase of land under the Land Acts.  The only other noticeable increases are £300 in sub-head F, for telegrams and telephones, and £200 in sub-head C, for incidental expenses.  The increase in incidental expenses arises mainly through anticipated higher expenditure on advertisements.</P>
    <P>Sub-head I, improvement of estates, etc., remains unchanged at last year's figure.  The continued shortage of building and other materials greatly affects the Land Commission's potential output upon land division.  Last year, the expenditure under sub-head I was approximately £196,000.  In prevailing circumstances the sum of £254,800 proposed in the present Estimate is considered to be the maximum amount that could usefully be expended.</P>
    <P>More than one-half of the entire Estimate is allocated to the allied sub-heads H (1), H (2), H (3) and H (4) which are related to making good the deficiencies in the Land Bond Fund.  These deficiencies chiefly arise through the halving of tenant-purchasers' annuities and through other State aids to land-purchase, for example, the costs fund and statutory contributions given by way of bonus to vendors of estates over and above the prices repayable by tenant-purchasers.  Some slight deficiency also occurs in the Land Bond Fund as a result of the writing-off of annuities on land permanently submerged as a result of erosion.</P>
    <P>Some of the other sub-heads involve token amounts only which have been inserted to meet possible but unlikely contingencies.  The remainder scarcely call for explanation as the changes this year are in no way out of the ordinary.</P>
    <P>Last year's trying weather seriously affected the Land Commission's activities. Farmers throughout the country were engaged long after the usual season in a superhuman struggle to save the harvest and many of the Land Commission's staff turned in the time of crisis from their ordinary duties and gave valuable assistance in the fields and in organising the campaign for volunteer workers.  Almost 800 employees, and this includes head-quarters <Col N="2134" /> staff as well as labourers, went to the assistance of the farmers for an aggregate of almost 7,000 working days.  I take this opportunity to express my appreciation of the work done by the staff of my Department in association with the magnificent achievement of the farmers during last harvest time.</P>
    <P>While we hoped 12 months ago that some expansion in the development of land settlement would follow the apparent easing of emergency conditions, many unpredictable difficulties arose that dashed the hope.  The weather during the early months of the year was such as to make travel in rural areas most difficult and inspections were in many cases quite impossible. There was also a further brake on progress in the form of test litigation challenging the Land Commission's power to resume land.  That issue is still <i>sub judice.</i>  Precise figures for land division during the past year are not yet available but roughly 9,000 acres were acquired and roughly 15,000 acres were divided among about 1,400 allottees.</P>
    <P>In one very important sphere the Land Commission succeeded in making considerable progress.  I am referring to the vesting of lands in tenants and allottees.  Altogether 10,192 holdings and allotments were vested as compared with 6,769 vested during the previous year.  This time last year, I stressed the paramount need for accelerated vesting and I do so again this year as a very considerable amount of this work remains to be performed.</P>
    <P>Some 65,000 holdings of tenanted land, 43,000 allotments of untenanted land and 15,000 holdings on Congested Districts Board estates, making a total of 123,000, remain to be revested.  Even last year's great effort is dwarfed by this total, but it is confidently hoped to expand the output still further through the recruitment and training of additional staff for which provision was originally made in last year's Estimate. Delay in vesting land in tenants and in allottees who have proved satisfactory means that the Land Commission's work in relation to such land is only partially completed.  Deputies are <Col N="2135" /> well aware that the existence of unfinished jobs in any business leads to waste and dissatisfaction.  Commonsense and good organisation alike demand that we should press on as quickly as possible with the completion of the Land Commission's uncompleted undertakings.  In this way only can the Land Commission eventually concentrate on their biggest remaining task&mdash;the important and complex work of alleviating congestion and improving rundale holdings.</P>
    <P>During the past year close attention was paid to the needs of the congested districts.  Despite the bad weather, numerous inquiries and inspections were carried out there.  The Land Commission are keenly alive to the need for completing the work on the remaining Congested Districts Board estates.  Those estates, to a large extent, are acutely congested, and migration is the only key to a solution. But migration on a sufficient scale is impossible while the supply of building materials is restricted.  The long years of emergency also brought another difficulty in their train, as they depleted the ranks of experienced inspectors.  Time alone will make good that loss.</P>
    <P>As far as conditions permit, it is proposed for the coming year to concentrate again on the congested districts and the problem is under close examination.  We want to avoid as much as possible the dissipation of the Land Commission's restricted potential and we are fully alive to the danger of permitting the problem to be again submerged as this will tend to add to the difficulties of its solution.  The Land Commission's capacity for work is, however, limited like the capacity of each and every one of us, and if too much is attempted when general conditions are unfavourable no real progress can be achieved.</P>
    <P>During coming months, also, we look forward to helping the national fuel production effort.  Surplus turbary on the Land Commission's hands will be made available for letting wherever there is demand and no effort will be spared in arranging necessary development works.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2136" /> The preparation of schemes for the final allocation of acquired lands in all counties will be pressed forward to the limit of the Land Commission's capacity but in this work, too, the shortage of materials and of experienced inspectors provides a big handicap.</P>
    <P>Inspections into the user of allotments will also be continued.  I am glad to be able to tell Deputies that last year's Land Act has already had a beneficial effect.  I hope that those allottees who still shirk their responsibilities to the community will even at this stage turn over a new leaf.  The Land Commission have no wish to deprive any allottee of his holding but if he fails to make the requisite effort, there will be no other alternative.</P>
    <P>I shall bring this statement to a close with the usual brief account about the payment of land annuities. The position is very satisfactory.  The total arrears on 1st April, 1947, was £279,212 representing less than 1 per cent. of the total amount collectable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Minister in expressing appreciation of the services rendered by officials of his Department during the difficult harvest of last year.  The House has already expressed its appreciation, generally, of the action of those who volunteered their services in that emergency.  The assistance given to the agricultural community went a long way to safe-guard our supplies of native wheat and grain generally.  I have often wondered why this important Department &mdash;the Department of Lands&mdash;which looks after the disposition and utilisation of the land is divorced from the Department of Agriculture.  I do not think that there is very much co-operation between the two Departments. I doubt that any conference takes place to unify the outlook and policy of the two Departments.  It is of prime importance that there should be harmony in the working of both Departments.  I have often felt that, from the point of view of production, of which we speak a great deal here, the disposition of the land, how it is utilised and the opportunities given to the people on the land are of great importance.  It is possible that, in the <Col N="2137" /> Department of Agriculture, there are experts who do not see eye to eye with the policy of the Department of Lands so far as what constitutes an economic holding is concerned.  We discussed a motion in this House on that matter and I was amazed that the Minister failed to appreciate that, in the resettlement of land, it is highly important to ensure that the allotment given to the individual be economic.  That is important in the national interest as well as in the interest of the individual. I suggest to the Minister that there should be much closer relationship so far as the disposition and utilisation of land are concerned between the Department of Lands and the Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The Minister made reference to the controversial Act passed here last year and he informed the House that good results had flowed from it.  The report also refers to the Act in page 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;During the year ended 31st March, 1946, 282 acres, taken up from unsatisfactory allottees, were re-allotted to 31 new allottees.  It is regrettable that such action is necessary but it is imperative in the national interest to insist on the proper use of allotments which have been provided for the beneficiaries at considerable expense to the general taxpayer.  New legislation was sponsored for dealing with unsatisfactory allottees and the systematic inspection of allotments continued during the year under review.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us that inspection will continue.  I think that the House agrees with the Minister that there is responsibility on himself and his Department to see that land given in that way as a gift from the State to individuals to make their circumstances economic is properly used.  But the fault may not always be with the allottee. The parcel provided may not be economic so far as he is concerned. The Minister accepted the policy in operation for a long time and was not prepared to have any full examination of it.  A considerable number of allotments are not being properly worked. I am afraid that the Minister will not ensure their proper working solely by <Col N="2138" /> compulsion.  More is necessary.  It is not economic in a number of these cases to maintain the equipment necessary to cultivate land properly.  It is not economic in some cases to maintain two horses and you can scarcely have good cultivation without a pair of horses.</P>
    <P>No attempt has been made by the Department to introduce or foster a co-operative organisation by which allottees on an estate might come together and co-operatively equip themselves to do their work.  I suggested on former occasions that such an attempt might be made.  That policy ought to emanate from the Department and be put on trial.  It would be well worth a trial, to see how far the small man can be helped by co-operative methods, by bringing assistance to him to provide the necessary machinery for cultivation and so on and to eliminate the kind of waste that is inevitable if a man tries to equip himself on a small holding.  It is impossible for a man in those circumstances to equip himself properly. If we are going to launch out now on an acquisition and division policy, my advice to the Minister in regard to the Act passed here a few months ago, arming him with powers to dispossess an allottee and giving that allottee no opportunity to defend himself in court or anywhere else, is that compulsion will not be successful.  If we are to make a real success of land division, the matter must be studied much further.  One way in which substantial help can be given is by the introduction on large estates of some kind of co-operative organisation that will supply the community there with the necessary equipment.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to vesting and has given figures.  I did not get them, but we have them here in the Report of the Land Commission.  So far as the revesting of tenanted land is concerned, there is a total of 106,724 holdings to be vested.  Up to date, 35,604 holdings have been vested, in 24 years.  Last year 4,118 holdings tenanted were vested, comprising 109,645 acres, representing a purchase price of £843,776.  The Minister comtio <Col N="2139" /> plimented himself and his Department on what has been achieved and said they have set a new record.  It is true that they have set a new record in that figure and I appreciate that that new record has been established.  However, even on that basis of vesting 4,118 holdings, it will take 17 years to vest the remaining portion of the tenanted land in this country.  On that basis, it will take over 40 years to do the work intended under the 1923 Act.  I think that it is grossly unfair to assume that the tenants should have to wait 40 years before they become the real owners of their property.  I need not stress that, as I know the Minister is anxious to have the work completed. As a matter of fact, he referred to that uncompleted work as being unsatisfactory. I merely stress what he is already saying&mdash;there is urgent necessity for a speed-up when we see that only 35,000 holdings out of a total of 106,000 have been vested in 24 years. There is a balance of approximately 70,000 holdings, all tenanted land, to be vested.  According to the report, more progress has been made in the vesting of allottees.  The work of completing vesting under the 1923 Act is an urgent matter and many people are wondering as to the cause of the delay.  They expected to have the holdings vested in themselves long since.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister why such a lapse of time occurs in the selection of allottees when an estate is resumed.  It is very bad policy that an estate should be taken over by the Land Commission and remain in their hands for a number of years before being finally disposed of.  The Minister may make the excuse that there is a good deal of work in the selection of tenants and inquiring into their fitness, but that is no excuse and if the Minister has any appreciation of what happens a particular estate in the interregnum he must agree with me that it is very regrettable that there is such a delay.  Under the Compulsory Tillage Order, a certain amount of the land must be tilled and there is a lot of conacre going on, on land held by the Land Commission at the present time. Year after year, the fertility of that <Col N="2140" /> land is being destroyed, by a Department that is interested in the welfare of the land and that is looking after the interest of land.  That Department is setting the worst possible example in the use of land, with no regard for proper husbandry, although they sit in judgment on an individual if he does not operate a proper system of husbandry and very often they dispossess him on that account.  When it comes to their own particular land, the land they hold themselves, they can grossly abuse it and make no attempt, good, bad or indifferent at a proper system of husbandry.  They abuse the land and destroy its fertility and then put in certain individuals and tell them to make good and if they do not make good they kick them out.  That is the policy they operate and the Minister ought to be ashamed of it.</P>
    <P>If it is a Department of Lands with any interest at all in land development, it ought to be interested in land development and ought to be capable of setting a good example, especially when it takes powers to dispossess people without giving them any chance of defence.  I wonder if the Department were brought before any judicial institution, what would its defence be. It has no defence of any sort.  It is a disgrace to the Department that that sort of policy should continue.  The policy of serving a resumption notice on an individual and allowing it to lie dormant for years before being put into operation is a bad policy.  The moment any man occupying land is notified of the intention of the Land Commission to resume his holding, he ceases to have any long-term interest in it and is going to take all he can out of it before it is resumed.  That sort of thing should be stopped.  When we remember that it is the policy of the Land Commission to allocate small holdings to individuals, a natural corollary of that policy should be to see that the land is in good heart.  The policy of the Land Commission is to destroy the fertility of the soil and to settle men on small allotments and holdings in such a condition that it is utterly impossible for them to carry on.  They are without sufficient capital to try to rehabilitate land, which has been deprived of its heart and its fertility. <Col N="2141" /> Those unfortunate people are simply being steam-rolled by the Minister. While I am all for ensuring that, when a man gets a gift from the State, he should use it properly, I would at the same time appeal to the House to see that the Land Commission does its job properly and sets a good example.  That is why I suggest that there ought to be some sort of co-ordination between this Department and the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>In regard to the operation of the Act to which the Minister referred in his speech, he ought to bear in mind that, in many of those cases, there are extenuating circumstances, and that men have failed because of conditions over which they had no control.  They failed because the conditions under which they were put in by the Minister's Department were too harsh and too difficult.  It would require a super-human effort on the part of some individuals to make good under such conditions.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that this is a matter which requires thorough investigation and not by the Department because one could scarcely expect it to bring in a report condemning itself.  The Minister said that the machinery within the Department was sufficient to satisfy it as to whether its policy regarding the size of a holding &mdash;as to whether it was economic or not&mdash;was right.  I cannot accept it that a man is himself the best judge as to whether he is doing his work properly or not.  This is a matter that, in my opinion, should be examined by an independent tribunal.  I am not satisfied that we are pursuing the right policy, so far as the future of the country is concerned, in this matter of the utilisation of the land and of increasing production.  There ought to be some revision of the policy that has been operated for a long time by the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that quite a number of the members of his staff had been seconded to other Departments, and that a number of the principal officers had gone temporarily to the Department of Agriculture. <Col N="2142" /> In my opinion, before these staffs are reassembled in the Department of Lands we should be satisfied that the Department is going to pursue a wise policy in the future, so far as the disposition of land is concerned. I am sure the Minister realises that if the resolutions passed by the international bodies dealing with the provision of food for the whole human race are to be implemented, and if the world is to enjoy a higher standard of nutrition, all that will call for the production of more food than was consumed in the prewar years.  As a food-producing country we are keenly interested in the principles and policies adumbrated at the meetings of these international bodies on such questions as the future dietary and nutritional requirements of the peoples of the world.  For that reason, it is important that we should give serious consideration to the question as to how our land is held and used.  I suggest to the Minister that the time is opportune for having a full examination of that matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister ended by making a reference to the payment of the land annuities, and said that less than 1 per cent. was outstanding.  That is highly satisfactory.  I am aware of the fact that the Minister's Department has relentlessly pursued those who were in arrears in the payment of their land annuities.  I suppose the Department felt that, while things were reasonably good with the farming community, this was the time to put the screw on.  I suggest to the Minister that just when people are beginning to recover from the depressed conditions under which they have been carrying on is not the best time to put the screw on too much. In any event, the sum outstanding is so insignificant that it is scarcely necessary to make any further comment on it.  I suppose the Minister's Department was pushed by the Department of Finance in that matter.  At any rate, the Department seems to have done its job efficiently.</P>

      <P>When this Vote was under discussion last year I put up this <Col N="2143" /> proposal to the Minister, that the land annuities should be held by his Department as part of a fund which would be utilised for the final settlement of the land question.  I observe that when replying the Minister did not even mention a word about my proposal.  He is asking the House to-day for a sum that is slightly short of £1,500,000 for his Department.  In my opinion that sum is completely inadequate if any genuine effort is to be made to settle the land question.</P>
      <P>The Report of the Committee of Inquiry on Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy contains a table that, strange to say, cannot be found in the <i>Statistical Abstract.</i>  The table, which is on page 93, reveals the fact that 74.2 per cent. of the farming community, representing 225,993 homesteads, have a total acreage between them of 3,245,000 while those on 78,903 homesteads have 9,672,000 acres between them.  That is to say that, roughly, 74 per cent. of our homesteads have 3,250,000 acres between them, while 26 per cent. have over 9,500,000 acres between them.  If I remember correctly we have had statements from various Ministers of the Government from time to time such as that the land question is settled, and that there are too many people on the land.  In my opinion the Minister is not making any attempt to settle the land question. If he were genuine in his attempts to do so he would not have come to the House to ask for a sum that is less than £1,500,000.  That is less than the sum that is collected in land annuities each year.  Instead the Minister would have come and asked for a sum of £6,000,000 or £7,000,000.  He would treat this matter much more seriously. His colleague the Minister for Defence came to the House and asked for a sum of £5,000,000 for a peace-time Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what the Minister for Lands should have done, so that in my opinion the work of the Minister and the Department is a huge joke.  That cannot be proved better than by a reply which I got to a question about three weeks ago when the Minister told me that the salaries paid by the Land <Col N="2144" /> Commission, exclusive of what is paid to labourers and gangers, amount to over £404,000.  In the report of the Land Commission for this year we find that it has acquired a total of 9,920 acres. If it costs over £404,000 in salaries to acquire 9,920 acres of land, then the time has come when the Land Commission should be abolished completely, because that Department and the work of the Department have long since become a standing joke in the country. He boasts about the 10,000 holdings that were vested last year.  I wonder how many of those were holdings of under £3 valuation and how many were holdings of a valuation as low as £1.1.  I would like the Minister when replying to explain the purpose of vesting a holding of £1 valuation.  I could quote one particular case of a holding of 18/-worth of land that was vested in the owner.  It is waste of time and money to vest holdings of that size in the owners.  They are vested without their knowledge.  Does it preclude them from ever getting an addition of land in the neighbourhood or does it preclude them from migrating if the Land Commission take it into their heads to go into these small holdings?  On the other hand there are holdings of over £10 valuation, which the Land Commission consider to be economic holdings. I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>We have now come to the Final Stage of this Bill, and before we proceed to discuss the Bill on this stage I would like to make clear the position of the Chair as regards the introduction into the debate of the personality and office of the Chief Justice as Chief Justice.  As Deputies are aware, there has been a rule for over 25 years past, based constitutionally, that the office and personality of a judge or his decision in court are not in order in debate in <Col N="2145" /> the House.  The inclusion of the Chief Justice as a member of the board under Section 4 of the Bill does, as the Chair stated on an earlier stage, leave that section open to criticism by members who take objection to the course proposed in the section.  In other words, the Chief Justice as chairman of the board will not be acting in his judicial capacity.  That objection may be legitimately voiced by those who feel it necessary to adopt that course, but I must emphasise, following the proceedings on Second Stage and Committee Stage of the Bill, that the office of Chief Justice cannot be made the subject matter of debate, neither can there be reflections on him personally nor can his motives be canvassed.</P>

      <P>On this, the Final Stage of this Bill, I wish to enter a cast, brief, but I hope emphatic protest against the infringement of principle in this Bill, against the dangerous doctrines that have been used in the course of the debate to justify its passage and the very dangerous precedent that the Bill creates.  I have no intention of referring in any way to any of the details of the measure or to any part of the machinery which is in the Bill to carry out the central purpose of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An action was started by private individuals in court claiming that they were entitled to certain moneys in court.  Those moneys had been lodged in court a considerable number of years ago because it was not possible then to ascertain who was the original owner of those moneys.  The lodgment in court by trustees of trust moneys is permissible in cases of that kind where trustees have difficulty in administering the funds subject to their trust or where they are unable to ascertain who are the real beneficiaries of the trust funds.  That was the position in the case.  That was the position of the trustees when the money was lodged in court.  For many years no person came forward claiming to be entitled to any interest or any share in those funds and no action was taken in court to establish any claim to those funds or to get the direction of the court as to their future use.  Some few years ago certain private individuals, citizens <Col N="2146" /> of this State, rightly or wrongly conceived the notion that they had a claim to those funds.  They adopted the recognised legal procedure to have their claims adjudicated upon by the courts established in accordance with the Constitution and with the law of this State. The existing provisions of the existing Constitution provided by Article 34 that justice should be administered in the public courts established by law.  In the exercise of their rights as citizens of this State they had resort to the Irish courts established by an Irish Parliament administering Irish law.  Their action proceeded, as I understand, with no great expedition, for a variety of reasons but, just as apparently those plaintiffs in that proceeding were in a position at a not very distant date to have their claims adjudicated upon, this House was called upon to interfere and to exercise its right of passing legislation dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>Stripped of all the discussions, perhaps of the irrelevancies, that have crept into the debates upon this Bill, that is the fundamental matter to which I wish to direct attention.  This is an effort by the Parliament to take away from a private individual his right to resort to the court at a time when he is pursuing that right which is vested in him as a citizen and before the courts established by this Parliament have adjudicated upon or are given a chance of adjudicating upon his claims.  That is what I say is the principle which is infringed by this Bill.</P>
    <P>In the course of the discussion on Committee Stage of this Bill I suggested that possibly a case could be made that a problem existed as to the future dealings with the funds in court.  The proper time to have dealt with that was before any individual took any step to have his claim adjudicated upon in court.  Possibly some discussions took place amongst parties who had some interest in these funds or in the organisation whose funds they were, prior to the institution of the proceedings.  The vital fact is that no step was taken to obtain Parliamentary sanction for any dealings with those funds until long after an action had been started in our courts and that this Bill only came into this <Col N="2147" /> House at a moment when the plaintiffs in the suit were endeavouring to have their action heard.  To interfere in that set of facts is, in my submission, Sir, a very dangerous precedent.  To justify this wholly unprecedented proceeding a variety of arguments were put forward on behalf of the Government.  A new body of equity was appealed to and ultimately we were told that the Oireachtas was regarded as something in the nature of a High Court of Equity or a High Court of Justice, exercising some indeterminate jurisdiction, quite unknown, without precedent, without rule, without anything to refer to except what a particular Government might conceive to be the equity of a particular set of facts in a particular period of time.  The appeal to such a nebulous jurisdiction in this House is, again, a very dangerous doctrine to promulgate.  I say that it is dangerous, not appealing to the existing circumstances with which we are confronted at present in the country or in this Dáil, but taking the long view and looking forward into the history of this country in the future.  We do not know what particular Government, what particular majority may find themselves wishing to do a particular action, through legislative sanction, which may cause injustice to particular individuals in the future, the justification for which will be in this nebulous and indeterminate jurisdiction that the Dáil is supposed to have for a body of equity that exists in the minds of particular individuals from time to time, finding its rules in no law or no legal code&mdash;which can be found in no books, which can be ascertained with no certainty but which can be given a high-sounding title for the justification of a piece of gross injustice.  I think that anybody who looks at this matter impartially and in a detached frame of mind must realise that we are setting a very dangerous precedent and appealing for its justification to very dangerous doctrines, ill-founded and, in my submission, ill-conceived.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that I speak on this Fifth and Final Stage of the Bill.  I have no interest in the action. little interest in how the funds are to be dealt with under this Bill, but I <Col N="2148" /> feel that the public interest which has also been called into aid&mdash;I think for the first time, I mentioned it in the first speech I made on Section 10 of the Committee Stage of this Bill&mdash; requires that this precedent should not be proceeded with.  I have little hope that the Prime Minister, who is in charge of this Bill and who has sponsored it throughout by appeals to this indeterminate body of equity and to the jurisdiction of this House as the High Court of Parliament, will accede to this final request made by me and, I think, by my colleagues entirely as a matter of principle.  I think that if this case were even now allowed to continue its allotted course, before the autumn session of this Parliament the House would be in a better position to see what ought to be done in connection with the matter.  I do not know whether or not these plaintiffs are entitled to succeed or will succeed in their action, but I think we are not entitled to say that they will not succeed, that rather we are entitled to say that if the courts do give a decision in their favour that decision must be such, of necessity, from the facts as we know them now, as to justify legislative interference to set them aside.  That is what we are doing in this Bill.  I think that is an evil thing to do.  It is a bad precedent to set.  We have been used, in the course of our studies of the history of law and equity, to hear reference to the so-called &ldquo;Mother of Parliaments&rdquo; as being the High Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>The British legislature, for historical reasons, can claim to be a High Court of Justice but, with their instinct for doing the proper thing in a proper way, they have their own methods which find their highest exposition in the judicial functions of the judicial members of the House of Lords.  We have no such history here in this country and I think it is a very bad precedent to try to set up this Dáil, this forum of political Parties, elected on political programmes, to try to put it into the heads of these people that they have some sort of depository of justice and some form of deposit of faith which will enable them to determine what is justice and equity in a particular instance and in a better fashion <Col N="2149" /> than the judges who are appointed, after years of training and experience, to administer justice in the courts of this country.  It is utter nonsense to say that this is a court of equity or that it has any possible qualification to deal with matters of morals, of fundamental principles of justice.  These, Sir, are the outlines merely of the objections that I have to this Bill.  I oppose it on principle because I think it enshrines a principle and creates a very dangerous precedent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I follow very much along the lines of my colleagues who has just spoken.  In order to have the matter brought into a narrow compass for those who may read, I would like, at this Fifth Stage of this calamitous measure, to refer to two or three quotations from what I heard the Taoiseach saying here and which certainly indicate a new conception of the whole system of the courts of law, of justice and of equity in this country.  I want to stress, before I read, that I had expected some case might be made in connection with this measure on account of the very peculiar nature of the moneys which are at issue in the suit that is before the courts, that some better effort might have been made to prevent this action from having a general effect later: that some effort might have been made to show why this was a singular situation and one whose very circumstances, as adopted in this House, should never have led to the point of precedent that Deputy Costello fears.</P>
      <P>I want to stress that the words I shall quote here are used generally by the Taoiseach.  His phrases do not affect this Bill, and this Bill only.  His phrases were not carefully considered so as to have application only in a limited way and only to this particular measure.  The phrases that he used were of general import and can have much wider application than the measure we are discussing.  On the 24th April, in the Dáil, as reported in column 1444 of the Official Reports, he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;When we bring this matter here we are bringing it to the sovereign court of justice, the court which can <Col N="2150" /> decide upon the substantial justice what is proposed...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As reported in the Official Reports two columns earlier he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I say that we are here&rdquo;&mdash;that is Dáil Éireann&mdash;&ldquo;a court of equity in this matter, the fundamental court of equity, and that what I am striving for here is that substantial justice should be done as against formal justice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, again, as reported in column 1444, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...is to be judged by its fundamental justice, that is, its justice from the point of view of the well being of the people as a whole, the common good.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is then the supreme court of justice and, lest there should be a difference between justice and equity, this is the supreme court of equity, and lest there should be something over and above justice and equity in the way of fundamental right, this is the court where fundamental right will be declared in accordance with our notion of the common good.</P>
    <P>I take up my Constitution at that point to see how all that fits in with what we, the people of Éire, gave ourselves in this Constitution, and I find an Article which deals with the courts and which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Justice shall be administered in public courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by this Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the courts' jurisdiction is set out.  You are to have courts of first instance, including a High Court &ldquo;invested with full original jurisdiction in and power to determine all matters and questions whether of law or fact, civil or criminal&rdquo;.  We have Articles dealing with the criminal courts which give every man a right to trial by jury.  Of course, we weaken by saying that special courts can be set up, and we know that under earlier Article we can have administrative tribunals, and neither the special courts nor the administrative tribunals may be presided over by judges appointed under this Constitution.</P>
    <P>I ask where is the power in that to establish this legislative body, whose <Col N="2151" /> function under this Constitution is declared to be distinct from that of the courts, as a court.  I am reminded of a phrase used in England in connection with a piece of statute law when a court giving judgment said that &ldquo;it seemed as if in constructing an elaborate fortification the Legislature had provided what appears to be an easy method of undermining its foundations&rdquo;. Are we undermining the foundations, by this easy method of the Sinn Féin Funds Bill, of the courts that we so solemnly established in this document?  What are we putting in their place?  At the end of a debate in which the Taoiseach himself derided the courts which he established and partly filled by saying that they might give an unreal decision, that they were tied to a narrow legalism and that they could not, for some reason, understand the background of fact associated with this matter, we find that he is driven to claim that if anybody wants to question the constitutionality of this measure he will go where?  To the courts, which are held up to scorn here as a body that might give a narrow legalistic determination, might find something that was unreal and which are, apparently, incompetent to apprebend the associated body of facts upon which their decision might rest.</P>
    <P>These words used by the Taoiseach are general.  It is not that we, in relation to the Sinn Féin Funds Bill are a sovereign court of justice, or a court of equity, or the place where fundamental rights will be declared, but generally.  That is the position we have taken up.  In the old days one knew of the pagan concept, that what pleased the Prince had the force of law.  Have we got to the point now when the Prince has established himself and is projecting his view of the law in this Assembly and through his Party as being something which will have the force of law irrespective of what the Constitution may say or the courts may decide?  We know that in recent years there was another distoration of law, the Nazi idea of law which tried to propound the theory that law was an emanation of the folk spirit, the spirit of race, and that there was one man who could declare what <Col N="2152" /> that spirit was.  That was put through a completely dominated Reichstag. Are we near that position now?  Is that what is being claimed?</P>
    <P>At this stage we find ourselves three or four days from the introduction in England of a piece of legislation called a Bill to Preserve the Rights of Subjects. There they set out, fearing they have gone too far along the path along which we have gone much further, to take certain precautions and to give certain safeguards to prevent, say, a situation that sometimes can arise in England where a point of law may not be raised in court when a Minister is plaintiff, a position in law in England which has given a shorter time for the limitation of actions than there is in connection with a private citizen, and a variety of small points; everything that goes, as one man said, to strengthen the enormous leverage that the Crown has against the private citizen when he comes into court.</P>
    <P>We have all these statutes that they object to.  We have done away with the Crown in name, but we have Crown positions and we have Crown rights as against citizens and the enormous leverage is there.  In England what they object to is the leverage exercised in court and determined by judges appointed to be in such a position that they can be independent, ask to be independent, and expect to be independent.  We have this easy, roundabout fashion of by-passing the Constitution.  We keep the courts, but we say to the courts: &ldquo;Not in this case will you give any determination.  You might be constrained to decide on narrow legalistic grounds.  You might not understand the background of fact.  You might be brought to an unreal decision and, therefore, we do now what we mean hereafter to do many times: we take from you the right to decide this case.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have gone very far in this country already past what we call the fundamental rights of the citizens.  We have got past this constitutional position with a piece of legislation which enables the Minister to declare it his opinion that a named person should go to jail and that person goes to jail and stays in jail until such time as the Minister changes his opinion, and no <Col N="2153" /> court can decide on the legality of that detention.  We have the same system that rules in what we used to know as the privacy of the house, and the liberty of the subject must be exactly the same if any question arises in connection with a breach of the privacy of the house.  If this legislative body passes legislation saying somebody's house is to be battered down to effect an entry, that is law.</P>

      <P>We have another Article in this Constitution about private rights, phrased in such terms that the courts had to declare that the references to social justice were more political shibboleths, devoid of all legal meaning.  The courts that said those things were put into the position of being independent and they are expected to be independent.  Now we have the clear-cut situation explained to us by the Taoiseach, and I am generalising his words&mdash;that in any case in which this legislative body, by a majority, thinks the public may demand it, this House can interfere in a pending case and deprive those applying for justice and law before the courts of what they are seeking in contest to get from the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume, from the Taoiseach's interjection when we discussed this from a constitutional point of view, that he will agree with what I am going to say, that if he brings in legislation, putting it in this way, that whenever it appeared to the Taoiseach to be conducive to the public good that he should, by notice served on the court, get the court to dismiss a pending action, and then have that action brought in here for the determination of the Taoiseach, with his Party strength, he would expect and claim that that Bill would be passed by the courts as constitutional.  I think that <Col N="2154" /> is his claim.  If that is his claim, and I suggest it cannot be anything but that, what is the value of this document, with its whole elaborate fortification of the courts and an independent judiciary, and the statement that the courts will have full jurisdication over every matter, civil and criminal, fact and law?</P>
    <P>The British are now fortifying their code with a new piece of legislation to safeguard the rights of subjects.  They have no constitutional guarantees.  It is said they depend upon the majority of a particular generation for what they do, and yet they are much more jealous of an individual's rights than we are here, with all our fortification of the Constitution.  They have a tradition in these matters.  Unfortunately, we have not.  One can go back and read through their history and find the long conflict there was when the people were trying to get power from a king.  Eventually, they carried forward the same conflict, so that the people struggled, not against a prince or a king, but against an executive, and they kept pressing and pressing and worked out the code of justice they now have, founded upon the Bill of Rights.</P>
    <P>This Sinn Féin Funds Bill and all that comes from it, with its repercussions on the Constitution, now means that we are passing a Bill of no rights, except such rights as the Taoiseach and the majority Party will allow to any person.  In this we are encroaching on the old fundamental rights and I often think, when I hear debates on constitutional matters here, that there is very little regard for the history and the tradition which attach to these things.  I hear people using phrases as if we got our rights from 1916, 1921 or a later date.  Nobody appears to appreciate the long history that there is behind all this and the terrific struggle there was to achieve all these rights and the fact that when people were striving for them, they were striving for something that was sacred to them, that came to them from an old Christian and an old classical and pagan tradition.</P>
    <P>We are going to have none of that. We have the simple case that we who are elected as a legislative body under <Col N="2155" /> a Constitution which segregates our duties and rights from that of the courts are now suddenly assuming the status and powers of judges.  We are, to quote again, the supreme court of justice in this country, we are the supreme court of equity in this country. We are even above all that.  If anybody wants fundamental rights, this is the court where these rights will be got, and they will get these rights on our consideration of the common good.</P>
    <P>And not merely are all the old things rooted in tradition gone if this succeeds, but even the extra fortification given to history of having an institution of law and justice built up in a way that is common all over the world. The plan that seemed best to the best minds of men all over the world over many centuries was that it was a great thing to have, side by side with your legislative body and your Executive, another body, a body of men chosen for their judgment as well as for their knowledge of law, people who, when chosen, were given every possible fortification that persons would require to put them into an independent position and there was then demanded of them that they be independent.  Our Constitution demands all that, and, after that we relied on their good sense and judgment and experience; but independence was the key-note.</P>
    <P>Is this House marked by independence? Was it not because nobody could believe in the complete independence, in the face of a particular set of facts, of a legislative body elected on a Party system, that this scheme of flanking the legislative body with a body of judges grew up?  Now we abolish all that.  We are going backwards through history; we are going back beyond the Bill of Rights.  We are back unconsciously at the stage which men thought to be so bad that they fought for years to establish the system of institutions we are now scrapping.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Costello is right in saying that this is an evil precedent, a frightening precedent, and it is only right to say, in conclusion, that the motive that has led to this is as mean as the action to which it has led. <Col N="2156" /> Because one man cannot have his history brought out before the people on oath in court when he would appear, as he would have to, as a witness, and to hide the shame that might lie on him, we wreek the foundations, constitutionally, of the State.  It was fitting that part of the debate should have been garnished with four words of Greek from a man who certainly knows no Greek and who most decidedly knows nothing of the Greek system, the Greek tradition, the whole view that the Greeks had of life which made them among the first to give us what eventually led on to the building of courts of justice side by side with the legislative body.  We can take the four words of Greek&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should start by congratulating our two legal friends on the ability with which they have tried to confuse the issue.  This Bill was brought in for a very simple object, and it provides how that object is to be secured.  There was placed in court some 23 years ago a sum of money which belonged to a great national organisation.  It was placed in court because of a great national division which broke up that national organisation into two parts.  Two treasurers, who happened to go one way, put the moneys in court.  The moneys have been there for 23 years and nobody has claimed them during the whole of that time.  The question of their disposal did not arise until the second of the treasurers had died and the legal personal representative of that last surviving treasurer had asked that something be done about them.  It has been suggested in all this debate that we have stepped in to interfere with court action.  The truth <Col N="2157" /> is the reverse&mdash;that this matter was brought to the court only when the question of legislative action for the disposal of these moneys was known to be about to take place.  These moneys have to be disposed of or left there permanently.  It seems to me right and proper that this House, as representing in the largest and broadest way the nation, whose interests were being served by that national organisation to which the moneys were subscribed, should dispose of these moneys.</P>
      <P>Some of the lawyers who talked during the debate seem to suggest that the courts could have brought in a method of settling them, on the <i>cy prés</i> doctrine.  They know full well, as lawyers, that that is not so.  They know full well that that doctrine has a very restricted application to charitable objects and that the courts could not in these circumstances settle a scheme on that basis.  Though they know that and pretend to give us legal opinions here for our guidance, they conceal it and pretend the opposite. The courts could not dispose of these funds; therefore, it was natural that this body should dispose of them.  It was only when we were prepared to come in here with legislation to dispose of them that the courts were resorted to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this resort to the courts took place, the Government and I had to decide what steps we were going to take.  We stepped aside in the hope that there might be a quick determination of this matter.  We waited for a number of years until finally the Attorney-General took steps to compel the action to be brought to hearing. Under that compulsion, a date was fixed, but no sooner was the date fixed than another action began.  When I asked what expenses were likely to have been incurred up to then, I was shocked when I was told that probably before the case came to trial at all, a sum of £7,000 or £8,000 would have been spent.  I naturally asked the question: &ldquo;How much will it take if this case goes to court?&rdquo; It was anticipated, this being a case covering a long period of years, that another £7,000 or £8,000 would have to be spent, as it was expected that the case would <Col N="2158" /> last for three weeks at least.  Then I was informed that it was very likely that the case would go to appeal and that, if it went to appeal, another sum of practically the same amount would be spent; so that the estimate that was given to me was that about £20,000 of the total of £24,000 in court was going to be spent in legal expenses.</P>
    <P>I was told that we were going to have two seniors and a junior on the side of the plaintiffs, that the Attorney-General was going to have two seniors and a junior and that there were going to be two seniors and a junior on behalf of the representative of the last surviving treasurer.  I asked myself: Would we be justified in allowing all this money to be spent, so that in the end nobody was going to benefit by these national funds except those who would benefit through law costs?</P>
    <P>I felt that it would be a scandal that money contributed under the circumstances in which this fund was contributed should go in that way.  Perhaps I should have seen that earlier and at the very beginning, when this action was proposed, that I should have gone ahead with the legislation.  One of the reasons was&mdash;I am not ignoring it&mdash; that retroactive legislation is not desirable if it can be avoided.  I was anxious, therefore, to allow the matter to come to a head and get it finished with, rather than bring in legislation; but when I saw that the result was going to be that, no matter which side got the decision, in the end all that would be left would be a trifling sum of money, then my belief was that the fund should be used for better purposes than being spent on law charges.</P>
    <P>I had for a long period of years endeavoured to get that money applied for some common purpose, a purpose that would be agreed to by all the various parts into which the organisation had split up.  I failed in that.  As is well known, I tried to get agreement so that the money would be used for the advancement of the language, because that was a common purpose.  It was a purpose that was common both to the original organisation and to the various sections into which that organisation had, since 1922, become split up.  The revival of the language was, <Col N="2159" /> as I said, a common purpose, and I had done my best to get agreement so that the money would be used for that purpose, but when the representative of the last surviving treasurer came along, the suggestion was to use it somewhat in the same way as is provided here in this Bill.  I said I did not care for that very much, because I was afraid of the administrative costs that would be involved.  On the particular matter in which it was proposed to dispose of the funds, I felt that the administrative charges would be too high, but as there seemed to be a measure of agreement obtainable on that method amongst the survivors of the controlling body of the original organisation, from 1919 to 1922, I accepted it as being very much better than wasting the money in legal charges.  Now, that is the history of the matter.</P>
    <P>So far as the suitability of this body to dispose of the funds is concerned, I think there can be no doubt.  These were national funds in the broadest sense, given to probably the broadest national organisation which could be shown in any country.  That organisation was broken in two in 1922, and, in 1923, I, as one of the principal officers on one side, did my utmost to restore that organisation, to reorganise it.  I did my utmost to keep it on the lines on which it had been, to keep the constitution the same, and I did everything within my power to maintain the continuity.  Would that be sufficient to establish the right of the organisation of which I was president after 1922 or 1923 to the funds?  I do not know.  I do not know on what legal principles, on what basis that might be decided in court, but my evidence in a court of law would be that I did that, and to what extent I succeeded the court would have to determine.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan suggests that I would be afraid to stand as a witness in court because I would be parading myself, he said, as having been President of Sinn Féin from 1922 to 1926. I was president of that organisation, of the reorganised organisation, from 1922 to 1926.  That would be my evidence.  I would not have to go to <Col N="2160" /> court to try to make a thesis on one side or another.  All I would have to do in a court is to give the truth in so far as I knew it and to give my evidence as I knew it.  If the court decided one way or the other, that was no longer my business, once it had gone to the court, and, were I a witness in court.  I would say there what I am saying here, that&mdash;a fact which is known to everybody&mdash;I was President of Sinn Féin from 1922 to 1926.  I did not parade myself as such but was president of the organisation that called itself Sinn Féin.  Whether there was a continuity, I could not say what the court would hold, but I know that I did my utmost to maintain the continuity.</P>

      <P>The Deputy need not interrupt.  I have said that I did everything I could.  In that organisation there was another break in 1926. As president of that organisation&mdash; remember that it had already been reorganised in 1917 and that the Sinn Féin organisation from 1917 to 1922 was a very different organisation from the Sinn Féin organisation from 1905 to 1917, although it had the same name, it was very different&mdash;I tried, in 1925 or 1926, to get Sinn Féin to adopt a policy which I believed would enable it to succeed in its purpose, and, when we did not get a majority at the particular convention, I left.  The result has been that, over a number of years, the organisation has dwindled to the position which I called insignificant, and the question is: is that body to which these funds were never subscribed&mdash;they were subscribed to the great national organisation&mdash;this small dwindling body, to claim to-morrow that it is entitled to get these funds? <Col N="2161" /> In the arguments here, it was suggested that we are taking the funds away from them.  They never had them.</P>

      <P>That is a question on which different people might have different opinions.  So far as I am concerned, that was the position&mdash;I took it that they had left it.  We tried to reorganise and build up the organisation. But suppose this small body got these funds to-morrow&mdash;I do not know what numbers they have, but if there were only a dozen people calling themselves Sinn Féin&mdash;are we going to say that these dozen people are entitled to get these moneys subscribed to a great national organisation, and that, after getting them, they could, by changing their constitution, apply them to any purpose they pleased?  I think that in ordinary simple justice the thing would be absurd.  The fact is that everybody who subscribed to this fund, every subscriber in the country, has a certain interest in these moneys, and if it were possible to give back these moneys to the subscribers, it would, in my opinion, be the course that would be adopted by the courts, but, of course, that is not possible.  These are the fundamental merits of the case as I see them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said&mdash;and I believe that, in saying it, I was only saying in a different form what the Leader of the Opposition said &mdash;that this was a matter which was not the type of matter which should have gone to the courts at all.  The Leader of the Opposition was inclined to blame me at the start for not taking action more quickly before any expenses had been incurred.  That was the way I expected him to approach it. <Col N="2162" /> It was the realistic and honest way of approaching it, but the lawyers took a hand and turned the whole debate into a different channel.</P>

It has been suggested here that we are doing something monstrous, something unprecedented, that we are cutting away the foundations of the State by this action.  One would think that legislation of this kind had never been passed in any Parliament in the world, but the fact is that legislation of this kind has been passed in every Parliament&mdash;whether it is a Parliament like ours with a written Constitution, a Parliament like that of Great Britain with no written Constitution or a Parliament like that of the United States with a written Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  What is unique?  That you have a sum of money left for 23 years in court which was given originally to a great national organisation.  I said it was unique because I do not think it will happen in our lifetime that anything of this kind will arise again, or is likely to happen very often in the lifetime of the State.  It is unique, and, because it is unique, the danger of legislation being used as a precedent in that connection is most unlikely. That was the sense in which I used the word &ldquo;unique&rdquo;.  Undoubtedly, it is unique.  It is something which has happened in this State once and is not likely to happen again.</P>

That is untrue and known to be untrue by every lawyer in the House and by everybody who cared to read the debates, either here or in the Seanad, when the first case of retroactive legislation was being introduced.  The very same arguments <Col N="2163" /> used by the Opposition against this Bill were used by the Opposition of that day, both here and in the Seanad, against the Land Bill of 1926 relating to the Lynam v. Butler case.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will wait, I will deal with these things.  The principle involved from the point of view of the Opposition&mdash;the case they made&mdash;was that here was a case pending, a case which was being appealed to another court; they said: &ldquo;If you do not want it to go to this other court, bring in a change of the Constitution. This is a case in which an individual is concerned which is passing from one set of courts to another and you are coming in now to interfere with the courts.&rdquo;  It was said that it was monstrous and most unprecedented, that it was going to set a precedent for all sorts of interference with the courts in future, that it interfered with the independence of the courts and so on.  That particular type of argument had to be met, as well as the argument that it was necessary, in the national interest, to prevent its going to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.  What were the answers?  The same answers, if anybody cares to look them up, that I made here.  Those were the answers given to the argument that it was unprecedented to interfere with the independence of the judiciary and so on. Cases by the dozen could be quoted both from England and the United States proving that retroactive legislation was not merely possible but was necessary in the public interest in those countries on a number of occasions.  I shall come to some individual cases later.  Let us keep to general principles for the moment</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My words have been parsed&mdash;words I spoke here impromptu.  They have been taken from their context and it has been sought to give them a significance other than the obvious significance which would be given them by anybody who took them in the context of the case I was making.  I said that, in every Act of ours, the question of justice is involved.  We make the laws. <Col N="2164" /> If we make unjust laws, then the courts have to carry out those unjust laws. The courts have no option in the matter.  They have to maintain the Constitution and the laws as they find them.  It is we, sitting as the representatives of the people, who make the laws.</P>
    <P>In so far as we are making laws, we are determining rights as amongst classes and individuals in the State. There is scarcely a law we pass which does not, somehow, affect existing rights.  Therefore, if we act unjustly, if we do not act from the point of view of the public good, we shall be doing damage.  We are, undoubtedly, inasmuch as we are making the laws, a supreme court of justice&mdash;in that sense.  Whatever laws we make, the courts have to carry out.  It is pretended here that the courts can, somehow, as against the Legislature, defend citizens.  That is a mistaken idea. In England, where they have no Constitution determining the rights of citizens, Parliament is sovereign and Parliament can pass a law interfering with the rights of any individual or any class of individual at any time. There is no question whatever of any barrier to that supreme power.  Except for the Constitution here, there is no legal barrier to the exercise of rights in such a way as will compel the courts to do exactly what Parliament wants them to do.  The Oireachtas makes the law.  The courts have simply to interpret the law as it is given them and carry it out.  If, at any time, the courts interpret a law in a way contrary to the will of Parliament, Parliament can change that law.  That should be obvious to everybody.  It is nonsense to think that the courts can stand up in opposition to Parliament in regard to general rights.</P>
    <P>In our Constitution, we have provided for the protection of the citizen; in so far as it was possible to preserve individual rights, as against the rights of the community as a whole or the Executive or Parliament, without making the whole system impossible, that was done in the Constitution.  The aim in that Constitution was to preserve fundamental rights and prevent any majority in Parliament, or any Executive influencing that majority, from interfering <Col N="2165" /> with certain fundamental rights.  But the Constitution had to be a practical document.  It was not sufficient to give expression to general ideas; it had to be a workable document. It had to see this State through dangerous periods such as that through which we have just passed.  It had to save the State against abuses of liberty, and it will be admitted that there can be abuses of liberty.  All that had to be provided in it.</P>
    <P>Save in so far as it may be later changed by the Irish people, the Constitution is over Parliament, and the power the Supreme Court has over Parliament is to see that Parliament does not transgress or violate that Constitution.  That is the ultimate safeguard in so far as it is possible to have safeguards for the individual. It has been suggested that this Bill is a violation of the Constitution.  Nobody has attempted to get down to bedrock and point out exactly where and how it violates the Constitution.  We have had vague phrases, but nobody has attempted to show in what respect the Bill which you are now asked to pass violates the Constitution.  The advice given to me by people who have no interest whatever in misleading me is that this Bill is constitutional.  I am satisfied with that.  If anybody has an action in which that point is involved, he can bring it to the courts.  If and when that question is tested, if this Bill is found to be in any respect whatsoever contrary to the Constitution by the determining authority&mdash; the Supreme Court&mdash;then, to that extent, what we do is null and void.  Let us have an end to this suggestion that we are violating the Constitution.  We cannot do it.</P>

      <P>The argument about our doing something which is unconstitutional is, on the face of it, absurd. We cannot do anything effective which is unconstitutional.  Anything that we do, if it is unconstitutional, is to that extent null and void; and if anybody claims that the advice which is given to me, which I accept, is unsound, then any person aggrieved can have the matter tested.  Nobody has pointed to any particular Article of the Constitution, but there has been a general suggestion that there in something in this which is against the whole spirit of the Constitution.  Well, in the case of an American decision which was adopted and approved here in the State (Ryan) v. Lennon, 1935 (Irish Reports, 170, p. 236) the words of that decision were:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Courts cannot nullify an Act of the State Legislature on the vague ground that they think it opposed to a general spirit supposed to pervade or underlie the Constitution where neither the terms nor the implications of the instrument disclose any such restriction.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, the courts naturally held that if anything in the Constitution is to be interpreted as governing or fettering the sovereign right of Parliament it must be specific and precise. Britain has no written Constitution to fetter the power of the Legislature at any particular time to take such action as it deems wise in the public interest. <Col N="2168" /> Therefore, the constitutional side of the argument has no weight whatever. All the eloquence of Deputy McGilligan about the rights of individuals and the struggle that there was in Great Britain against Parliament are of no avail.  Those rights are enshrined, in so far as that document is effective, in the will of Parliament.  It would be very foolish for our people to think that, if they at any particular time elect a majority of their representatives with any particular point of view, they are not in a position to give effect to those views, on the one condition only of their being subject to the Constitution. Therefore, when elections take place and when the people are electing their representatives, they should remember that they are giving them a tremendous power for the good or ill of the community as a whole.</P>

    <P>I have been asked if I could give some examples of legislation of this character.  The plea has been made that we can have legislation retroactive, but that there is no case which just comes in and interferes with a case in court.  Of course, that was not true, and anyone who tried to understand the matter at all knew it was not true. Within our own experience here, without going to any particular case, scarcely a Deputy would not have heard of laws being passed in which it was stated something like this: &ldquo;The law shall be such, notwithstanding anything else and shall always be deemed to have been such.&rdquo;  The first case is that of the Land Act of 1926, which dealt with the Lynam v. Butler case.  Leave had been given by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to appeal.  It was regarded that it would be wrong national policy to allow that to happen, and, in the public interest, the State came along and passed an Act which deprived this litigant, who was looking for a change in the decision, of any chance of getting any change in the decision.  The reason for that was a good reason.  Even <Col N="2169" /> though the Constitution at the time was interpreted by some as giving litigants the right to bring in that outside court, it was right and proper in the national interest to say that that should not happen.  But the fact was that it did come in, in the middle of a legal process, and say that one of the parties was not going to be allowed to be heard &mdash;or, at least, be heard with any effect.</P>
    <P>I have another case.  Some of these cases are more to the point than others.  This one is about a deputy-registrar in Bankruptcy in Cork.  The point was that he had been acting and doing certain things, and it was found that only the registrar could do those things.  A law was passed stating that any act done in the exercise of powers which could have been lawfully delegated to the registrar was deemed to be and always to have been as valid and as effectual, when done by the deputy-registrar, as if it had been done by the registrar himself.  That was a case of a decision which had been taken by the court and the Legislature came along and set it aside.  As far as interference with the courts is concerned, which is the greater interference&mdash;to come in before a thing is done or to wait until it is done and then say: &ldquo;No matter what the decision was, we, as a sovereign authority, say the law shall be otherwise&rdquo;? It was not a matter of very grave consequence, I admit, but the principle of setting the law otherwise than the court stated it to be is contained in it.</P>
    <P>I have another case, that of the Copyright (Preservation) Act of 1929. That was a case in which the Performing Rights Society took action against the Bray Urban Council for contravening copyright.  What was the result? An Act was passed declaring retrospectively, notwithstanding the decision of the court that there was no copyright, the subsistence in Saorstát Éireann from the 5th December, 1921, of every copyright of the kind which had been declared by the Supreme Court not to be subsisting.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court said that no such right subsisted.  The State came along and made a law that such a right did subsist.  It then took certain steps that flowed from that, because <Col N="2170" /> although the right subsisted it did not want to have the Bray Council mulcted in charges for breaking a copyright. It deprived the defendants of the benefit of the decision in their favour that they had not infringed any copyright&mdash; it was found that they had not&mdash;but the Legislature said: &ldquo;you have&rdquo;, at the same time protecting them and others to the extent of precluding any right to damages or otherwise, in respect of the infringement before the passing of the Act.  Incidentally, I might mention that that case went before the Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council, which held that the Act precluded them from doing anything other than discharging the order of the Supreme Court as to costs. There was a case where the Supreme Court said that there was no copyright, and where the Legislature came along and said that there was, The Legislature was even able to be inconsistent, because, although it said that a copyright existed, it also said that still there were to be no damages given for the infringement of it.</P>
    <P>I have another case here which relates to the Finance Act of 1929.  At that time there was an income-tax case pending and it was understood that there was a question going to be raised with reference to the power of removing documents.  Section 30 of this Finance Act of 1929 declared that a power to inspect and take copies of documents conferred by Section 26 of the Finance Act, 1926, included and had always included power to remove all or any such documents.  Now, that was a case in which it was understood by the State that the vital point would be whether the State could or could not remove documents.  The State, in protecting the public interest, took good care to see that it had that power, and, of course, once the Legislature passed a law then the courts had to accept it.</P>
    <P>I have here the Courts of Justice (No. 2) Act, 1931.  This statute declared that a certain method of awarding costs in the Circuit Court and a certain principle of taxation in respect of such costs should be and be deemed always to have been valid.  This had the effect of overruling the decision of the Supreme Court in the case <Col N="2171" /> of Quinn v. Stokes (1931), Irish Reports, 558.  The Act, however, excluded from its operation any costs directed by the Supreme Court before the passing of the Act to be taxed on any particular principle appointed by that court in respect of those costs. There was another case where the State had no hesitation in coming in and saying that the law shall be and be deemed always to have been valid and in overruling the decision of the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Then there was the Land Act of 1936. Section 13 of that Act extended retrospectively the power of the Land Commission to reduce standard purchase annuities under Section 38 of the Land Act of 1933 to cases of holdings subject to a judicial rent.  Before that it was held that the section did not apply to those subject to a judicial rent.  In the case of the Marquis of Lansdowne against the Land Commission (1936)&mdash; Irish Jurist Reports, 1&mdash;the Supreme Court had held that Section 38 of the Act of 1933 did not extend to such holdings.  The statute of 1936 went on to provide that the extended power could be exercised in relation to a particular holding subject to a judicial rent, notwithstanding any order or decision to the contrary in respect of that particular holding made or given before the passing of the Act, if so made or given on the sole ground that such holding was subject to a judicial rent.  This deprived the plaintiff in the particular case, as well as all others, of the benefit of the decision in his favour.</P>
    <P>Another section of the Land Act of 1936 went further.  Section 17 of that Act contained retrospective amendments of Section 28 of the Land Act, 1933, relating to warrants of the Land Commission for the levy by distress of arrears of annuities.  It had the effect of nullifying the decision of the High Court in the case of Halpin against the Attorney-General (1936)&mdash;Irish Reports 226&mdash;and it contained a provision&mdash;I ask Deputies to listen to this&mdash;providing that any action or other proceeding pending at the passing of the Act in respect of anything done under Section 28 of the Land Act, 1933, should not be further prosecuted or proceeded with if <Col N="2172" /> and so far as it was grounded on all or any of the matters retrospectively set right by the provision in the Act of 1936.</P>
    <P>At a later date, there was the case of the Accidental Fires Act, 1943.  Most Deputies will probably remember this. There was a fire in Athlone which started in a factory and spread.  It affected a number of houses and property adjoining.  The Accidental Fires Act of 1715 did not cover the case of a factory, and, accordingly, the defendants were liable for damage caused by the spreading of a fire originating, even though accidentally, in their factory. The statute, in effect, extended the protection against the consequences of an accidental fire to a fire originating in any building.  While it left the benefit of the decision in their favour to the plaintiffs in the particular case, it provided that any legal proceedings in connection with such fire instituted after 16th November, 1942&mdash;that was the date of an announcement on the subject&mdash;and pending at the passing of the Act should be discharged and made void, subject only to relief as to costs. This provision deprived a number of persons, damnified by the particular fire, of any remedy against the defendants&mdash;which they would have had if the decision had not been dealt with by statute.</P>
    <P>These were not the only cases.  They could be got by the dozen.  When the Land Act of 1926 was before the Seanad cases that were then fresh in the public mind were referred to.  One of them was the British War Charges (Validity) Act, 1925.  What happened was that during the war the British Government had made an arrangement so that licences were given for the provision of certain goods on certain charges.  They made these charges but it was found in the courts that they were doing something which was illegal.  The putting on of those charges was illegal and, therefore, they could not recover them.  What did the Legislature do?  It declared that acts which had been found by the courts to be illegal should be legalised, and should be held always to have been legal.  It said that those who should have paid those charges should now <Col N="2173" /> pay them, and that any cases before the court were to be dealt with on that basis.</P>
    <P>There was another case, the case of McDonald v. Shand, which I think was referred to in the debate.  The point there was that it was decided that the chargeability to income-tax in respect of bonuses was separate from the chargeability on the main income. Because the bonus was variable, it was held that it should not be taxed in accordance with the rules which had been adopted.  Again, the Legislature did not hesitate to come in, and the reason that it came in at that time was to avoid a certain financial loss, because all the civil servants, the moment they found the bonus which they had been getting came under this heading and was not, like fixed income, subject to tax, they began to bring cases into the courts, and, of course, the Legislature stepped in and said: &ldquo;Look here, we are not going to have any of that.  No matter what the courts have said, we deem that it is right and just that this bonus should be dealt with in the same way as fixed income,&rdquo; and deprived all these people of their right of action, just as we here, by passing that Act of ours with regard to accidental fires, deprived every person whose property was burned as a result of the fire from the factory, although they had at the moment before that Act came in, a right of action, and some of them were taking action.</P>
    <P>We deprived every one of these people of their right to go to the courts and to pursue that action.  So too, the British Parliament did not hesitate to save the Treasury from the loss that it would have suffered if the cost-of-living bonus paid to the Civil Service were to escape income tax, and we followed the same example here.  Precisely the same thing was done here in 1924, as was done in Great Britain, under our Finance Act of that year.  I think I have given sufficient examples to show that, so far as this Bill is impugned as doing something extra-ordinary in legislation, there is no foundation for the imputation.  We are doing what has been done time after time in other countries.  I think I can say, as was said in the debate <Col N="2174" /> on the Bill, that was the first case that came before us, in 1926, that we will all admit that retroactive and retrospective legislation is a thing that ought not to be lightly begun or attempted.  It is not desirable as a general rule that that should be done. It is quite a different thing to be told that it cannot be done, that we are doing something altogether unprecedented when we do it.  The whole question in all these cases is simply this: Is it in the public interest that it should or should not be done?  Is it in the particular case just that it should be done?  Not that it cannot be done.  If the arguments had gone on the line that it is not desirable in this case that we should do it or it will not be just to a particular party to do it, I could have no complaint or nobody could have any complaint, but I think we have very good ground to complain of the case put up by people on the opposite benches, who ought to be as jealous about the power of this Parliament as we are and who ought therefore not to try to cripple it.  In such a situation they ought to stand up for the rights here given us by the people under the Constitution.  That is the position.  I think, with regard to that, that we have a right to legislate retrospectively and that it would be wrong in principle to attempt to deny it because not merely is it desirable in some cases but in other cases it may be absolutely necessary to have retroactive and retrospective legislation.</P>
    <P>As regards the other question which I think can well be argued and which it is desirable to argue and to argue closely in any particular case&mdash;Is it justifiable or not that we should have retroactive or retrospective legislation; in the particular instance in which it is going to be done, is it just that it should be done, is it wise that it should be done?&mdash;I say in this case that it is just.  The people who are claiming these funds did not claim them for 23 years.  The people who are claiming them now, in my opinion, have no substantial right to them, whatever right they may be able to prove by any formal continuity.  I believe these moneys belong in the broadest way to the Irish people and ought to be used for some purpose which is in accord <Col N="2175" /> with that view.  Is it wise?  I think it is.  I think not merely is it just but it is wise.  I think it is wise that we <Col N="2176" /> should save these moneys for some good purpose and not let them be frittered away in law charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment I was dealing with the various aspects of the Lands Department.  The summary of the work of the Land Commission is very shortly put here.  It says that 9,920 acres is the amount acquired during the year and that an area of 14,132 acres was distributed among 808 allottees, and so on.  Paragraph seven says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The foregoing figures for land distribution do not include the allotments made to new allottees on land recovered from unsatisfactory allottees. The inclusion of such reallotments might also prove misleading. During the year ended 31st <Col N="2177" /> March, 1946, 282 acres taken up from unsatisfactory allottees were reallotted to 31 new allottees.  It is regrettable that such action is necessary but it is imperative in the national interest to insist on the proper use of allotments which have been provided for the beneficiaries at considerable expense to the general taxpayer.  New legislation was sponsored to make better provision for dealing with unsatisfactory allottees and the systematic inspection of allotments continued during the year under review.  The enactment of the Land Act, 1946, has clarified the legal position, and we shall continue to take every action possible to ensure the proper use of allotments by all allottees.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was in entire disagreement with that Act and I am more so to-day now that I see the Act functioning.  I stated at the time that it should be the duty of the Irish Land Commission to increase uneconomic holdings to an economic size.  I will speak later about the size. They have fixed the level at £10.  They do their best to bring every holding up to £10 valuation.  Surely there is sufficient land available to do so.  Two hundred and eighty-two acres were taken from unsatisfactory allottees and given to 31 new allottees.  I think that the Land Commission officials and inspectors would be far better and more gainfully occupied if instead of engaging in the work of inspecting allotments to see how they are being worked, they took steps to acquire land that is available in abundance all over the country and re-allot that.</P>
    <P>I hold that it is not the person with the uneconomic holding who gets the additional plot of land to bring it up to an economic size&mdash;it is the original holding that gets it.  Once an addition or an allotment is given to an uneconomic holding to bring it up to a certain level it is wrong under any circumstances to take that back.  The reason is quite obvious.  It is quite plain to anybody that there will be, as referred to here in this report, unsatisfactory allottees.  There will be people who get allotments and who will not work them as we would like to see them being worked.  What is the position? An unsatisfactory allottee has an allotment <Col N="2178" /> taken from him.  Say a man with a poor law valuation of £4 gets an allotment of £6 valuation, thereby bringing his total holding up to £10. He does not work that allotment as we would like to see him working it and it is taken from him.  If he is a careless or a lazy man or a good-fornothing, not alone will the allotment be taken from him, but the original holding will also go from him in time. When that holding is put up for sale it is bought by somebody else who then looks for an addition to it in the locality, but no addition is available, thereby creating a further problem in that particular case.</P>
    <P>In nearly all the cases I know of where people were threatened with having their allotment resumed they are widows or people who are temporarily incapacitated through sickness or through some other cause beyond their control.  Surely it is not the duty of a responsible Department of State to take allotments from these people. Several people of that kind all over my county have been notified this year that they must work their allotments properly.  I disagree with this method of officials saying whether land is worked properly or not.  Let me state clearly that they are not qualified to judge whether it is being worked properly or not.  The fact that an unfortunate allottee has to let his allotment in conacre, take in grazing cattle or sell meadow or crops off it is no indication that the land is being worked badly.  If it is, I should like to hear the explanation of how it is.</P>
    <P>In many cases, you take the addition, as it is commonly known in the West, away from the person, or you threaten that if the person does not work it properly it will be taken back from him.  In 99 out of 100 cases, the original holding on which the person resides is vested in him.  When the Land Commission inspector says: &ldquo;You are not to let the addition in conacre; you are not to let the grazing of it; you are not to take in the grazing stock; and you are not to sell the crops,&rdquo; these people at once transfer their activities to the addition.  In order to relieve financial pressure, they let the holding which is vested in them, over which the Land Commiscatio <Col N="2179" /> sion have no authority, thereby exploding the whole purpose of the Act.</P>
    <P>The Act is wrong, in any case.  It is an absolute waste of time and public money to send inspectors to see if people are working their allotments. If the person is not a good farmer it is only a matter of time until he will have to sell it through his negligence or misfortune. Some person who had gone to England or America or acquired money at home will buy the holding. It is ridiculous to take the addition away from the holding and expect people to buy the original holding which needed an addition to it.  Such people will immediately look for an addition of land because the holding is uneconomic without the addition.  I want to emphasise that it is the holding should get the addition and not the owner of the land.  The addition should go with the holding.  I am equally emphatic that no sub-division of a holding under a certain size should be allowed.  Otherwise we will be reverting back to the conditions that existed under the landlord system, whereby holdings were sub-divided and sub-divided until they became a lot of strips like a patchwork counterpane.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach recently, in Navan, stated that 25 acres of land was sufficient for a holding.  That may be Fianna Fáil policy, but it is the first time I have heard it announced by any Minister or by the Taoiseach that 25 acres is sufficient.  Would the Taoiseach or the Minister or any Fianna Fáil Deputy say that he can live on 25 acres with the present cost of living and the present income from such a holding?  A man would require 35 statute acres of arable land at the very least, plus some other land.  I know it is not possible, particularly in the case of estates that are going through the process of being subdivided by the Land Commission, to give a holding of 35 statute acres of arable land in all cases.  There will be bad land on every estate and some of the bad land must go with the good.  I hold that a man wants 20 Irish acres or 35 statute acres to make a decent holding at the present time.  Firstly, the £10 valuation, which is taken as a basis, is too low.  Secondly, it is misleading because, as I have <Col N="2180" /> stated before, it is quite clear that when the valuation of this country was being made by Sir Richard Griffiths almost 100 years ago the land was not valued evenly.  A given acreage of land capable of giving a certain yield of crops, in one district is valued much higher than similar land in another district.  We know that the valuers at that time were tampered with by the landlords for their own purposes.  At a commission of inquiry on this subject, several of these valuers admitted that they were tampered with and influenced to increase the valuation on certain estates, so that the owner would be qualified for membership of the grand jury or other benefits like that.  Valuation is not a proper or fair basis to take in the matter of allotting holdings. I know land comprising half a parish which was valued at about £1 2s. per statute acre.  The same quality of land, or even better land, in my locality is valued at about 11/- or 12/- per statute acre.  Twenty-five acres of land might mean anything.  When he said that 25 acres made a good holding, did the Taoiseach mean 25 acres in Connemara or 25 acres east of the Shannon?</P>
    <P>I say that a man wants 35 acres of good land.  If there is waste land which must be attached to the holding, it should be brought up to about 40 acres at the very least.  Anything less than 35 statute acres of arable land is inadequate.  It is only creating a further problem for some Government in the future.  Arising out of land agitation in my county, Deputies on both sides of the House have tried both in the House and outside of it to make political capital by stating that this Party are opposed to free sale and fixity of tenure.  I should like to make the position clear, and I think this is a suitable opportunity to do so.  I want to make it perfectly clear that, not alone are we not opposed to free sale and fixity of tenure, but that it would not be good for any person or Party or Government to propose to interfere in the slightest with either free sale or fixity of tenure.  There was too high a price paid for both of these things by our forefathers to yield them up easily.  Any Party or anybody who propose to interfere with either of them will meet with a very warm reception <Col N="2181" /> from the small farmer, the medium farmer, or the big farmer.  I want everybody to understand that clearly.</P>
    <P>There was land agitation in Mayo and there will be until the Land Commission do their work.  That land agitation amounts to nothing more than that we want the legislation already passed by this House, but which has been left gathering dust in the pigeon holes, to be put into operation. The people want that.  When the Party of which the Minister is a member was trying to get into power one of the main points in their programme was the settlement of the land question.</P>
    <P>In my county there are 23,400 land-holders under £10 valuation, the class of people to whom Deputy Corry referred to as &ldquo;hen-roosters&rdquo;&mdash;a striking and a nice comment from a member of a Government that secured a majority in every one of the five countries of Cannaught as well as in Kerry, Clare, Donegal and other congested areas on that very subject.  &ldquo;Hen-roosters&rdquo;! It is well to know the Fianna Fáil outlook. When two members of my Party tried to get the Land Commission to do their duty&mdash;and let it be clearly understood they tried to do this before there was a question of that land being put up for sale&mdash;the Government reply was to stuff them into gaol for a month, a thing that has not taken place in the case of any member of this House, for what I might call legitimate action, ever since the formation of the House.</P>
    <P>It is just as well to go over the details of that case.  A farm known as Cottage Farm was put up for sale on the 16th October last.  In June, July and September, before it was ever mooted that the land was being put up for sale a solicitor on behalf of the surrounding tenants, together with Deputies Cafferky and Commons, requested the Land Commission to take action.  All the action they took was to write saying that the matter was receiving attention.  The farm was put up for sale.  There were protests against the Land Commission not doing their duty&mdash;not against the sale of the land or against the right of free sale.  The net result was that two <Col N="2182" /> Deputies were stuffed into gaol for a month.</P>
    <P>That land has since been sold.  The Land Commission know as well as I do that the moment a farm passes from a person who is not working it into the hands particularly of a married man who knows how to work it, the difficulty of acquiring that land is increased a hundredfold.  They refused to take action and some time later they wrote to the solicitor saying that owing to action that had been taken they refused to proceed any further with the matter.  What kind of policy is that?</P>
    <P>We have several Land Acts on the Statute Book of this House, and what are they there for if we do not put them into operation?  The Minister goes through the sham of walking in here every year and asking for money to deal with the biggest problem in the State.  National drainage or other problems would not take half or quarter or one-tenth of the money that the land question would take if it were to be properly solved.</P>
    <P>Are we to leave 23,400 people in Mayo, not to speak of people in other parts of the country, to eke out an existence on holdings with such low valuations?  They are to live there, get married and rear their children for export. Is that the Government policy? So far as I can see, that is it.  The population of County Mayo dropped, between 1936 and 1946, from 161,000 odd to 148,000&mdash;13,000 less in one county in ten years.  Perhaps there is method in Fianna Fáil madness.  If another 13,000 leave the county in the next ten years the land question there will settle itself.  There will be plenty of land for everybody.  Weed out the people and the land question will settle itself.  Land will go a-begging, because there will be nobody to take it.</P>
    <P>Is that the road we are treading? Are these the fine ideals that the men in 1916 and in later years went out and fought for?  Is that the freedom for which we struggled?  Is the export of human beings to go on because no attempt will be made to solve the land problem?  Instead of asking £1,140,000 it would be far better business <Col N="2183" /> if the Minister asked for £7,000,000 and kept doing so for the next eight or ten years.  Then an end of the problem would be in sight.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 10 of the Report of the Irish Land Commissioners there is one very interesting sentence.  The paragraph starts off by referring to the number of holdings vested, and it continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As there is not nearly enough untenanted land available in the congested districts, the improvement or enlargement of these holdings can be affected only by the resumption of some of them and the migration of tenants from others, making the resumed and vacated lands available for the enlargement of adjacent uneconomic holdings.  The process of resale of the remaining Congested Districts' Board estates is thus very difficult and tedious and delay in the rearrangement of `rundale' holdings is frequently caused by the unwillingness of tenants to accept the Land Commission's proposals for `striping' the scattered plots into composite holdings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that a new departure in policy&mdash;that improvement or enlargement of holdings can be effected only by the resumption of some of them and the migration of tenants from others?</P>
    <P>Two years ago I asked the Minister for Lands would he consider the acquisition in certain villages of holdings which had become derelict.  When I was a schoolboy I knew villages containing 11 or 12 families and to-day there are only four or five families there.  Their holdings are held by somebody in the locality and their houses are tumbled down.  I admit it is not a very easy problem to solve. There will be rights claimed and a thousand and one other difficulties placed in the way of the Land Commission. I asked that question in the Dáil and the Minister refused point blank to resume holdings that had reverted or that had fallen to the ownership of people no longer resident here, people who emigrated to England or the United States and who did not intend to come back to resume the five or ten-acre holding.  It would not <Col N="2184" /> mean a hardship to anybody to resume those holdings.  The owners are away and they will scarcely come back.  The acquisition of these holdings will not entail any hardship.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply was a very funny one.  He said he would not do anything of the kind, and he seemed to be afraid of doing so because, as he stated, &ldquo;Deputy Dillon would refer to that as grabbing&rdquo;.  That would be just about two years ago and I remember the words distinctly.  There is no need for me to refer to the debate; the Minister could look it up if he wishes.  But what did he mean by that?  If you are to settle the land question you must take land from somebody; you cannot simply reclaim hundreds of acres in the Atlantic and plant people there.  If holdings are left by childless or old people who have no descendants and no relatives living nearer than England or America, I do not see what is wrong in acquiring them.  If there is any reasonable explanation to the contrary I will be quite satisfied.</P>
    <P>We must acquire land from somebody, or else we might as well abolish the Land Commission and let the Minister resign.  The duty of the Land Commission is to make every uneconomic holding economic.  We have people living on three or four acres with a valuation of £2 or £3.  We have one Government Department paying them the dole and another Government Department looking after social welfare, while the Department of Industry and Commerce fails to provide them with suitable or gainful employment. Is that not the cause of the whole trouble?</P>

      <P>Deputy Fagan has raised a very interesting point but he has not cleared my mind on the subject. If there is a derelict holding of seven or eight acres or more, the owner <Col N="2185" /> of which has been in the United States for many years, what is the difference between acquiring that land and acquiring a farm of 100, 500 or 1,000 acres, the owner of which is actually living on the land?  We must acquire land from somebody and there is plenty of legislation passed by this House to settle the question.  The whole trouble is that the Minister for Lands does not demand each year a sum adequate to deal with the question.</P>
      <P>It strikes me very forcibly that the Minister for Lands is not as forceful in making his demands as the Minister for Lands each year at the appropriate time, as the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Industry and Commerce in putting forward demands for their Departments.  I wonder is the failure to deal with this question with sufficient speed due to that inactivity of the Minister for Lands?  I wonder is he taking his office in a too lack-adaisical fashion, in not demanding sufficient money for his Department? At the present rate of progress, the Land Commission would not have the land question settled for the next 120 years.  That is a very glaring state of affairs for a responsible Government Department.  They seem to be in the position of a person with his hands tied behind his back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised a question here to-day about an estate in the Newport area.  I decided at that time not to give the facts, but I think it better now to give a full statement to the Minister of what exactly has happened because many people in this country are very hazy about the land question and the trouble in the congested areas.  There are 28 holdings on the Stanuell estate in the Newport area.  All of them are in rundale, split up into patches of about four yards wide by 25 yards long. One tenant with a valuation of £3 has his holding split up into 35 such patches without any fence between them.  Others are split up to nine or ten patches without any fence.  The housing is of the most primitive kind. The houses were crected in 1847 at the time of the great evictions.  There were wholesale evictions in that area prior to the famine and the houses subsequently built were hastily erected.  Not-withstanding that, the fact that the <Col N="2186" /> Congested Districts Board was set up specially to deal with such areas, and that the Land Commission has been in existence since 1923, the people in these areas are living in the same conditions as in the days of their great grand-fathers. The Minister's reply to my question to-day was that a major question of drainage was involved, and by that excuse he sought to shift the blame for the continuance of these conditions over to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance who is in charge of the Board of Works.  I shall not accept an excuse of that kind. The Government has at its disposal machinery for dealing with all these problems, and if they are unable to solve it, some other Government will do so.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might quote further from a letter which I have received from a man named William Chambers, who has had considerable correspondence with the Minister's Department in reference to conditions in this area. He, of course, got the usual replies, that the matter was receiving attention. In this letter he states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Most of these houses were erected hastily in 1846 and 1847 after the great evictions.  In eight of these houses, several people have died with tuberculosis&mdash;as many as four in each of a few houses.  I pointed this out to the Land Commission without avail.  Most of the tillage land is submerged at times by flooding, owing to the old river not having been cleaned for years and to its being overgrown with weeds and trees.  Some tenants have lost their entire potato crop, not even being able to save seed for the spring.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The fact remains that there are about 30 cottages on this estate, which were hastily erected 100 years ago.  They are thatched cottages, pitched together in a rough-and-tumble way, five or six houses in close proximity.  The people are living under most unsatisfactory conditions, and surely the Land Commission should not turn a deaf ear to their grievances.</P>
    <P>There is also the case of the Peyton Estate, outside Castlebar, which I have raised every year on this Vote and many times during the year by way of <Col N="2187" /> question, where the holdings are also held on the rundale system.  On one occasion the Minister told me that offers were made to migrate tenants from this estate to holdings in other counties and that some of the tenants accepted while others refused, but I think that if any reasonable effort were made to deal with that estate the grievances of the tenants would have been settled long ago.  I have also drawn the Minister's attention on several occasions to the condition of the tenants in Tooreen, a district a few miles from Ballinrobe, where a large number of tenants are huddled together, also on the rundale system. The houses are crowded in the most congested and unhealthy way.  Again, in the Louisburg and Westport areas, there are 41 tenants living on mountain land on the O'Dowd and O'Moore Estates, the highest valuation being £3.  The whole problem resolves itself into a question of whether the Minister is going to tackle the land question seriously.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1,400,000 is a miserable sum to provide for this purpose.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Defence would not be satisfied with a miserable provision of that sort.  The Minister for Defence is asking for £5,000,000 for an Army, when every person in the country knows that an Army costing no more than £2,000,000 or £2,500,000 would be quite adequate to meet our needs now that the emergency has passed.</P>
    <P>The Government seems to be determined to squander money in every direction except in the right direction, and if any Deputy attempts to raise his voice he is shouted down by the Fianna Fáil Party.  They have taken even the stronger action of ramming Deputies into jail when they think that is necessary.  How long is that going to go on?  From a summary of the Department's activities, so far as I can see, they have purchased approximately 10,000 acres, they have allotted 14,000 and they have vested 10,000 holdings while they have taken over 282 acres under the 1946 Act.  I think the Minister should seriously consider a complete overhaul in the Department.  He should also consider <Col N="2188" /> consolidating all the Land Acts into one piece of legislation.  Having to go back to Land Acts of 1881, and those of subsequent years, is only confusing the Land Commission and the public generally.  I do not believe there is a legal man in the State at the present day who is a complete master of land law, and I would consider any Deputy in this House very presumptuous if he said that he was master of the various Land Acts as they stand at present.  All these outstanding questions must be tackled by the Minister, and if the present Government will not deal with them some other Government will be elected which will.  We have had 25 years of self-government and during that period we have gone a long way to prove the old cry of the British that the Irish people were not fit to govern themselves.  We definitely have not made much progress in the direction of solving the land question.  Roughly 121 new houses have been built.  Five migrants were migrated out of Mayo last year out of 23,400.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the matter which was referred to already by Deputy Hughes&mdash;the matter of lands held by the Land Commission, the length of time they hold them before sub-dividing them and the manner in which the Land Commission by their carelessness are allowing these lands to get into a state in which they are practically useless to those who will get them when the Land Commission have finished with them.  One farm beside me which was sub-divided during the past year was purchased from the original owner in 1920.  It was allotted in 1946 after 26 years in the ownership of the Land Commission.  When it was taken over from the original owner, it was clean.  There was not a quarter-rood of waste or scrub on it, but, when the Land Commission came to allot it, the first thing they had to do was to put men in to cut a pathway through the blackthorn and hazel which had practically overrun the farm.  A precious lot of use that land is to the allottees!</P>
    <P>In other cases, they give land out in conacre for tillage&mdash;the general tillage rotation is grain, roots and grain again, with grass seed&mdash;without insisting that <Col N="2189" /> farmyard manure be put on the land, with the result that three tillage crops are taken off the land in nearly all cases, to my knowledge.  Two or three years after, that land is given to allottees and it is little better than a piece of the Sahara Desert.  It has been robbed of all its fertility and requires ten or 15 years to regain its fertility again.  If the Land Commission decide to take the land from them, they come to the conclusion that they are not working it right, when possession of such a piece of land is a drag on the allottee because it means robbing the home holding to enrich it. The Minister should see to it that lands held by the Land Commission are divided at once.  There is no authority in law, in my opinion, for the Land Commission acquiring a farm and holding it for 26 years before subdividing it.  Our forefathers had very little business running the landlords out of the country if it was merely for the sake of handing the land over to one landlord, the Minister, as is the position at present.</P>
    <P>In some townlands or villages, when the Land Commission go in to settle the land question, they seem to antagonise the people in some way.  I have received numerous complaints to that effect, and the net result is that the majority of the people in these areas will not agree to the Land Commission proposals for finishing off the land question.  I have many complaints from one particular village.  There are 22 families living there and the total valuation is about £98.  There were formerly over 40 living there, but some have died and their lands have become derelict, and others have been migrated, and now these 22 people are asked to agree to a final settlement on the basis of the division of £98 worth of land between them, less than £5 valuation each.  What I suggest should be done is that, no matter what the cost, a sufficient number of people should be migrated out of these villages, so that, in these mountainous districts, a valuation of at least £10 will be given to those left behind, with decent houses, decent roads and proper sanitary accommodation in the houses. They are entitled to that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2190" /> I could name townland after townland, particularly in the western part of the county, where 20 families and over are living, some of them with half an acre of land which is alleged to be arable by inspectors of the Department of Agriculture for tillage purposes. It is no more than ground on the surface of a bog which has been brought into some degree of kindness by successive generations of labour and drainage.  Something must be done about all this question, and, if this Government is not prepared to do it, some other Government must do it. Absolutely no attempt is being made to handle it or to face up to the responsibilities in the matter.</P>
    <P>There is a vast amount of land in Mayo suitable for acquisition if the officials of the Land Commission would only go the right way about acquiring it.  Vast numbers of holdings are falling derelict, and I have written thousands of letter to the Minister asking for the acquisition of holdings in respect of which people are quite willing to sign an agreement to the effect that, although the acquisition of these lands will not bring them up to a £10 valuation, they will not make further demands on the Land Commission in the matter of land settlement.</P>
    <P>In one case, a single man died whose nearest relatives were second cousins living in the United States.  That holding, if acquired and sub-divided amongst three neighbours, would bring each of them up to about £10 valuation, but the relatives in the United States, without coming home, put the land up for sale.  It passed into the hands of a man who is working it well, and perhaps better than the previous owner worked it, but nevertheless, I hold that the Land Commission should purchase such land under the auctioneer's hammer, if necessary, and divide it when there is no other land available in the immediate locality.</P>
    <P>I do not see why the Land Commission could not go into the open market and purchase land in certain instances, if they want it.  The Minister may say that there would be bogus bidders at such a sale.  There may be, but even the private purchaser has to face that possibility.  The Minister may say, further, that he has no precedent for <Col N="2191" /> such an action, but I say he has. Officials of the Department of Agriculture attend pedigree stock sales all over the country and purchase under the auctioneer's hammer against the private buyer.  They buy all the premium bulls they want against the private buyer at Ballsbridge, Carrick-on-Shannon, Cork, Limerick and Tralee, and there must be other precedents and examples in the other Government Departments.</P>
    <P>In many cases, the price paid for land by the Land Commission represents little better than confiscation, a fact which is driving people to hold land rather than offer it to the Land Commission.  If the Minister went about his job properly, he would be offered more land than he has money in this Vote to purchase.  I have asked on a few occasions that farms be acquired, the owners having requested me to approach the Land Commission with a view to getting them taken over, but the Land Commission have refused to do so even though there was no danger of the lands being left on their hands.  In such cases, although the owner was willing to hand over to the Land Commission and the people in the locality were willing to take it off the hands of the Land Commission, within a month, or within a week, if necessary, the Land Commission refused to take over the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself substantially in agreement with Deputy Blowick, particularly in his inquisitiveness as to the reason for the masterly inactivity of the Minister's Department in recent times in carrying out the oft-proclaimed policy of the Government in proceeding with land division.  The Minister should tell the House the reason for that inactivity or the alternative to that policy of land division, if the Government have abandoned such policy.  The people are entitled to be told where we are going.  If the Government have decided to abandon land division for all time, the people should be told that and they should be told the Government's alternative.  The policy adopted recently&mdash;or lack of policy&mdash;amounts to abandonment.  That has caused a <Col N="2192" /> great deal of disquiet throughout the country, and it has caused Deputies from different parts much annoyance, because nobody can tell what is going to happen.  In the pre-war years, a very considerable advance was made in the division of lands.  I do not agree with Deputy Blowick that we should have a consolidation of the land laws.  The Department has all the power it requires if it wants to continue the work at which it was engaged up to the time of the war.  For the temporary abandonment of the policy of land division at the time of the emergency, there was some justification. The dispersal of staffs in other directions and the uncertainty which prevailed would constitute justification for a halt in land division.  That time has passed and people are wondering when we are to have a reversion to the original policy.</P>
      <P>Are we to be told that it is owing to the high price of land that the policy has ended, that the Land Commission cannot afford to buy land at prevailing prices and give it to tenants because, at the price which they would have to pay, it would be uneconomic? Deputy Dillon was very hot on such subjects on the Vote for the Minister for Justice.  I am sufficiently old-fashioned to hold that we should persist in land division.  Like Deputy Blowick, I do not want land to be taken at a confiscation price.  I want a fair price to be paid for the land.  I see private individuals jumping into the market and buying every farm that offers.  Some of these people are without knowledge of husbandry or agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How are they to make it pay if, when bought by the Land Commission and divided amongst people with a good knowledge of tillage and agriculture, it could not be made pay?  In recent times, in my county, the Land Commission have been written to inquiring &ldquo;what about these lands&rdquo; and &ldquo;what about those lands&rdquo;?  But the Land Commission are not doing anything.  Deputy Blowick spoke about lands held in America.  I can quote a classic instance in my own county.  I refer to 130 acres on the Gaffney Estate, near Rathkeale.  The owner of that estate, a gentleman named <Col N="2193" /> Gaffney, has been living in America for many years.  Fifteen persons were enjoying the letting of that land.  The joker in America decided to sell the land and instructed a solicitor at Rathkeale to do so.  The Land Commission were not interested and, before the sale took place, one man came along and bought the place privately.  He was one of the 15 to whom I have referred.  He had two farms of his own and, I am told, has 60 acres outside.  These smallholders had the grazing of the hay of these lands for 17 years and never failed to till their quote during the emergency period.  The result will be that we shall be at the loss of 30 milch cows.  In recent years, the people have seen three estates going in this area and this is the last chance. If the land is not taken by the Land Commission, the people see no hope of obtaining land.  That was, obviously, a case in which the Land Commission ought to have intervened.  There was every justification for intervention. The land was suitable for division.  It was easy of access.  The public road runs through it.  Fifteen people were being accommodated on it and one of them gets it now to the exclusion of the other 14.  That should have been a matter of interest to the Land Commission. Whatever price was paid by that gentleman could easily have been paid by the Land Commission and repaid by the tenants, on division.</P>
    <P>The position is not confined to the County Limerick.  I know of cases in the Minister's own constituency.  There are similar cases in north Cork and in south Limerick, around Kilmallock, with which the Minister should be conversant. There seems to be a definitely laid down policy of &ldquo;go slow&rdquo;. The Minister should tell us whether we are to get back to land division or not. Deputy Blowick referred to the activities of the Land Commission in resuming land from people who have failed to work it according to the principles of good husbandry.  Two hundred and eighty-two acres were taken up for that reason.  That is hardly sufficient activity to justify the officials of the Land Commission.  With Deputy Blowick, I think that these officials would be much better employed <Col N="2194" /> operating on the estates in which the Land Commission were interested before the emergency.  The division of these lands and the establishment of families upon them is the best method of giving people a rooted interest in the country.  They should be given a chance of bringing up their families in decency instead of going off in the emigrant ship.  I shall not enter into a discussion of the question of the right size of holdings.  That, I should say, would depend on the soil of the different countries.  Deputy Blowick objects to holdings of 25 acres.  He may be right or he may be wrong but 25 acres in Connemara would not be equivalent to 25 acres in Limerick. The people should be given economic holdings.  The people to whom I referred were making a living on the Gaffney estate out of 130 acres.  They, probably, had a few acres of their own. With the 130 acres, these 15 people were able to keep going for 17 years. The taking of this land from them means that they are placed in a completely uneconomic position.  They are also left without hope of obtaining any land in the district.</P>
    <P>As I often mentioned when speaking on this Vote in past years, I object to some of the rules and regulations governing the carrying out of land division, particularly the rules relating to distance from the estate in question. Manifest hardships have been imposed because of the too narrow interpretation of that rule.  I know of the case of a very hard-working man in County Limerick.  He worked for three or four farmers around.  He was ruled out of an allotment of land because, by taking a tape and measuring the road, he was proved to be five-eights of a mile from the place where the land was available. He could fling a stone from the place where he lived to the land in question but, as measured by the inspector, he was five-eighths of a mile distant and was ruled out.  He never got a chance of obtaining an alternative holding because he would then be 20 or 30 miles away.  All the inspectors admitted that his was a most deserving case but he was ruled out by the regulations. Three farms or estates have gone since there but he did not get any holding. In every part of my county, land is <Col N="2195" /> waiting for division.  We have not got quarter way with the estates marked out for division and I want to know from the Minister when he intends to get back to the policy of division or if he is going to abandon it.  Something has got to be done because a number of people have to make up their minds as to where they are going.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission took steps to ensure that allottees would use their allotments according to the rules of good husbandry.  There was inspection of these holdings.  But there is no inspection when private persons come to buy land.  Drapers, grocers, watch makers and others may buy lands and the Land Commission is not interested. Surely the Land Commission have a bigger responsibility than looking after allottees.  They are responsible for dealing with the land question.  The land question has not been settled. Can they afford, under cover of the emergency, to go fast asleep and allow every estate to be bought by persons who have no interest in tillage development? The only people who are being chased and pursued are the unfortunate allottees who, as Deputy Blowick said, got holdings which, in some cases, were too small and who had no finance to work them.  Their holdings are resumed.</P>
    <P>I know of cases quite recently in which hard-working men were not able to purchase sufficient stock for their land and it was resumed from them. Why not take off the watch-dogs of the Land Commission and get on to the people who never did anything at all, but who acted as ranchers?  The hard-working men should get a fair crack of the whip and should be given some financial assistance.  The people who are employed on the estates are supposed to have the first claim to a holding. That was perfectly right and equitable, but if those men are given a reasonable holding and have no money to stock and equip it, how can they escape the penalty of being accused of not using proper methods of husbandry?  In the absence of machinery and finance, they are bound, in the first instance, after two or three years, to make lettings of that land in order to get something in to buy some <Col N="2196" /> stock.  I know that the Land Commission, in many cases to my knowledge, were not too hard on that type of case, but there were exceptions where they were very hard.  These people are not welcome any more to take work on the county roads, as the labourers do not want them and say: &ldquo;You are a farmer now, go and live on your land.&rdquo; How can such a man live, when he has no money and has lost his employment? What is he going to do?  I suggest that there should be some financial provision to enable them to stock the land.  Then they could be let start off from scratch and prove their ability, and if they were good agriculturists for their bosses, they will be good agriculturists for themselves.</P>
    <P>However, there is not much use in dealing with that until the main question is answered.  Let us hear from the Minister definitely whether he is going to get on with land division or not.  If he is, then how soon can we expect a resumption; and if he is not, what in the name of commonsense is keeping the Land Commission there at all?  It would not require a tithe of the staffs to deal with the collection branch and the punishing of people defaulting in husbandry.  The main concern of the Land Commission is land acquisition and division, and I hope the Minister will be able to tell us when he is going to get back again to that track; and if not, I hope he will tell us what he is going to do instead, and if there is nothing else, then how soon he is going to disband the Land Commission and get rid of it.</P>

      <P>From the tone of the debate in the last hour, I am afraid the Minister is going to have a busy time in the coming year.  I can understand that the Land Commission had to ease off during the emergency.  In the first place, they could not buy the land at the prices going, as if they bought at those prices they would have to give it to the tenants at rents they would not be able to pay.  Now that the emergency has passed and that prices are coming back to normal I agree that the Land Commission should take over the resumption of division and bring it to its normal conclusion. There was a time in my constituency <Col N="2197" /> when I and others shouted just like Deputies Blowick, Cafferky and Commons in the west of Ireland. I thought the division of land was the beginning and end of all the prosperity and comfort for the country, but I have had many disillusionments since then.  I found the economic problems created since have almost outdone the good the Land Commission should have done.</P>
      <P>Our country is going through an economic change which may not be very good in general.  The division of the Midlands into small uneconomic patches will have repercussions all over the west of Ireland.  The western Deputies have got very keen on land division.  More power to them.  Of course, it is the best political issue as if one is making a clamour to divide the land, the people will always be with him.  If Meath and Westmeath are divided into small patches, the western seaboard will die out and not alone will people emigrate by hundreds and thousands but they will have to fly by tens of thousands.  The small struggling farmers of the west and south of Ireland lived by the prosperity of the Midland farmers, relying on the cash that went down from Meath, Westmeath and Kildare to purchase the stock&mdash;sheep, store cattle and strong cattle, and even the calves.  We will have to think seriously whether we are going to do good or bad by land division.</P>
      <P>The first thing is to ease off on the type of land division in my county.  It has done a vast amount of harm, by dividing Meath up into small uneconomic patches of 22 to 26 acres.  I am speaking for the whole of Meath, including the migrants.  A bad job has been made of land division in County Meath, including Rathcairne and Gibbstown.  You have large families of six, seven and eight in these holdings of 22 acres.  Some of these sons and daughters are married.  In one household, you have three or four families and it is absolutely congested. I know of one case near myself, where a labourer has a cottage and in a room six feet by eight feet there are eight children with their parents, while in another room there is father, mother, son and daughter, at another end of the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2198" /> I would ask the Minister to make a review before he starts off again, as if he keeps going on the present policy, not alone will there be slums in the West but there will be slums in the Midlands, too.  At the present moment, Rathcairne colony and Gibbstown colony are definitely slums.  I am speaking for the migrants and to a man they will say what I am saying. I ask the Minister not to listen too much to the clamour in the West about shoving people to the Midlands.  I admit there is room.  There is room if we make economic patches, but there is no room for hundreds and thousands to make uneconomic slums.  That would create the same problem, since, when all the holdings would be vested there would be a complete sell-out and the strongest man would buy, and that would start the ranches over again.</P>
    <P>The national outlook should be predominant for the whole of us.  There is much good work to be done still and in my county there is a fair amount of land which could be taken over and divided.  I know it could not have been done during the war, as it would have been too costly and the rents would have been too high.  We cannot blame the Minister for that, as if the land were bought at a certain price, a rent would have to be put on accordingly.</P>
    <P>I want to see a balanced nation of thrifty, economic farmers.  In my county, there are estates of 500, 600 and 1,000 acres.  That should not be, 25 years after getting national freedom. Any man could live comfortably and be wealthy and have a good life on 300 acres.  The maximum size of a farm in any place should not be more than 300 acres.  If a man works that much as it should be worked, he can make a great living out of it.  We do not want vast estates of 1,000 acres while we have people flocking out of the country or trying to make ends meet in very miserable surroundings.</P>
    <P>Many of the big estates in the County Meath could be tailed down.  I do not want to see men who have been there for years, or their families, cleared out.  I want to see them remain in their old homesteads, but at the same time I think that 300 acres should be enough for any man.  If the <Col N="2199" /> Minister would tackle that problem an immense amount of good could be done.  As regards many estates, I did not like the way in which, in the past, the Land Commission seemed to work hand-in-hand with certain large wealthy farmers in the County Meath. Tracts of land were taken off these men, but these comprised swampy land on which there was nothing but rushes and sedge.  That was what the unfortunate in-coming tenants got.  The landowner was allowed to keep the cream for himself.  The swampy land was handed out to the unfortunate tenants at a big rent, and that is what many men have to try and live on to-day.  They are simply hewers of wood and drawers of water, trying to clean the dirt off that land.  The owners got a damn good bargain and the unfortunate tenants a very bad one.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Land Commission are speeding up the vesting of holdings.  If they would speed up the vesting of all the holdings allotted during the last ten or 15 years they could then concentrate on the work of new land division.  I hope that in the future they will be able to plan their work better than they did in the past. A lot of the land division carried out by the Department that I have seen was very badly done.  Many farms taken over were divided up in long, scraggy strips.  The result is that in many cases there is not a drop of water on perhaps four or five fields near the house, so that the unfortunate tenants have to be drawing it from one field to another all the year round. The Land Commission should see that estates are properly divided, so that a man would have a water supply on his holding, even though that might mean giving ten acres more to his neighbour. The Land Commission, however, are not able to get away from their policy of 25 statute acres for each man, so that the divisions are a sort of patch-quilt affair.  I do not believe there is a supply of water on more than 50 per cent. of these allotments.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission should also have made proper roads into estates when dividing them.  They should, first of all, have consulted the county engineer. <Col N="2200" /> I know that after five or six years these roads get into such a very bad condition that the county council, even though it is anxious to do so, cannot take them over.  It is anxious to help the unfortunate tenants, but the position is as I have stated it.  I know, of course, that the making of some roads was reasonably well done, but after four or five years they show the effects of wear and tear.  Many of them are just quagmires.  The wheels of a car will sink in them as far as the axle.  It is impossible to take a threshing set over them.  You have gates, and piers on some of them, and generally speaking they are in such a bad condition that the county council cannot take them over.  The problem created there is a colossal one, and is a matter that should be attended to.</P>
    <P>In the old days the roads that were made were crooked because the big gentry who owned them would not allow the public bodies of that time to go through their estates and make a decent road.  Some of the roads that I refer to are just a cul-de-sac.  They lead to nowhere and consequently cannot be taken over by the county council.  In the future, the Land Commission should consult the county engineer, and if the roads are properly made the county council will willingly take them over.  The present roads are too narrow and too crooked.  No proper foundations were made.  You find big junks of stones on them, and in a period of bad weather a lot of old muck comes up and renders them impassable. The Land Commission should see that a proper foundation is made when laying a new road.  If there was a good layer of rough gravel and a top layer of fine gravel the roads would last for a long time.</P>
    <P>The provision of pumps is another problem.  The Land Commission, in their unwisdom, provide a pump that serves three or four tenants.  I think that if you give a man 25 acres of land, a house and a shed that he is also entitled to have a pump in his yard. As it is, the wife or the children of some of those tenants have to carry water over a distance of a quarter of a mile.  Even as it is, the pumps provided are not in working order for <Col N="2201" /> more than six or eight months in the year.  I hope the Minister will do what I suggest and provide a pump for each tenant.  I also suggest to him that, when he brings up Westerners to the County Meath, he should give the Meath men who get parcels of land as good a chance as he gives to the others. We do not want any friction between the two.  I have always stood for the Meath man as against the Westerners, but at the same time we want to see friendship and harmony between both peoples.  I must say that very many of the migrants have proved themselves to be good tenants.  They are hard workers, they are thrifty and go ahead.  At the same time, I am satisfied that they got a far better &ldquo;do&rdquo; than the Meath men who were given land.  I know many men who were herds on estates in the County Meath and what they got was the tail-end of an estate.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission refused in some cases to put up a pair of piers or a gate for them.  The Meath men should get the same facilities as the migrants.  That is a thing which has been a cause of contention between the local people and the migrants.  It has soured a good many local farmers when they saw that their neighbours were not getting as good treatment as the migrants.  I am not saying that the treatment the local people are getting now is as bad as it was ten years ago. At the same time, there is room for improvement.</P>
    <P>There is another point in connection with some of those farms in the County Meath.  New houses that were built on them eight or ten years ago have not yet been allotted to anybody.  The grass is growing around the doors, and even the doors themselves are getting rotten.  The houses are in bad condition because there has never been a fire in one of them.  When a question is asked about them we are told that migrants are coming up.  I wonder where the migrants are coming from? Is it the intention to bring people from America?  These houses have been provided by the taxpayers and it is not fair that they should be allowed to get into such a bad state of disrepair.  The windows in some of them are broken and doors are cracked.  The land is let <Col N="2202" /> on the 11-months' system.  Crops are being taken out of the same field year after year.  It is not a crop but scutch. It is quite a waste to be putting wheat seed or seed oats into the land on these plots because it is not capable of producing a crop.  The whole thing is a shame and a disgrace.</P>
    <P>The future policy of the Land Commission should be to select the right type of tenant.  The majority of the present tenants are fairly good, but then quite a number of them are very bad.  They are so bad that one would imagine they were picked by a blind man.  Even though they are bad, I do not want to see them thrown out on the road.  I know they are a problem for the Land Commission.  They are in these holdings now, they have reared families, but I am afraid that a number of them are never going to be of any real use.</P>
    <P>It may not be their fault.  Maybe they were never any good but now they have large families and are often in bad circumstances.  Leave them there and vest their holdings as soon as you can so as to give them a chance of selling out.  They will be no use there. The Minister has power to keep certain people from buying it but he should allow small farmers to buy such holdings. There are many small farmers' sons who would buy such holdings and would give a good price for them. There should be a scheme in land division of allocating three or four farms, where an estate is being divided into 10 or 12 farms, to people who are able to put up some money.  It would be an incentive to a man with £300 or £400.  He would not be able to pay £1,500 for a small holding but might be able to put up £300.  The Land Commission could give such a person a chance by accepting £300 as part payment. I guarantee that such a person would be most successful because he would have put his whole earnings into the farm and would work it.  I ask the Minister to consider that suggestion as one worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>In County Meath and other Midland counties there is a number of Army officers and some old sergeants who have retired in the last few years. These men have been 22 and 23 years <Col N="2203" /> in the Army and have given loyal and valuable service to the nation.  They are only 50 or 45 years of age on retiring and they do not know what to do or where to go.  A good many of them have old I.R.A. and Army pensions. Most of them have young families.  The nation owes something to these men.</P>
    <P>There is a vast number of Land Commission holdings, some of them having new houses on them, that could be given to these people.  The Minister, as an old colleague of mine, would be sympathetic with such a scheme.  I know that some of them are trying to get out of the country because there is nothing here for them.  There is not the slightest hope for a man like that of being able to buy a farm.  People from across the water are buying up all the land that is worth while in County Meath.  Any estate that is for sale at the present moment does not reach the auction rooms.  It is bought underhand.  They are buying not merely one farm, but three or four farms.  I know that in County Meath vast estates have been recreated in the last two or three years by one man buying up three, four or five farms of from 100 to 300 acres and combining them as a stud farm, in some cases, or as a ranch in other cases.  I know that under the ordinary laws the Land Commission could not stop that, but I want the Land Commission to keep their eye on it and to let those people know that the Land Commission policy must be pursued to its logical conclusion, that is, the division of land in as reasonable a way as possible to put the greatest number of people to live on the land in an economic manner, and that this land will be acquired at a future date.  It would be acquired if we had a national Government in power.  It would have to be acquired. If it is not acquired, the people will not stand for it and there will be the old trouble of driving cattle and breaking gates.  We do not want that, but it will happen.  The Irish people will not stand for this.  The whole struggle for Irish freedom was to put the people back on the land and that is still in our minds.  We are proud of the fact that we took part in the struggle.  I would ask the Minister to see to it that County Meath will not <Col N="2204" /> revert into big ranches.  The Land Commission policy of dividing up ranches into small holdings&mdash;too small &mdash;must not be defeated by people from England and Europe coming in and buying up three and four big farms and combining them in a big estate. That is very wrong in a country where there is such a land problem.</P>
    <P>We hear western Deputies clamouring for the migration of the western people to the Midlands.  They are right to do it.  I suppose they have their problems.  I hope that the Land Commission have had a general review of the position and intend in the next two or three years to complete land division.  Twenty-five years of native government is far too long for the carrying out of land division.  The first four or five years of national emergency, from 1921 to 1925, may be excluded, but from 1925 to 1935 land division should have been completed. We see the way in which land division is being completed in Poland and other countries.  Hordes of strangers are going in and tearing up the land and that is the end of it.  We do not want that here but land division could have been done reasonably and decently in a national way.</P>
    <P>In future I would ask the Minister to give an economic price when he is acquiring land.  There is no use in confiscating land.  We will not stand for it.  I will be asked, how can we pay such a price for land?  The only way is to extend the period of repayment. If it is a 60-year term, make it 120 years and let posterity pay for it. Even make it a 200-year term.  Let the man from whom you are taking the land get a fair crack of the whip.  That is only reasonable.  I have been saying this for the past ten years.  We have to make the same speech every year and I regret the necessity for it. Does forestry come under this Vote?</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with it on the other Vote.  I am satisfied that land division has justified itself and has had good results.  We will want to be very careful to see that our economy is not changed overnight. <Col N="2205" /> Our economy is bound to change as you change from a system of big farms to a system of small farms.  The economy of our country is linked up with the system of the Midlands buying from the West and the South.  It was a balanced economy.  Live stock from the hills and mountains of the South and West found their way to Meath, Kildare and Westmeath and were finished there for the Dublin or the British markets.</P>
      <P>That is how the export trade was created and that is the way we want to see it.  The land of Meath is different from the land of the West.  I know it is very fertile, but it is a rotten soil for tillage, as any migrant will admit. It is a hard rugged soil that will not produce good crops.  In one year in ten you may get a good crop of oats in the heavy lands of Meath, but if the season is bad, the crops go down before they are ripe and two-thirds of the crop is lost.  You require a grazing policy in Meath.  That may be hateful to anybody who ever shouted about land division or talked of the cattle for the road and the land for the people.  But I am satisfied that if our economy were properly worked out and if Meath, or those parts of Meath that cannot be tilled economically, were left as the grazing farm of Ireland, an immense amount of good would be done.  The people of Meath would be quite prepared to pay a subsidy to the farmers of Louth, Carlow and Wexford, which are traditionally tillage counties, to carry on the tillage so as to give them a chance of carrying on grazing. Grazing is the proper policy for land of that type and it is going against nature to try to force a position which will not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could not have expected the Land Commission to carry on land division for the last five or six years but I do expect them to complete it at the earliest possible moment.  I ask the Minister to maintain a happy balance between the migrants and the Meath people.  There has been tried out in Meath what would not be tried out in any other county because it was known that the soft people are there.  The Government would not try out a migration policy in Cork.  If they had, I know who would lead the van&mdash;the Minister <Col N="2206" /> himself&mdash;to see that justice was done to his own Cork people first.  I want to see justice done equally between us all.</P>
    <P>Let the Minister take the first trip he can to Meath, visit the Rathcairne colony and the Gibbstown colony, and ask the migrants are they satisfied with the allocation of land that they have received.  I know what the answer will be&mdash;&ldquo;Indeed we are not and is there no hope of another ranch near us being divided in order to give us free grazing?&rdquo; That is the first thing he would be told.  I would ask the Minister to come down with me to the County Meath and see for himself, although if he sits in the same car with me he may get a hot reception because some of them do not take very well to me because I generally speak out the truth without any veneer.  What I do like about the migration scheme is that the Minister drew the migrants mostly from Clare and Kerry.  The Minister did not get some of the stronger farmers from Mayo.  The men from Mayo, Kerry, Clare came up to fairly big holdings&mdash;45 statute acres, good two storey houses, and a shed with a loft in it.  It is the best work of the Land Commission.  I hope we will have more of it.  If we are going to have migrants from Mayo and Clare let us bring up fairly strong men.  Then we will not have slums.  We will be doing good work and work which will bring a blessing on the nation.  There is no sense in bringing men with six, seven or eight of a family straggling after them and planting them on a few statute acres of land.  At first everything is grand&mdash;a lovely painted house, smoke coming out of the chimney, a bag of flour in the corner.  They sometimes find three or four gangers and workmen making a path for them.  They come with happy faces, blessing de Valera and the Minister for Lands, saying: &ldquo;Isn't it grand that we are being brought from the slums in the West to full and plenty in Meath.&rdquo;  But when they are there for two or three years they find things are the reverse.</P>
    <P>In the west of Ireland they had eight or ten acres of land for which they paid about £1 a year; they had grazing on a mountain for a few Kerry cattle which cost nothing&mdash;a few <Col N="2207" /> pounds a year paid for it all.  In Meath, the rent collector takes £12 a half-year.  The Land Commission send an annuity paper.  They have to pay £35-£40 annuity every year.  It opens their eyes.  Then there are generally a few curses instead of blessings on de Valera because things are not what they thought they would be.  The Land Commission inspector told them that all they would have to do would be to stand at the hall-door and watch the grass grow.  I know a man, and the Land Commission inspector told him that if he threw out a fork at the hall-door 300 yards away and came out the next morning he would not see that fork.  That unfortunate man got a bad farm, and I know that if he threw out the fork at the hall-door and was looking for six months he would see it there because the grass never grew.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister has his hands full.  There will be no smile on his face by the time he has done with the matter.  He is doing good work if he carries on with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to this debate, everyone will agree that the Minister certainly has his hands full. Everyone will agree that the Minister's soul is being tested at the waters of contradiction because in this debate on Lands year after year we have a number of contradictory statements and contradictory suggestions, even made, in many cases, by the one speaker.  On one matter at least to-day most speakers were agreed, and that is that the Land Commission should define now and for all time what their future policy is in regard to land division.  The Land Commission have had six or seven years in which to sit down and think over this whole problem.  They have had six or seven years in which to review the results of the past 20 or 30 years of land division in this country and they ought now to be able to come to some definite conclusion as to whether the lines upon which they are proceeding at present are right or wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the lines on which they are proceeding are right then they should have no hesitation in going forward, but if <Col N="2208" /> they have been proceeding on wrong lines they should have no hesitation whatever now, regardless of what vested interests may have been established or on whose corns they may walk, in reversing their policy.  I was very pleased to hear Deputy Blowick say to-night that he stands for security of tenure for farmers.  The land question was fought out bitterly 50 years ago, and it was settled on the basis of the farmer being made the absolute owner of his farm.  That was the foundation upon which landlordism was abolished and peace restored in agricultural Ireland.  It is absolutely essential that that security of tenure is preserved and whatever activities the Land Commission so overtake they must not, under any circumstances, weaken the farmer's sense of security in his holding.  If the farmer is placed in a position by the activity of the Land Commission that he cannot look forward to possessing his farm for his lifetime and passing it on to his family then all progress in agriculture will come to an end.  There will be no incentive to the farmer to improve his fences, to improve field drainage, or to improve the fertility of his soil.  The farmer will simply become a bird of passage.  He will become just as a civil servant&mdash;an official of the State.</P>
    <P>We must make up our minds if we are going to preserve the system which was established 50 years ago, the system which was known as &ldquo;peasant proprietorship&rdquo;, that is, ownership of the land by the people who were working on it and occupying it.  If we are going to preserve that system we have got to be very careful as to the lines on which the Land Commission is to proceed.  Deputy Blowick referred to the fact that 74 per cent. of the holdings of this country comprise something about 3,000,000 acres, whereas the remaining 26 per cent. of the holdings occupy 9,000,000 acres.  He pointed out that disparity in the size of agricultural holdings as a reason for a very drastic and far-reaching scheme of land settlement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to compare the size of our holdings with the <Col N="2209" /> size of holdings in other progressive agricultural countries.  We have frequently had Denmark cited to us as a country where land is very intensively worked, much more intensively worked than here.  We have it on absolutely reliable authority that the output of the land in Denmark is 50 per cent. higher than the output of the land in this country, and I think that is a moderate estimate.  On comparing the size of holdings here with the size of holdings in Denmark, I find that there is very little difference between them.  You have practically the same percentage of small holdings, the same percentage of medium-sized holdings, and the same percentage of large holdings. It seems to me that variety is good in every walk of life and variety seems to have worked fairly well in Denmark.  Small farmers have worked their farms very intensively and, apparently, the larger farmers also have worked their farms intensively. Therefore, the problem of increasing agricultural output does not appear to be capable of solution by the mere redistribution of land.</P>
      <P>I know that there is a big political driving force behind the agitation for the redistribution of land.  There are more voters with small holdings than with big holdings and any wide-awake Deputy or would-be Deputy would naturally be inclined to play up to the largest number of voters.  We know that the Fianna Fáil Party, particularly in the early stages of their growth, concentrated upon this agitation for land division.  They took a very simple line of approach.  They divided the people of this country into ranchers and working farmers.  Everybody who joined the Fianna Fáil organisation, whether he was a large farmer or a small farmer, was classified as a working farmer, and every farmer who did not join the Fianna Fáil organisation was branded as a rancher even though he might have only ten or 20 acres of land.  These were good political tactics, but bad national policy and bad land policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very easy to stir up the fires of greed and covetousness amongst smallholders. It is very easy to say to Paddy Murphy: &ldquo;You have only 15 acres while Mr. P.J. Murphy down <Col N="2210" /> the road has 90 acres.&rdquo;  That is good political propaganda.  But you might as well say: &ldquo;Why should Mr. James Murphy have a big grocery and provision store with a turn-over of £30,000 a year when poor Jimmy Murphy has only a little huckster's shop with a turn-over of a few hundred a year?&rdquo; In following that line of argument you are appealing to a very natural instinct in people with small means.  It is easy to buy political support and to win votes by offering your supporters slices of your opponent's land.  That was the policy pursued by Fianna Fáil for many years and that is the policy which, I think, the Minister is trying to damp down.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister for Lands did approach representatives of the Clann na Talmhan Party in the West and asked them to ease off with this agitation for land division, that it would only make trouble.  But he and his Party had a right to think of that when they were sowing their wild oats in Connaught.  It is a fine thing to sow wild oats, but they have the unfortunate habit of growing and producing another crop of oats much wilder still. I am afraid that the troubles which the Minister is experiencing, particularly in the West, are a direct result of the policy which he and his colleagues inaugurated for purely Party advantage. I know that even in the Leinster counties branches of Fianna Fáil were established solely on the promise that every active member of an established branch would get a division of land. That is a policy which must be brought to an end and which must not be reinaugurated by some other Party following in the footsteps of Fianna Fáil. There is no use in getting rid of the Fianna Fáil Party, with all their corruption, if they are to be replaced by a Party which follows exactly the same tactics.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Minister and to the Land Commission that the question of Party advantage must be left completely out of land division.  The Minister said on one historic occasion that, other things being equal, a supporter of the Government Party would get a farm in preference to a supporter of any other Party.  That was a clear indication of the Minister's mind on the <Col N="2211" /> matter.  I think that on that particular matter the Minister was much more honest than many of his colleagues and many of the members of his Party and I give him credit for that; but it is bad policy, bad for the Land Commission, bad for the land and bad for the future of agriculture.  The Minister is entitled to ask along what lines we suggest the land settlement policy should continue in the future.  First of all, I believe that compulsion must be withdrawn. Compulsory acquisition and resumption of land has been tried out over a long period and has failed.  I believe that the Land Commission would get more land than they are able to handle by voluntary acquisition, by going into the open market and buying the land just as the speculators do to whom Deputy Giles referred.  I know one farmer with a large out-farm which he finds he is unable to work efficiently and productively and he has been offering it to the Land Commission for the last seven or eight years, and although there are a number of smallholders in the district who would benefit by its division, the Land Commission have not moved in the matter yet.</P>
    <P>If the Land Commission had their representative at every sale where a farm suitable for division is put on the market, they would get plenty of land in every county and they would get it at a reasonable price, unless during very abnormal times.  The value of land rises and falls and, if acquisition is to be purely voluntary, if the Land Commission are to buy in the open market, I suppose the position will be that when the value of land is low, they will buy more than when it is high.  That is as it should be.  There is nothing wrong with that.  But, generally speaking, no farmer will invite the Land Commission to acquire his holding because he knows when the Land Commission come in they will take years to reach finality.  Inspectors will come to inspect the holding and others will inspect the potential applicants and the farmer will be sick and weary before any definite move is made.  In addition, if the farmer does not agree to the price the Land Commission offer, they can acquire his holding compulsorily.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2212" /> Abandon your compulsory powers and the farmer will meet you.  Abandon compulsory powers and act promptly when land is offered to you and the farmer will meet you.  You will get all the land you can deal with in an efficient manner.  That is the alternative to making the land a source of violent agitation, and making it a pawn in political Party conflict. As long as the Land Commission have these compulsory powers, it is open to any politician, no matter to what Party he belongs, to say: &ldquo;I will get the land taken off Mr. So-and-so and given to you if you support me.&rdquo;  That has been done in every constituency and it will continue as long as the Land Commission have these compulsory powers.</P>
    <P>Abandon those powers and you will get back to something more normal in the relationship between one farmer and another and between the farmers and the Land Commission.  In addition to getting more complete holdings offered to them by farmers when they proceed to acquire them in a voluntary way, I believe many large farmers in years to come will be prepared to offer portion of their farms to the Land Commission.  Farming will be a more difficult occupation in the future. Labour will be more difficult to obtain and will certainly be more expensive and many large farmers will find that they cannot manage.  They have not, perhaps, family help of their own or perhaps the health to look after a very large farm themselves, and they will ask the Land Commission to buy a portion of their holding and in that way a great deal of land will be made available to the Land Commission to assist smallholders and, in some cases, landless men.</P>
    <P>The question is sometimes asked as to what extent the Land Commission should assist, out of public funds, new holders coming in on land.  Deputy Dillon raised that matter on another Estimate.  He said that the Land Commission, having purchased land, sell it at half the purchase price to incoming tenants.  I do not think that is true, because, in reply to a question that I put with regard to one holding, I found that it was purchased for £3,553 and sold to the incoming tenants for £3,308. <Col N="2213" /> I am puzzled to know whether, after being sold to the incoming tenants at £3,308, the purchase price was reduced by 50 per cent. as in the case of other annuitants.  I would like the Minister to indicate the position in that connection.</P>
    <P>I hold that the policy of the Land Commission should be to act as an honest broker between the man who has land to sell and the man who wants to buy land but who, without the aid of the Land Commission, would be unable to do so.  For example, there are a number of uneconomic holders in an area.  A large farm is put up for sale.  The uneconomic holders would be unable to buy it and divide it among themselves.  The Land Commission could purchase that holding and divide it, but there should be no particular advantages to the uneconomic holders unless that they would be enabled to purchase the land because, if those allottees were to be given the land at any price drastically below the purchase price, they would get an unfair advantage over a smallholder who might happen to purchase a piece of land so as to make his holding economic. There must be absolute equity as between one farmer and another, as between the man who sells and the man who buys, as between the man who gets an allocation of land and the man who purchases land out of his own resources. Absolute justice and fair play are all that are required.</P>
    <P>If, as Deputy Giles very rightly pointed out, the repayment of purchase money would be too high if spread over 60 or 68 years, there is no reason why the repayment period could not be extended so as to ensure that the smallholder coming in on the land would get it at a reasonable rent.  That is all that could be expected from the Land Commission&mdash;that they would act as honest brokers, purchase the land and sell it to the smallholder on the easy payment system.  If they followed that line, they would escape a lot of the entanglements in which they have involved themselves.</P>
    <P>They have represented to the public, and I think it is true in many cases, though not in all, that they are giving a free gift of land to allottees.  Thus <Col N="2214" /> you have fierce competition between rival applicants and a good deal of jealousy and bitter agitation.  That is a thing which ought to be eliminated from land settlement.  Land settlement should be a powerful judicial function performed in a cool, detached atmosphere, far removed from any bitter conflict or any strife.  The Land Commission in deciding between one applicant and another, in deciding whether to purchase a holding or not, should act in an absolutely judicial manner, and under no circumstances should they allow themselves to be influenced by local agitation, because if we once establish a position in which the Land Commission can be forced to acquire a holding, or forced to give it to one set of applicants through threats of violence or strife, then Land Commission operations will become absolutely impossible in this country.</P>
    <P>Once the people see that the Land Commission can be intimidated or can be driven, they will continue to drive them.  The Irish people are a fairly intelligent people in matters of that kind and if they find that a certain policy succeeds, if they find that illegal action and violence were successful in forcing the hands of the Land Commission, then you will have the country plunged into a state of agrarian strife, north, south, east and west.  It is time for the Minister who is responsible for this whole policy to sit down and weigh the situation carefully. There is no use in ploughing the sands, in dividing and re-dividing land. There is no use in listening to people who talk about one man having a small holding and another man having a much larger holding.  If you divided all the land equally between all agricultural holders at the present time, each man would have only a very small holding and you would not have settled the question then because, in the course of 20 or 30 years, some men would sell their holdings and other landholders would buy them up and inequality as between one holding and another would reassert itself.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in this House on a previous occasion a case in my constituency where an agricultural holding or rather I should say an estate because it was held by a landlord, was <Col N="2215" /> acquired by the Land Commission and divided.  Three new holdings were created, houses were built, fences were erected and roads were made.  In the course of the 30 years that have since elapsed&mdash;as a matter of fact in a much shorter time&mdash;one man who was not residing in this country had purchased the three holdings and merged them into one.  The fences that were erected by the Land Commission have crumbled away and even the houses that were built by the Land Commission have fallen.  I want to know have the Land Commission considered that aspect of the question?  Have they considered that in many cases, just as in this particular case, they may be only ploughing the sands?  They may be creating new small holdings, which will last only for a few years and subsequently be merged into larger holdings.</P>
    <P>From every point of view land tenure in this and every other country is an extremely serious question.  It is a fundamental question inasmuch as any weakening of individual ownership in regard to land would mean inevitably the destruction of private ownership in this country.  If you have not the right to own a piece of land, to hold it for your lifetime, to sell it or to pass it on to your descendants or successors, then you are just a slave.  The country in which private land ownership is abolished becomes inevitably a slave country.  The ownership of house property in the towns, the ownership of shops and business houses, the ownership of private houses in our urban areas, would all eventually cease so that it is a fundamental question whether we are to preserve private ownership or abolish it.  It is a question for the solution of which the Minister and the Land Commission must take responsibility.</P>
    <P>While the actions of the Land Commission up to the present have not to any great extent weakened security of tenure in this country, notwithstanding the fact that the Land Commission have absolute power to acquire land anywhere, they have to proceed very cautiously in regard to acquisition. There is an old saying that great bodies move slowly but it is equally true that great bodies, once set in motion, can <Col N="2216" /> move very quickly and it may be that these words apply with particular force to a great body moving quickly as against a small body.  Thus, if the Land Commission allow themselves to be forced by agitation into a policy of ruthless sub-division of land with a view to making all holdings of nearly equal size, they will have set on foot a movement which no power in this country can bring to a standstill.  If all the agricultural holdings in this country were to be made of equal size, I do not know what the average-sized holding would be but it would not be a very large holding.  Whatever it would be, one of the effects of that policy would be to deprive 130,000 agricultural labourers of their means of employment.  Then, again, you would have set on foot another violent agitation by over 100,000 agricultural labourers, who, by reason of the wholesale division of land, would find themselves unable to obtain employment.  These men again would commence an agitation to obtain holdings for themselves, and, if they were sufficiently strong, there would have to be another sub-division of holdings so that the policy would go on indefinitely.</P>
    <P>That is why I say the Land Commission should proceed cautiously.  That is why it is desirable, at least, in order to safeguard the principle of security of tenure, that they should divest themselves, as far as possible, of the right to acquire land compulsorily. Having done so, they will have much greater freedom in dealing with farmers for the purchase of land, because it must be remembered that they have no one now to deal with but farmers.  The landlords were abolished years ago, and it is a question of dealing with farmers, large or small, and acquiring their holdings by agreement. It is not a question which is confined exclusively to the acquisition of very large holdings.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Blowick and other Deputies have pointed out, there are many semi-derelict, small holdings which the Land Commission could acquire, and there is now a new problem arising in many parts of the country, that is, that, owing to the deterioration of accommodation roads and laneways, the people are getting <Col N="2217" /> away from the little holding a long distance from the road.  I know there are many small holdings a long distance from roads which have been acquired by other bigger farmers, purely as outfarms, as grazing accommodation, and I think it is tragic to see these little homesteads disappear.  If there is anything of a drastic nature in regard to interference with private ownership which the Land Commission or the State should do, it is, in my opinion, the prevention of the destruction of an existing homestead.  Where a farmer who has an uneconomic holding buys a holding upon which there are a house and out-offices, he should not be allowed to let the house and out-offices fall.  It is bad from a social point of view and from a national point of view.</P>
    <P>We ought to see that we have fewer and fewer of the roofless houses and gaping walls that one sees all over the country.  That is one suggestion I would make.  Let the Land Commission deal with the people as a business firm in a business-like way; let them buy land in a business-like way and deal with the people in a business-like way and let them not spend years and years deciding whether to acquire a holding or not.  If they make up their minds to acquire a holding, let them acquire it quickly and conclude the purchase speedily, and let them not keep an unfortunate man in suspense for years after he approaches them with an offer of land.</P>
    <P>I have on a few occasions drawn the Minister's attention to the fact that, where land is divided, the accommodation roads provided are scarcely ever completely satisfactory, but there is an even greater evil, that is, that the boundary fences provided by the Land Commission are hopelessly unsatisfactory. I know that it is not so easy in every district to get people who are skilled in the erection of earth fences, but one thing which the Minister and the Land Commission should insist upon is the establishment of a proper, hedge of whitethorn on every boundary fence.  It is absolutely ridiculous to see through the country bare wall fences standing as monuments to the Land Commission's inefficiency in sub-dividing land, and they are to be seen everywhere.  The Minister tells me <Col N="2218" /> that in these cases they supply quicks. They do, but, in nine cases out of ten, they do not grow, and there must be some inefficiency there, because, if whitethorn quicks are properly sown at the proper time, they will always grow.  There may be failures, because of adverse weather, in one or two cases, but, where that happens, they should be replaced.  That is one absolutely essential consideration in the improvement of estates.</P>
    <P>There is no use in taking over an estate, sub-dividing it and leaving it in a worse condition than that in which you found it.  Inevitably, if a farm is not properly fenced, it is in a worse condition than that in which you found it, because the whole system of economic and efficient husbandry depends on proper fences for live stock.  If you cannot keep sheep and cattle from trespassing on a tillage crop, it is hopeless to sow the crop, and you are simply creating another desert because you are creating a position in which you will have a number&mdash;one or more, and perhaps a large number&mdash;of inefficient farmers.  Good fencing is essential to efficient farming.  Every old farmer recognises that, and, in the old days, hard-working, industrious farmers always sought not only to repair their earth fences but to plant on them proper hedgerows.  If the Minister is wise, he will accept the advice I have offered to him; if he is unwise, he will continue to muddle along as he and as his predecessors have been muddling for the past 30 years.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable amount of criticism of the Land Commission with regard to their lack of progress in the vesting of holdings, and I should like to ask the Minister how the progress made during the past 25 years, since the establishment of the State, compares with the progress made prior to the establishment of the State.  I am reliably informed&mdash;I have not got any statistics to help me out in the matter&mdash;that the revesting of land under the pre-1923 Land Acts was much more speedy than the revesting under that Act.  I do not know how much truth there is in that, but I should like to have a comparison of the figures of progress for the years <Col N="2219" /> prior to the establishment of the State and after.  It seems ridiculous that it should take so long to give a man a certificate of ownership of his land, and I think this certificate of ownership is a very important document.  I do not agree with Deputy Blowick that it is not important to the very small holder.  It is just as important to the man with one, two or three acres as it is to the man with 100 acres.  The farmer should have a legal document in his possession certifying that he is the undisputed owner of his property and that nobody has any right to take it from him, and that should apply whether the holding is large or small. I know that there can never be such a thing as absolute security of tenure, but at least land should only be taken from a farmer by special legislation for definite specific purposes.  We know that it has been necessary to take land for hydro-electric schemes, and occasionally by local authorities for the provision of housing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that the question I addressed to the Minister for Agriculture is of paramount importance to the consuming public.  I asked him what steps he proposed to take to provide a subsidy for butter produced by farmers so as to bring the maximum quantity of butter into the rationing pool and treat the farmers on a basis of equality with the creameries.  Anything done by the Minister to bring the maximum quantity of butter into that pool will be very much appreciated by the consuming public, particularly when it is remembered that, out of a quantity of creamery butter aggregating 543,000 cwts., last winter we provided a ration of two ounces for the public. 470,000 cwts. of butter were produced privately, no part of which was brought into the rationing pool or <Col N="2220" /> was available for rationing purposes. It all went, one way or another, to people in a position to buy outside the ration.  When we remember that that substantial quantity of butter has been ignored up to the present, we get one reason why the ration has been so low.</P>
      <P>The Minister directed my attention, in his reply, to a Press announcement. I am not impressed by the Press announcement.  That Press announcement has made for nothing but confusion. No attempt was made in that announcement to explain to the public the purpose of the scheme which was announced.  I think that the Minister was so ashamed that he wanted to keep the real purpose of the scheme hidden away.  The purpose was to bring more butter into the pool by a mean method.  The fixed price of butter is 2/8 per lb., and it is illegal for any person to offer butter for sale above that price.  The Minister is empowering the proprietors of butter factories to pay a price of 2/11 per lb. and is subsidising the butter factories in their production by 3d. per lb.</P>
      <P>Why should any difference be made between people producing butter privately and those who produce butter in the creameries?  I feel that there is neither justice nor equity in the proposal. It will create more and more black-marketing of butter and that is most undesirable.  The bulk of the people producing butter privately would be quite prepared to sell in a legitimate way if treated fairly.  That will not be done unless the Minister is prepared to change his scheme.  He is offering a subsidy of 3d. per lb. in respect of privately-produced butter processed in a factory.  That is an insult to people producing good butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subsidy to the creamery is 3¼d. per lb., plus an addition of 5d. now, making 8¼d.  The private producer is expected to pay portion of that 8¼d. to the creamery producer and, at the same time, receive himself a subsidy of only 3d.  The Minister spoke about the cost of butter-making in the creamery, as if the private producer was at no expense and as if the housewife who makes butter is not to expect any compensation for her work.  The making of butter in a dairy involves cost.  The Minister should remember that.  The <Col N="2221" /> processing of that butter in a factory is adding insult to injury.  Some of this butter is first-class.  Quite a quantity of it is superior to any creamery butter, both in my opinion and in the opinion of judges.  To suggest that that butter should be processed in a factory is nothing short of an insult to those who engage in the art of good butter-making. The Minister has adopted the best possible method of destroying the art of good butter-making and of driving butter into the black market.  The housewife who is proud of her ability to turn out first-class butter will be insulted by the suggestion that her butter should be sent down to a factory to be processed.  Did any good butter-maker ever make butter with the intention of sending it to a factory? Does the Minister think that good butter-makers are going to the trouble to produce for the purpose of selling to a processing factory which may mix up the good butter it receives with butter of the very worst quality and brand it all with the same name&mdash;&ldquo;factory butter&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I suppose some Deputies will avail of the opportunity of going out to the show of the Royal Dublin Society this week.  They will see there a big competition in butter-making, designed to encourage young girls to make themselves proficient in the art.  The competitors there have won renown in many countries.  The Minister insults those girls by telling them that, when they go back to their farms, the butter which they produce will be fit only to be sent to a factory for processing.  The Minister should adjust his ideas if his Department has come to those conclusions. I am speaking of good-quality butter.  Butter which does not come within that category might be sent to a factory.  What is to prevent the Minister appointing in the different towns in those areas where butter is privately produced agents to buy the good quality butter?  Let them buy the first-grade butter and pay a price fair and equitable to the producer&mdash;the price given to the producers of creamery butter.  I do not see why the price should be inferior.  We are paying the subsidy on butter whether creamery butter or, in the case of the new subsidy, privately produced butter, not to <Col N="2222" /> help the producer but to help the consumer. Butter cannot be economically produced at 2/8.  If the consumer considers the price of milk and compares it with the price in Northern Ireland and elsewhere, he will appreciate why a subsidy is necessary.  I suggest to the Minister that first-class butter ought not to be processed or sent to a factory but that agents should be licensed to buy it.  First quality butter that ought to command top price should be set aside and sent into consumption immediately.  The butter that is not of good quality could be processed in the factory.  The processing of first-class butter will only disimprove it, by mixing it with butter of lower grade.  It is an insult to the women and girls making that butter, and I want to protest against such treatment being meted out to them.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the consuming public, I want to say that the Minister's scheme is going to drive butter out of the pool which would be available there for the public if the thing were properly and intelligently handled. This is a very important matter, as small children have to get the vitamins which are in butter, and butter only. There ought to be responsibility on the Government, on the Minister for Agriculture and on the Minister for Health to ensure that those children are provided with the maximum quantity of butter available, so that they may get those valuable vitamins.  The Minister may think I am over-emphasising this matter.  I am particularly interested in it, as I come from a district where we have no creamery but where there is a very substantial quantity of butter produced privately.  I feel that the scheme announced by the Minister will result in very harsh and unjust treatment. I am simply demanding justice &mdash;equal treatment of the people producing this valuable commodity for the community.  I am asking no more and no less than equitable treatment for all.</P>
    <P>I have suggested to the Minister in a rough way how this could be done.  If it is going to cost more by way of subsidy to do that, I am saying to the Minister that there is a responsibility on him to do justice to all and I am asking for nothing more or less than <Col N="2223" /> justice.  I am sure that note will help the Minister when he is replying but I do not think he wants any notes.</P>

      <P>I would appeal to the Minister to review this matter and to think of what is coming next winter. We were told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he had an estimate from the Department of Agriculture which indicated an increase in creamery butter production in the coming year.  I think that is not a sound estimate.  Cows all over the country are in so emaciated a condition that the milk yields for the coming year will not be up, and there should be some anxiety on the part of the Minister and the Government to ensure that the maximum quantity will be available for legitimate distribution, to ensure that the poor man will get a fair share of whatever butter is available, as well as the man who can put his hand down in his pocket and pay any amount.  I am sure that 80 per cent. of the people producing privately, if offered a price which is fairly comparable with that paid for creamery milk or butter produced on a creamery basis, would sell in a legitimate way.  That would represent a very substantial quantity brought under control.  If the Minister is not prepared to do that, I honestly think he will drive more butter into the black market, far more than he considers, at all events, as the people who make first-class butter will resent the insult offered to them through this scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>What does it cost the farmer to get his milk to the creamery and pay cartage on it, or if he takes it himself what time does he lose in doing so?  Has he not the advantage of the buttermilk rather than the skim milk?  I suggest that I am justified in tendering to Deputy Hughes on this occasion the advice that, while he may know quite a lot about a lot of things, <Col N="2225" /> there are times when he can say too much about some things in which he is not as well versed as he would require to be to stand up here or in any other place and talk about them.</P>
      <P>This scheme was designed to try to tap the greatest quantity of the 400,000 cwts. of butter that, according to the statistics, are made in the farmers' homes.  It is nonsense to say that there is any very considerable quantity of that available, as a large amount of it must be consumed by the farmers themselves who produced it.  There is undoubtedly some quantity of it sold, as Deputy Hughes suggests.  There is a quantity of it that is made as he suggests and that is excellent butter, and it needs no further processing, as it is as good as any butter you will get anywhere.  I invite Deputy Hughes or anyone else to face the practical proposition of getting into the central pool the largest quantity of butter in order that it will be controlled and in order that we may take advantage of any surplus in excess of what manufacturers or confectioners may require and use it for the purpose of increasing the ration at a certain time of the year.  I told the House and the Deputy this morning that this was a matter to which we had given considerable attention, after discussing it with those who know as much as any member of this House about the way in which home butter is produced and offered for sale and finally disposed of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said that he did not.  I would like to tell him that we move about through the people just as he does, and that we have just as close contact as he has with the people who live and work in the manner that I have described.  We have those contacts, and if we do not know a thing ourselves then we take advantage of those contacts in order to improve our <Col N="2226" /> knowledge.  I want to assure the Deputy, and everybody else interested, that very many of those producers are very glad indeed that on this the first occasion an attempt has been made to give them conditions similar to those obtaining for those who supply milk to the creameries.  Very many farmers who produce butter at home have written and spoken to me and have expressed themselves as being very pleased indeed with this effort which has been made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I always expect sympathy from the Deputy but at times he somehow disappoints me.  I do not want to add just one further disappointment to the list that is already there.  I was anxious to secure that the farmers who produce milk and convert it into butter would find themselves in this position, that they would get for that butter a price similar to that which is obtained by those sending milk to the creameries.  That was the first purpose.  The second was that I was determined to do what I could to drag into the pool the largest possible quantity of farmers' butter, so that we would have in the pool a quantity of butter that could be used for the purpose of increasing the ration if we should find ourselves at the end of this year in a position similar to that in which we found ourselves during the year that has passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said already, this scheme has been devised in consultation with those who produce butter, who handle butter and who process butter.  The scheme may not be perfect, because, after all, if the home-produced butter could have been as easily tapped as Deputy Hughes now suggests, it is an extraordinary thing that it could not have been tapped long ago.  I do not say that it is an easy matter to tap that source of supply.  I am not sure if this scheme will prove as successful as I would wish it to be.  I think that if Deputies examine all the difficulties that are associated with laying one's hand upon that source of supply, they must see that this is only a scheme.  There is no question of an offer to those who produce butter of <Col N="2227" /> the type to which Deputy Hughes refers and to labour that point is just of no use whatever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say how many, in his opinion, are going to make first-class butter for the purpose of sending it to a factory for processing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know, and I cannot help that.  Is it seriously suggested that I could nominate somebody in Carlow, Kildare, Offaly or Laoighis and all over the Twenty-Six Counties to say to those traders: &ldquo;You go out and buy farmers' butter of superior kind,&rdquo; and is it suggested that butter, bought under these conditions and under such a scheme as that, could be rationed?  Is it suggested that, on butter bought under a scheme of the nature suggested by Deputy Hughes, a subsidy could be paid, and that the State in doing that would know where it was going?  Does not anybody with any intelligence whatever know that a scheme of that kind would be unworkable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Are not the people that the Minister is now going to use capable of buying and grading?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>They will buy and grade as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    <Col N="2228" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for themselves.  Surely, the Deputy is not suggesting to me that we could pay a subsidy through the widespread organisation that he suggests for butter graded in the fashion that he has described?  He knows, of course, that the thing is absurd, and he is not so devoid of intelligence as to think that such a scheme as that could be worked.</P>
      <P>During the period of over 20 years that I have been a member of the House there has never been a question raised on the Adjournment in all that period for which, in my opinion, there was less justification than this one.  The only reason Deputy Hughes has for raising it is due to his disappointment at the fact that I came to the home producers of butter with a scheme which has been so acceptable to them, a scheme which, for the first time, places them on the same footing as their neighbours who are sending milk to the creameries.  In addition, I have given the added assurance to the consuming public that if there is any butter there that can be used in the manner I have described, the producers of it are being offered a price that is as good as their neighbours are getting, a price that should tempt them to sell it so that it would be in the pool to be used for the purpose that I have explained.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 7th May, 1947.</P>

      <P>No general investigation of the kind to which the Deputy apparently refers has been made.  In connection, however, with the administration of some of the Government's schemes for the preservation of the language in the Irish-speaking districts or as part of the Government's general policy to extend the use of the Irish language a certain amount of information has been obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, annual inspections are carried out by the Department of Education in connection with the making, since the 1st July, 1931, of special grants to eligible teachers in districts where Irish is generally spoken as the language of the homes and where a considerable proportion of the children coming to school for the first time know Irish only or know Irish better than English, and also in connection with the grant, since the 1st July, 1934, of the bonus of £5 (originally £2) to the parents of Irish-speaking school-children in the Gaeltacht and the <Col N="2081" /> Breac-Gaeltacht in cases in which the Department is satisfied that Irish is the language of the child's home and that the child in consequence speaks Irish naturally and fluently; the number of school children in receipt of the bonus mentioned above is published in the annual reports of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that when the 1946 Census statistics relating to the Irish language are available, a general picture can be obtained of the position of the language in the country as a whole and, in particular, <Col N="2082" /> in the Gaeltacht and the Breac-Gaeltacht areas.</P>

      <P>The functions of the Minister for Local Government in relation to Irish and its use arise from the administration of the Local Offices and Employments (Gaeltacht) Orders, 1928-1947, and the Local Officers (Irish Language) Regulations, 1944.  The purpose of the Orders was to provide as far as possible for the local services in the Gaeltacht officers able to perform their duties through the medium of <Col N="2083" /> Irish, and the regulations were made to ensure that in all areas, whether in the Gaeltacht or not, preferences would be given to candidates for local offices with a knowledge of Irish.</P>
      <P>The working of these Orders has been reviewed from time to time.  The following is a statistical summary of the results at the date of the last review (July, 1945):&mdash;</P>

    <P>The extent to which local officers with a knowledge of Irish make use of the language as a vernacular depends on the use of Irish by the population amongst whom they serve.  It has not been made the subject of special investigation.</P>
    <P>So far as the Department is concerned, any communications in Irish are dealt with in Irish and certain letters and forms in use in the Gaeltacht are issued only in Irish.  Until it is found possible to raise the standard of Irish required from new entrants to the local service it is probable many local officers would not be competent to deal with official business through Irish if required to do so.</P>

      <P>I propose to take the question regarding Lóthar, Naomh Eoin, Duibhinn, An Gleann, and Bun a' Choire National Schools together.</P>
      <P>It was decided to remove these schools from the list of Fíor-Ghaeltacht schools as from the following dates:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Lóthar, Ciarraighe (10045)&mdash;1st July, 1945.</P>
      <P>Naomh Eoin, Ciarraighe (16018)&mdash;1st July, 1945.</P>
      <P>Duibhinn, Tír Chonaill (16383)&mdash;1st July, 1946.</P>
      <P>An Gleann, Ciarraighe (8147)&mdash;1st July, 1945.</P>
      <P>Bun a' Choire, Maigh Eo (16902)&mdash;1st July, 1943.</P>
      <P>This decision was based on the results of the annual investigations in connection with the award of the bonus to parents of Irish-speaking children in each school district.  These investigations in each case were carried out by the local district inspector on various dates in each school year.</P>
      <P>The circumstances in which the Department's decision in such cases is, for administrative purposes, based on the results of the investigations in connection with the bonus to parents have already been explained by me in reply to the Deputy's question of 25th February, 1947, regarding the case of Baile Ciaragáin National School, Tír Chonaill.  The investigations in the schools named in the Deputy's present questions showed that the bonus to parents had been awarded in respect of less than 50 per cent. of eligible children attending each school in the school year prior to the date of the Department's decision and that the percentage figure had generally shown a continuous decrease for some years previously.  It was on these grounds that the Department decided to remove the schools in question from the list of Fíor-Ghaeltacht schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2087" /> On the removal of a school from the list of Fíor-Ghaeltacht schools a teacher therein ceases to be eligible for the special grant by way of a percentage increase in salary allowed to teachers under Rule 121 of the Department's code and the children are no longer eligible for the special concessions allowed to children from Fíor-Ghaeltacht schools in connection with admission to the teaching profession and for various scholarships awarded by the Department to such children.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the removal of a school from the list does not involve the refusal of the bonus to parents in whose cases the conditions for the bonus as specified in Rule 121 (4) are fulfilled.  To the extent, therefore, that payment of the bonus still operates in the case of parents in these school districts, the local inspectors have each year made inquiries into the position of the language in the district. In each case, the result of their inquiry each year since the date of removal has been that the bonus to parents has been awarded in respect of less than 50 per cent. of the eligible children attending these schools.</P>
    <P>Having regard, however, to representations made in connection with the removal from the list of another school, it was recently considered desirable in cases where schools had been removed from the list solely on the evidence available from the investigations concerning the bonus to parents, that the conditions in regard to the Irish language in the school district should be specially investigated by the Department's inspectors.  These cases include the five schools referred to by the Deputy.  The inspectors' reports are not yet available.</P>
