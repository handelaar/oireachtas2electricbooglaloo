    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Under the Emergency Powers (Clean Wool) Order, 1944, which is at present in operation, it is an offence to purchase or sell wool from which tar, pitch or paint had not been removed before shearing, or to <Col N="714" /> manufacture, purchase or sell sheep dip containing colouring matter which stained or coloured wool.  These substances imparted a stain to the wool which could not be scoured out under normal processes, with the result that the value of the wool was considerably reduced.</P>
      <P>At the time the Order was being made, buyers and manufacturers of Irish wool pressed strongly for the prohibition of the use of tar, pitch and paint in the branding of sheep and the use of bloom dips.  As, however, adequate supplies of alternative branding fluids were not available it was decided that power could not reasonably be taken under the Emergency Powers Order to prohibit the use of substances which stained the wool. The position with regard to the supply of suitable branding fluids has now improved to such an extent that adequate supplies are available to meet the needs of the sheep producers. Under the Bill provision is being made for the making of an Order prohibiting the use of any specified substance in the branding of sheep.  I propose immediately the Bill becomes law to make an Order prohibiting the use of tar, pitch, paint or any other objectionable substance in the branding of sheep.  Sheep producers were consulted in the matter and have indicated that they would raise no objection on the understanding that supplies of suitable marking fluids were available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill continues in force the prohibition contained in the existing Emergency Powers Order on the manufacture, sale and purchase of bloom dips.  The Bill, therefore, is to all intents and purposes a continuation and an extension of the Emergency Powers (Clean Wool) Order, which has been in operation since March, 1944, and should result in the marketing of Irish wool in a much cleaner manner than heretofore.  I need hardly stress the fact that the necessity for marketing Irish wool in the best possible condition has become all the greater in the post-war period.  Wool is one of the few raw materials of which there is a large world surplus, and considerable difficulties are likely to be <Col N="715" /> encountered in maintaining a satisfactory market for Irish wool, either at home or abroad, unless the highest standards of cleanliness are maintained. It is understood that certain American buyers now require a warranty of freedom from tar, pitch and paint before purchasing Irish wool.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House must agree that any measure that aims at improving the quality and condition of our wool for marketing purposes should meet with the approval of the House.  Nevertheless, I feel that the Bill is a manufacturers' Bill and is drafted in the manufacturers' interests purely and simply.  The problems of sale and of the handling of wool by producers were scarcely considered at all.  One would think that responsibility should be put on all the people who handle wool, not merely on the producers.  Section 5 states that no person shall purchase or otherwise acquire or sell or dispose of any wool on which a prohibited substance is present.  Does that mean that every fleece of wool has to be opened and examined?  If a man happens inadvertently to buy this wool and the whole parcel of wool was not opened, is he liable to be prosecuted?  If that process has to be gone through in the case of every parcel of wool, it means that the producer has to pay for all that examination, and not the manufacturer.</P>
      <P>Section 4 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A person who shears sheep shall before the shearing, separate from the fleece all wool on which a prohibited substance is present.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I submit to the Parliamentary Secretary that that section should be drafted in a different way because a person who may shear wool may be an employee of the man who owns the sheep and the responsibility should not be put on the employee but on the owner.  Whether it is removed before or after shearing is immaterial, so long as the wool is not marked with objectionable matter from the manufacturers' point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="716" /> So far as bloom dips and colouring are concerned, the Minister knows that in the vast majority of cases these bloom dips are used at a certain period of the year for breeding stock, mostly to colour rams, and there is scarcely any danger that these particular fleeces will be available before the bloom dip is washed out.  Again in that particular section, I think you are interfering unduly with the normal work of the sheep farmer.  If a man takes pride in his breeding stock and he is prohibited from exercising his art in decorating a particular animal and making him look his best, I think it is carrying this provision too far.  As a practical man the Minister ought to look into this matter and consider what has been the normal practice in connection with the exhibiting of certain animals at shows where a stock owner desires to turn out his animals to the very best advantage. Again, in connection with Section 3 there is no definition of &ldquo;daggings&rdquo;. If a case comes before a judge or a justice, how is he going to decide what daggings are or where the daggings begin or where they end?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not end quickly enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly the draftsmen have been frightened off from the attempt to define the word &ldquo;daggings,&rdquo; but surely the term should be defined, otherwise the court may not know the meaning of the word &ldquo;daggings.&rdquo;  I think that most Deputies now present have some idea of what daggings mean, but if there was a full attendance of Deputies there would be quite a number who would not know what daggings are.  The Minister may say that the points I have made will not arise in ordinary practice, that the Emergency Order has been in operation and has presented no difficulty but if there is any rigid application of the Act, if purchasers of wool are forced to open every fleece that is offered for sale, then it is the producer who will have to pay for that administration of the Bill and not the people who are going to benefit by it.  While agreeing with the Minister as to the desirability of our wool being marketed in proper <Col N="717" /> order, I still say that it is the manufacturers' responsibility to ensure that the wool is clean by means of some price arrangement&mdash;by paying a good price for wool properly prepared for market and by inflicting a substantial cut on the man who markets wool to which some foreign matter is adhering.</P>
      <P>If the House feels that it is desirable to have such an enactment as this, I think it ought to be drafted in such a way as to make it easy of administration.  It is not in the interests of the sheep industry to impose a responsibility on purchasers to open every fleece that is presented for sale to ascertain whether there is foreign matter attached and whether the daggings are there or not.  If the House feels that we must put the responsibility on someone to ensure that the wool is presented in a clean condition, I do not think it ought to be put on the purchaser.  If you are going to compel the purchaser to open every fleece and examine it, then the man who is doing his job well, who is producing clean wool, will have to pay for the examination of wool that is not properly presented, because there will be a cut in the price.  I think the Minister ought to consider that aspect of the matter and put the responsibility on the producer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Any measure that will help to improve the quality of our wool, especially in view of what the Minister has said, that there is likely to be quite an appreciable amount of wool for export, is a step in the right direction.  I cannot see eye to eye on the points that are worrying Deputy Hughes, especially in regard to Section 5.  If the man who buys wool does not take the precaution of opening the fleece to satisfy himself, in a reasonable way, that its condition complies with this measure when it becomes law, well, in my opinion, that is his lookout.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>My argument was that it was the producer and not the purchaser who will ultimately have to pay for the examination.  The Deputy should bear that in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="718" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some experience of wool, and I think I am correct in saying that such an examination does take place when a man is buying wool. It did in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in any great detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>A certain amount of precaution was necessary on the part of the purchaser when buying wool. The Minister referred to colouring matter in the various dips.  Will he say whether that applies to the ordinary yellow dips such as Cooper's and Osmond's?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will see that if he reads the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I have, and it is not quite clear.  We all know that the colouring matter in yellow sheep dips is not of very much importance except that it gives the fleece a nice appearance.  I take it from what the Minister has said that the principal colouring matter will be excluded but that the yellow matter will not be excluded.  I suggest that Section 4 is wrongly drafted because as it reads I take it that it would be an offence for a person not to remove pitch or other objectionable substances before the sheep were sheared.  I do not see the necessity for that so long as the producer offers the wool to the purchaser in a condition that will comply with this measure.  Since the Clean Wool Order came into operation, the practice in the West was not to remove any brands from the sheep before shearing.  That was done prior to the rolling of the fleece.  As the Bill is drafted, if an officious guard or an authorised officer on behalf of the Minister found a man shearing his sheep without having previously removed the brands it would be an offence.  I think if the section provided that the brands were removed from the fleece after shearing it would meet the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied that, in the case of black-faced mountain sheep&mdash; the practice in their case has been to use ordinary raddle&mdash;branding with a fluid would be sufficient?  We know that mountain sheep are difficult to brand.  The wool on them does not <Col N="719" /> retain either pitch or branding with a fluid mark.  I think that in the case of these sheep the Minister should allow a certain amount of latitude.  The farmers who produce them have their own peculiar method of branding them with raddle.  The prohibited substances for branding are tar, pitch and paint. Raddle cannot be described as paint. Has the Minister any statistics available which would indicate the amount of branding that has been done by tar and to what extent it did damage in the past to the wool clip.  I take it that he had such statistics before him when preparing the Bill, and that the damage done must have been appreciable.  I, however, cannot see that very much damage could have been done by the use of pitch or tar for branding, or that it entailed any very big loss on manufacturers to remove it.  I should like to know from the Minister whether it is intended that this Bill should apply to this season's clip.  I suggest to him that it should not apply, but that the Clean Wool Order should remain in force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  This Bill is much wider in scope than the Clean Wool Order.  I suggest that the Bill should not apply to this season's clip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the last point that was raised by Deputy Blowick, I think that the essential difference between this Bill and the Clean Wool Order is that the Bill imposes a total prohibition on producers with regard to the use of certain substances for branding.  The Emergency Powers Order did not prohibit the use of tar or pitch, but compelled the producer to remove it from the fleece before it was offered for sale.  In this connection, a point arises which may require attention.  This season's lambs may have been branded already with pitch or tar.  Some farmers use pitch or tar in order to protect lambs from foxes.  If this Bill comes into immediate operation and if, during the course of the summer months, Gárdaí or authorised officers of the Minister find this year's lambs which <Col N="720" /> are branded with pitch or tar, a charge may be brought against the sheep owner.  That would be unfair and unjust.  As far as sheep are concerned, that may not apply because, if the Bill is to take immediate force, it will have been put into operation before the sheep have been sheared, and the sheep would not have been branded.  That is an important matter which occurs to me at the moment.  I have not given it very detailed consideration but I suggest that it is a matter that requires to be considered.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Bill will meet with any serious objection.  When the Order which this Bill continues was first introduced, I attended a meeting representative of Wicklow mountain farmers who used tar and pitch fairly extensively because their sheep have to range over a very wide area and must be very effectively marked.  There was, of course, the usual protest against this kind of Order but, after due consideration of all the aspects of the case, the meeting decided that they would not oppose or object to the Order inasmuch as their main concern was to secure the highest possible price for their wool and, in striving for the highest possible price, they naturally felt that they could not object to any thing that would raise the quality of their wool.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt whatever the substances such as tar and pitch do enormous damage to wool and lower its value enormously.  Their use creates tremendous difficulties in manufacture and I suppose also, to a certain extent, would lower the quality of the wool, even when it had been completely cleaned.  There is also the damage that is done by the use of these substances to the plant used in manufacturing the wool into cloth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the producers were consulted.  I should like to know if any particular organisation of producers was consulted or if there was consultation merely with individual farmer producers.  In a matter of his kind, it is desirable that some body should be recognised by the Government as representative of the producers and should be consulted whenever occasion arises to make Orders to <Col N="721" /> amend existing Orders.  The closest co-operation between those engaged in production and the Department is absolutely essential if we are to secure an improvement in the quality and quantity of output.  As I have indicated, one of the most serious matters which concern farmers is the question of price and, as this Bill, presumably, is designed to increase the price by raising the quality of the wool, I propose to refer briefly to that matter. Last year, as happened very often in the past, the price paid for wool was very low having regard to costs of production and all the circumstances, but the great grievance of the producer is that immediately after the clip had been collected from the farmer the price jumped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is now going a bit outside the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that I am, but this matter was referred to in a passing way by Deputy Hughes who pointed out that the additional cost of examining wool imposed by this Bill would be passed to the producer.  The unfortunate thing is that additional gains which come to the merchants are never passed on to the producer.  If anything should happen immediately after the wool has been purchased from the producer to increase its value, no attempt is made to pass on the increment of price to the producer and I have no doubt that if additional expense is imposed upon the merchants and dealers by reason of this Bill the producer will have to foot the entire cost.  With regard to the alternative to having the responsibility placed on the merchant, it would seem to me that it would be very difficult to fix the onus on the producer unless a system were adopted whereby every separate fleece of wool would bear some identification mark when collected by the merchants.  If that were done, it would be possible to trace each fleece to the producer.  That, of course, is done in connection with the marking of eggs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are matters more or less of detail.  They will require very careful attention and consideration before the <Col N="722" /> Committee Stage.  I would ask the Minister to allow a little time to permit the various people concerned to investigate and to discuss them.  Very often a Bill of this kind is not discussed very seriously by farmers and small merchants down the country as they do not see it until it is actually before the House.  That is why a little time should be allowed to elapse between the Second and Third Stages, to let any points that may arise on any section and that may seem capable of any improvement be considered by the producers.</P>
    <P>The Minister will get wholehearted support and co-operation from all sections in carrying the Bill into force. Everybody in the production and marketing of wool wants to see our wool placed in the highest grade possible, having regard to the breed and the climatic conditions.  We cannot produce the very fine type of wool which warmer countries can produce, but no one will deny that it is our bounden duty to see that our product is put on the market in the very best possible condition.</P>
    <P>I do not see any great difficulty in connection with the point raised by Deputy Blowick under Section 7.  I think the ordinary sheep dips which do not include in their make-up a permanent stain or colour will not be affected.  There are, or there were, certain dips in the past which had a colouring matter of more or less permanent effect, or a long-term effect, at any rate, intended to improve the selling appearance of the sheep by imparting a colour to the wool.  No one will suggest, for example, that the colouring of ordinary Cooper's Dip is of a permanent nature.  Therefore, my reading of the section is that it would not be affected.  In conclusion, I would like the Minister to look into the point I raised about this present year's lambs and their branding with tar and pitch.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing very contentious about this Bill and it will not cause any great resentment amongst wool producers.  The change in the type of brand will not make any material difference to them.  One of the things they will be inclined to ask <Col N="723" /> is whether they will get the benefit of the change-over.  In the past, some farmers all over the country, particularly the good farmers, branded their sheep for a number of years with the type of brand envisaged in this Bill, but they did not see that they got anything for that.  A person who branded them with tar or pitch got just as much per lb. for the wool.  I know that branding with tar or pitch causes great difficulty to the manufacturers. I happened to see wool that was being prepared for the foreign market and men were engaged in clipping off the tar and pitch.  The question is whether the producers are going to get any of that benefit.  Not only from the point of view of the quality of the wool should the tar and pitch be abolished, but also because in many instances there were serious accidents in the branding of sheep when tar was hung on a fire.  Sometimes the place where the tar was melted&mdash;it may be carelessness on the part of the people looking after it&mdash; took fire and the whole house went up in flames and even some of the people were injured.</P>
      <P>The whole wool position deserves attention and should be looked into. There is grave dissatisfaction year in and year out amongst the producers regarding the instability in the prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cogan was prevented from travelling that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  As far as putting the cost of the examination over on the producer is concerned, I do not think it will arise seriously, as intimated by Deputy Hughes.  My experience is that wool producers sell to the same person from year to year and when a buyer is satisfied that he is dealing with an honest person and was getting an honest product in the past, the examination in that way will be very light.  I do not believe he will go into it at all.  If there is anything wrong, he knows the person from whom he bought it and can bring it to his notice.  I think that could be got over very easily.  It is quite right to ensure that neither diseased wool nor daggings should be included.  In general, this <Col N="724" /> measure will be welcomed by the producers, but their main interest in it will be to see what benefit will accrue to them.  If it is going to benefit only the manufacturers, they will not hail it as enthusiastically as they would do otherwise.</P>
      <P>As far as the wool position is concerned, it is not entirely a matter for the Government.  The wool producers themselves could do a good deal, just as they have been doing in Deputy Cogan's constituency.  I suppose that is a question for discussion some time in the future, but I would like to see one related to the other, as I believe they are very closely connected, even though my mentioning it at the present time might be outside the scope of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to ask the House for all stages of this measure and was somewhat disappointed to hear Deputy Cogan inviting me to give some space of time between this stage and the other stages.  The reason I intended to ask for all stages was that a good deal of discussion has taken place with the interests concerned, even since I came into this office, on these proposals.  As I said in the beginning, we had secured agreements amongst the interested parties.  I had a lengthy discussion on the only point on which there seemed to be more or less strenuous opposition by dealers in wool, namely, Section 5, to which Deputy Hughes has referred.  The dealers came to see me quite recently and we talked this matter out very fully.  I heard their point of view and told them mine and I think they went away&mdash;maybe not satisfied, but satisfied that there was no other suitable approach, from our point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan referred to the legislation dealing with clean eggs.  That was the very piece of legislation which was in my mind when discussing Section 5 with the wool people.  If we did not put upon them the responsibility of seeing to it that they bought clean wool, Deputies can easily see how impossible it would be to enforce any restriction.  If a producer of wool goes to Deputy Hughes with wool and he proceeds to examine the wool fairly <Col N="725" /> carefully, and if, as a competitor of Deputy Hughes, I do not approach the thing as conscientiously as he and it becomes a matter of competition between us, since it was not an offence for either of us to buy wool treated in this way, we will both come down to the very lowest standard and the whole scheme falls through.  I discussed that point with the people concerned.  They held rather firmly the opinion to which expression has been given by Deputy Hughes, but I think I shook it well before they left me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It was suggested that making the owner responsible for the acts of his employee or employees was objectionable.  I cannot see any way out of it.  That seems to be the position in all legislation.  If the law can be broken on a sheep owner's premises or on the premises of a man in any business and if he can avoid paying the penalty merely by saying that the act was committed by an employee, enforcement of the law would then be a difficult matter.</P>

      <P>I know it was often a source of irritation to myself to find, as I tried to convey when Deputy Hughes was speaking, that they did not end as quickly as I should like them to end.  I do not know what Deputy Blowick had in mind when he asked me what was the extent to which damage was done by the use of substances. I do not know that I could give him any figure of the kind he appeared to expect me to be able to give him, but I should say that damage to the reputation of a commodity is the important point.  I do not know that it is a proper analogy, but if a sawyer sees a very fine tree in which he knows that iron bolts, nails, screws and nuts are stuck at different places which are not visible, the tree appearing to be very valuable, but the sawyer knowing that, when he puts it on the bench, he may run up against the metals and destroy very valuable equipment and so on, he knows that the tree is of no value at all to him. The tree, if it could be handled, might be all right, but the fact remains that the knowledge he has that it contains these metals means that he will not purchase at all.</P>
      <P>If, as we know is the case, there is no market here for the wool of the kind we produce and if the purchaser of that wool, because of the world supply position, says: &ldquo;I want this wool in a certain condition.  I want a certain warranty that it is free from so-and-so and so-and-so.  Otherwise, I will not have anything to do with it,&rdquo; it seems to me to indicate the kind of damage done by the use of the substances we seek to prohibit here.  That answers the point raised by Deputy Beegan, which is raised by producers, legitimately, I suppose, not only in relation to wool but in relation to a number of other matters&mdash;what are they going to get out of it?  It is often impossible, and in fact it is impossible in many cases, to say exactly what they are going to get out of it, and the only reply one can give is in general terms the reply I have just given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> Objection was taken to Section 4, and the question was asked why we fix the time when the offence is committed at the point before the wool is removed from the sheep.  We must fix a point somewhere.  If the wool is removed from the sheep, it could be carried over for a very long time, and it is thought desirable that the point fixed should be before the fleece is taken from the sheep's back.</P>

We have had, as I say, considerable discussions, both with regard to the emergency Order now in existence and the proposals before the House, with all the interests concerned, and, while, some of them may not like some of these provisions, they have all agreed as to the need for them, and I thought it not unreasonable to ask the House to give me all stages of the measure to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.  This is an enabling measure, which will empower the Minister for Agriculture to regulate by Order, in such manner as may from time to time appear desirable, the export of agricultural and fishery products. The Bill contains nothing new or exceptional, and merely incorporates in permanent legislation the powers at present exercised under emergency legislation.</P>
      <P>The existing legislation dealing with exports of agricultural products is concerned primarily with the quality of the products without giving the Minister for Agriculture power to control the quantity of such exports.  With the expiration of emergency legislation the need may still remain for restricting exports so as to conserve supplies needed for home consumption.</P>
      <P>Opportunity is being taken to repeal the earlier Acts regulating exports which, owing to changed conditions, are no longer suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>If the purpose of the Bill were purely to control the quality of the export it would be quite all right but, in the case of restricted exports, I do not think any fee should be paid by an individual for a licence. The prevention to export is in the interest of the consumer up.  When we restrict the export we restrict the category as far as the consumer is concerned. Why should the consumer or the agent of the consumer be asked to pay a fee when he is exporting a particular commodity?  If there is a restriction to ensure quantity for export purposes it would be a different matter but when it is done purely in the interests of the <Col N="731" /> consuming public I submit it is unfair to ask for a fee.  There is one other rather important matter in connection with this whole question of exporting and importing under licence, Sir.  I do not want to cast a reflection on anybody's character, but it is open to suggestion that it makes for certain abuses.  I put to the Minister that a record ought to be kept in his Department of the licences and the register ought to be open to the public for inspection on payment of a fee; it ought to be open to members of this House and the Seanad on the payment of no fee.  The public could thus satisfy themselves that there is in operation an Act to restrict any exports and that whatever limitation or whatever amount is exported under licence no favouritism is shown to any individual who acquires a licence for that purpose.  I submit that the public is entitled to know who is selected for a particular purpose and who is licensed to export a particular commodity.</P>
      <P>Where restriction is imposed in the interests of the consuming public, surely the producer, the agent of the producer or an exporter handling a commodity for a number of producers should not be called upon to pay a fee. It is not the amount of the fee that I object to.  It is the principle of the thing.  Secondly, where restriction is imposed and where certain individuals are allowed to export under licence the public generally should be able to satisfy themselves that there is no differentiation and that no favouritism is shown&mdash;that a man is selected for it because he is the right person in the circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know much about this licensing system myself but I scarcely think that any of the abuses to which the Deputy referred could arise.  Business people are not people who would, even if a Minister were to attempt to unfavourably or unjustly select for the purpose of giving a licence some particular person as against some other person, allow him to get away with it.</P>

      <P>This House has, on a number of occasions, been used, as it should be, for the purpose of having allegations of that kind threshed out. It is always possible for a Deputy to avail of the facilities afforded here for that purpose and ensure that no complaint of this kind will fail to be fully ventilated.  I do not think that such a type of case could arise.  This provision is not always made for the purpose of serving the interests of the consumer here.  There are other interests which have to be served.  It would not be right to say that it is exclusively in the interests of the consuming public here.</P>

The House knows well that when cattle were being exported under licence, many people got licences to export who were never in the trade.  If we are to export under licence in this case, a register should be kept so that everybody would know who had obtained licences.  The Minister should be able to satisfy the public that there is no favouritism in the granting of licences.</P>

The additional £4,090 under sub-head E is due to staff ^changes and the rise in staff costs following consolidation.

I take it that the appointment, promotion, dismissal and retirement of members of the staff lie in the hands of the Ceann Comhairle and that nobody else has the right to appoint, promote, or increase the pay of any member of the staff under the control of this House.

If a vacancy occurred in any business establishment worthy of the name in this city or in the country, the necessary steps would be taken beforehand to select the most suitable successor to the person due to retire at a particular date.  It is the duty of the Ceann Comhairle, under the Constitution and the Standing Orders, to answer to the House for his failure to fill, this position and I recognise nobody else in this matter.  I have heard, and I suppose other Deputies have heard, that there is an innumerable number of applicants and that every Minister has a nominee for this much sought for position, which was so honourably filled over a long period of years by Captain Tom Byrne.  I hope that whoever gets the job will do it as well as it was done by him.  It is about time, at any rate, if there is anybody responsible for reconciling the differences between Ministers who have their own nominees for this job, that he should make up his mind as to who is the most suitable applicant amongst the innumerable people who have made application for the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Captain of the Guard has a certain responsibility to this House. For instance, I understand that, under the Rules and Standing Orders of the House, he has the sole responsibility for removing any Deputy who refuses to leave the House at the request of the Chair.  Quite recently we had a little bit of trouble here.  That kind of trouble arises in the best-regulated families.  At any rate, a member who was ordered to leave the House on a particular occasion did not respond right away to the request of the Ceann Comhairle and we had no Captain of the Guard to enforce the ruling of the <Col N="737" /> Chair.  That distasteful task was left to one of the ushers</P>
    <P>I wonder was it quite in order on that occasion for the Chair Id order the removal of a Deputy by a person on whom did not lie the responsibility for carrying out that duty.  I am not too well versed in the duties of the Captain of the Guard, but there may be other duties which nobody else should, in the ordinary course, perform except the Captain of the Guard.  At any rate, for a long period of years this House has passed an Estimate, and I presume it will pass this Estimate, making provision for the position of Captain of the Guard.  I hope that a satisfactory explanation for the failure to fill this responsible post will be given to the House before this Estimate is passed.</P>
    <P>On a number of previous occasions the attention of the responsible authority here, that is the Ceann Comhairle, was drawn to a number of matters, including the very unsatisfactory kind of room provided for the reception of visitors.  Like yourself-Sir, I have had the experience of visiting Parliament Houses in other countries &mdash; in London, Brussels, Paris and Rome &mdash; and I think we have nothing to boast about in the kind of dog-box at the entrance gate for the reception of foreign visitors and of our own people who come here in large numbers from time to time to see Deputies.  It is a disgraceful kind of dog-box which is used for this purpose.  If the Minister for Finance has all the money he says he has for every useful purpose, it is time that he allocated some of it for the purpose of providing a decent kind of reception-room for visitors to this House.  I hope that before this Estimate is passed an assurance will be given by the responsible authority in this matter that a proper reception-room will he provided before the end of the financial year.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Department of Finance claim responsibility for all these matters, but where they come in under the Constitution in matters of this kind I do not know.  So far as I can see, the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has as much responsibility under the <Col N="738" /> Constitution for the proper conduct of this House, for appointments to the staff and for the promotion and dismissal of members of the staff as the Minister for Finance.  I would be amazed, as I imagine other Deputies would be amazed, to hear that all this work is left in the hands of some senior or junior civil servant.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of the staff employed in this House and, particularly, in the restaurant.  When I first entered this House in 1922, and for many years afterwards, the catering arrangements were in the hands of a committee appointed by this House. That committee had full responsibility for the employment and the conditions of employment of the staff that worked here over a long period of years.  At one stage, perhaps during the period of your membership of this House, Sir, that Kitchen Committee employed a good and efficient staff under the best possible conditions, gave them a full week's employment, and at the end of certain financial years profits which were made went back into the revenue for the relief of taxation.  Who is responsible for it I have yet to find out, but now we are asked to vote a subsidy, if you please, of £500 a year to a private company, established for profit-making purposes.  Is there any other catering concern in the country in such a privileged position as that? I doubt it.  This is a fairly big concern. I do not care whether they claim the whole or portion of the £500 provided in this Estimate as a subsidy to enable them to get more profit on their business than they would get in any other place where they are carrying on business.  I understand that the directors of this catering concern are associated with a lot of other catering concerns outside this House.  That is not pertinent, except to this extent, that they get no subsidy for the catering they do in other places.  They have to rely on the service they give to the public, and the taxpayers have not to pay, in addition to those who have to pay decent amounts, I suppose, for the food they consume in any of the other establishments carried on by this concern outside this House.  I do not know that anybody would get up here and <Col N="739" /> say that he is getting his food cheaply in the restaurant.  I have heard many members complaining about the high charges.</P>
    <P>As to the efficiency, I have nothing to say on that matter against the concern responsible for carrying out the catering arrangements, but I wonder how many members know of the conditions under which the staff in the restaurant are employed.  I take it that members of the House know something about the hours and working conditions and I would like to see any Deputy from any part of the House, who is personally aware of the shocking conditions under which some of the members of the staff are working, standing up here and saying he is prepared to go outside and defend them.  How many Deputies know that one girl with a glorified title is working a full week here for 27/3 and another girl with, perhaps, a more important title, is paid £2 8s. 0d. for a hard week's work, working late into the night and with very long service?</P>
    <P>If Deputy Mrs. Crowley speaks in this debate, I wonder will she defend such things if she knows the conditions of the women members of the staff and were asked to vote a subsidy to a so-called business concern that is prepared apparently to defend these rotten conditions of service.  Somebody may get up and say that the staff are not working here every week, but the same applies to the Ceann Comhairle and to Deputies.  We are not sitting here every week or every day in the week and there is no use in coming back with that kind of argument.  Before this subsidy is voted, I want an assurance from the Ceann Comhairle, and from nobody else, that the rotten conditions of service of the catering staff will be revised immediately and that the employees, male and female, will at least have as good conditions as employees have in any other comparable concern in the city or country.</P>

      <P>The manageress of this concern is known to every Deputy to be a highly efficient, lady and, from what I know of the wages and working conditions of girls employed in similar positions in hotels in the city or country, she would have double her pay in any decent concern.  This is the one occasion in the year when &mdash; and I am addressing Deputies of every Party &mdash; we are in control.  There is no Party issue in this matter and, if there was a Vote on this, I would expect there would be no Whips put on.  If I cannot get an assurance from the Chair that there will be an immediate revision of the rotten conditions of service of the catering staff, I am prepared to put this Vote to a division and test Deputies on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was about to refer to the committee that the Chair has in mind.  It is known as the Kitchen Committee. What powers have the members of the Kitchen Committee, and how often do they meet?  When did they last make a recommendation on this or any other matter?  Were they ever allowed during the last year or two to meet for the purpose of discussing the questions I am now raising ?  My information is that they were not asked to meet or, if they did meet, they were not allowed to discuss these matters.  Therefore, there is no use in discussing a committee that has no power or responsibility. When the committee had power and responsibility they discharged their duties to the satisfaction of Deputies and to the satisfaction of the taxpayers to the extent that they conducted the catering arrangements of this House so satisfactorily that they gave the best food at a low price and they made a profit and that profit went back into revenue for the relief of taxation.  Why can we not get back to those days instead of having to vote £500 this year to a catering concern that would be ashamed to disclose the hours and wages and general working <Col N="741" /> conditions of the staff?  I will wait for a reply from the Ceann Comhairle before I say anything further.</P>

      <P>There is provision in tins Estimate for the allowances of members of this House and I want to raise a question which, I flunk, is of fundamental importance.  This, as has been pointed out, is the supreme Assembly of the nation.  On the deliberations of this Assembly depends the entire future of our administration and the type of legislation under which our people will have to live.  The extent to which decisions taken by this House influence the lives of all sections of the people is well known and clearly understood. This is a democratically elected institution and we know that in every such institution the members have certain rights and also certain duties. If you are a member of a small committee, a committee of agriculture, a vocational committee or anything of that kind, down the country, there is a record kept of your attendance at meetings.  If a member fails to attend a minimum number of days he is disqualified. But here in the supreme Assembly of the nation it is possible for a Deputy to get elected and to sign the roll and then he can sit back for five years without ever showing his face in this House.  I think that is an appalling state of affairs.  I feel that this money should not be allowed to people who never appear here; at least, there should be an obligation upon every member of the House to come here and bow to the Chair so that the Ceann Comhairle would have some idea of that member's appearance.</P>

      <P>If I am considering the desil ability of voting against this Estimate, I suggest I have a right to give the House some reasons why I am influenced in arrving at that decision.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that a member of the most unimportant local committee can be disqualified for failing to give a minimum number of attendances without giving some explanation, and I think the same rule should apply to members of this House.  I do not think the matter would require legislation. It could be arranged by an amendment of the Standing Orders or Regulations. It is a matter that requires urgent attention, particularly as we saw a number of faces here 12 months ago-that one does not see so frequently now. At least one particular face has disappeared but the owner of that face is still a member of the House.</P>
      <P>With regard to the position of Captain of the Guard, I think it is extraordinary that that position should be left vacant so long.  The outgoing captain impressed everybody by his personality and his efficiency. He was, as it were, almost an institution here.  People who came to visit this House, remembered ever afterwards his courtesy, his friendship and his cordiality.  I think that if nothing else, it is an insult to that distinguished official that the position which he filled with such distinction should be left unoccupied so long. There are, as has been pointed out, many important functions delegated to the Captain of the Guard which Deputy Davin rightly suggested cannot be filled by any other officer.  I ask what qualifications will be required of Captain Byrne's successor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> Will the position be filled by promotion or will somebody be brought in here who has no knowledge or experience of the functions of the officials of this House?  I feel very strongly that this is a position which should be filled by promotion I think that in most Departments promotion is the desirable way of filling the higher positions, giving the man in the junior position something to look forward to, something to hope for, if he is efficient and diligent in his services.  I think in this instance, the position should be filled by promotion and that it should he filled immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter in connection with the staff that I should like to mention, namely, the shortage of reporting staff that we experienced last year in dealing with many of the matters which came before the Committee of Public Accounts. When both Houses are meeting, the reporting staff is insufficient to report the proceedings of both Houses and, at the same time, meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.  As I understand, the salaries paid to reporters here are insufficient to attract new entrants for these positions when they become vacant.  Most reporters can get better jobs outside on newspapers or at other reporting work.  Consequently they are not prepared to accept the salaries offered here, having regard to the long hours of duty, coupled with the uncertainty in connection with the sitting of both Houses which at certain times involves attendance here both late and early.  If they were assured that the Seanad would meet at certain specific times, possibly they might be able to devote some of their time at slack periods of the year to alternative work outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say that it is most unsatisfactory and not conducive to the proper functioning of the Public Accounts Committee that we should be held up because of a shortage of reporting staff.  The work of the Committee is sufficiently important to ensure that it should be able to meet regularly when it requires to do so.  When the Dáil is sitting it should be possible for the <Col N="744" /> Committee of Public Accounts to meet at least one day of the week and be assured of the services of a sufficient staff of reporters to report both the proceedings of the Dáil, the Seanad and of that Committee.  When both Houses are sitting, the present staff of reporters are obliged to report sittings lasting over a considerable period as they do their work very efficiently.  I would suggest that if the proceedings of the Dáil, of the Seanad and of Public Accounts Committee are to be reported, an increased staff is necessary. I understand that the difficulty in the past has been that new recruits with sufficient training and knowledge were not coming forward.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that if that is due to the inadequate salaries offered a drastic modification in the rates and the terms of the appointment should be made because it is essential, I think everyone agrees, that if the proceedings are to be properly reported and If we are maintain the staff at a high level of efficiency, the personnel, of the staff should be sufficiently large.  It is certainly most unsatisfactory that throughout the year the Committee Public Accounts has had to adjourn on occasion for as long a period as three weeks because of a shortage of reporters at times when the Dáil and Seanad were meeting simultaneously.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention the difficulties which visitors to this House sometimes experience in seeing Deputies. The general system under which Deputies meet visitors is unsatisfactory. The small hut at the gate is quit inadequate and the telephonic service between the gate and the rest of the House is insufficient to meet requirements. When both Houses are sitting. there is generally a large number of visitors calling here.  It often strikes me that we have no hesitation in providing better facilities for certain Government Departments and other State institutions but when we require such facilities here, or when it is a matter of extending facilities throughout the country, there is great difficulty in securing them.  Certain Government Departments, as I say, can get any facilities they require <Col N="745" /> without any difficulty.  I suggest that one place where improved facilities arc required is here in Leinster House. Both the telephone staff and the staff of ushers are sometimes at their wits end to meet the demands made on them. Some alteration should be made in the system by increasing the number of ushers or improving the telephone service so that visitors will not find themselves called upon to undergo a wait of half an hour or three-quarters of an hour before they can see a Deputy.</P>
    <P>In the general matter of staffing here, I think all Deputies arc dissatisfied with the manner in which the restaurant has been run.  It may be that we are living in difficult times from the point of view of caterers, owing to shortage of foods of one kind or another and the difficulties of obtaining a fuel supply.  These difficulties have resulted in increasing the work which the members of the catering staff are called upon to perform but when we consider that there is a subsidy paid in respect of the restaurant and that free fuel, or something approaching free fuel, is provided then I think we could reasonably demand better service.  I suggest this is a matter that should be considered carefully. The present conditions are most unsatisfactory.  On certain days of the week the staff have to work long hours and they are in receipt of comparatively small wages.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that this is a matter which should be taken up. It is certainly unsatisfactory that the restaurant is not run better, and that the food there cannot be given cheaper, particularly when Deputies vote a subsidy for the restaurant.</P>
    <P>With regard to the filling of vacancies, it is a strange thing a Captain of the Guard has not been appointed.  The retiring captain has been out of office for three or four months and so far no appointment has been made.  I think it is desirable in a matter of this kind where it is possible there should be promotion from the existing staff &mdash; or at any rate an examination or test which would enable members of the existing staff to present themselves if they thought fit for the position &mdash; that at least they <Col N="746" /> should be afforded an opportunity of applying for the position.  I think the House is entitled to know why the position has not been filled, what are the proposals for filling it and from whom does the Department intend to invite applications.  We should also have the terms of the appointment.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that, in general, if the staffs are to be maintained at a high level &mdash; if the competent staffs which it has been the good fortune of the two Houses of the Oireachtas to enjoy are to be available in the future &mdash; a modification and a revision of the existing rates is inevitable.  I said here before that the staffs in the Houses in general are extremely efficient and courteous, and that they devote themselves assiduously to their duties.  If Deputies are to be afforded the services which should be available to them from the staffs, then the staffs must be kept at a high level of efficiency. A number of members of the staff will, in the course of the next few years, be retiring.  I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary what proposals the Government have for filling these vacancies, and on what terms they propose to fill them.  Certainly, the delay that has occurred in filling some positions does not augur well for the future.  It is essential that we should have here an efficient and a competent staff.</P>
    <P>As I said before, the Library here is conducted in an excellent fashion.  All matters are filed there, whether they are volumes or reports, which Deputies or Senators may need, and are readily available to them.  It is essential that we should continue to have efficient officers in the Library.  As far as I am aware, the salaries and the allowances paid to the staff there and, in fact, to many members of the staff in general, are too low to hope for the same efficiency in the future as we have had m the past.  If we can expect that we will have new applicants for these positions when the present holders retire or are promoted to other offices, then I think the matter should be revised.  I would like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary what views the Government have on this matter.  Certainly the rigid hand of the Department of <Col N="747" /> Finance has for too long been obvious in the general administration of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  If we are to conduct this House, and the work of the House in the manner in which they should be conducted, then a less drastic interference by the Department of Finance is desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to emphasise the point made by Deputy Cosgrave in connection with the Reporting Staff here who, in my opinion, work under conditions of exceedingly great difficulty.  I think there will be agreement amongst the most casual observers that on occasions these difficulties are created by under-staffing. I wonder whose duty it is to inquire into the arrangements so far as the Reporting Staff are concerned. Perhaps it would be a little more important to know if it is the Department of Finance in that case also that makes the arrangements, or is it the Ceann Comhairle?  Deputy Davin referred to this institution as a Sovereign Assembly, and that as such it naturally has its rights and privileges.  I gathered that amongst its rights, at least would be the recruitment and the appointment of staff.  I understand that the position is to the contrary, and that the Department of Finance interferes here, and that it actually appoints and transfers members of the staff.  In other words, that it gate-crashes in here by a policy of peaceful penetration and takes complete control of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the question of officers here generally.  I am not as long a member of the House as Deputy Davin, but I have taken a fairly keen interest in its general operation and control.  One thing that has often occurred to me, as it must have occurred to anybody who has tried to study the position, is this: What is likely to arise here in years to come on the very important question of continuity so far as the senior officers are concerned t In my judgment these people are engaged on work of a highly specialised nature, and there obviously should be an arrangement in the House for understudies, particularly regarding the <Col N="748" /> junior members of the staff.  Are the junior members of the staff getting the opportunity to equip themselves to fill the shoes of the senior officers who are carrying out their duties exceedingly well in this House?  The work is of an exceptional character, and can only be done by understudies or by those who have had a specialised training.  I am not so sure that is being done, and, therefore, I think it is inevitable there will be trouble in that respect if the Department of Finance is allowed to interfere.</P>
    <P>I venture to say that if the position of this House is compared with the position that obtains in the British House of Commons, that such a thing does not obtain there.  After all, the whole procedure of this House is very largely fashioned on the policy and procedure of the British House, but I could not possibly understand the Speaker of the House of Commons, or the staff there, being interfered with by the British Treasury.  I doubt very much if they would allow it.  Deputy Davin asked what right has that particular Department to come in here any more than the Department of Defence or the Department of Posts and Telegraphs which render certain services here, would have.  I think that this question of the constitutional rights of the House should be cleared up once and for all so that every member will understand what they are.</P>
    <P>In connection with the restaurant think the members of the House, as a whole, will be disturbed at the conditions, particulars and details which Deputy Davin has given.  There is a point of view that I should like to give expression to.  It occurs particularly in the evening when Deputies may be interested in some particular debate. I refer to the period from 6 o'clock onwards.  At that time some member might like to associate himself with some particular debate going on in the House.  Meantime, the member may perhaps go to the restaurant for a light meal.  He cannot get the meal because of the length of time it takes to serve it.  Here, again, the question of under-staffing is obvious so far as the restaurant is concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to the position of the Captain of the Guard, criticism has <Col N="749" /> been levelled against whoevcr is responsible for the delay in filling the post.  A point of view that I would like to express is that, to my mind, this is obviously a position to which there should be promotion from the existing members of the staff.  There are members of the staff who are obviously capable of filling that post. Why is it that no opportunity is being provided for them to do so?  If one can accept what one hears, an outsider is about to be imported into this particular position.  I suggest that the House should protest if that is so as regards a position that is within the gift of the House through its nominated officer, the Ceann Comhairle.  I say it is time that we should protest against appointments of that character.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general amenities, I want to join with others in making a personal protest against the reception facilities available at the outer gate.  I think there will be general agreement that, apart from the utter unsuitability of that particular hut for reception purposes, the very make-up of the hut itself is completely out of place in the grounds outside.  It would appear to me as if a certain amount of deterioration has set in in the conduct of this House.</P>
    <P>In regard to the ushers, some time Ago &mdash; for what reason I cannot understand, but it displays a rather petty mind, to say the least of it, whoever was responsible &mdash; the position of ushers was, in effect, abolished by the filling of posts as attendants or messengers who are called upon to do ushers' duty, merely for the sake of saving a few pounds.  That is a despicable attitude. particularly in a Parliament House, and members of the House should protest.</P>
    <P>I do hope that, as a result of this debate, we may have a clear indication as to whose responsibility it is to see that the question of the staff is put on a basis that the House will understand, so that the disabilities under which certain members are suffering may be removed at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <P>I would like to join with the remarks of the various Deputies <Col N="750" /> in connection with the conditions in regard to pay of some of the staff at the present moment.  There is one point I would like to make in connection with Deputy Davin's observations about the meetings of the Joint Committee. The order of the Committee is that it will meet monthly.  That means that it would work out at one meeting every six weeks but, being a Joint Committee of both Houses, it is from time to time difficult to arrange meetings.  At any rate, the order is that there should be monthly meetings and, as far as possible, these meetings take place.</P>
      <P>On the question of staff, the conditions of the staff are not a matter that comes within the authority of the Committee but recommendations and representations on the lines suggested to bring about some improvement m the matters referred to, have already been made.  I join with those who have protested against the non-filling of the position as Captain of the Guard.  That vacancy should be filled as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I wish to add my voice to this debate.  Every member of the House regretted the retirement of Captain Thomas Byrne and wishes him many years and good health to enjoy his retirement.  He is a man with a great national record.  I should like to see the position filled by promotion.  There are men on the staff here who have good national records and, in fairness, the position should be filled by the promotion of one of these men.  I do not belong to the city and I am surprised to hear city Deputies referring to the filling of the post.  If my information is correct, this position is to be filled by an ex-Army captain who is to be brought in here and put over the ushers in this House who have served it since its establishment.  That is entirely wrong and if the Ceann Comhairle appoints such a man &mdash; I do not believe he will have the full say; I believe it will be a matter of some political pull&mdash; it will cause among the staff here an uneasiness just as in any firm if an outsider is brought in and put over the staff, it creates uneasiness amongst the staff and an unhappy position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="751" /> I will vote against a subsidy of £500 being given to any caterer who is carrying on in this House slave labour, as was indicated by the rates of pay payable to the Restaurant staff outlined by Deputy Davin.  I understand that this subsidy is given to the caterer to maintain a skeleton staff here when the Houses of the Oireachtas are not in session, during Christmas, Easter and summer, for a few to come in here whenever it suits them.  The country should not be asked to bear that expense.  These caterers do not get a subsidy from any race committee for going out to Baldoyle or Leopardstown. I am aware that the girls serving in the Restaurant finish work when the House rises.  What is the subsidy for?  The Deputies, surely, are not getting cheap food in that Restaurant.  You would get it cheaper in any part of the city.</P>
    <P>As far as I see, it is profiteering that is going on.  If other people charged what they are charging here, there would be a hue and cry.  I am certainly against any subsidy for that, especially when trade union conditions are not observed.  As we are all aware, when the two Houses are sitting, there is not sufficient staff to wait on tables. There are a few waitresses there who are run off their feet from the time the teas start until they are finished.  What is the subsidy for?  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary when he is replying to tell us exactly what the subsidy is for, because, if they are not going to give the people who are waiting on us a decent standard of wages, then I will certainly vote against it.</P>

      <P>I am not going to occupy the House very long.  Certainly, there is general dissatisfaction among all the members of the House as to the conditions in the restaurant and the general costs of meals there as compared with restaurants outside. When the restaurant was being run by a Committee of this House it could make a profit and I cannot understand why we are now told that a profit <Col N="752" /> cannot be made even though a very handsome subsidy is given towards the upkeep of the restaurant.</P>
      <P>I also wish to say a few words about the reporting staff.  I have observed here that on several occasions assistance has to be given by the reporting staff from the Press Gallery.  I do not think that the reporting staff should be in the position that they would have to call on the assistance of the Press Gallery.  There should be an adequate reporting staff here to deal with everything that takes place in the House without having to call for assistance from outside circles.  The Press Gallery, I believe, have been very decent in giving the assistance when requested but I do not think that they should be called upon.</P>
      <P>I was very much astonished also, about twelve months ago, to be informed by an attendant or an usher, that, although they are supplied with uniforms, they are not supplied with overcoats.  That class of economy is simply cheeseparing and I do not think it is justified.</P>
      <P>Certainly, from what I have heard of the conditions in the restaurant and the standard of wages there, to say the least of it, it is anything but extravagant.</P>

      <P>With your permission, I will answer Deputy Davin, if he will allow me.  He seems to be in a mood to hold up the proceedings. He is one of the oldest members of the House but, like all old men, myself included, his memory is failing him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, then, his memory is 100 per cent.  right.  In 1923, when he was a member of the House, a special Standing Committee was set up to deal with this very matter.  It made certain recommendations.  In practice, this matter is dealt with in accordance with those recommendations, made by the Standing Committee on the Oireachtas Staff, with regard to the recruitment and promotion <Col N="755" /> of the staff of the Houses of the Oircachtas.  I take it that that is the very subject in which Deputy Davin is, interested and wants information about.  In their 1923 report, the committee classified the Oireachtas staff into two main divisions: (1) the officers of the Houses and (2) the administrative, clerical, technical and subordinate staffs.  Division (1) consists of (a) the clerk and assistant clerk of each House and (b) officers common to both Houses, namely, the superintendent, the Captain of the Guard, the librarian, the assistant librarian.</P>
      <P>Appointments to these posts, in accordance with the 1923 Report, are made by the Taoiseach on the joint recommendation of the Chairman of the House concerned and the Minister for Finance in the case of category (a) and by the Taoiseach on the joint recommendation of the two Chairmen and the Minister for Finance in the case of category (b).  Division (2), comprising all the remaining staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas, consists of (a) the administrative, clerical and typing staffs of the three principal offices, that is, the Public Bill and General Office, the Private Bill and Committee Office and the Journal Office, (b) the Official Reporting Staff, (c) the Translation Staff, (d) the subordinate staffs, namely, the established attendants or ushers and unestablished messengers or cleaners, etc.  All the staff listed in the preceding paragraphs are recruited in accordance with the usual procedure and through the Civil Service Commission in the case of established posts, and promotions follow the usual Departmental practice.</P>
      <P>I suppose that, after such a long period of time, Deputy Davin may forget, if he has forgotten, about the Report of this Committee, which was set up away back in 1923, 24 years ago. It is a long spate in any man's life, even in that of Deputy Davin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal criticism offered was with regard to the facilities for the reception of visitors who may wish to see the Houses of the Oireachtas, or who have business with Deputies.  That is a matter that should be dealt with by the Committee on Procedure and <Col N="756" /> Privileges, and, on their report being presented, the Minister for Finance will, I am sure, consider the matter favourably.  I agree that the facilities are not what they ought to be, and I agree with those Deputies who say itis time they were improved; but, in my opinion, the proper body to go into the matter is a committee, such as the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, on which all sides of the House are represented.  I do not think it is necessary for me, having informed the House of the conditions of appointment and the method of appointment of the staff, to go into any detail with regard to the filling of the vacancy caused by the retirement of Captain Tom Byrne.  The person to be appointed to this vacancy will have to have the qualifications of national service and a competent knowledge of Irish.  Most, if not all, of the ushers have already applied and are, eligible to be considered in connection with this vacancy.</P>
    <P>A good deal of criticism has been levelled at the catering, the system of catering was varied in 1923.  Upto then there was a committee of the House dealing with the subject, but, apparently &mdash; I can only assume this, as I cannot remember exactly the reasons&mdash; the members were not satisfied with the then existing conditions, though some of them are lamenting them to-day. At that time, apparently, the members felt some alteration was necessary, and, because of that, an outside firm of caterers was called in to do the catering.  This firm was in the good graces, I understand, of the trade union movement and was looked upon as a good employer.  Part of the conditions of the contract was: &ldquo;It is agreed that such labour shall not be remunerated at a lower rate than obtained prior to the date of this agreement.&rdquo; In other words, generally speaking, the terms of employment were to be as good as those obtaining elsewhere.  I do not know that there has been any breach of that agreement. There is, as Deputies are aware, an undertaking that, in the event of a loss by the caterers, a subsidy amounting to £350, and, in respect of the expenses of catering, a further £150 making a total of £500, will be paid.</P>

      <P>It is much easier for the Deputy to count the members of his Party than it is for me to be ,aware of who they are.  I am sure he will not go astray in the count.  The position with regard to the reporting staff is that an attempt was made recently to get additional members for that staff, and two qualified persons were found, but only one accepted appointment. subsequently.  It is intended to have a further try to increase that staff; It is not true to say that it is because of the rate of remuneration that there is difficulty in getting qualified persons. Incidentally, most Deputies seemed to be thinking in terms of the past when they referred generally to the unsatisfactory remuneration of the various officers and staff employed in the House, forgetful of the fact that, equally with every other employee and group of employees in the State service and, generally speaking, in the various firms throughout the country, they got their proportionate increase. It is not because of any reduction or lack of remuneration that it has not been found possible to get these competent reporters.  The difficulty is that it is necessary to have reporters capable of reporting speeches in Irish as well as in English and, at the speed at which the ordinary person speaks, it is not so easy to get people with that particular qualification.</P>

      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back.  This motion was put down for the purpose of giving the Parliamentary Secretary an opportunity of stating whether it is the intention of the Government to give a supplementary pension, in view of the increased cost of living, to the resigned and retired R.I.C. men.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows the history of the matter.  Evidently, the British Government, in the case of those who served up to the period of disbandment, have given supplementary pension allowances on two occasions since the beginning of the last world war.  I understand that repeated applications have been made by groups representing the resigned and dismissed R.I.C. men. We have been told here that other State pensioners have received supplementary pension allowances.  We have been told, too, that the position of retired teachers is under consideration. Am I to take it that the claim made by this small group will be favourably considered with the others when the case of State pensioners comes up for consideration?</P>

      <P>I do not know whether there is any provision in the Estimate for pensions for widows of members of <Col N="764" /> the Garda.  There is a case for revision of those pensions in view of the increased cost of living.  They were fixed at a very low rate and reconsideration of them is an urgent need.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I direct this inquiry to the Parliamentary Secretary? It was indicated in the House some years ago that the Minister for Finance had directed an actuarial examination of the entire superannuation code.  It was understood that that actuarial examination was proceeding. Questions in the House subsequently elicited that the actuarial examination had been suspended because the actuary had been assigned other duties. I directed a question to the Minister for Finance recently to ascertain when we were likely to see the report of the actuary, and the Minister for Social Welfare, who replied, indicated that the work had, apparently, again been suspended and he was unable to say whether or not it was then proceeding. Can the Parliamentary Secretary give any indication whether the actuarial examination is, in fact, proceeding and, if it is, when it is likely that the report of the actuary will be available? This is a very important matter.  A large number of persons are affected by the superannuation code.  It is of vital importance to them now because the Minister for Finance has indicated that he is not prepared to consider long over-due amendments to the superannuation code until such time as he is in receipt of the actuarial report. Can we have some indication now as to when that report will be available?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been frequently stated by more than one Minister that the question of increasing the pensions of limited classes of persons such as those referred to by Deputies could not be considered separately.  No decision has yet been come to by the Government on the matter, but, obviously, they cannot consider one or two classes without considering all the persons who would be more or less living under the same conditions.  Obviously, the two cases of the resigned and dismissed Royal Irish Constabulary and the widows of deceased Gardaí could not be singled out for consideration <Col N="765" /> without going into the claims of all the people who would be equally entitled to consideration.  Deputy Norton raised a question regarding the actuarial examination. I understand that that is still in suspense, as the actuary continues to be engaged on other work.</P>
