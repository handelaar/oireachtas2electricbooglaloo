      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that poultry keepers, especially in County Cork, are seriously hampered <Col N="1842" /> at present in the production of early chickens as sufficient paraffin oil is not available for incubators and brooders: and if so, if he will make increased quantities of such oil available, so that poultry keepers may be in a position to export, during 1947 and 1948, the quantity of eggs which has been mutually agreed upon between the Government of Great Britain and ourselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that arrears in deliveries of kerosene for lamps, incubators, etc., have occurred recently in some areas of County Cork owing to the current shortage of transport and to the concentration on deliveries of tractor vaporising oil for tillage purposes.  I have made arrangements with the oil distributing companies to have deliveries made in the near future to the areas where supplies are still outstanding, and the companies inform me that from a date early in May they will be in a position to meet all arrears in deliveries in County Cork.  Greatly increased allowances of kerosene have been made for poultry raising during the current season as compared with previous seasons, and allowance is now made for the full requirements of poultry keepers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of the fact that the weekly butter ration in recent months has been restricted to two ounces per head, and that the total quantity of butter required to provide this ration is comparatively small in relation to the total quantity produced in normal years, he will state what steps were taken, before fixing the ration, to ascertain whether butter was being sent out of the country illegally or otherwise in substantial quantities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As the export of butter is controlled by the Minister for Agriculture, information is available at all times in regard to the quantities licensed for export.  Apart from small quantities provided for ships' stores, no commercial exports of butter were licensed during the production year ended 30th April, 1947.  The total quantity of butter exported during the year under special licences to individuals, to enable them to send butter out of their own butter rations to persons of Irish nationality resident abroad, in certain circumstances, was 40 cwt. approximately. I am satisfied that the preventive measures adopted by the Revenue Commissioners ensure that unlawful exports of butter, to the extent that they exist, are on a small scale.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the West Cork Slate Quarries find it difficult to carry on operations at present, owing to the fact that they have been permitted to increase the prices of their products by 10 per cent. only, while their costs in wages and materials have shown a progressive increase much exceeding that percentage; <Col N="1844" /> and if he will consider permitting them an increase of at least 20 per cent. on pre-war rates to enable them to continue in production with a reasonable profit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In permitting the concern to which the Deputy refers to increase its prices by 10 per cent., I had full regard to increased production costs and I am not satisfied that any further increase in prices would be warranted at the present time.  I will be prepared, however, to review the position on receipt of the financial accounts of the concern for their current trading year&mdash;ending on the 30th June.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that 31 new double-decker buses have already been placed on the Dublin City and suburban services.  The speed with which the city services can be improved is limited by the shortage of equipment and by the necessity to assign a proportion of new vehicles to the provinces, where many areas have been deprived of all means of public passenger transport since train services were curtailed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister recommend the monopoly now in charge of our transport to do something to speed up the provision of an adequate number of buses for the conveyance of people who are now delayed long periods?  In many cases, they are late for their work on account of the delays and will he ask the company to provide the service which they promised the public?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister notice that, in recent months, it would appear to the casual observer that the queues waiting for public transport in the centre of the city are growing longer than they were?

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister not had representations made to him that, fully sympathising with the difficulty under which the company is labouring, it is obvious that the more effort the company makes the longer the queues appear to grow?

      <P>I presume that the reference is to a letter which appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> on 29th April.  I have read this letter.  Its accuracy may be judged from the following examples:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  The writer suggests that prisoners get their last meal for the day at 4.30 p.m. and are locked up in their cells for the night at, or before, that hour.</P>
      <P>In fact, prisoners do not go to their cells for the night until 7.30 p.m. and they have a light meal at that hour.</P>
      <P>2.  It is stated that on Sundays and holidays prisoners are &ldquo;shut up alone from 12.30 onwards.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In fact, on these days, prisoners are out of cells, and in association, practically all day.</P>
      <P>3.  It is stated that during the first two years of his imprisonment a penal servitude prisoner is allowed only three letters and one visit per year.</P>
      <P>In fact, he is allowed 12 letters and 12 visits per year, and more, if reasonable cause is shown.</P>
      <P>4.  The statement is made &ldquo;Prisoners are not allowed forks at their meals.&rdquo; In fact, they are supplied with forks when required by the nature of the meal.</P>
      <P>In some of these instances, the facts have already been given some publicity and should be well known to anybody interested in prison conditions.  In all instances, the facts could have been ascertained by the slightest inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that the average annual yield of all our dairy cows is under 400 gallons; that the average annual yield of the cows under test in the cow testing associations, is over 500 gallons; further, that if even one-fourth of our cows yielded as <Col N="1851" /> much, on an average, as those under test, there would be an increase in our milk output of some 30,000,000 gallons yearly; and if so, if, in view of the desirability of securing an appreciably higher number of cows under test, he will state when it is intended that his Department shall put into full operation the several recommendations contained in the interim report on dairying issued in 1943 by the Commission on Post-war Agricultural Policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the average yield of cows owned by members of cow testing associations is higher than the average yield of other cows. I am not satisfied, however, that the difference is as great as the figures given in the question would suggest. Particulars furnished in the report to which the Deputy refers show that over a number of years the annual quantity of milk sold to creameries in our principal dairying area represents 379 gallons for each cow held by the suppliers. Since a considerable quantity of milk is consumed in the suppliers' households and fed to live stock, the average yield per cow would, in my opinion, be nearer to 500 than 400 gallons in the area mentioned, which comprises the whole of Munster and County Kilkenny and contains more than half the milch cows of the country.</P>
      <P>As regards the last part of the question, it would not be possible in existing circumstances, owing to the lack of necessary equipment, to effect any considerable extension of cow testing associations.  While the establishment and proper use of such associations would tend to encourage farmers to take steps to increase milk yields, there is no reason why they should not proceed immediately to improve their herds, and I am hopeful that the present prices for milk will induce dairy farmers to do a good deal in that direction.  All factors having a bearing on milk yields are under consideration at present.</P>

According to the statistics furnished by the Department of Industry and Commerce some 24 per cent. of the milk yield of each cow is consumed on the farmer's place in one way or another.

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is simply this: that if this board were to get a gift for the purposes for which the board is, in the main, set up, that is, to deal with people in needy circumstances in the classes indicated, it could receive the gift for that purpose and apply it in accordance with the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier in this Bill it provides that the board shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession. Here the board is being put into the position that it can accept gifts, in addition to the Sinn Féin funds which it is proposed to take in the way set out in the Bill; that it can acquire property and subscriptions in order to build up a fund and keep it going.  I think that is a most undesirable proposal.  Here and there throughout the country, close down to the circumstances in which men and women came together to do the work that is referred to generally in Section 13, organisations of one kind or <Col N="1876" /> another have been set up&mdash;organisations of a purely voluntary kind&mdash;to collect subscriptions on a voluntary basis for the assistance of people in the classes mentioned in the section. Their circumstances are well and intimately known to these voluntary associations, and the collection and the distribution of these funds have been fairly well established.</P>
      <P>Now the Taoiseach proposes that this board shall be set up with a fund that can attract to itself the type of voluntary subscriptions that have been given to these other bodies.  I entirely oppose this proposal here.  I think it will be a blow directed against the voluntary associations that have been carrying on a very necessary and a very intimate work and it will have the result of taking away to a certain extent certain income from the bodies that are already doing this close and intimate work and, instead of having the general and scattered voluntary bodies attending to this work, we would have the political body that it is proposed to set up in this Bill.  I object to that.</P>

      <P>On the contrary, within the sphere of nationalist activity we belonged to the Party opposed to them.  But their efforts and our efforts of those days are now part of the history of the country and, just as the veterans of the movement to which I have the honour to belong have been recognised as men who served their country to the best of their ability by those who came after them, so I <Col N="1877" /> believe there would be very few in the nationalist ranks of the country who would not now gladly recognise that the persons referred to in this Bill, whether we agreed or disagreed in the past, served their country to the best of their ability in the time they were called upon.  I share Deputy Mulcahy's feeling of distaste for a proposal that people who served their country and who as a result of that service missed opportunities for material advancement that they might otherwise have enjoyed and thus have come upon hard times in their older age, should have their financial embarrassment or their difficulties made the subject of the kind of impersonal inquisition which a statutory board may undertake.

      <P>You see, Sir, Section 14 envisages the maintenance of this board, not only for the disposition of the actual sum of money that would come into their hands, but for the purpose of receiving gifts.  So that it may remain as a permanent feature, as a body to which these veterans might be referred if they came forward with a claim that they were entitled to something as of right rather than as an eleemosynary relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That envisages that some day it may come to an end, but you observe that this enables it to carry on so long as gifts are given to it. What I am afraid of is this, that in future some outstanding figure of those days might be in difficulties.  As things stand at present, a group of old comrades or admirers would then ordinarily come together and choose out a number of persons whom they might approach, and prepare a little tribute for that individual person.  In that way, an embarrassment that everyone wanted to avoid is overcome without unduly trespassing on the intimate <Col N="1878" /> affairs of the individual who requires help.  I speak of this because I had personal experience of it and I have no hesitation in saying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Why do you ask us, in addition to whatever we have done by way of endowing the board, to come forward again and undertake responsibility for this individual&rdquo;?  Do ye want&mdash;now I am speaking to the members of Sinn Féin and its associate bodies&mdash;do ye want to have a statutory board of this kind to undertake this kind of job?  I know that so far as my old friends were concerned, where an exceptional case arose, I never was unable to find a group of individuals to undertake the job.  They were not all old Nationalists.  I will name no names.  Some of the first I approached were people sitting in very prominent places on the Front Benches of both sides of this House.  I offered them the opportunity and what I deemed to be the privilege of sharing a tribute to an old friend and I was not mistaken.</P>

      <P>I do not want to intervene in what really is not my business because it is not my business to deal with the classes of persons mentioned here.  I am only telling my experience when I was dealing with persons in analogous situations of an older day. I thought Section 14 envisaged the survival of this board.  If it does not, my anxiety falls to the ground.  If it does, then I think you ought to consider carefully what you are doing because, if you make this a permanent institution, you will be providing against a contingency that does not require provision, because you will always find a group of people who will be able to undertake an individual case and, in the event of such cases arising, the persons concerned would infinitely prefer to have their difficulty dealt with in that way than to become the dependents of a statutory body such as is envisaged in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say a word or two, perhaps.  The intention there to permit of the body taking a gift is simply that some individual may wish to make available a sum of money, or what can be turned rapidly into money, for this body to distribute in accordance with the terms of this Bill.  I do not think it would be right to forbid that.  I had hoped that this might be regarded, for the time being anyhow, as a benevolent fund to deal with whatever sums of money might be made available and, of course, everything would depend on how the scheme works out in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it works satisfactorily it is quite possible that in a very short time some individuals who might like to make a sum of money available might do it. Leaving aside the argument of making <Col N="1880" /> the board permanent, every argument against the making of gifts would be against any benevolent fund of any kind.  The existence of these funds will not prevent a group of individuals who may be interested in a particular case in their neighbourhood from coming together and giving such personal assistance as they might deem desirable. I do not think that will in any way dry up any funds which might be made available in the sense suggested by Deputy Dillon.  It is sometimes useful to say: &ldquo;Very well, if you cannot investigate the case, why do you not try that fund?&rdquo; If, for instance, Deputy Dillon found in a particular case, that, because such a fund was in existence, personal contributions were not readily available, I do not think that he would put up the argument that he put up here.  He would say: &ldquo;I know that there is such a fund but, after all, the person concerned would appreciate it very much more if a number of friends came together and made this gift.&rdquo;  They could do that.  There is nothing to prevent them.  I think it would be undesirable to rule out gifts to the board.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should say, with regard to the permanency of the board, that I do not think the sum is sufficiently large or that it is likely that it would last over a considerable period.  I am afraid that the costs will leave only a relatively small sum.  The only point in that, as far as the Government is concerned, is whether that money should be spent in law costs or whether it should be used for a better purpose.</P>

      <P>Consequently, I am afraid that the sum is too small to suggest that it would last.  If, notwithstanding all the suggestions that have come from the Opposition, the board was found to function well and was performing a useful public service, the distrust that was expressed for it here might in time disappear when the <Col N="1881" /> public saw it functioning and it might not be an unwise thing if, having been tried and proved reasonably successful, it might be regarded as a body which would serve something of a wider purpose than the mere distribution of the original funds.</P>
      <P>There is another purpose which this provision could serve.  It might happen &mdash;I know that it has happened in other cases&mdash;that a person in distressed circumstances might say: &ldquo;Look here, I would be entitled to get a grant from this fund.  I could ask you to consider me for a grant but I would prefer if you would give me a loan.&rdquo; He might be told: &ldquo;There is no provision here to give you a loan&rdquo; and he might say: &ldquo;All right, if I am granted this money I propose to do certain things with it and I propose paying it back to the fund if I can&rdquo;.  Suppose, after a few years that the circumstances of the person who was in needy circumstances changed and that he was in a position to pay back to the fund the money he had got, the only way in which it could be received would be as a gift.  We are making no provision for loans.  You would not like to deprive him of the personal satisfaction of being able to repay and say: &ldquo;Fortunately, I did not need to become a complete beneficiary of the fund in the sense of getting a complete grant and I have the personal satisfaction of being able to pay it back&rdquo;.  That would have to be purely voluntary and the section would enable that to be done.  That is an aspect of it.  I am not making very much of that aspect of it though it could happen.  I do not think there is any likelihood that it will make, in any way, for the permanency of this body.  I think that all Deputies will agree that if it proved itself in practice as having value the objection on grounds of permanency might disappear.</P>

      <P>If the problem the Taoiseach speaks about exists and if a body to deal with it is necessary that is another day's work.  If this Bill ever becomes law then the trust fund that is here investigated is an ill-begotten fund and the sooner any moneys in it are disposed of to meet whatever proposals the Taoiseach has in mind, the <Col N="1882" /> better.  I have no intention of discussing on this Bill either the problem that is suggested by Section 13 or the extended proposals that the Taoiseach seems to have in mind in connection with Section 14.  I oppose Section 14 as I opposed the other sections of the Bill.  I want to say with regard to Section 14 that Section 14 is an attack in fact on a large and varied number of voluntary associations that are dealing with the problem the Taoiseach speaks about now.  It could easily be part of the unhappy results of this Bill that through the operation of Section 14 some of the funds that are going into the smaller bodies now would dry up and that they would look vainly to the larger and more pretentiously set up trust fund to deal with the particular types of wants and assistance that they have been getting for years through the smaller societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to the Taoiseach that Section 14 is a matter of substance.  I never can be quite sure when I am dealing with the Taoiseach whether he has stumbled upon something with the best intentions in the world, not realising its implications, or whether he is burning the midnight oil for the purpose of providing something well calculated to make us stumble upon it.  Section 14 alters the whole purpose of this body.  The case made for this Bill up to Section 14 is that there is a sum of money in the court; that we want to take it out of the court and we want to dispose of it in accordance with the presumed wishes of those who subscribed to it.  Now that is a finite purpose.  You can see the end of that and the primary purpose there is to ensure that the fund which is now in existence will be disposed of with propriety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 14 means something quite different.  It means the setting up of a statutory body which may receive gifts, bequests or devises for the general purpose of relieving members of the organisations named who, in the judgment of the board, may deserve and require assistance of one kind or another.  I do not know how ye people feel about that, but I know I would not have liked to send my old colleagues in the evening of their days to <Col N="1883" /> strangers.  Remember, this body is under a statutory obligation to keep books of accounts and to have them audited by an auditor appointed by the board with the approval of the Government. That means a certain amount of filling of forms and receipts and justifications to an auditor that the funds distributed were distributed in accordance with the purposes of the Act.  It could mean a means test.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that any section of the House wants to approach needy veterans of the national movement on that basis.  You may get eccentric old persons, the best in the world, who have in fact a nest egg somewhere but, in their senility, they have the delusion that they are threatened with fearful poverty.  They come to their friends and a few of these friends put up a little money, but discover afterwards when they die that they left £500.  We can afford to laugh at that, although we imagined that they had not a farthing.  But there is no more about it.  We understand that many an old person gets odd in that way.  But, suppose you have a board which has to satisfy an auditor that it only distributed the funds to needy persons, must it not make some inquiries to satisfy itself?</P>

I do not want a permanent system under which you say to such a person: &ldquo;I tell you what I will do; I will drop a line to the board set up under the Bill and let them deal with it.&rdquo; I am amazed that the Taoiseach wants it.  I can see the method of reasoning which wants to establish a board to distribute a fund which we know of and that sees the board finishing altogether when that job is done.  Surely the Taoiseach, if he will not admit that we were <i>bona</i><i>fide</i> in expressing our anxiety on grounds of principle in regard to this Bill, at least will admit that the Bill was distasteful to a lot of people in this House who are most unquestionably entitled to speak as much as he is for Oglaigh na hEireann, The Irish Volunteers, The Irish Citizen Army, Fianna Eireann, The Hibernian Rifles and Cumann na mBan?  If that is true, surely it is not desirable to promote the perpetuation of that body and to carry into it the seed of dissension and resentment and bitterness.</P>

      <P>From those who think the whole thing is a mistake and wrong.  You do not want to make it permanent.  If you cannot see that yourselves, I cannot make you.  But, if it were a plan that I thought was becoming or desirable, I would remind the House that in setting up this board which is capable of receiving gifts from the State as well as from private individuals, it would be very wrong to confine its activities to the veterans of one particular period of the national <Col N="1885" /> struggle.  There are veterans of an older day than any referred to here who have met with adversity and who want that adversity ameliorated from time to time.  Were this a becoming scheme, I would stipulate that there should be scope therein to deal with their cases as well.  But I do not want to put any such scheme into operation in respect of your veterans, because I venerate them too much as men who, for principle and belief, sacrificed much.  I do not seek to impose upon your veterans that which I would not wish for my own.  I would not accept that provision for the veterans of the movements with which I had the honour to be associated prior to the Treaty.  I think you are gravely mistaken if you accept that for yours. Quite apart from this measure, I would be happy to think that something might be devised which would make provision for all on a common ground upon which all of us would agree.</P>

      <P>I approve of Section 14 and I have my reasons for doing so, due to my association with the organisation for a long number of years.  Every member of this House has, I am sure, heard tell of conscience money at one time or another and this section gives people who were once associated with the Sinn Féin organisation an opportunity to make restitution. That is one of the reasons why I support Section 14.  Reference was made, when Section 13 was under consideration, <Col N="1886" /> to another fund that was dissipated in the course of law actions. I have in mind still another fund in the same locality.  A very substantial amount of the Sinn Féin funds there fell into the hands of one person, who still retains it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this section because it provides an opportunity to many of the people mentioned in Section 13, who have been more fortunate than their colleagues, to make some contribution to a fund or a trust of this kind.  I have had some experience of cases, at least two, of Old I.R.A. men who left bequests in their wills for some such purpose as this, but nobody looked after the matter and through the lapse of time the bequests were not made operative; for one reason or another those bequests failed to achieve their object.  I have no doubt that if there was a body, such as is contemplated in this Bill, prepared to administer a fund of a national kind like this, many people who are now better endowed with the world's goods than some of their old colleagues would welcome the opportunity to make some contribution.</P>
      <P>I think that if this section is accepted it will fill a gap that has existed for some time and it will enable people to help their colleagues of former days, through a body which, they will be assured, by its composition, will administer the fund impartially. It will give them an opportunity of helping those old colleagues. I think a body prepared to accept the implications of Section 14 will do a very useful work in the country and will provide a means of helping those in needy circumstances who were formerly associated with one or other of these different organisations.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moran must be living far from the situation if he thinks that there are large numbers <Col N="1887" /> of people who have had to wait for a fund, such as is contemplated now under Section 14, to be assisted.  We now hear the canvass going on against the smaller voluntary bodies that, in a localised way, have for years been and are now dealing with this matter.  All I can say with regard to Deputy Walsh's point is that if people have restitution to make, and if they realise the amount of the restitution they have to make, this will be an awfully big fund.</P>

I have had a long experience of dealing with funds in the locality from which I come.  I have contributed to them and I have helped to administer them.  As a result of the superhuman effort needed to secure the freedom of this country, a large number of people suffered financially, and the result of their suffering is still apparent.  It has devolved on the more fortunate of us to come together occasionally and assist the less fortunate ones.  That has continued down the years since 1921, and even before that time such assistance was necessary and it will continue as long as the survivors of the movement live in any large numbers in the country.  These funds will not in any way interfere with local efforts to relieve distress among persons who have been associated with the national movement.</P>

    <P>When you turn to the definition of &ldquo;qualified person&rdquo;, you immediately discover that such a person must be a needy person.

The board would have to be able to go into court and say: &ldquo;We considered that general question and came to the conclusion that a person who had an income of less than so much could be regarded as a needy person.&rdquo;  Suppose they said a person who has an income of 30/- a week for each member of the household is a needy person and taking that as a foot rule, they make an award to an individual&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with some attention to the introduction of <Col N="1892" /> this Estimate by the Minister.  While his introductory statement was brief, it indicated the steps that are now being taken by the Department with a view to further progress in broadcasting both at home and for listeners abroad.  I am glad that this short-wave station has been taken in hands, because it is within my knowledge, from travels I have made, that many of our people in America and elsewhere are anxious to listen in to the Irish broadcasting station.  That was almost impossible up to the present because of the particular wavelength we have.</P>
      <P>During the brief debate we have had here, reference was made to the programme which is put over for the benefit of listeners at home, and, to a certain extent, of listeners across the water.  It is very difficult to cater for all the different types of listeners, and to ensure that everybody will be satisfied with a particular item.  I have heard very many people express great interest in the feature called &ldquo;Question Time&rdquo;, but I have heard the complaint made by some people that the time at which that feature is broadcast is rather too late, because a great number of people listen to and enjoy &ldquo;Question Time&rdquo; and, in fact, participate to a great extent in the competition by endeavouring to answer the questions before the competitors.  It is only a very minor complaint, but the Minister might consider altering the time to a more suitable hour, so that young people can enjoy this feature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other speakers, and particularly Deputy Morrissey, seemed to find fault with the increase in the hours of broadcasting devoted to classical music, and Deputy Morrissey, speaking with a knowledge of rural Ireland, seemed to suggest that the people were not concerned to any great extent with this type of music.  It is, as I say, impossible to cater satisfactorily for everybody and to ensure that there will be unanimous acceptance of everything coming over the radio.  I can assure the Minister that the care he has given to the matter of improving the standard of music and the improved programmes generally which he has helped to bring about have been received with great satisfaction certainly <Col N="1893" /> by listeners in the Dublin area.  It is not my intention, because I am not competent to do so, to suggest to him what types of programmes he should ask his officers to insist on and I do not intend to go into the question of how news is broadcast&mdash;whether it is good or bad&mdash;but as a listener, many of whose friends and constituents are also listeners, I know that, in comparison with the radio stations adjacent to us in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, we can be justly proud that our radio station is holding its own both in the matter of the type of programme and the quality of the programme put over.</P>
    <P>There is one other point which I think may concern the technicians of the Minister's Department.  I have had many complaints that in certain parts of Dublin the operation of certain types of machinery installed by business undertakings interferes with reception, and I am sure the Minister has had brought to his notice letters which appeared in the Press pointing out, with particular reference to the Ballsbridge district, that there is very severe interference from time to time. I do not know whether the Minister can do anything about it&mdash;whether he has powers or could get powers to compel these undertakings to take such measures as will obviate the oscillation which takes place&mdash;but I think he might look into the point. During the war years, we had a situation in which it was impossible to improve the machinery or implements of broadcasting, because of the impossibility of obtaining new machinery and spare parts, and I recognise, that during those years, the conventions with regard to wave-lengths were not strictly adhered to by the European nations in particular, because of war conditions or because it was not their policy to do so; but now that we are reaching a stage where it is possible to get improved equipment, the Minister ought to make sure that whatever equipment he gets will be the most up to date and the best available.  I understand that there is now very keen competition between the firms in various countries producing broadcasting equipment so that we ought to be able to make a choice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1894" /> Having followed the progress of this broadcasting station almost since its inception and having listened to the statements of every Minister and Parliamentary Secretary responsible for introducing the Estimate over the years, I feel that we have gradually developed from the very primitive conditions which existed when we first introduced broadcasting here and have progressed very favourably.  I hope that the Minister will continue to give his personal attention to the broadcasting station in the future as he has done in the past.</P>

      <P>There are one or two matters in the Minister's speech which I should like to have cleared up, but, before proceeding to ask questions with regard to them, I should like to say that, in the last few years, I have noticed an improvement in the standard of the programmes of Radio Éireann.  I do not say that, in all the circumstances, they are what we individually would like them to be, but still I think an effort is being made to improve the quality of these broadcasts which I think has succeeded and is succeeding.  I commend the Minister for that.  I am very pleased to notice that in this year's Estimate provision is made for an increase in the symphony orchestra.  As a lover of symphony music, I am afraid my views on that matter cannot, perhaps, be taken as representative of those of the general public and I hesitate to put them forward.  But I do think that any increase in the quality of the orchestras in Radio Éireann will meet with the approval of what I might call enlightened public opinion.  While <Col N="1895" /> there may be people who prefer céilidhe bands or dance music of any sort, I am glad to say that the thoughtful section of the public are being catered for.  I have been going to classical concerts for about 20 years. I commenced to go to them when I was fairly young.  I did not go to many during the war years.  After a lapse of some years, I went to one recently and I was greatly struck by the number of young people present. When I first went to classical concerts, all the people present were middle-aged or elderly.  Now, as far as I can judge, the audiences are mainly composed of young people.  From the musical point of view, that is hopeful and it is a factor which anybody who is planning programmes for a broadcasting station should take into consideration. It has a very great bearing on the types of programmes which should be arranged.  I am glad to say that the Minister is realising the place classical music takes in any educated community.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that he is about to inaugurate in the autumn of this year a short-wave, foreign broadcasting station.  I should like him to explain in somewhat greater detail exactly what he means by a foreign broadcasting station.  He did use the words: &ldquo;North American&rdquo; and, in this country, we are apt to regard foreign broadcasts as North American.  I should like to see our station also catering for Europe.  We should remember that there are many other countries than America&mdash;France, Italy, Germany, Spain and Switzerland, for example&mdash;and that there are audiences in those countries who would, no doubt, be interested to hear Irish views and comments and who would like to get to know something of Irish matters. That would require, of course, a foreign section in our broadcasting service.  It would, probably, require a good deal more expansion than the Minister has envisaged.  It is not quite so simple as broadcasting to North America and I should like to have the views of the Minister on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if we are mainly thinking of North America and the English-speaking <Col N="1896" /> portions of the world as the recipients of our broadcasting items, I commend this to the consideration of the Minister&mdash;that it is not solely, or even mainly, because of Irish news and Irish views our programmes will be listened to and will be a success.  They will be listened to mainly on account of our comments and our attitude to world affairs generally.  I should like to mention to the Minister, in that connection, a small newspaper in the United States which is well-known but the name of which I cannot recall.  This newspaper, through the excellence of its comments, on international affairs and on affairs in America, built up a coast-to-coast circulation amongst enlightened people. As a result of the excellence of its editorial comments, it became indispensable to any person who wished to be <i>au fait</i> with American news.  I should like that ideal to be held in front of our foreign broadcasting service.  Otherwise, we run the risk of falling into the foolish error of just putting out our own news and not being listened to. People will listen to our own news through their interest in what we have to say about what is news to them. That presupposes that we have in the station a competent editorial staff, able to deal with foreign news services and, above all, able to comment on them in an interesting fashion, and, naturally, with an Irish mind.  We cannot, and do not wish to, have them commented upon with anything else.  We should go to very great trouble to build up an organisation which will be a credit to the country.  I cannot go into the details but I should like to hear the reaction of the Minister to a proposal such as that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>When consideration of this Estimate was adjourned last night, I was offering a suggestion which is, more or less, confirmed by what Deputy Dockrell has said.  I was suggesting that, since we are going in for world-wide broadcasting, through the medium of a short-wave station, and since we shall be compelled to broadcast a considerable amount of Irish news and, as Deputy Dockrell suggests, Irish comments upon world news, it is essential we should not permit our broadcasting <Col N="1897" /> station to be a Party station.  It should be national in the widest sense of the word.  That is why I suggested that we should have, either controlling the station or as an advisory committee to the Director, an all-Party committee which would ensure that it would not be the narrow Party view which would be put across to the world by the various announcers and commentators on world events.</P>
      <P>There are two dangers in connection with this world-wide broadcast.  One is that we may put nothing out but the narrow Party view&mdash;the view of the Party which happens to be in power at the moment&mdash;and the other is that we may leave control of the whole service to a Government Department which will feel itself tongue-tied by reason of its natural fear of offending any Party in the State.  In either case, I think that the service would be a flop and a failure.  When giving a fairly comprehensive review of passing events in this country, you are always likely to touch upon matters of a contentious nature. There is need for a committee, composed of representatives of all Parties, who may have the time and the energy to devote themselves to making this service as good as it can be made.  A short-wave station enabling us to speak to the plain people of Great Britain, North America and the English-speaking world and people with Irish associations and connections everywhere, is of immense value.  In the last century, when it was considered desirable to state the Irish case, we sent representatives to the British House of Commons, to use that institution as a sounding board to express our opinions and to state our case before the world.  Now, through this short-wave station, we have in many ways a more effective sounding board to express the views of the Irish people and bring to the world real news of Ireland and her affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The council which I suggest is one of the ways out of the difficulty which I foresee in making that policy effective. It will be necessary to launch a publicity campaign in support of national unity, pleading Ireland's case and making the people of Great Britain in particular see how advantageous it <Col N="1898" /> would be to do justice to this country by the removal of the Border.  I remember a story of a man who was very addicted to strong drink and who eventually was induced to become a total abstainer.  A friend asked him how he was getting on and he said: &ldquo;This total abstinence may be very good for my poor soul, but I am afraid it is going to be the ruination of my poor body.&rdquo;  Now, there is no use in telling the British people that national unity here may be good for their souls, as it means righting a wrong of the past.  It will be necessary also to make them see that it will be in their material interests to do justice to this country.  That is a function which can be performed admirably by this broadcasting service.</P>
    <P>We should also use the power and influence which this station will give us to combat the advance of communism, not only here but amongst our own people in Great Britain.  It will be a terrible disgrace to our nation if people of our race, who have been driven to Britain to seek a livelihood, are dragged into the foul communist organisations which are seeking to attract their support.  We must plead with our people to stand by the tradition of Christian outlook on social matters.  In that way, we will be doing a service both to the Irish race and to the entire world.</P>
    <P>It is frequently said that this Dáil, being a cross-section of the people, can be a useful advisory committee to the Minister in the matter of preparing programmes generally.  There is a great deal in that, but this Dáil, as an advisory committee, has its shortcomings. Deputies, by reason of their vocation or occupation, have not much time for listening in.  Very many Deputies are away from home for the greater part of their time; they have not much time to turn on the radio at home and very little opportunity of hearing it elsewhere.  We might not be such a representative cross-section of the community as you would find in a parish hall or town hall meeting.  The Minister should know what the ordinary people want in regard to programmes and should have some idea as to what the people would listen to <Col N="1899" /> and what they will turn off.  I often wonder if it would not be possible, on occasions such as &ldquo;Question Time&rdquo; in various towns in the provinces, to have an inquiry as to the kind of programme the people want.  It is possible also to send out a questionnaire to listeners, but very often a representative number of people do not reply to such a questionnaire.  Frequently, when Deputies say here what is right and what is wrong in regard to a programme, they may feel very strongly on the matter, but they are expressing nothing more than their own personal opinion, and that differs with every listener.</P>

    </P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two guiding rules which the Minister might accept.  When broadcasting, you are speaking to people for the most part in the living rooms of their own homes.  The kind of programme that would be very successful in a hall or theatre is very often unsatisfactory when heard at home.  That is true even of opera.  You can listen to grand opera in a theatre, but when you get it in your own home it is not so grand. You can listen to a band playing on a promenade or in some public place or at some public function, but very often a loud, noisy band is not very pleasant in your own home.  In the same way, plays which may go down well in a theatre or village hall may not sound half so good when broadcast, since people do not want loud noise, loud sounds, yells, shouts, wails, moans and such noises in their own homes.  They very seldom attract either sympathy or hearing.  While drama is very good and very desirable on the wireless, the ordinary human being will always plead for a good story&mdash;and a good story told through the medium of drama is always attractive. I am afraid that most of our playwrights in the last 40 or 50 years, following the bad example of George Bernard Shaw, O'Casey and others, have concentrated on caricaturing the Irish character completely, and of presenting our people in the worst possible light.  In most of the plays written by <Col N="1900" /> Irish writers we have no heroes and no heroines.  The overwhelming majority of the characters portrayed are villains of some sort.  For the most part, they are undesirable characters.  Some years ago I had to endure the pain of listening to a broadcast of <i>The Playboy of the Western World.</i>  I was shocked at that presentation of alleged Irish life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not the first man who was shocked at that.  I remember being shocked at it 30 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not seem to have changed very much since then, because in my opinion <i>The Playboy of the Western World</i> seems to dominate the minds of nearly all who sit down to write an Irish play.  You have in most of those plays the same coarse type of peasantry portrayed&mdash;vulgar, mean, cunning and loathsome in many respects.  We had a similar type of play presented over the wireless last Sunday.  I forget the name of it, but that does not matter.  The characters were of such a despicable type that they would not be tolerated anywhere. One would not like to have to live with the type of people portrayed in that play.  Is that absolutely necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have every sympathy with the Minister because it is probably true to say that the playwrights have failed to provide any other type of material.  I think that if they have failed to provide any decent kind of play, suitable for presentation over the radio, we should go to other countries and see if their playwrights can provide us with suitable plays.  There is no use in presenting caricatures of our people either to our listeners at home or abroad.  I have no objection to a caricature of the Irish people in a comedy or a farce because the intention there is simply to provide a laugh.  It does not matter in what country a comedy or a farce is produced, we know that the characters are exaggerated and that nobody takes them seriously.  Nobody, for example, takes Charley Chaplin as being representative of a London citizen.  There is no objection to exaggeration in comedy, because that is what you expect.  In the case, however, of a serious play, if nothing is represented in it but unsentin <Col N="1901" /> pleasant characters and what is evil, and if these characters are represented as being Irish people&mdash;peasants for the most part&mdash;well, you are simply insulting your listeners and annoying people who have not given you any offence.</P>
    <P>I remember two old farmers who were dear old comrades all their lives. They met night after night in each other's house and had long discussions on politics, the weather an so on. Eventually, one of them died.  When the other poor old chap came to the wake and was taken to the room below the kitchen where his old friend was being waked, he stood for some time looking at him and said: &ldquo;Oh, all our crooked and contrary arguments are over now&rdquo;.  In saying that, he was expressing regret for the one thing which he had enjoyed most in life&mdash; the companionship of his friend and the intellectual arguments in which they used to engage.  What I want to impress on the Minister is that the ordinary people listening to the wireless would like to hear more crooked and contrary arguments.  They would like to hear two people engage in a discussion on some contentious matter.  It might be the Taoiseach&mdash;&ldquo;the greatest man that Ireland has produced&rdquo;&mdash;or some other question.  Let two get at it and debate it.  I think that we do not get enough of that kind of dialogue over the wireless, one reason being that it is very hard to get anybody to write that kind of stuff.  Another reason is that when a person sits down to write for or against some contentious proposal, he usually weights the argument in favour of his own point of view.  If a member of Fianna Fáil were writing a dialogue for a discussion on the question as to whether the Taoiseach was or was not the greatest man that Ireland every produced he would make the person opposing the proposition appear very weak in his argument.  What I suggest is that the Minister should get two people to write the script, one for one side and the other for the other side.  Let each argument be short and concise, just like the ordinary conversation or dispute that one may hear at a cross-roads. If that were done this service would be providing very good education <Col N="1902" /> and entertainment for the listening public.  It would also provide a lively argument in which neither side would be pulling their punches.</P>
    <P>Another feature that should be introduced into our broadcasting service is the production of comedies and sketches.  Comedy dialogue can also be very attractive and would be appreciated by listeners.  We do not always want the heavy stuff.  You could also give educational stuff in the form of a dialogue between two persons on, for example, what type of fertiliser is best for the land.  We have had discussions in the public Press as to whether or not fertilisers should be used at all. Another question that might be debated is, what is the best breed of cattle for the country.  Let that question be debated in an earnest and not in a half-hearted way.  The old gentleman to whom I referred earlier longed for a contrary argument.  Man is a warring animal and likes a fight. We indulge our liking for a fight in various ways, sometimes not very desirable ways and sometimes very desirable, for example, when we go to a football match to see two rival teams engaged, each striving to prove itself the better team on the football field. In the same way we would like to hear two contestants fight out over the wireless some difficult or contentious question.</P>
    <P>In broadcasting to the world there are many things to which we could draw attention of people in other countries.  There are many people who regard this country as a land of mud cabins and of barefooted colleens wearing shawls.  It would be no harm to broadcast enlightened and informative statements on current events in this country.  Our people in other lands would like a description of our principal sporting events, of our national activities, of the condition of agriculture and how it is carried on on up-to-date farms, of our industries.  There are thousands of people in other countries who would like to listen to an intimate discourse on Guinness' Brewery or other Irish industries. Such broadcasts would benefit this country by teaching people abroad <Col N="1903" /> that we are not a backward peasantry living in primitive conditions.  They would let the people know that we are a progressive young nation striving to advance and to regulate our progress according to sound national and Christian principles.  That would help to create favourable public opinion to this country and there is no country that can afford to ignore world opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It bespeaks a noble affluence of literary riches when Deputy Cogan, with one sweep of his hand, deposits Shaw, Synge and O'Casey in the wastepaper basket. That is the spirit in which I like to hear Deputy Cogan.  When he goes on expressing extreme solicitude for what the residents of the Bowery or White-chapel think of our cultural state, I think he is mistaken.  I do not give a fiddle-dee-dee what Jugo-Slavia or Oklahoma or the back streets of Glasgow think of the cultural condition of our mind.  There is an old saying that good wine needs no bush and if our cultural qualities are so sensational as to justify the casual shedding of Shaw, Synge and O'Casey as so much worthless dross, Deputy Cogan need not worry; if we never had a wireless mast in Ireland, the Seven Seas would be darkened with ships bearing investigators to our shores.  We would be a shining light amongst the intellects of the world without any propaganda to tell the neighbourhood how wonderful we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see the proceedings of this Dáil broadcast all day, every day, that we sat.  I would like to see it broadcast on a special wave-length different from the ordinary one employed by Radio Éireann so that all we say and do would be available to the people of this country to listen to and judge for themselves.  I would like that for two reasons.  I think the nearer a free people are brought to their own Parliament the more they will treasure it as a citadel of liberty. That is the primary reason that I want our people here in Ireland to hear what we are doing here all the time whenever they want to listen.  But, although I would never make it my primary purpose, <Col N="1904" /> I think that in the back of my mind I would like to have it broadcast so that those who wanted to listen would hear all that was passing because then a great many people would realise that this deliberative Assembly to which we belong, with all its faults, is one of the best Parliaments at present functioning in the world.</P>
    <P>It has become fashionable in this country to suggest that the proceedings of Dáil Éireann lack dignity or lack lucidity or lack relevance.  But has it ever struck Deputies of this House that if there is the slightest contretemps in this House it becomes a matter of news in Great Britain and even in the United States?  Have we ever asked ourselves why?  If there is a scene in the corridors of the Chamber of Deputies in Paris, if there is a fracas in the House of Commons, if there is a violent exchange in the House of Representatives in Washington, it is not news.  That is the dog biting the man.  When that kind of thing happens here, that is the man biting the dog. That is why I would like our people to be able to listen for themselves all the time to what was passing in this House, so that they might know how their work was being done, so that if they felt at any time that criticisms of this House were such as to shake their faith in Parliaments, they could say: &ldquo;Let us put that to the test. Let us listen to our own Parliament for a test period, knowing that it is not for that Parliament a choice time, because they have to function in the presence of the radio all the time, and that they are not on their best behaviour between 4 and 6 every afternoon but that, whether we start listening at 3 or at 10 o'clock at night, we hear it doing the same kind of job as it does every day in addition to the other work that its members habitually undertake for those they represent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that that is something worth thinking over.  Remember, the best method of defence is attack.  The most unpopular opponent that tyranny has is a free Parliament.  Tyrants do not achieve their tyranny by hiding their light under a bushel.  They hold <Col N="1905" /> parades.  They show themselves.  They surround themselves with throngs and glory and bands and demonstrations. I am quite prepared to match all that panoply wherever it is shown, in Moscow or Berlin, with the plain work-a-day, perhaps drab, atmosphere of a democratic Parliamentary function.  I think our people, like the British people, the American people, and, I believe, the French people, the Swiss people, the Dutch people, the Belgian people, the Scandinavian people, given these two things will choose the citadel of truth.  Our only danger is that by consistently depriving people of their right to listen in and hear what is going on and giving it to those who hate Parliament and all it stands for (1) the right to show their light from the highest eminence they can find to stand upon, and (2) the right to slander and misrepresent Parliament continually without ever letting Parliament answer for itself, we are not doing our part.  I want to defend this Institution by attacking those who tear it down.  I am quite confident we will require no more formidable attack than to let in the light on ourselves and upon them.</P>
    <P>I notice we are going to have a new personnel in Radio Éireann which will be primarily responsible for short-wave broadcasting.  I notice the Director of the station is expected to retire shortly, but I cannot find any reference in the Minister's statement to the steps he contemplates taking to fill the post of Director when Mr. Ó Braonáin's term is over.  I wonder what does this new personnel and short-wave station presage.  I notice it largely consists of the Taoiseach's old guard.  Is this short-wave programme going to be engaged on propaganda for this country or on a series of programmes to demonstrate the fact that Deputy Cogan suggests might be a subject of argument &mdash; that the Taoiseach is the greatest man that ever was born.  I see some of my friends rallying to the service of Radio Éireann short-wave station who, by their past performance, would lead one to believe that they were reared to proclaim that the Taoiseach is the greatest man who <Col N="1906" /> ever was born.  More than half the people of this country do not agree with that proposition, yet they are contributing to the taxes that are paid to the station.  Of course, if the station is used to that end, measures, and effective measures, will have to be taken to ensure that that usage is rendered nugatory.  I want to put this to the Minister as a member of the Government: I have got a horrible kind of feeling that this short-wave station is going to be used for the purpose of creating in the United States of America the idea that we have a kind of Irish fifth column there and that if the Administration of the day do not do what we think they ought to do we can put on the heat and speak to the Irish in America.  Do many Deputies in this House ever ask themselves why it is that we get a little hot under the collar when we meet the Ascendancy in this country?  It is not because they are old, it is not because they are ugly, it is not because the women have big feet or the men have drooping moustaches.  It is because they are not at home here.  They always feel themselves to have a kind of domestic-interest outside the country.  If they were not so utterly ineffective, one might almost think of them as an English fifth column.  Of course that would be silly.  In fact, they are museum pieces and as such they are very precious&mdash;like old china or pewter mugs.  But if they were not, by the passage of time, reduced to that antiquarian quality that fifth column element in their make-up would justify their unpopularity.  Does the Minister's Government imagine that people of Irish birth or extraction in the United States of America desire to be held up before their fellow-countrymen in the United States as an Irish fifth column in America?  Does the Minister imagine that people of Irish birth or extraction in America want to have it suggested, even by implication, that their actions in the United States are to be conditioned by what we in Ireland want them to do?  I warn the Minister and his Government that if anything of that kind is attempted, quite apart from the bitter and justifiable resentment that it would create <Col N="1907" /> in Washington, throughout the whole gamut of Irish-American opinion, as they used to call it, it would cause the most acute embarrassment and distress, because our people, or those we used to call our people in America, do not want to be looked upon by their neighbours as hyphenated Americans. They do not like the term Irish-Americans, any more than others like to be called German-American, or Italian-American.  They are Americans. The fact that their name happens to be McCarthy, O'Brien, Dillon or Cosgrave is something of which they are proud.  They know the stock was good.  But being proud of the origin of your stock is quite a different proposition from allowing it to be suggested that that origin gives rise to divided loyalty.</P>
    <P>Just imagine the reaction of our people if the British Government addressed the people of English extraction in its country and asked them to unite to bring pressure to bear upon the Irish Government to do so-and-so. I would be inclined to say to those people who are living here: &ldquo;Look here, let us get this straight. Are you citizens of this country, or are you not?  If you wish to live here as aliens, there is a law under which you can live here; but if you wish to live here as citizens, let us hear no more of this business of a foreign Government addressing you as to what you should do or should not do in the internal political life of your country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder very much indeed if this plan to erect a short-wave radio directed to the United States of America on which propaganda about Partition, Irish propaganda, is to be disseminated is a good idea.  I doubt it.  It was one thing during the war, when there was censorship, when there was interruption of communication, and when a situation might arise when one community would get completely cut off from another, to resort to any device to bridge the chasm between us; but it is a different thing in normal times for the Irish Government to claim the right to address a section of the American people.  I think it is a <Col N="1908" /> mistake and will do more harm than good.</P>
    <P>I am bound to say that I believe the thing is largely cod, because the real explanation of the short-wave station is that the Taoiseach wants to go on a trip to America.  He has been yearning for that ever since he became Taoiseach.  He wants to get a good reception, and, at the moment, Mrs. Buckley's boys are more active in America than his boys.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the station is for, because Robert Brennan has been brought back from America to sound the Taoiseach's praises over the radio.  That is the whole purpose of this cod.  I venture to swear that five years from to-day, when the rabbits start playing leap-frog below in Rineanna, the masts which are to direct the radio to the United States of America will be converted into knitting machines to knit the wool off the rabbits from Rineanna.  By that time either the Taoiseach will have had his trip to America and his boop-a-doop there, or Mrs. Buckley's boys will have made it clear that, radio or no radio, he had better stay at home.  If that is the reason&mdash;well, the Americans are no fools.  They understand that kind of codology well enough.  But, if it were intended to use this station for the purpose of insolent, impudent intervention in the domestic affairs of the United States by campaigns which might be represented in America as being designed to affect the Irish vote in the year of a Presidential election, remember that the big, quiet, gentle creature is tough when he is aroused. The quietest, gentlest creature in the world at the moment is the United States of America and do not rouse him, because he can be mighty tough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How many people inside or outside this country or America ever listen in on the short-wave?  I have one of those radio sets with seven buttons, six of them for various short-wave bands and one for Radio Éireann and the B.B.C. I have not pushed in one of the short-wave buttons for nine months. <Col N="1909" /> Is there anyone in the House ever listens on the short-wave?  I used to listen to a man named Moffat, who broadcast gramophone records from Newry and I found I could get a better reception on the Aberdeen wave-length. Apart from that, I never used it.  Does anybody use it?  Do Deputies picture the Irish in the United States plugging in to this on the short-wave?  I do not. I think that as a result of this enterprise we may get none of the advantages we anticipate because the kind of people we would like to think will listen to it will not listen to it.  They will, in fact, listen to the incomparably superior programmes made available by the immensely wealthy corporations in America night and day rather than to what we can send out over the short-wave, the reception of which will be very doubtful.  The only people who will listen to it are the people who may make mischief and we will have to pay for it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan thought we should broadcast to every country in Europe. How often did he listen to the Danish radio, the Norwegian radio, the Swiss radio, the Belgian radio or the Dutch radio in the course of the last six months?  If he does not listen to them, why does he expect them to listen to us?  Deputy Briscoe was talking a moment ago about the impressions one gathers as one travels around the world.  The striking impression I got from going round the world was that a number of people did not know where this country was at all.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether you would describe them as plain people.  I would not care to do so.  I think they were rather well-chosen. Most of the friends I had were interesting and charming people, but it was quite a revelation to realise that many ordinary people walking the roads of <Col N="1910" /> the Continent of Europe and elsewhere, when you tell them that you came from Ireland, will either sympathise deeply with you for having to live in such a place or else ask you where Ireland was.  Iceland seems to be a much better known region than this country&mdash;I suppose it is its association with ice.  I do not mean to say nobody knows where we are.  The vast majority of people do, but it is surprising the number who do not even know where this country is.  I see Deputies shaking their heads in shocked horror, but I would like to ask some of the head-shakers where Lithuania is and I bet you it would put them to the pin of their collar to tell me.  It is surprising how many respectable citizens in this country expect all the world to know where Ireland is, but they are not in the least surprised to discover that they have not the foggiest notion themselves about the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>The Minister has decided to allow a certain amount of advertising time on the radio.  I never could make up my mind for or against that, but on balance I think I am for it.  Kept within reason, it brings in revenue and very often these firms provide a very pleasant programme.  I do not mind their having permission to use a certain percentage of their time for proclaiming the virtue of their wares, but it is going a bit far if a whole hour is to be devoted to reading out numbers.  One time last year after one of the Sweep-stakes I think they spent a week reading out the numbers of the winning tickets.  They cut that down substantially this year, but I question the propriety of permitting the whole of any evening or any broadcast period purchased by an advertiser to be used exclusively for the purpose of proclaiming wares.  I think the Minister should consider mentioning to the persons who take the time that they must adhere rigidly to a general regulation that only a percentage of the time purchased is to be used for proclaiming wares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell mentioned that 25 years ago, when he started to go to symphony concerts, the audiences looked old and venerable, whereas nowadays everyone attending these concerts looks fresh and young.  That <Col N="1911" /> is the common experience of all of us when we advance into middle age.  I have in recent times stood at the street corners in consternation at the spectacle of beardless boys in the uniform of the Civic Guard, whereas in my young days the police were venerable gentlemen in whom you might repose the utmost confidence.  Unfortunately, one comes to realise that there comes a day in the lives of us all when the Civic Guard or the bus driver is younger than we are.  There was a time, of course, when such a thing was quite unthinkable.  I hope Deputy Dockrell is right in believing that the younger generation are taking a greater interest in music, symphony music, than the people of 25 years ago.  The next time he goes to the Royal Dublin Society I would invite him to look around and ask himself, had he seen this company five and twenty years ago, would he have thought of them all as bright young people or as venerable people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell says we ought to afford Europe an opportunity of hearing our views.  I think I have dealt with that.  I believe if we afforded them that opportunity, nobody would listen or have the slightest interest in our broadcast. I do not think anybody from Southampton to Singapore gives two hoots in Hades what we think.  The idea of the Russians listening in to a broadcast from the radio here is, to my mind, quite fantastic.  There may be certain persons there who take a special political or other interest in this country and for that reason they might take care to locate our station, but the idea that they would all hang upon our words is to my mind quite fantastic.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the following matters as being proper additions to our programmes.  I think it is a great mistake to provide a concert on occasions in this country consisting exclusively of Irish traditional music, or of something that is peculiarly indigenous to this country, but I think it is equally incongruous that, if we go to the trouble of organising a concert of symphony music, we should not from time to time, as these occasions present themselves, incorporate into <Col N="1912" /> the programme traditional music, such as that which is for me forever represented by Marcella Hurley singing &ldquo;Bean Dubh a Gleanna&rdquo;, and harp music.</P>
    <P>As regards harp music, everybody does not like harp music, but I think it is in some sense indigenous to this country.  Again, I think it would be worth while on occasions having a concert of music of Irish composers.  I think, also, it would be gratifying not only to us at home, but to many abroad, if a concert of music rendered by famous Irish artistes was provided. As to that last suggestion, it could be very easily done, not in very solemn form, but by a carefully devised and chosen gramophone record recitative of quite an incidental character, without making any hullaballoo about it.</P>
    <P>Lastly, and I do not mean this should be done every night and all day, but occasionally, the poetry of this country, not excluding Anglo-Irish poetry, the contemptible contributions of such persons as Deputy Cogan so ruthlessly condemned, recited by Irish voices.  It is not everyone, I suppose, in this House who has had the experience of living in exile for a time, but there is something peculiarly gratifying and exciting in hearing Irish voices, but not necessarily a West Cork accent that would lift the hat off your head, though that can be charming.  I have heard it ringing through the Grand Central Station in New York, when it was like a draught of wine to hear it. The man who used is was very angry when I asked him if he came from Cork.  He said he had not been there for 30 years and did not know he had any accent.  The Irish voice&mdash;dare I say it in this citadel of the plain man&mdash; the cultivated Irish voice, reading Irish poetry is something, if it did penetrate the outer ether, that could be very welcome to our people, not because it moved them to heroic effort or to violent agitation but just because it made them think of home.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Cogan that short and informal debates, among recognised authorities on current topics, would be of great interest to a considerable body of our people, but I think to make them really interesting, <Col N="1913" /> they must be topical.  They must relate to matters which for the time being engage the public mind.  If we could bring to our radio in discussion or in some programme analogous to the Brains Trust in England, such persons as Crowther, the inimitable Alfred O'Rahilly, a Frenchman or a distinguished American.  I think it would be very valuable and interesting.  Sometimes it might be done by way of having two persons conduct a discussion, though in my experience I find such discussions sound pretty stilted. Unless they are organised on the lines of the Brains Trust they do not appear to be very spontaneous.  However, the satisfactory arrangement of such a plan should not surpass the skill of our technical staff.  Provided the subjects are topical and provided the persons taking part in them are really first-class, I believe the programme could be much enhanced by the inclusion of such items.</P>
    <P>I want to join with other Deputies in expressing the opinion that I think the programmes of Radio Éireann are improving.  For a Minister with such an infinity of patience as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, I think he is deserving of special credit.  The incubus of patience under which he labours is being stoutly borne in regard to Radio Éireann.  It would be wrong to withhold that tribute of praise.  I warmly felicitate the Minister on his decision to augment the orchestra.  I am not so sure that his repertory theatre plans are the best way of approaching the matter.  I think it might probably have been better if the existing repertory theatres had received some kind of grant to help them, on condition that they offered to the station a certain number of performances in the year. I am afraid that the repertory company in Radio Éireann will be&mdash;we have an Irish word for it&mdash;&ldquo;bacach&rdquo;.  However, time will tell.  I should like to see those repertory companies which start of their own volition getting a look in.</P>
    <P>Subject to these observations, and with very special reference to the note of caution I have sounded in regard to broadcasts directed to <Col N="1914" /> America, I have nothing to add but beware lest Radio Éireann should present our people in America in the light of fifth columnists.  They will not like that; the American people will not like it.  It is not true and it would have most disastrous repercussions upon this country if that impression were to spread abroad.  We are proud to have their friendship and even their affection.  We in this country would think ill of them if they had any allegiance comparable with their allegiance to America.  Knowing them as we know them, we speak to them in the knowledge and on the assumption that, as between America and Ireland, they have chosen America and in every conceivable contingency would do the same again.  There is no other basis on which they may be properly addressed and it is a matter of urgent and vital importance that nobody should ever make the mistake of forgetting that for a single moment, so far as this country is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points which I should like to bring to the Minister's notice concerning matters upon which I have heard some comments down the country.  The first is connected with the conclusion of the night broadcast on Wednesdays of each week.  Of course news from foreign parts is very interesting to many people; music, horse racing and golf are interesting to other people; but there is one item which is given at the end of the news broadcast on every occasion in which a big number of our people are interested, a section of our people who are looked upon as being worthy of note at any time of crisis such as that through which we are passing at the moment, namely, the agricultural community.  Many of them consider that they are entitled to have this item of news brought more to the forefront.  I refer to the report of the Dublin Cattle Market and I wish to bring that point to the Minister's notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the speeches here, I heard Deputy Dillon suggest that it would be advisable if the proceedings of this House were broadcast.  I hope the Minister will not accede to a senseless suggestion of that kind.  Of course <Col N="1915" /> a section of the Deputy's followers in the country, a very small one, would be anxious to hear the Deputy exercising his oratorical powers in this House but I think they would probably be much better employed in attending to their ordinary duties at home.  Of course what applies to the Deputy applies also to a number of other members of the House.  A number of their camp followers would be glad to listen to them but, again, I think that in doing so they would be wasting valuable time.  I think it was the most nonsensical suggestion ever made in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to hear some statement from the Minister which would indicate the future policy of Radio Éireann.  So far as I can see, the broadcasting station has been drifting along for a number of years with small additions here and there but in general there is no settled policy. Reading the Minister's statement one can only say that it is dull and drab, lacks imagination and is in general indicative of a policy which, so far as broadcasting is concerned, shows no clear-cut lines of thought or no clearcut views on broadcasting in general. It may be that the cause of that is the fact that the broadcasting station is the same, or almost the same, now, as when it was set up here in 1926 and that, with some small modifications, with the exception of a limited quantity of new equipment put in there from time to time, the facilities generally are the same as they were when the station was founded.  Wireless and everything connected with it in the past 20 years, particularly in recent years, has made very rapid strides, and the equipment and buildings deemed suitable 20 years ago are entirely inadequate for present-day requirements.  That being so, I think the Government and the Minister should consider some longer policy, some policy with a wider view, some policy which will give those charged with the responsibility of broadcasting better opportunities to make use of their talents and the talents available. So far as my information goes, the present buildings are entirely inadequate for modern requirements in <Col N="1916" /> broadcasting, and, consequently, the station and Radio Éireann in general, while it has shown some considerable improvement, is far from having the standard of efficiency of stations abroad which we are in a position to listen to.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that it might be advisable to take broadcasting out of the control of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It may be that a proposal of that kind would involve setting up a separate independent company.  I do not see any substantial objection to such a course.  In fact, if there is one case in which an independent company or body could be set up and in which it might have desirable results, it is this, where we could get an independent body charged with responsibility not merely for news but for all programmes, and in that way the radio would be expected to show some independence.  At present the news in particular is bad, the news service of Radio Éireann is bad.  Anyone who lives within 50 miles of Dublin, or even at a greater distance, can get in the evening papers practically all the news given by Radio Éireann, with the possible exception of some late local news or late Dáil reports.  With these exceptions, the news is either a rehash of the news available in the evening papers or of the news available from the B.B.C.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see why we should not make use of the services of a news agency. There may be objection to broadcasting directly news received from other countries, but surely we can engage the services of one of these news agencies, and, as is done by other stations, attribute the particular news to the agency.  In that way, Radio Éireann will in no way be saddled with responsibility for disseminating that news or for the accuracy or general tone of that news.  The people, at any rate, will be in a position to get news which at present is denied them.  In so far as most listeners are concerned, if they want wider world news, they can get it by listening to the B.B.C., where they will get a fuller description of world news.  If we are broadcasting a news service, I do not see why we should not undertake to broadcast <Col N="1917" /> some of the reports which these news agencies make available.  In that way, Radio Éireann could give a far better news service than it is giving.  Certain local information can only be given over the local station, and it must present a much fuller picture of local conditions than any news agency could possibly give, but until quite recently, and even at present, local news as given over the radio, with the exception of certain cities and big towns, is defective, and, in so far as the country in general is concerned, matters of serious note which should be reported are rarely reported until the following day.  With the rapid transport of news-papers nowadays, it is possible to read these items earlier than one can hear them over the radio.</P>
    <P>On the general question of what the public should hear, or what we should ask the station to broadcast to the public, I think that, taking it generally, the Dáil might give as accurate an indication of the public needs in the matter as any other body, but, on the other hand, there is no reason why what a Deputy says here, merely because he is in a position to say it in the Dáil, should carry any greater weight, in relation to entertainment, than what the ordinary citizen, who makes his views known to the Radio Director, may say and the ordinary citizen's views should be given consideration equal to that given to a Deputy's speech, except perhaps when public matters are in question.  For that reason, I do not think it entirely fair that, on the entertainment side, views should be vigorously canvassed here in such a way as to suggest that because Deputies are in a position to voice their opinion on matters of entertainment and matters of topical interest, their views should receive any more attention than is given, in the ordinary way, to the representations made by individuals, either in reply to questionnaires or any other inquiries the station may make.</P>
    <P>With regard to general policy and the guiding principles which influence the radio, I think that this is the place to make representations and to ventilate our opinions and the opinions <Col N="1918" /> which Deputies may glean from time to time from contact with their constituents. I should like to say that if there is one thing more than another which may damage this country abroad it is the complex that a large mass of people throughout the world is listening to Radio Éireann.  I think that some Deputies gravely exaggerate our importance and our influence, and I feel that the Government and certain organs which they have available to them and which they use, are inclined at times to exaggerate our importance and the number of people outside who listen to us.  Having said that, I must say that I do not want to imply that we should refuse to be influenced by public opinion outside, but, with the exception of America, England, a small percentage of French listeners and a small percentage of Spanish and Italian listeners, I think it is true to say that the world rarely listens. There is certainly only a very limited number throughout the rest of the world who listen to Radio Éireann.  It is nonsensical and displays a complete ignorance of world affairs for Deputies to imagine that there is an audience all over the rest of the world listening to Radio Éireann.  It is equally nonsensical to imagine that there is a vast audience in the United States.</P>
    <P>
      <i>An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.</i>
    </P>
    <P>There are large numbers of our people in America and, with the rapid rate of present emigration, there will be a large audience in England.  These people will be interested in our affairs but, with the exception of emigrants and the children of people of Irish extraction, it is true to say that the vast bulk of the people of the United States and England do not listen to Radio Éireann any more than we listen to broadcasting stations in America.  It is true that there are in America many people of Irish extraction and of Irish birth.  While these people may not listen as regularly as we should like, they do listen on occasion.  But anybody who has travelled even a small portion of the globe will recognise that other peoples are preoccupied with <Col N="1919" /> their own affairs.  No matter how interesting we may make our broadcasting service, they will have other matters to which they will attend.  Any statistics that have been compiled will show clearly that it is absurd to suggest that we have a vast listening audience in America or that we shall have such an audience.  The Deputy who said that a number of those people never heard of this country did not exaggerate.  The number of people who came to Europe during the war and who had never heard of this country was surprising.  It would be untrue to say that the majority of the American people never heard of this country, but quite large numbers who came to Europe recently had only a vague idea of where Ireland was and those who were not of Irish extraction were not greatly interested in conditions here.</P>
    <P>I should like to impress on the Minister and the broadcasting authorities that whatever information is given to our people in America should be accurate.  There should not be any of the Fianna Fáil window-dressing which goes on at times at Radio Éireann.  In future I should like that the questions and answers in the Dáil and the debates here be properly and effectively reported.  It is nonsensical, and it is degrading to Deputies, that, when a question is asked here, Radio Éireann reports that the Minister concerned said so-and-so in reply to a question.  One would think that the question was put by some mummified figure and that a wise, intelligent and far-seeing Minister gave the answer.  Our constituents are as much entitled to hear our names on the wireless as are the constituents of any Minister to hear his name.  It would not lengthen the programmes by more than five minutes if the names of the Deputies who put questions in the Dáil to which Ministers reply were mentioned.  I do not want to hear the childish answers from the Minister that there is not time to do that.  That excuse does not &ldquo;wash&rdquo; and, if it is the only explanation the Minister can give, I do not want to hear it.  We want accurate Dáil reports.  Most of the reports are jumbled, not through <Col N="1920" /> the fault of the reporters or the announcers, but owing to the way the reports are given to them by the news agencies.  Very often you listen to a report of a debate here.  You hear the initial speaker.  You continue listening and, after a considerable period, you find that somebody else's speech is being reported.  No later than last night, in the report of the debate regarding reflections on the Chair, the proposer of the motion was mixed up with the proposer of the amendment. Some care should be given to those reports.  Deputies who are sent here by their constituents should have equal rights with Ministers.  The constituents of Deputies are paying licence fees and are contributing to the revenue of the station.  They should be given an accurate, even if, owing to present restrictions, a concise report of the proceedings of this House.  If a Deputy puts a question, his name, at least, should be mentioned even if the actual terms of the question are not given. The name of the person to whom the Minister replies should be stated and listeners should not be left under the impression that he has replied to some mythical figure or to some automaton, operated by the pressing of a button.</P>
    <P>Subject to these remarks, I think that the station is, in the circumstances, doing well, but it should be appreciably improved.  Before we embark on a new short-wave station, we should make available to the personnel of Radio Éireann better facilities and improved conditions for broadcasting. Radio Éireann should be completely equipped and furnished with the facilities generally associated with a broadcasting station before we embark on a new venture.</P>

      <P>The Deputy made the point that, apart from our own people, we might not have an audience <Col N="1921" /> outside.  Anybody with a radio gets into the habit of finding out what programme is on.  If there is a good programme on, no matter from what country, you are inclined to switch on to that station.  I am putting this point as a matter of argument.  Considering the number of our people in the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia, a great many should be definitely anxious to hear our programmes. I think that it is going to be a great asset to the country to have a good short-wave station.  I thoroughly agree with some remarks made by Deputy Cogan.  He said that he would like to see Radio Éireann used more freely to bring public opinion to bear, particularly amongst our friends in other countries, on the wrong perpetrated on our country regarding Partition.</P>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the remarks of Deputy Cogan on that point.  Propaganda is used in every sphere from business to politics and for every vital matter in State or Church.  I do not see why we should not use our radio for this purpose. Deputy Dillon is a very cultured gentleman and I feel sorry that he should not use his brains to better advantage.  He implied to-day in his usual style that we might use the radio to interfere with the domestic affairs of the United States, or something to that effect.  He had spoken for a while on the subject of having the Dáil speeches broadcast. It was very nice to hear him making that statement, but subsequently he spoke about using our short-wave radio to interfere with the internal workings of another nation.  I hope the Minister will never consent to broadcast Dáil speeches when there are men standing up in the House representing a section of the Irish people and saying things like that.  We are only a simple people, only a small nation, just trying to keep our heads above the water, we are only a young Parliament trying to do our best and it is up to every Irishman, no matter what his political views may be to contribute some constructive policy when we are dealing with international affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our country is not so well known.  I have had experience of people coming into this country who had not known <Col N="1922" /> about it until until they came to Europe. The short-wave radio is another asset to us to bring our national point of view&mdash;not Party politics&mdash;before the people of the English-speaking world or those peoples who can understand what we want to say.  Down through the ages prior to radio, even in the case of the people who went away to other countries and tried to help our point of view, they have always been an asset to this nation.  Now, when we have radio, it should be used to the advantage of the country in an international way.</P>
    <P>No one can say that the programmes have not improved recently.  There has been a very fine improvement.  I agree also with Deputy Cogan that debates on topical subjects would be very much appreciated, especially by listeners who say they listened to so-and-so make a certain point and who can then discuss it.  That is responsible often for starting a controversy regarding the radio and I would like to see it more developed.  Other Deputies have spoken about the possibility of Radio Éireann giving a weather forecast in the morning.  I suppose that at some time in the future Radio Éireann will develop on those lines and become more up to date so as to give us more news in the forenoon.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, I welcome Radio Éireann extending to the short-waves. I would like to see the programmes as varied as possible and as entertaining as possible for our people.  The Minister seems to be the right man in the right place.  During his time in the Department he has been doing his job well and I hope he will continue to develop the station.  I know he is not the man to do it for Party purposes but for the development of the country, both nationally and internationally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had occasion last Friday night to listen in to the Radio Éireann news, deliberately for the purpose of seeing how the Dáil debates for that day would be treated.  I heard this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To-day in the Dáil the Minister for Finance announced that the Budget would be introduced on May 7th.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the end of the Dáil debates <Col N="1923" /> for last Friday.  Of course, the Taoiseach had been sitting sullenly silent all day and had not opened his mouth, therefore there had to be a complete suppression of all the views put forward by the Opposition on that day.  On the previous Friday&mdash;Friday is the only day I get a chance of listening to the Dáil debates&mdash;I had occasion to listen to the news also and I found this rather significant fact, that though we on this side of the House had spoken&mdash;several speakers from the Fine Gael Benches&mdash;all our speeches were eliminated.  It is a good while since I listened previously to reports of the Dáil, but these are two recent happenings which forcibly drive home to me that there is a political censorship in the news service and that presumably the Minister has issued instructions that there is not to be an objective review of the Dáil debates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not nonsense.  I am stating facts.  On these two successive Fridays, those are the facts and I challenge contradiction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an extraordinary coincidence that on these two successive Fridays the views on this side were suppressed.  If that is a practice, I want to say here and now that Radio Éireann is not the property of the Fianna Fáil Party or the Government or the personal property of the Minister to be used in any partisan or Party way.  It is the property of all citizens and particularly of those who subscribe for wireless licences.  There should not be any censorship of the debates here.  On the contrary, I strongly advocate a feature such as &ldquo;To-day in Parliament&rdquo; as is broadcast from the B.B.C. and which is given in a purely objective manner, giving above all the speeches from the various sides of the House of Commons.  They are given in reduced form but presumably they are an accurate précis of the speeches.  When a Deputy, particularly from this side of the House, is broadcast on Radio Éireann one or two sentences from an entire speech are taken, <Col N="1924" /> very often out of their context, and there is no effort whatever at a précis, with the result that when a Deputy listens in to himself he hears a most distorted version of what he said.  On the other hand, the Ministerial view-point is given verbatim.  The old practice which obtained heretofore of having the news bulletin broadcast lodged in the Library for the perusal of Deputies should be reintroduced.  It is clear from the two instances I mentioned that political censorship does prevail.  Whether or not the Minister has given instructions on this point I do not know, but I hope that, if the debates are to be broadcast, everyone who speaks from any side of the House will be reported objectively, and that a fair précis of what he says will be given.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave has mentioned a matter which, I think, is of considerable importance, that is, the control of broadcasting and the desirability of considering an alternative method of control.  I do not agree with the present system of control.  I am giving my own personal views on this point. I think that control by the Minister of a Government, particularly a Government which is inclined to view most matters in a partisan spirit and light, is improper.  I think, too, that Civil Service control exercised under the authority of such a Minister, is also not a system of control which is likely to give the best results to the public. I would prefer to see an independent corporation set up here for broadcasting such as they have in Great Britain &mdash;the B.B.C.  I would prefer to see on that corporation experts in their own lines such as the drama, literature, radio experts and people of varying opinions and from various walks of life who could be trusted to enter into the best end of broadcasting in a non-partisan spirit and bring to bear upon broadcasting developments here the benefits of their experience in their various walks in life.  Undoubtedly, the present system does lend itself to political influences, and one cannot get away from the suspicion that not only appointments, but broadcasting itself, may from time to time be subjected to political influences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1925" /> For that reason I question the propriety of bringing back from America a man who had been our Minister in Washington, a man who had been closely associated prior to his appointment in the diplomatic corps with the Government Party, a man who, it would seem from all these circumstances, is being appointed for political considerations, and certainly not because of his expertness in the technical matters involved in broadcasting.  I feel that that appointment is deliberately aimed at some particular propaganda envisaged by the Government.  It may be, as Deputy Dillon has said, propaganda to boost the Taoiseach, it may be propaganda to boost Fianna Fáil, or it may be propaganda to appeal to American interests in the matter of Partition.  Whatever it may be, it would seem that it is going to be political propaganda of some kind or another.  I think we are entering a very dangerous field when we appoint a gentleman to take charge of short-wave broadcasting for purely political purposes.  I hope that is not so and is not the intention and that the Minister will be able to satisfy the House that, in this appointment, no political considerations whatever are involved, and that above all his function is not to disseminate political propaganda of any kind to outside countries.  If we are to put ourselves on the map abroad, let us do so by way of culture, literature, drama and music.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Deputy Dillon in advocating a cultured voice from Radio Éireann.  It is one of the things that I have heard commented on outside, that very often listeners-in are not able, on occasion, to follow what is being said because of the peculiar accents of the announcers. <Col N="1926" /> It would be desirable, if at all possible, to get that type of a pure cultured Irish voice that was at one time associated with the best spoken English in Dublin.  That applies not only to those who take part in broadcasting constantly, but particularly to announcers who are so constantly coming on the air.  I know there is the difficulty of getting the right type of voice, but the Minister should not be discouraged in his efforts to find that particular quality that is so badly needed.  There are too many uncultured voices coming forth from Radio Éireann to-day.</P>
      <P>There is just one other point, and that is in relation to the broadcast of games, particularly Gaelic games, which are very well broadcast and can be easily followed by listeners-in who are close followers of them.  The position is quite different in the case of outsiders who have no idea of our Irish games and who do not know Mick Mackey or Lowry Meagher or our other outstanding hurling and football stalwarts.  It is futile to tell the outside world that Mick Mackey is in possession and is going for a goal. There ought to be some way of giving to outsiders not familiar with our Irish games an idea of the positional play. Those, of course, who are familiar with the games, and with the positions customarily filled by prominent players can follow the broadcast quite easily, but the difficulty that I refer to arises in the case of outsiders who have no knowledge of Mick Mackey or Lowry Meagher, and no conception of the positions which they occupy on the field.  That is an aspect that should be remembered when a broadcast is given, and, therefore, I say the positional play should be indicated, so that when listening-in we may know where the ball is at a particular time and can visualise what the player is trying to do with it.  I know that I myself have found it difficult to follow a broadcast of other games with which I am not so familiar, and for the reason that I have given in the case of our Gaelic games.  It may appear to be a small point, but if it were attended to it would add to the interest of outsiders in the broadcasts of our own games.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to dissuade <Col N="1927" /> his colleagues from embarking on Partition propaganda through the short-wave radio.  I do not think that is going to get us anywhere.  I, personally, would not listen-in to a broadcast from Palestine about the partition of Palestine.  I have no interest in it and I do not care two hoots about it.  I doubt if anybody similarly situated in any other country, except perhaps an odd Irish person, would have any interest in listening-in to our political propaganda about our dissensions and divisions here, North and South.  If we want to begin a Partition drive, we should unite here and make that drive across the Border.  Let us have a rapprochement between Dublin and Belfast.  If we cannot bring about a solution of Partition by a rapprochement between Dublin and Belfast, we are not likely to do it by a broadcast to New York, Albania, Canada, or any other place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister would need to be very careful in giving out propaganda or preaching at people over the radio.  Most people want amusement or relaxation from the radio.  Propaganda, once it is recognised as such, loses interest for most people and will not be listened to.  The same applies to preaching at people or educating them.  It must be very carefully done and put in its proper place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter.  I do not know if any other Deputy has mentioned it but certainly it is so important as to bear repetition.  I refer to interference.  That is a very sore subject with many listeners in Dublin. Some people tell you that they find it impossible to hear any station at times and others tell you that they can locate the cause of the disturbance as the hairdresser's machine down the street, or something like that.  I suggest to the Minister that there is a number of very humble listeners who are entitled to a certain amount of consideration. I do not know whether it is a matter for the Minister or for the Electricity Supply Board but certainly you want to get current delivered as free from interference as is possible. Remember, very little consideration and time spent on that would earn big <Col N="1928" /> dividends for the Minister in the good-will of his listeners.  I take it that the matter of other stations being audible in the background and being very nearly on the same wave-length is one in which the Minister is not his own master, that it is an international matter, but it would certainly add to the clarity of reception if the interference caused thereby could be eliminated.</P>

      <P>I wish to add my voice to this debate.  The question of propaganda has been referred to.  During the last war everybody had a wireless set for the purpose of being able to hear the propaganda by Lord Haw Haw. People in the country want more of the &ldquo;Around the Fire&rdquo; type of broadcasts. They do not want highfalutin stuff at all.  They want plain music, céilidhe music, in the country places at any rate.  In my constituency, the majority of the people do not know Irish, and they have to wait for the news in Irish to be given before they hear the news in English.  I think the news is broadcast too early.  Generally, the working man does not leave work until 6 p.m. and is not home until 6.40 p.m.  By that time the news is over.  I think 7 o'clock or 7.30 should be the time for the first news in the evening.  That would give everyone a chance to get home.  10.10 p.m. is too early for the last news.  Anyone returning from the pictures misses the news. 11 o'clock should be the time for the last news.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must consider our Irish people all over the world.  I have many relations in England and Scotland.  They love to hear what is going on at home. It would be no harm to broadcast items of local interest.  It would be a good idea to broadcast some of the Parliamentary questions and answers, which <Col N="1929" /> would be of interest to the community. When a Deputy puts down a question, he has been asked to do it, and the people concerned like to hear the answer.  They may live in some out-lying district where they may not get the daily papers.  People buy radios so that they may get the news.  That is what they pay their tax for.  Racing results are a good news item.  The results of the big races should be announced earlier.  It would save a good deal of anxiety if people knew how the horses ran.  Céilidhe music and programmes like &ldquo;Around the Fire&rdquo; are what the country people want, not some of the highfalutin stuff that some Deputies have been talking about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing we must realise about Radio Éireann is that it is not such a high-power station as stations in England, on the Continent and elsewhere, and that we cannot give a news service as good as can be given in other countries.  The object we should have in mind is to give as good a news service as we can.  The same applies to every other type of broadcasting. It is very hard for anybody to judge, and it would be very hard for the Minister to judge, the most suitable features to broadcast from Radio Éireann.  One section of the community likes céilidhe music and knows everything pertaining to céilidhes and Irish, while others like different types of orchestras, and so on.  I think the best thing the Minister can do is to carry on the way he is, thus giving a certain percentage of satisfaction to each listener.  Personally, I think that plays are very enjoyable over the radio.  Ninety per cent. of the people who cannot go to cinemas or theatres and who have to stay at home listen in for enjoyment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would advise the Minister in regard to the new short-wave station which he proposes to open and also in regard to the existing station to be careful in the selection of actors who broadcast the plays.  It is a well-known fact that while an actor may be perfect in every way on the stage and may, as a matter of fact, reach fame, nevertheless that same actor may not be suitable as an actor when broadcasting <Col N="1930" /> plays.  When broadcasting his voice only is heard and those who are perfect in one respect are often found to be of no use whatsoever in another. Therefore, I would advise the Minister to look carefully into every application which is made by individuals who offer their services as radio actors and to give each one a fair trial.  I know it may be expensive and that it will cost extra money but I think it would be worth while and that by that simple process he would be able to grade out the applicants and select the best.  I think the Minister would not be sorry and that he would find that this method would be of considerable benefit and would pay in the long run.  A great deal of notice is taken of the voice of a broadcaster and everyone would appreciate a perfect voice or one as near to perfection as can be found.</P>
    <P>I desire to make a few observations on the broadcasting of the news.  I think that we should have, if possible, a news broadcast at 9 o'clock every morning.  Some Deputy suggested that a weather forecast should be broadcast early every morning in order that everybody might know the prospects of the weather for the day.  I think that the man fit to give that forecast would be a remarkable man.  Nobody at the present time can forecast the ups and downs of the weather for half an hour, but I think that the average man in the country would appreciate some news, even a few items, at 9 a.m.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it may be too much to expect a continuous radio programme during the day.  Definitely we are lacking a great deal in that respect as compared with other countries.  Perhaps we have not news enough or features enough&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the new station is being opened I hope that an effort will be made to give the people a better broadcasting service.  Several Deputies here have referred to the broadcast reports about the business of Dáil Éireann.  They are not as good as the average man would like them to be.  We must realise also that in this House there are, let us say, about a dozen Deputies, excepting Ministers, <Col N="1931" /> who seem to monopolise and to take it on themselves to monopolise the entire conduct of the House.  If constituents in certain constituencies are disappointed because they do not hear the name of their local Deputy mentioned the fault may not be with the Minister or with the local Deputy.  It is very hard to satisfy the people down the country.</P>
      <P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the reports of the business of the Dáil broadcast by Radio Éireann could be elaborated.  As has already been pointed out, in the case of questions, the name of the Deputy who asks a question should be stated or it should be stated that the Minister, in reply to a question by Deputy So-and-So, gave such an answer.  The Deputy is entitled to that.</P>
      <P>With regard to sports broadcasts I think that everything as far as the Gaelic code is concerned is very well broadcast and that we cannot complain about the man who does that work.  He is one person who can definitely be said to be good at his job.  We cannot have any complaint as regards that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coogan said that in the broadcasting of games, such as hurling, those who listen in from outside this country may not know the positions on the field of the different players and that when a player is in possession of the ball, the broadcaster should make an effort to give the player's position on the field.  That is very hard to do.  It would be almost impossible for a broadcaster, who has to use both his eyes and his tongue at the same time, to say that the player in possession of the ball is the centre half-back or the left wing forward.  On the whole, I think there cannot be any great complaint in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to horse racing and dog racing, I have never heard any complaints about the broadcasts which are occasionally given, but those people who are interested in horse racing and dog racing and who pay for a radio licence are entitled to get an earlier broadcast <Col N="1932" /> of the results of the different races.  The one feature I like most on the radio is &ldquo;Question Time.&rdquo;  Everybody who listens-in to it finds it amusing, entertaining and instructive, because there are some very good brain teasers put by the compére.  It is interesting for any listener to take a competitor's number and see how he compares with that individual.  People have a habit of doing that and find it very interesting.</P>
    <P>As to the new short-wave station, we should make every effort to bring to the attention of the world the question of Partition.  I think we should have at least every week a broadcast on that station telling the world nicely and quietly and without any undue heat what the position is, how our country is divided, and how those who talk so much about fair play for small nations should endeavour to see that the partition of our country is brought to an end.  At any rate, we should devote a certain amount of time to propaganda, especially propaganda directed to the removal of the Border or the bringing about of the independence of our country.  It may be an entire failure, but it is worth trying.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beegan referred to the Dublin Cattle Market.  There should be a more detailed report given about that and it should be given earlier in the day, if at all possible.  I realise, as the Minister said, that he cannot have a programme covering the whole day and, if he cannot, then he cannot give certain news at certain times. While not as good as we would like it to be, on the whole I think Radio Éireann is probably as good as our country can afford.  If the Minister could in any way improve on the programmes, that improvement would be welcome.  If he cannot satisfy everybody, then we must forgive him.  But there is one thing I think he should do and which would satisfy everybody who listens in, and that is to reduce the licence fee to 10/- per year.  The extra 2/6 is the cause of more complaint than any of the programmes that have been broadcast.  I know the Minister will say: &ldquo;If you want more items on the programme, we must collect more money in order that these items may be given.&rdquo;  If he could do what I have <Col N="1933" /> suggested, he would be doing something which the average radio listener would be very glad to see happening.</P>
    <P>In the selection of people for broadcasting posts I should like the Minister to take into consideration every application received.  I know that there must be thousands of applications for the vacant posts and that those people will be pretty well paid. The standard, therefore, will need to be very high.  But if he could give a trial to all the applicants, it is possible that he might get from one of the most remote parts of the country one of the most cultured speakers that could stand before a microphone.  If he does what I suggest, although it may be more expensive, I think it will prove to be more satisfactory in the long run.</P>

      <P>There is not much room for controversy with regard to this Estimate.  The programmes from the station, so far as I know, are reasonably good.  I think the programmes are as good as those given by any other station.  You cannot please everybody, but on the whole I think the station pleases people pretty well.  There are a few items I should like to deal with.  I think the weather forecast should be given in the morning and at night, so that those engaged in agriculture may know what weather to expect.  For instance, it is important for a farmer in the hay-making season or at harvest time to know whether he may expect three or four hours of fine weather.  As regards the broadcasting of the proceedings of the Dáil, we all, more or less, object to the fact that the name of the Deputy who may have asked a very important question is not given, but the name of the Minister who answers it is given. It may be a very important matter, and I think the name of the Deputy asking the question should be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad that the short-wave station is to be started.  I expect the chief aim of that station will be to give important broadcasts which will be heard in other countries.  We expect to have some very important broadcasts in connection with Partition and our national status.  When we are broadcasting on the very important <Col N="1934" /> issue of Partition, we should speak with the united voice of the Irish people.  The services of the Leaders of the different Parties should be availed of for these broadcasts.  The Taoiseach can broadcast as the head of the Government, as he is entitled to do, in order to show that the Irish people are united in an effort to undo that wrong. All the Parties should endeavour to show that we are a united people in our effort to remove this blot on our country's status.  Every effort should be made to get a united voice on the national position of this country.  I am satisfied that the programmes given are reasonably good and that the people are getting satisfaction from them.  If we want to have programmes on a higher level, we will have to pay more money for them.  In general, I think there is very little to complain about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to pay tribute to the Minister and his staff for the very painstaking, efficient and courteous manner in which they treat all suggestions and recommendations made to them by the general public in regard to the broadcasting station.  When we tune in to hear the news at night, we look for more home news than we are supplied with.  It is very interesting for some people to hear items of foreign news, but there are many news items of Irish interest which should be broadcast.  In rural Ireland, especially, a great many people are disappointed because there is not more Irish news on the radio each night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to emphasise the necessity of reverting to the talks or lectúres on agriculture that we had some time ago.  There are a great many farmers throughout the country who have a full knowledge of their industry and it would be well if that knowledge were conveyed to others over the radio.  In addition to these farmers, who would, I am sure, be very willing to give their services, we have in Cork University a dairy science faculty, with Professor Boyle at the head of it, and he and his staff would give valuable information on the dairying industry, which is of such vital importance to the <Col N="1935" /> people now.  Here in Dublin, in the Albert College, we have Professor Sheehy, one of the ablest authorities in Europe, I think, on animal nutrition. I would like to hear from him occasional lectures on feeding and the value of various types of food.  It would be well if one evening each week were set apart for a talk of that kind.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to be able to pay a tribute to certain items on the programme, particularly those dealing with folklore and traditional songs and music.  I feel, when I hear the céilidhe bands and other items of that kind, that were it not for the radio the grand old Irish songs and the music of our forefathers would be entirely forgotten and would pass out of mind and never be heard by the young people, who hear in the dance halls and elsewhere so much jazz music.  I think the radio counteracts the tendency of these young people to have a flair for modern dance music and jazz.  It is a great tribute to our radio station that they cater there so extensively for the old folk songs and traditional Irish music.</P>
    <P>Our Irish items are also satisfactory and, on the whole, I think we are getting as much satisfaction from our broadcasting station as one could reasonably expect for the money that is expended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be a source of very great satisfaction to the director and to those who are connected with the working of the station when they read that there has been an expression of almost general satisfaction as regards the manner in which the station is being conducted.  Deputy Roddy examined the Estimates with, so to speak, a microscope and he wanted us to give even more details than we were able to give.  There are reasons why we could not give further details.  As my experts point out, we are not able to control the supply of steel, lead and coal, which are the three big factors in estimating the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the short-wave station, we have been able to put on order one of the big masts, which we hope to have at the end of this year. It was to have been here by April but, <Col N="1936" /> owing to delays, it was postponed and it will be some time in the fall when the first mast comes.  There is a possibility of getting a second mast which, I think, is already made, and we shall look for two other masts later on.</P>
    <P>The principle on which the Estimate works is that it is put down and the House gives permission for the expenditure of money.  Sometimes it will be only a token Vote and, if that is so, a Supplementary Estimate is brought in afterwards for the exact amount which will be expended, if it is over what is already on the Estimate.  That will be the procedure with regard to this Estimate, just the same as in relation to any other Estimate.</P>
    <P>The amount we are spending, as Deputies know, is considerably more than we were spending in other years. There is always a certain amount of doubt as to whether we should regard the customs duty as something which we might set against expenditure.  For instance, I have certain figures here which indicate that the licence fees brought in £112,500.  Advertisements brought in £41,100.  Just to show you how the Estimate varies at times, I might say that we had a very conservative estimate with regard to our advertisements for last year, the sum being £17,760, and we actually got in £41,100.  The total revenue was £153,600 and the total expenditure £244,293.  If you were to take into consideration the customs duty it would add enormously to our credit.</P>
    <P>The principle upon which the Department of Finance acts is that all the money that comes in goes into Finance, as if it were an ordinary tax, and we are paid just as much as is considered adequate to conduct the station.  Really, there is no kind of balance struck, but it is understood that certain moneys are attributed to us as if we had earned them.  If we were to take into consideration the customs duty we would be well on the right side of the balance sheet.  From 1925-26 to date the amount of customs duty is very considerable.  The total revenue for that period was £2,804,381. That includes licence fees, advertisements and customs duty.</P>

      <P>That is over the whole period since 1925-26.  I have not the figures for the total expenditure during the same period, but the surplus, the revenue over expenditure, would be £788,000.  In a sense, if you allow the customs duty attributed to us for those years, we are not extravagant in running the station.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously there are other financial considerations why there should be a conservative estimate of how much we should be allowed to spend.</P>
      <P>I was asked a question as to what our policy was.  In opening the debate, I did not mention the policy in general outline, partly because I thought people had taken it for granted.  In many speeches in the House there was a clear indication that there is an understanding of what the general drift of policy is.  It is clear, from what is done in other countries, that the institution of broadcasting has come to be regarded in every country as of very great importance.  Each country thinks of it as the outward expression of the best that is in it.  It is for each a really national institution, speaking first to its own race and people and, through productions of various kinds, to the world.  All the activities of a country are constantly under review. I cannot think of any important activity which does not find its way through the microphone to an almost unlimited public which may wish to, or just happen to, listen in.</P>
      <P>Our neighbours are spending very large sums of money on radio.  This year I notice by the Press that Britain is spending some £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 more than formerly on the stations.  We cannot compete in expense, but we try to make up for that in quality.  We work on the principle that it is better to have shorter hours and to give the best quality we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very glad to find that people generally approve of our policy of trying <Col N="1938" /> to give the best music.  It was certainly with a certain amount of trepidation that we entered on the policy we adopted.  When you consider the enormous advances that have been made in the spread of good music in other countries and how a big public in other countries take a great interest in the best music, there is a wide field for development open to us.  The tendency in all countries is to try to popularise the very best type of culture. In other words, the democratic attitude is being adopted in every country of trying to give the best to the people.  There was a time, even within our own memories, when only a select few prided themselves on being interested in culture&mdash;in art, drama and good music.  Now, there has been a complete change in the point of view and every Government tries to give the very best it can to all its people.  I do not think our people are any less intelligent than other peoples and I think they are entitled to the best in the same way as the people of other countries.  We have quite a leeway to make up before we reach the standards of culture of most of the northern countries of Europe.  Some of them are smaller, some of them larger than this country but in general their resources are about the same.</P>
    <P>On the whole it should be a matter of national pride to provide the best programmes that we can at our broadcasting station, and to make them at least as good as those provided in other European countries.  We have tremendous raw materials in our folklore, in our traditional music and in the ability available in the country. What we do not like is that some of our people are inclined to be satisfied with programmes of second-rate quality.  I think that is partly due to the fact that the teachings and standards of our people, due to historic causes, were inferior to those which would otherwise have obtained and that we had not a period of peace in which to develop sufficiently.  I believe that the ability and the raw material are now available and that they should be exploited.  The reason that we have established a short-wave station is that we want to show the <Col N="1939" /> world the very best that is in us.  We do not want to use it merely for propaganda purposes.  Propaganda has defeated itself in most countries. People are tired of listening to mere propaganda, the mere putting across of that sort of aggressive propaganda of which we became so tired during the war.  The best propaganda to end Partition is to show the world the best that is in us culturally rather than to try to engage in war on the air.  It is a very dangerous thing to make war on the air because the nuisance value of a station that wants to interfere with other stations is so great that, if others on the air retaliate, there is a general din and no one can listen to any station.</P>
    <P>We are confronted with many problems at the moment and we have had to send some of our best experts to America to try to get a short-wave band.  This is the first big conference which will distribute wave-lengths for the whole world.  We are going to have to take our turn to see what we can get in the way of adjustment, in order that the interference between stations may be reduced to the minimum and also in order to try to get a proper place on the short-wave band.</P>
    <P>Whilst I am speaking about interferences, perhaps I should advert also to the complaints of a few Deputies about local interference.  I am afraid that as time goes on, with the development of electrical machines, the problem of interference is going to increase.  We do our very best, our experts are constantly giving these matters attention and if anybody has a complaint to make they see to it at once.  We have succeeded in remedying defective reception in some cases. We have been able to eliminate a good deal of the interference in local areas because there are gadgets that can be attached to electrical machines with that object and we try to persuade the proprietors of such machines to make use of these appliances.  I do not think we have any compulsory powers in the matter.  All we can do is to try to persuade such parties not to interfere with their neighbours' reception.  My own <Col N="1940" /> opinion is that, as electricity becomes more popular throughout the country, that problem will increase.  At the same time means of cutting out radio interference are being developed.  Modulated frequency is an extremely expensive form of radio distribution.</P>
    <P>I do not know that I should delay the House any longer but reference was made to a great many matters in the long drawn out discussion on the Estimate.  I think the best I can do is to say that all these matters will be noted and examined.  The news broadcast was referred to.  We are very proud of our news service.  Within recent months we have gone in for a very elaborate news service, and I was very surprised to hear some Deputies refer to the news service as being copied from the evening papers. There was a time when we had to rely on such sources of information but we have now an expensive news service. We have a most excellent staff and I think our news service is quite as good as can be found anywhere.  I do not agree with Deputies who spoke about a neutral news service.  It occurred to me, listening to some Deputies, that what they wanted was not news at all, but a kind of folklore.  After all, news is distributed by the various news agencies and by different services and the items must be very similar unless these agencies depart from the truth.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish raised the question of the refusal by the Department to give recognition to the National Union of Journalists as representing our editorial staff.  It would be contrary to general policy in regard to the Civil Service to accept representations on behalf of civil servants from organisations the membership of which is not confined to the Civil Service.  Any representations which the broadcasting news staff may wish to put forward, either collectively or individually, will have careful consideration and this intimation has been conveyed to the news staff.  If, however, the news staff wish to have representation through a union, I believe there is an appropriate organisation within the Civil Service for membership of which they would be eligible.  We have, of course, no objection to the Radio <Col N="1941" /> Éireann news staff maintaining their membership of the National Union of Journalists for the purpose of entitlement to benevolent funds or other benefits, but we cannot accept representations from any outside union on behalf of civil servants in regard to their position in the Civil Service.  It must also be remembered that these journalists who have joined our staff have the benefits of sick pay and of pension, so that their status is different from that of journalists working outside.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say what is the staff organisation to which he referred which would cater for these journalists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is an organisation for professional officers.  With regard to weather forecasts, that matter has been giving us a good deal of thought lately.  We have been dealing with meteorologists in the matter, and I do not know whether we should start such a service until we are in a proper position to do so, so that we would not mislead the people.  It would be necessary to get local reports very often, and, even then, the most we could do would be to indicate weather conditions for perhaps a few hours.  It might be very useful to farmers to know what conditions were going to be even for some hours ahead, and for that reason we are anxious to do it.  It will cost a little extra money, but I think it will be justified, provided we do not give forecasts of the weather which turn out to be inaccurate.</P>
      <P>With regard to cattle market reports, we do give these reports.  It was suggested that they should be given at an earlier hour.  I can have that examined, but they are almost invariably given in the late news on market days and generally in the second news also. Since the curtailment of broadcasting hours, owing to electricity restrictions, we have not been able to give them on the first news.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies referred also to propaganda with regard to Partition and such questions.  That is really a matter for External Affairs.  Whatever would be done would be done through External Affairs.  Broadcasting is a service <Col N="1942" /> which is at the disposal of all Departments&mdash;Agriculture, Industry and Commerce, and External Affairs&mdash;and questions which raise international relations must necessarily be subject to the control of the Department responsible.</P>
    <P>A reference was made to the reports of the proceedings of this House in the news being distorted.  One Deputy put his finger on the difficulty with regard to giving reports of all Deputies who speak.  It would be very difficult to do that without picking out one Deputy rather than another.  Very often, as Deputies are aware, we have 40 or 50 questions on the Order Paper, and if we give some names and do not give others, the Deputies whose names we do not give have a grievance against those we give.  The purpose of the radio news service is to give the greatest possible summary of the news which is most important and the matter which interests the country is really the information given by the Government. If it happens that a Minister's name is mentioned, I do not think that can be regarded as propaganda, because it simply means that the particular answer comes from that Minister.  I do not think one could consider that as distortion.  It would be extremely difficult to pick out one Deputy rather than another because the Deputies who are not mentioned will have a grievance against the ones who are, and the method adopted is easier and saves time.  Some Deputies said that it would mean only an extra five minutes, but five minutes on the radio is a very valuable amount of time, when one considers how much can be said in five minutes and the number of hours we are on the air.</P>
    <P>With regard to the actors, examinations are going on at present.  Some Deputies suggested that we are not paying them sufficiently well.  The number of applications which have come in is 500, all of whom have to be examined, and the terms we are giving are very fair.  They appeared in the advertisement and I need not go into the figures now, but they compare very favourably with the pay given by any of the theatres.  The films, of course, <Col N="1943" /> pay enormous rates and I do not suppose that any Deputy will suggest we should compete against them.</P>
    <P>The question of the censorship of speeches was also mentioned.  It is not exactly a censorship.  It is control by an editor.  In the case of a great news-paper, the editor, sub-editor or somebody responsible must see everything that goes into the paper, and, in the same way, the Director of Broadcasting, or somebody to whom he has delegated the power, should see everything that is to go on the air.  I suppose one should make an exception in the case of the Head of the State.  That is a matter of practice.  He does generally submit his manuscript and did so on the occasion of his Mayo speech when a few verbal changes&mdash;nothing of substance&mdash;were made.  I should much rather see Deputies approach this problem from the point of an editor who, having invited someone to speak, wishes to co-operate and to help the person who is to broadcast to do it as effectively as possible, who has to point out certain snags, that certain things carry certain meanings, certain implications, which he may not have seen. During the emergency, there was one occasion when a manuscript was not submitted and a sermon was preached which might have got us into considerable trouble.  On other occasions, manuscripts were submitted and we had to point out that it would be very dangerous to have certain references made.  The people concerned were very helpful and made the necessary omissions. That is merely common sense and to call it censorship is not reasonable.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by saying how much we appreciate the work of the retiring Director of Broadcasting. He did a good job and it was a very difficult and a very trying job.  I should like also to pay a compliment to the whole staff and I think it will be a source of satisfaction to them that, on this Estimate, so many people said good things about them.  That reminds me of the new Director.  The reason why the new Director has been appointed is that he has very wide diplomatic and Press experience and <Col N="1944" /> that he knows America.  He knows what should be stated and what should not be stated and he knows the taste for Irish music and Irish cultural items in America.  Deputies may rest assured that he is not there for any small Party purpose.  He is there because he had diplomatic experience and training which is, perhaps, the best possible training in the circumstances. It was a very fine gesture on his part to accept the position, because, as somebody has said, the position he occupied was one of much higher rank.  He did not, however, stand on ceremony, and he is quite willing to do work which is of enormous national importance.  It is clear to everybody&mdash;and other countries recognise the fact&mdash;that radio is being regarded, more and more, as a matter of importance.  The countries which understand its value rely more upon making their programmes attractive than in seeking to carry out any sort of small-minded task.</P>

The members are picked from the point of view of the possession of a good cultural approach, without having any direct interest in productions on the radio. They have been extremely helpful to us in a few things, particularly in relation to the item, &ldquo;Listen and Learn&rdquo;. Each of the officers in control of a section has been before the advisory committee and has discussed the programmes with them.  They have offered many suggestions which were very helpful.  That is how we work the advisory committee.  We do not put on the committee anybody, no matter <Col N="1945" /> how distinguished, who might be coming to the radio on the basis of a fee. Once they come to the advisory committee, they are excluded from the radio programmes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill provides for a large measure of codification of the law in relation to health administration: it is also the first step in the task of general modernisation and expansion of the law and administration in relation to health services. I have no doubt that this latter task will involve the submission of a number of other measures to the Oireachtas as time goes on, but the <Col N="1947" /> present Bill contains what I hope will prove to be that measure of reform which is at once most urgent and most practicable.</P>
    <P>I do not think it necessary to dwell in any detail on the codification aspects of the Bill: the explanatory memorandum circulated to Deputies sets out the general heads of the statutory responsibilities which have devolved on the Minister for Health in pursuance of the recent Transfer of Functions Order which was made following the establishment of a separate Department of Health in pursuance of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1946.  The Transfer of Functions Order has been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, and Deputies who have examined it must have been struck by the great number of Acts and portions of enactments which had to be cited to give effect to the transfer.  There are 46 complete Acts mentioned in Part I of the First Schedule to the Order, and numerous sections of some 14 other Acts are set out in Part II of that Schedule, while there are 21 adaptations of provisions which fall to be exercised severally by the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Health, according to their respective functions.  This gives a fair picture of the voluminous and diverse enactments which have become the responsibility of the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>Now, if Deputies look at the First Schedule of the Bill, dealing with repeals, they will find that some 26 enactments are being repealed in whole or in part.  These repeals are possible because the provisions of the present Bill re-enact or replace them in modernised&mdash;and, I hope, in improved &mdash;form.  The result will be that the lists of statutory functions which proved such an arduous and complex task to prepare in connection with their transfer to the Department of Health will be greatly abbreviated and simplified by the provisions of this Bill.  The law on the matters with which the Bill deals will in future be available for reference in a readily accessible and modernised form.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the explanatory <Col N="1948" /> memorandum, the Bill, when enacted, together with the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, the Parts of the Public Assistance Act, 1939, appropriate to the Minister for Health and certain self-contained Acts, will comprise a consolidated series of statutory enactments in relation to most of the Minister's functions and the relevant responsibilities of local authorities. There will remain the need for a separate codification of the food and drugs legislation&mdash;although we anticipate that also to a certain extent by special provisions in this Bill.</P>
    <P>That is all I need say at this stage on what I might term the legal mechanism of the Bill in relation to the existing law.</P>
    <P>I have indicated at the beginning of my remarks that the second objective is the modernisation and reform of the health services.  To explain how far we aim at carrying this objective into effect in the present measure, it may be well for me, without going into the detail that is reserved for Committee Stage, to review the proposals in the Bill, Part by Part.  Deputies will, I am sure, also expect me to indicate the more important changes which have been made in the proposals which have previously been before the Dáil in the appropriate Parts of the Public Health Bill, 1945.</P>
    <P>I might say here, before proceeding to survey the provisions of the Bill and apropos of my references to the Public Health Bill, that, before the consideration of this measure became my responsibility and following very lengthy debates in the Dáil, a large number of amendments had been circulated for consideration on Report Stage of the Public Health Bill. The Ministerial amendments included among these had received very careful consideration and Deputies who participated in the debates and who have studied those amendments will, I am sure, appreciate that they were designed to go a long way to meet a number of the matters which had been the subject of controversy.</P>
    <P>In the present Bill, all the relevant amendments then proposed have been incorporated, except where the provisions in question have been otherwise <Col N="1949" /> altered, modified or omitted.  That fact in itself will, I am sure, help to expedite the consideration of the present measure and procure a moderately harmonious discussion of its contents. I say &ldquo;moderately&rdquo; because my proposals are not necessarily perfect and I do not claim to be infallible, but neither should other parties claim either perfection or infallibility for any criticisms or counter-proposals which they may have to make.</P>
    <P>As regards Part I, I would draw attention to the new definition of a &ldquo;health authority&rdquo;.  The Public Health Bill contained definitions of a &ldquo;county authority&rdquo;, &ldquo;health authority&rdquo; and &ldquo;sanitary authority&rdquo; and it was intended that a health authority might be either a county authority or a sanitary authority.  For all the purposes of this Bill, the administrative authority will be the health authority which means the council of a county or the corporation of a county borough. The intention is to rationalise and simplify the administration by making all local functions under the Bill the responsibility of a county or city authority.  This in effect means that the numerous urban sanitary authorities who will retain responsibility for sanitary services supervised by the Minister for Local Government will have no responsibility for health services supervised by me.</P>
    <P>Part II deals with institutions. Effect has been given to the Report amendments which were put down to meet the criticism of Deputies in regard to the powers sought by the Minister to order the provision or discontinuance of an institution.  As agreed on Committee Stage, a local inquiry will have to be held in relation to the desirability of the Minister acting in this manner in any particular case before any Order is made.</P>
    <P>This Part of the Bill contains provision for the transfer to health authorities of district institutions maintained by the public assistance authority.  I do not anticipate that this provision will be utilised except in restricted classes of cases until further legislation, to be explained beforehand in a White Paper, is introduced to alter radically the public assistance basis of <Col N="1950" /> institutional administration.  In the meantime, the powers sought may be utilised to bring particular infectious disease institutions under the control of the health authority, e.g., fever hospitals at present managed by the public assistance authorities.</P>
    <P>There was some discussion, in debate on the corresponding provisions of the Public Health Bill, in regard to the magnitude of the institutional building programme.  A figure of £24,000,000 was mentioned for hospitals and reference was made to a further long-term liability of about £10,000,000 for dealing with institutions other than hospitals, for example, county homes.  I should like Deputies to be clear that this Bill does not involve, as a matter of course or in itself, the implementation of that large programme.  That is a long-term programme which was initiated when the Hospitals Act was passed in 1933.  Hospital construction proceeded for some five years up to the outbreak of the war.  It is being resumed now and will be accelerated according as funds and materials are available; but it is not provided in this Bill that any particular institution will be built.  To give effect to the provisions of this Bill, certain transfers of institutions will be necessary; if they are modern ones, so much the better, if they are not, we must set about improving or replacing them as part of the general construction programme.</P>
    <P>The provisions for transfer of any institutions maintained by sanitary authorities are consequential on the removal from those authorities of any responsibility for health functions.  The institutions actually maintained by them are relatively few and trivial&mdash; scabies treatment centres, disinfestation stations and other centres of that kind.</P>
    <P>I now come to Part III of the Bill, which deals with the mother and child service.  I have had the provisions on this matter brought forward into one of the initial Parts of the Bill because I regard it as the most important item of reform for which the Bill provides. These provisions are the basis for a comprehensive service for mothers before, during and after childbirth, and for children up to the age of 16 years.  It will be observed that, so far <Col N="1951" /> as the Minister is concerned, the provisions are enabling provisions.  The Minister may make regulations applicable to every health authority or every health authority of a particular class or a particular health authority as to the manner in which, and the extent to which, they are to exercise their powers in regard to: Attendance to the health of mothers; attendance to health of children who are not pupils of schools, and attendance to health of pupils of schools.</P>
    <P>Then there is an obligation to submit children to medical inspection unless a registered medical practitioner certifies that the child is unable to attend the inspection owing to illness, or that he has examined the child and will be responsible for any treatment up to the date of the next inspection.  Provisions are also included in regard to the affording of facilities for medical inspection of children in schools.  I have no doubt that the co-operation of the school authorities will be forthcoming in practically every case.  The law has, however, to provide for all cases, to enable the comprehensive nature of the service to be maintained and, for this purpose, school managers are required to give all reasonable facilities on receipt of the prescribed notices, and subject to the consultation which the health authorities are required to have with them.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the prior consultation is to enable the inspection to be carried out with the minimum inconvenience to the authorities of the school, but I think that in practice it will be possible to arrange, with the consent of all concerned, for regular inspections at stated times in such a manner as to require very little discussion or preparation prior to particular inspections.</P>
    <P>As regards the need for a service such as is proposed here, most Deputies will be aware that both the present maternity and child welfare service and the school medical service are inadequate; that the whole-time public health staff is unable to cope with the demands of a full service, and that there is not proper continuity of attention to the health of children before they attend school and afterwards. It is proposed to establish an <Col N="1952" /> integrated service whereby the defects in the present schemes will be remedied and a greatly expanded and modernised service will be provided which will include ante-natal care of mothers, facilities for obstetrical attention and post-natal supervision, and a full medical service for children from birth until the age of 16 years.</P>
    <P>In this respect, I propose to pay particular attention to the preventive aspect of the new service.  Thus, in addition to medical treatment, the new service will include provision for the early detection and diagnosis of defects in children, their immunisation against preventable disease, care of nutrition, physical development and the promotion of sound healthy habits. It is my aim to use this service to promote a healthy growing generation.</P>
    <P>I have given considerable thought to the means by which this service will be implemented, and I am satisfied that it is very desirable that the district medical officers (or the dispensary doctors, as they are commonly called) should be associated with the new service.  The service will, of course, deal with various specialised ailments, but it is essentially a basic general medical service such as those doctors are already performing to the best of their ability and resources in their ordinary medical practice, official or otherwise. Some months ago I met representatives of the Medical Association, following which it has been arranged to accord sanction to proposals for increased salary scales for the dispensary doctors up to certain limits indicated to them.  Those increases are based on the admitted need for stepping up the remuneration of dispensary doctors in respect of their existing duties.  I told their representatives at the same time that I hoped, when this Bill was passed, to be in a position to discuss with them the terms on which they would assume responsibility for increased duties which, in effect, meant this service which I am now discussing.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the proposals in the Bill are enabling provisions, as far as the Minister is concerned. The local authority is required to implement them according <Col N="1953" /> as regulations thereon are brought into force by the Minister.  Furthermore, while most anxious to implement this service, we can only do so with the implements at our disposal, improving those implements, of course, as rapidly as we can.  To ascertain precisely what facilities will be at our disposal immediately and what new facilities should be provided, a comprehensive national dispensary survey is being conducted at present.  A conference of all the county medical officers of health has also been convened to discuss various public health matters, and the proposed mother and child service is an important item on the agenda.</P>
    <P>With the aid of these negotiations and conferences I hope to attain a workable and agreed basis for the co-operation of the dispensary doctors with the whole-time county health staff in the operation of the service. The chief medical officer in each county and his assistants will be expected to supervise the service, to check up on child health and on infantile and maternal mortality, to constitute in brief the headquarters staff which will direct the implementation of the scheme, inspect it in its operation, assess its results and be answerable therefor to the health authorities and to the Minister.  The present schemes are inadequate and unsatisfactory, precisely because a small health staff is required to get around every school in the county and to provide for followup treatment without any clear coordination of their machinery with the functions of the institutional and dispensary medical officers who treat the general maladies of the people.  The matter is obviously one in which the co-operation of all sections of the medical profession is essential.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of the service to which I wish to refer before passing away from it, and that is, the objections which have been voiced to the compulsory examination of children. I must say that I am not very much impressed by these objections. My experience of any beneficial service affecting health, or social welfare generally, which is made available, is that it is criticised by the people more on the score of its inadequacy than on the fact that they are compelled in <Col N="1954" /> some way or another to avail themselves of it.  The people of this country for the past 150 years and, in particular, since they were made the proprietors of their own holdings, have been anxious to improve their status and their houses and property and to educate their children above the standards which existed in former times.  There is also a growing degree of enlightenment on the need of greater attentioto health.</P>
    <P>Medical treatment, including specialist treatment, is intelligently and insistently sought for by the vast majority of the people.  But just as we need compulsory school attendance for the children of those who value education least but require it most so do we need compulsory ascertainment of disease and defects in relation to the children whose parents are least keenly aware of the need for medical attention.  An ill-educated child may become a menace to the community in his later years, but the danger is much less than that of an infected child who may infect his companions and there is the added possibility that unless his condition is diagnosed and treated he will grow up, if he grows up at all, a burden on the community through some kind of constitutional infirmity.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, the people who are not sufficiently well aware of the need for medical attention whose children are likely to be most in need of inspection and who may have to be required by some procedure, other than mere invitation, to present themselves for inspection.  But I do not anticipate that compulsion, if you can call it compulsion, will amount to absolute dragooning. As I say, the number of people likely to present difficulty will probably be very small, and side by side with the clinical aspects of the service there will, in due course, be a domiciliary nursing service which will be available for giving advice to expectant and nursing mothers and the mothers of young children.  That will, I hope, still further reduce the numbers who fail to appreciate the value of the service.  I hope that the domiciliary visitors will prove a very valuable medium of health propaganda and that their peaceful persuasion will prove in most cases an effective alternative to <Col N="1955" /> compulsion&mdash;in other words, that they will be able to coax the lazy ones on with something more gentle than a stick.</P>
    <P>I need not stress the advantages of the service from the personal, public health, social or national aspects: these are self-evident.  But to put the matter on its most material level, there is grave economic wastage from the loss of young lives and from the undue proportion of children who grow into adolescence and adult life with their economic potential diminished or destroyed by avoidable infirmities.  There is the economic waste of the children who are reared and then lost through death, and there is the further economic waste of chronically infirm persons who have to be supported by their relations or by the State or both.  In the matter of mental defects, in the absence of a comprehensive scheme to ascertain them and deal with them, backward children are allowed to remain or recede into idiots when early training of a specialist kind would advance them, never perhaps to normally adult mentality, but would at least make them amenable to progressive improvement.</P>
    <P>For families who do not wish to participate in the scheme generally applicable and who may have some preferences for private treatment of their children's ailments and some objection against compulsion based on more than mere aversion, inspection of the children is not compulsory if such people can satisfy the health authority that they are providing adequately for their children through the employment of private practitioners.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, treatment of the children following the ascertainment of defects is not compulsory for any class. But the public conscience has reached a stage at which the health authority must at any rate take cognisance of defects in children who are not otherwise medically provided for and bring these defects to the notice of the parents in the interests of the individual children and of the coming generation generally.  The parent then becomes the arbiter of the child's destiny and he is free to determine <Col N="1956" /> whether a recommended course of treatment will or will not be availed of&mdash;with this exception that where a case of infectious disease is ascertained on inspection the health authority has a further obligation, by virtue of their responsibility for the public health, to safeguard the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the next Part of the Bill.  Part IV deals with infectious disease and infestation.  The provisions on this matter in the original Bill were debated at considerable length and following detailed consideration of the provisions on Committee Stage amendments were prepared for introduction on Report which were intended to modify considerably the major points of contention.  These amendments have been incorporated in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>They include the guarantee that infectious disease regulations will not prescribe compulsory surgical treatment. I may say that I have had considerable doubts as to the wisdom of accepting this amendment even though it is provided in the definition section that &ldquo;surgical treatment&rdquo; does not include hypodermic injection, inoculation or other processes of immunisation or the taking of blood or other specimens for examination or test.  Take the case of a child who may have to be compulsorily isolated for treatment of diphtheria.  Most Deputies will be aware that the operation of tracheotomy is often necessary in such cases to preserve the child's life.  If consent is not forthcoming, then, under this provision, the child must be either allowed to die or the surgeon will have to break the law.  Consent is usually required at present as a matter of course.  But it is a very different matter to provide by law that consent is essential.</P>
    <P>I put it to Deputies to consider this matter and to let me have their views. In my opinion the idea that surgical treatment of an unnecessary or illegal or immoral nature would ever be undertaken by responsible medical officers in this country is entirely fanciful.  The suggestion is a slur on the profession.  And if, which God forbid, concentration camp conditions were ever to develop here, the mere prohibition in an Act of Parliament <Col N="1957" /> would not deter those responsible from indulging in activities which, as far as I can see, must have occurred to the minds of Deputies from a too close proximity to a time in which conditions abroad were abnormal and which we hope will never again recur.</P>
    <P>If, therefore, I have a general expression of willingness from Deputies to delete this proviso against compulsory surgical treatment I shall move an amendment to that effect on Committee Stage.  Otherwise the provision will have to stand.</P>
    <P>Another amendment of the Public Health Bill embodied in the present Bill is the modification of the provisions in relation to the duty of parents to keep children from school and the giving of lodging in dwellings and the use of public conveyances.  These provisions were formerly applicable to persons who were probable sources of infection.  They will now apply only to persons who actually have any of the infectious diseases to which the provisions are applicable.</P>
    <P>Another, and I think a very proper amendment is the provision that, before a person who is a probable source of infection is detained or isolated, he must be actually inspected medically.  Previously it was, I think, contemplated that it might be necessary to get after, for instance, a group of itinerants and detain them without individual medical inspection.  We will take the chance that our service will be sufficiently effective to permit of individual inspection.  A further safeguard of personal freedom which I have had included will ensure that the practicability of detention at home will be considered before a person is compulsorily isolated in a hospital or other place.</P>
    <P>I do not wish at this stage to go over the detailed provisions in relation to compulsory isolation and treatment.  I shall be prepared to discuss them in detail on Committee Stage, but I wish to say now that there may perhaps have been a certain delicacy or reticence as to the matters for which the provisions are primarily intended, a delicacy natural enough but capable of giving rise to considerable misunderstanding. I now say that one of the first and most important conditions <Col N="1958" /> which these provisions are intended to counter is the spread of venereal disease contracted from prostitutes soliciting in the streets.  That statement is not, I think, capable of any misunderstanding. It is not the business of the State or the health authorities to enforce the codes of public morality which are infringed by these conditions but so long as these conditions exist it is, I submit, the duty of the State to ensure as far as possible that the resulting spread of disease will be countered and as far as possible eliminated.</P>
    <P>Venereal disease, like some of the more natural diseases of children to which I have referred earlier, is a process of physical and mental rot which may pursue the unfortunate individual throughout his life.  But, worse still, it can produce another generation of unfortunate innocent children who may be congenital syphilitics.  Many unmarried mothers are found to be infected. Successful treatment of such cases is surely an objective which would justify the procedure proposed.</P>
    <P>I have felt obliged to state the position thus briefly and plainly, in the hope that the discussion which will follow and any consideration of these provisions on Committee Stage will advert to the terrible consequences of letting this menace go unchecked.</P>
    <P>Another serious infectious disease to which the provisions of detention and isolation will be applicable is typhoid. Typhoid carriers may be of two kinds, persistent and intermittent.  To treat them so as to eradicate the sources of infection is often a lengthy and tedious business.  Those people may not be aware of any illness or discomfort and in fact their condition is not dangerous to themselves but here again they represent a class which, all unwittingly, is a menace to the community, and it is for this reason that their detention for treatment and cure is proposed.</P>
    <P>Section 39 contains a revised set of provisions in regard to the maintenance of the dependents of persons suffering from infectious disease.  I should mention that &ldquo;infectious disease&rdquo; there, of course, includes tuberculosis.  The former provisions contemplated that the full cost of maintenance should be met from the <Col N="1959" /> rates.  I went into this matter personally and, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, I have included a provision for half the cost being met by way of State Grant.  Side by side with this new provision I propose to take power to regulate the rates of allowances where necessary.  Such rates may be fixed either too high or too low, and it is to achieve some uniformity in the rates which will be applicable over the country as a whole that I am seeking this permissive power of regulation.  The section is being tightened in other respects, as many Deputies very properly considered that, as formerly drafted, these provisions might be open to abuse.</P>
    <P>I have made other modifications in this Part of the Bill in the respects mentioned in the Explanatory Memorandum, including giving persons an option not to undergo immunisation (except in the case of serious epidemics).  I anticipate that immunisation schemes will be very fully availed of when an effective service is in operation, and in that event the people who opt out, some of them, such as Christian Scientists, on conscientious grounds, will be a danger only to themselves.</P>
    <P>I have had the requirement that a medical officer should notify infestation deleted, while extending the provisions to articles of clothing, etc., as well as to persons.</P>
    <P>The sections about precautions to be taken in relation to schools and public conveyances are also being omitted. These are matters of administrative detail which can be provided for in regulations.</P>
    <P>I think that Section 110 of the former Bill was not discussed in any detail in the Dáil but there were numerous amendments down in relation to it.  It proposed to take very wide powers of regulation and control of the uses to which institutions might be put.  I am absolutely in favour of a system of rationalisation of institutions by reference to their specialised functions and regionalisation of many of them by reference to appropriate areas of the country, but such a process could not be effectively undertaken without including <Col N="1960" /> the voluntary hospitals in it. I hope in the more comprehensive proposals which I shall publish in a White Paper to outline a scheme of this nature which would be contingent on full negotiation and agreement with all the interests concerned.  Meanwhile, the section which replaces that section in the present Bill, viz., Section 40, is related only to the treatment of infectious disease in institutions.  It has been found by experience to be absolutely necessary to prevent the spread of infection or cross-infection.  For instance, it would defeat the whole policy of segregating infectious disease cases if we were to allow open tubercular cases to be treated in the same wards as non-tubercular patients.  It is to remedy such conditions that the present provisions of the section are designed and limited.</P>
    <P>I may briefly describe the purposes of Part V of the Bill as being for the protection of the public from danger to health arising from careless or unsafe preparation of food and to standardise foods which are especially important to the public health.  The powers sought replace and supplement existing powers which have been found to be inadequate.</P>
    <P>The need for the powers sought in this Part is evident.  While many food establishments in this country maintain an adequate standard of cleanliness, I am sure that all Deputies will agree that there are also many which leave much to be desired.  It is necessary that public health administrators should be able to stop the dangerous and careless practices which often give rise to illness and epidemics and from the point of view of nutrition to control the extravagant claims sometimes made for very useless compositions. Standardisation of foods will only affect economically those at present dealing in sub-standard products.  I am sure that the control will be welcomed by the honest manufacturers, traders and caterers as eliminating an unfair economic advantage at present enjoyed by those who do not incur the expense of taking proper public health precautions.</P>
    <P>The form of the regulations made under this Part will be settled after <Col N="1961" /> full consultation with the trade and other interests concerned.  It is hoped that, with their help, a code of food laws will be evolved which will be capable of harmonious and efficient operation.</P>
    <P>Part VI contains somewhat similar powers of control over medical and toilet preparations and certain other articles.  Here again the intentions are to prevent danger to health, from the use of certain preparations and articles, and also to control the sale of preparations purporting to have medical or tonic qualities which in fact they do not possess.</P>
    <P>The opportunity has been taken to repeal the Rag Flock Act to re-enact and extend its provisions to other filling materials.  The intention is to enforce appropriate standards of cleanliness for bedding of all kinds.</P>
    <P>The remaining portions of the Bill have, I think, been adequately explained in the memorandum issued with the Bill.  I have provided in Part X for the establishment of consultative councils on the lines proposed in the previous Bill and in amendment thereof.</P>
    <P>I have omitted the section which defined the health functions of the Minister. They added nothing to his legal powers and, as Minister for Health, I am seeking and will continue to seek from the Oireachtas all the statutory additions to the legal powers already transferred to me which I may consider necessary for the proper implementation of a progressive health policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with a certain amount of hesitation that I rise to discuss this particular measure.  For approximately the 20 years that I have been a member of this House, as a matter of principle I have consistently refrained from undertaking discussion on any legislation introduced by the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  I adopted that particular course lest I might be under suspicion of having obtained at any time in my professional capacity information from inside that Department that might in any way be embarrassing to the Minister in charge of the Bill.  I think it is entirely unnecessary for me to say that never at any <Col N="1962" /> time did I seek to secure, either directly or indirectly, for my own information or the information of colleagues, any information from that Department relating to the business before the Dáil.  However, in face of this new Health Bill, having considered the whole situation very carefully, I came to the conclusion that when a Health Bill was being introduced, laying down the legislation that would affect the health of the people in the country for perhaps many decades to come, laying down, by legislation and regulation, the extent to which that Bill would affect the individual persons making up this country, the extent to which it would enter into every home in the land, and the possible extent to which it might interfere with the ordinary rights of people, there was a very peculiar responsibility on any medical man who happened to be a member of Parliament to state his views, as a result of his experiences, to tender the advice that was the natural outcome of those experiences, and to have those views either accepted or rejected just for what they are worth.  In approaching this particular Bill in that capacity, merely as a medical Deputy who has had a certain number of years of experience, both as a general practitioner and, later on, as a public health medical officer, I do not claim to speak in any representative capacity whatsoever.  I merely speak as an individual medical man expressing my own views, honestly based on my own experiences.  The Minister has his own ways and means of getting the considered views of the majority of the members of the profession, whether as a whole or when subdivided into specialised sections such as public health men.  I do think it is rather unfortunate that, even in debate, this particular Bill should in any way be related to the late and not lamented Public Health Bill of 1945. I think that it would be wiser just to make a new start, as we are, with this Bill.  The other Bill, in my opinion, was a policeman's Bill rather than a medical Bill.  It was a Bill that was ruthlessly going to trample on the human rights of people.  In the interests of health, the one test that was applied to the Public Health Bill of <Col N="1963" /> 1945 was&mdash;is this section sound in the interests of national health?  If the answer was &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, then the Bill said: &ldquo;Go ahead.&rdquo;  That is a very dangerous doctrine; it is a very dangerous road to tread.</P>
      <P>If the only test applied to a Public Health Bill is whether it is sound in the interests of national health, I think no Christian would stand for that.  We must remember that on the eve of the Great War, both in the West and in the East, we had a peculiar kind of health mentality beginning to exhibit itself and we had members of my profession subscribing to some of the new health doctrines.  The new health doctrines that were showing their heads in the East and in the West at that time were the ugly doctrines of the eradication of the unfit, the liquidation of those with transmittable disease, the theory of making it surgically impossible to reproduce the race if there was transmittable disease or transmittable infirmity.  If any of those things were submitted to the mere test&mdash;&ldquo;Is this sound from a health point of view, &mdash;the answer would be, `Yes'.&rdquo;  But would it be right from any human point of view?  The answer would most emphatically be &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  In the old Public Health Bill there was too much of the attitude that, provided a thing was defensible on general public health lines, the rights of the individual did not matter.  Now that Bill, let me say to the Minister, is dead and buried and I congratulate the Minister on that.</P>

      <P>The Minister has come in here as a new Minister, heading a new Department, with a completely new Bill which may contain within it some of the sections of the old Bill that were generally acceptable. I congratulate him on that.  I do not want to have him embarrassed by any recollections of the old Bill or the House confused by the shadow of the old Bill.  This is a completely new Bill, and I have studied it very closely.  On the whole, I regard this Bill as a non-controversial Bill.  I agree with the Minister in expressing the hope that it is a Bill that can be discussed harmoniously. When I say that this is a <Col N="1964" /> non-controversial Bill and that the general principles of the Bill are highly acceptable, I do not mean that it is a Bill that will not require the very closest investigation, the very fullest consideration, and very full criticism in the direction of improving a good Bill in order to make it a better Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill, might I say, like practically every Bill that comes from a Department, represents the desk mentality rather than the mentality of the operative in the field.  From the medical point of view, this Bill represents the mentality of the headquarters medical man sitting at a desk and, from beginning to end, there is a strange absence of the mentality of the medical man at the periphery, the operative in the field, the man who comes up against the practical questions and the practical difficulties.  A blend of these two mentalities would, and I hope will, produce the ideal type of Bill, the Bill that is easy to work, the Bill that understands human reactions and the ordinary difficulties that arise out of human contacts.  It is in that direction that I want to address my remarks.  I should like to approach this Bill by dividing it, as it were, into parts, not so many of the sections divided into so many parts as contained in the Bill itself, but rather to approach the discussion of this Bill from different aspects, namely, (1) the provisions in the Bill itself, (2) the effects of the Bill, and (3) the machinery necessary to implement the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the provisions in the Bill and the aims and objects of the Bill, I think there should be very general agreement with the aims and objects.  It is a Bill that starts out with the object of providing better medical and nursing services for the people as a whole, taking some further steps to prevent the spread, if not to attempt to eradicate, infectious diseases and providing medical advice and, if necessary, medical treatment for expectant mothers, nursing mothers and the child from birth to the age of 16.  With regard to some of the provisions and the ways and means suggested, we have, first of all, a great number of elaborate sections dealing with infectious diseases and the powers <Col N="1965" /> that are taken to deal with those diseases.  You have a continuation of the emergency regulations with regard to the compulsory removal of infectious disease cases to hospitals.</P>
    <P>Now, if I were asked, is it advisable or desirable that any or most cases of infectious disease cases should receive treatment in isolation in a fever hospital, unhesitatingly I would answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  I think every medical man of any experience could answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. But, if the question is put the other way, namely, is it necessary in the year 1947 to take compulsory powers to have such cases removed to hospital, my answer as one person with one person's experience would be emphatically &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I am more than 30 years practising medicine, a number of years as a general practitioner and dispensary doctor, some 18 or 19 years as a public health medical officer with medical charge of a county and dealing specifically and in a peculiar way with infectious disease, with some years in between as chief of the Army medical service.  During those 30 years I can say truthfully and honestly that never even once did I come across any single case that should be treated in a hospital and that was not treated in a hospital &mdash;not even one case.  But I can remember very many cases where it required tact and patience and perseverance in order to get the patient to go to hospital or to get the parents to agree to send the child to hospital.  I remember one house at a distance that I had to visit no less than seven times and I had to pick up a very highly-respected clergyman and bring him back to the house to add his powers of persuasion to mine.  Later on I had to get a retired school teacher to come with me to the house to add his powers of persuasion to mine.  That was the most difficult case I ever had.  Finally, that child went to the fever hospital with happy and contented parents behind and with a smile on his face and we left that house with the blessings of the family.  The powers were there under the emergency regulations.  At the very first refusal we could have requisitioned a couple of Civic Guards and we could have had that patient forcibly removed from the home to the fever hospital.  The patient would go <Col N="1966" /> away in tears, the parents would be left at home in tears and that very atmosphere and experience would seriously jeopardise the prospects of a cure, or, at all events, anything like a smooth and speedy cure.</P>
    <P>Here in Ireland, unlike a number of very near countries, the success of the medical profession has been built mainly on the degrees of understanding and the amount of affection between the public and the doctor.  The medical man, particularly in rural Ireland, is something more than just a medical attendant; he is a kind of friend, an adviser, a counsellor for the people, and the success of medicine in Ireland has grown out of the amount of respect and confidence that the people have in the medical profession.  That is the name we have at home and abroad and I would be sorry to see the practice of medicine being carried out in this country under the shadow of a policeman's baton in any particular field of its activities.</P>
    <P>Cases were cited where it was necessary to have compulsory powers.  The itinerant class, the mobile tinkers, the people who are in one district to-night and who, like the Arabs, fold their camps and disappear and are in another bailiwick to-morrow, and who have been carrying cases of infectious disease with them, were always a problem. I think even our own public health laws from 1864 met that particular type of case; it met the type of infectious disease that was a menace to the public and had no fixed abode or no particular provision for the safe-guarding of the neighbour.  But, if the general rule is based on that particular type of case, then have your compulsory powers with regard to that case but, in my opinion, they are unnecessary and unwise with reference to the general run of cases.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister or anybody else may say: &ldquo;If you do not want these powers you need not use them; they need not be used and what harm are they doing to anybody?&rdquo; Neither the Minister nor myself is a prophet; neither the Minister nor myself can speak for posterity.  The very minute that becomes our health code, there will be younger men coming out of the schools who will be trained in this type of medicine in association with law. <Col N="1967" /> They will not be trained along the old principles that the first thing necessary in the practice of medicine is to get the confidence of your patient and your patient's parents.</P>
    <P>The public health man of the future, educated in this newly suggested code, will rely on the police, will rely on the law, rather than on his own tact, his own powers of persuasion and his own powers to induce respect and confidence. I think it will lead to a gradual deterioration in the professional outlook of members of our profession in the future.  I do not think that there is any indication that any such steps are necessary or desirable.</P>
    <P>We had a lot made about a situation in Connemara.  We had reference to a mobile group somewhere in Connacht. We had one or two episodes of that kind and we had, of course, the departmental view.  I would be inclined to ask the question: was every possible power used or every possible influence used before the legal order had to be put in force, and, the legal order being enforced and having set authorities going compulsorily to remove cases to hospital, was there an immediate benefit?  Was there a resultant loss?</P>
    <P>If the general powers asked for here are necessary or defensible in certain zones or areas, I suggest to the Minister that he should make these powers adoptive; if any administrative body wants to adopt legal compulsion behind the medical work of the county, let them adopt it the same as all adoptive Acts are applied to certain areas, but do not apply them to the country generally.</P>
    <P>What I say with regard to infectious diseases applies with greater force to school medical attendance.  The School Medical Attendance Acts have been in operation in this country in different counties from 15 to 20 years. They have been operating very smoothly.  I have had 17 or 18 years' experience in one county and it might be of interest to recite briefly my experience. When I took over public health work in County Meath I took over duty in the midst of a hectic political storm.  Anyone who was not a <Col N="1968" /> political supporter more or less thought I was going there as a political agent, and it was their business to embarrass me in my duties to the greatest extent they could because they thought I was there to carry out a political job, to be the spearhead of a political Party.</P>
    <P>Everyone was pulled into that, school managers and school teachers.  I went to schools for school medical inspection and never found as much as a mouse on the floor.  I had certain legal weapons behind me with regard to school attendance.  I did not use one of them; I merely went to the next school.  That school might be empty and the next school half-full, but if I found any children in a school I did my job and these children got glasses or got their teeth removed and, where that was required, they got diseased tonsils removed.  In the schools where the boycott was on the children were trying to read with their squints and with the books up against their eyes. Every second week they had a swollen jaw from a rotten tooth and they were snuffling and sniffling with their adenoids and tonsils.</P>
    <P>Then they began to see the value of school medical inspection.  There were no compulsory powers used, although there was a law with regard to school attendance.  The news was passed from one school to the next, and the result is apparent from a report that I have for the year before the war began, the last normal year and the last year a report was issued.  The attendance at school medical inspections all over that county is considerably above the average attendance and is 99 per cent. of the pupils on the roll. That was brought about merely by cooperation between parents, teachers and medical men.  Remember, my results are in no way exceptional.  Do not think they are.  An exceptional case is where there is any avoidance of school medical inspection.</P>
    <P>Practically in every county in Ireland, parents, teachers and even children value the services they are getting through school medical attention. There may be one or two areas where the service is not being fully availed of.  Why blame the children <Col N="1969" /> or why blame the parents?  Very often these services break down from want of tact on behalf of some of the personnel of the machinery working the service. It may be the medical officer, it may be the nurse, it may be somebody else who is tactless and turns people against it.  I heard with a certain amount of amazement the Parliamentary Secretary on a former occasion stating that the reason that compulsory powers were taken was because&mdash;I do not pretend to quote his exact words&mdash; there was a great number of children avoiding school medical inspection or absent on the day of school medical inspection and that in most cases it was those who wanted medical inspection most who were absent.  I did not query or contradict the Parliamentary Secretary, but I do not think that over the last 18 years there has been a single annual report produced by any school medical inspector in any county in Ireland which I have not read and studied.  I cannot just remember any single report that indicated that there was any studied or deliberate avoidance of medical inspection. I attend conferences of my colleagues in the public health services every couple of months, and I never heard anything of the kind suggested.</P>
    <P>I believe that school medical inspection is going on very satisfactorily and very harmoniously, that confidence is growing in that service and that parents, teachers and managers are looking more and more to the value of that service.  That being so, even in the backward counties, the utilisation of that service is increasing year by year, and I think it is a grave blunder to associate it with any form of compulsion now.  If the thing is a failure then by all means let the courts come to the assistance of the service.  If it were going backwards&mdash;and I know there is no evidence of that&mdash;I think it is desk enthusiasm for getting the work done that is at the back of these compulsory provisions.  Without a linking up between the desk mentality and the field mentality, you would not have compulsory powers.  If there is a particular area where compulsory powers are required, then deal with that area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1970" /> Again, the Minister or anybody might say: &ldquo;If you do not want the powers you need not use them.&rdquo;  I do not think that is an answer and the Minister will not be very long presiding over his present Department when he will agree with me that it is not an answer.  Say that you pass the Bill with these compulsory powers providing that children must attend school medical inspection, and that I fix a school medical inspection for a certain day at a certain school where there are 230 children on the rolls and that 204 children attend that medical inspection. When the returns come up at the end of the month I shall probably be asked: &ldquo;Of the 26 children absent, in how many cases have you got a certificate that they have been adequately inspected elsewhere?&rdquo; I reply: &ldquo;Six.&rdquo; What is the next letter that will come? &ldquo;What steps do you propose to take in regard to the other 20?&rdquo; I reply: &ldquo;None.&rdquo;  The next month, in reply to a similar query, I reply: &ldquo;None.&rdquo;  A point is then reached when I get the Act hurled at my head and I am told I am not making use of the provisions there to assist them.  That is done through the manager.</P>
    <P>I am talking with knowledge and with sincerity.  I am talking from the absolute conviction that the advice I am giving is in the best interests of Irish medicine and Irish youth.  Compulsion and medicine are completely incompatible.  Compulsion and the Irish character are completely incompatible. Compulsion is not required. If there is an area where there is a case built up for acquiring these compulsory powers, then again I say let these powers be adoptive and give any particular council, any manager or any county medical officer who applies, leave to operate these powers but do not be shoving policemen on to those who are doing their work quite successfully as it is.</P>
    <P>There is another side in connection with this unnatural association between medicine and law.  I think it is a side of which the Department over which the Minister presides is never conscious and that is administration.  We shall take the case I have been discussing. Take these 26 absentees from that particular school this week and 26 <Col N="1971" /> absentees from another school next week.  We reach a point when the Department has goaded the unfortunate medical officer down the country into taking legal action in accordance with the provisions of this Bill.  There are 52 prosecutions in all.  It is not just simply a case of rambling into the courthouse on a fine morning, saying that so-and-so's child was absent from school medical inspection and then sitting down to hear what the Bench has to say about it.  You are put there and you are asked in accordance with the Act: &ldquo;Are you in a position to give evidence that this child's parents got due and adequate notice of the date of the medical inspection?  Have you a mental photograph of every case? Have you ever made a mistake in your records by leaving any case out or have you ever made a mistake in a name?&rdquo; You are called into court and you have to remain there while prosecutions for brawls, drunks and unlighted vehicles are dealt with.  I had an experience of going to court in connection with the Housing and Miscellaneous Provisions Act and again with the Milk and Dairies Act&mdash;only once, thanks be to goodness, in each case.  I learned a lesson.  I was like a travelling clown going from one courthouse to another in County Meath.  In connection with the milk and dairies case, I appeared in five different courts before the case was heard.  Then I was asked to prove the bacteriologist's certificate as to the condition of the milk.  Had I anybody from the laboratory to prove that it was the sample I had sent up and that that was its condition?</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department knows that, in that particular case, there was an appeal to the High Court.  I do not know how many nights I sat up in the Four Courts after the courts had closed, in conference with junior barristers and senior barristers and solicitors, while that case was pending &mdash;I am sure seven or eight nights&mdash;and the case finally never came to court. I was in another housing case that went for two years from court to court and was then settled at a cost of £700 or £800.  These Bills very lightly suggest court action and lay down penalties, but I should like the Minister to <Col N="1972" /> get a couple of legal men sitting down with him to give him a picture of what is entailed in one prosecution under any of these clauses.  My experience is that life is too short for that kind of thing, and, when the machine is running smoothly and running well, the wise pilot will not fiddle with it.</P>
    <P>I give the Minister one last example of health and law.  There is a regulation which prohibits the sale of mussels for human consumption, if the mussels are taken from a certain belt of the coast.  Mussels are taken from that belt of the coast in cart-loads, hundreds of tons every week, and it is in my administrative area.  It is in contravention of the regulations; it is illegal; but they go to Sheffield and Leeds and are sold there for human consumption, and the British health authorities objected.  I was told to take action in accordance with the regulations.  There is nothing illegal in any man picking up a mussel and putting it on a cart, and I cannot stop him picking mussels and putting them on carts.  The railway company, when I tried to get them to stop carrying the mussels, said: &ldquo;Under such-and-such an Act, we are bound to carry anything tendered to us for carriage.&rdquo;  They carried them, and, when I got legal opinion, I found that I would have to sit on top of a sack of mussels in Mornington and keep sitting on that sack until it reached Sheffield and until I saw the bag of mussels under me being sold for human consumption.</P>

      <P>Those are the difficulties which arise, and there is a tendency inside the Department of Local Government, which I hope will not be transmitted to the Ministry of Health, lightly to invoke legal powers and to think: &ldquo;Everything is rosy now; we have the law behind us.&rdquo;  But remember that the unfortunate instrument they have is not a legal man.  He is a medical man and every one of us is terrified of law, hates the courts and does not want the law to be brought to his assistance in his profession at all.  So much for some of the provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing I regret very much is that we should have a Health Bill in 1947, <Col N="1973" /> when we are aspiring to make this island an aerial link between East and West, bringing the Far East within a few days, if not a few hours, and the Western Continent within six or seven hours of our shores&mdash;that is our aim and ambition, our desire and our intention&mdash;in which we choose to repeal the Vaccination Acts.  I could understand a layman doing that, a layman who had been badly advised; I cannot understand any medical man doing it. I am not going to assert dogmatically what the properties of vaccination are, but vaccination is, if not a guarantee, a protection against smallpox, and to remove that protection from our people at a time when we are bringing the East right up against our shores &mdash;and smallpox, as the Minister knows, is mainly a disease of the East &mdash;is a step which it is difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>The retreat is covered up in the White Paper by saying that, in the event of an outbreak of smallpox, powers will be taken to vaccinate.  Did the Minister get medical advice supporting him in that view?  Did he ever come up against even a suggested case of smallpox and try to vaccinate, with all the machinery of the Army available, with transport, with unlimited helpers, unlimited doctors and unlimited nurses?  On one occasion, there was a report of a case landing at Haulbowline and that meant that every person who had had contact with Haulbowline had to be vaccinated, and speedily vaccinated.</P>
    <P>The news arrived within six or eight hours and the scatter of people was as far as from Haulbowline to Nenagh. People had to be hunted all around the place to be vaccinated.</P>
    <P>Did the Minister read of the Glasgow epidemic quite recently?  With all the ample machinery that is available to the British Health Department for vaccinating in advance of the case, the Glasgow contacts had reached the south of Wales.  The epidemic had reached the south of Wales well in advance of the vaccinators.  It is nonsense to talk of vaccinating in face of an outbreak of smallpox.  You cannot keep in advance of the outbreak. Take a case landing at Rineanna.  He has been a little seedy on the plane and when he gets off the plane, he proceeds <Col N="1974" /> to Limerick by bus, has a meal in Limerick and goes to Dublin by motor. He stays, say, in the Shelbourne and then goes up north.  This is all done very easily within three days.  On the third day, having been seedy all the time, the rash comes, and remember that in this country we have not seen smallpox, or very few of us have not seen smallpox, and the first stage of smallpox is not going to be diagnosed just as quickly as a broken leg.  Let us say that even three days elapse and that then it is found to be smallpox.  Where are your contacts?  How are you going to get after them?  What became of the 25 people in the bus from Rineanna to Limerick?  What became of the people in the hotel in Limerick?  What of the people who travelled up, the people in the Shelbourne, the people at the races that evening or at the theatre or pictures that night?  And you will vaccinate ahead of the epidemic !</P>
    <P>It may be defensible on any other grounds to drop vaccination this year in this Bill, but it is not defensible on health grounds.  There is an objection to vaccination&mdash;it is historical and political. It was compulsory under the British Government, and we in this country were out to break every British law we could, and that was one of the laws which it was popular to break. There was a provision in England for conscientious objectors, which did not apply to us, and consequently it was easy enough to arouse indignation against that law, the breaking of which was one of the things adopted in a major struggle by the Sinn Féin organisation.</P>
    <P>There was a reason for it at the time &mdash;not a health reason but a political reason and a national reason. I do not think that that should be transmitted down along the line.  It is bad health policy.  In association with the dropping of vaccination, you have a Bill which is making provision for immunisation against other infectious diseases. In my very humble opinion, we are inclined to go too fast in that direction. I believe in letting the test be done on the big fellow and, when it is successful, apply it to the little fellow. I believe that general immunisation <Col N="1975" /> against infectious disease is only in the phase of trial.  The Minister will not forget that, 15 years ago, immunisation against diphtheria was taken up as a new protective.  It was urged over the radio and elsewhere.  Immunisation against diphtheria was being done then with the one-shot method.  Since then, we have learned that we might as well have been squirting it through a window. It was so much labour lost.  Let all that experimenting, or most of it, be done in a country with greater population, more disease and far more finance than we have.  When a thing is proven sound, then adopt it here compulsorily or as Departmental policy.</P>
    <P>Immunisation against diphtheria has reached a very high degree of efficiency and success.  I am all for it.  But, remember, big proprietary firms have waded into medicine.  They have immense publicity and immense wealth behind that publicity.  They are able, to a certain extent, to command the support even of medical journals.  There is power pressure behind proprietary articles and preventives which are being put on the medical market now-adays. My advice is to be cautious and conservative in this matter before we generally apply it with any degree of national policy or compulsion behind it.</P>
    <P>There is one other point on that question of immunisation.  Immunisation in the city is one thing, because the population, as they grow up and move about in trams and buses and go to picture-houses, have a degree of acquired immunity, so that no harm whatever is done by immunising a minority within a city.  Remember, however, that immunised children or an immunised group inside any population can be carriers of disease without throwing out any symptoms.  An unimmunised person who gets the germ throws out symptoms, gets sick and is removed from the general public, whereas the immunised person can carry around the germs without throwing out any symptoms.  A vast weight of medical opinion here and elsewhere considers it a mistake to immunise a minority inside a majority community.  I admit freely that, if we stick it out and keep immunising year after year, in the <Col N="1976" /> course of time&mdash;perhaps 20 years&mdash;we shall have wiped out diphtheria.  But what is the price we shall pay in the years between?  I had no immunisation in County Meath up to the year of suggested evacuation.  I had an average of only nine cases of diphtheria per annum&mdash;all children.  Because evacuation from Dublin was threatened and immunised Dublin children would come down on top of the Meath children as so many carriers, I had to immunise 13,000 odd children in Meath.  What are my diphtheria rates since?  An average of in or about 50 a year&mdash;and the bulk of these adults. That shows that it is not all easy weather.  There are pros and cons in all these matters.  That is why I suggest that the desk mentality and the field mentality should be brought more into contact before legislative proposals are introduced.</P>
    <P>This Bill has one very welcome provision. That relates to the establishment of a health advisory council.  It was not necessary to introduce a Bill in order to have a consultative council. I think that the consultative council, or a consultative council, should have been operating on this Bill before it reached this point.  When a Bill is in draft, the Ministerial colours are, to a great extent, nailed to the mast.  To get a Bill altered at this stage is difficult and the effort may appear to be controversial.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other provisions, I strongly urge the Minister to withdraw those which are bringing in an element of legal compulsion to the practice of medicine.  If there is a particularly strong case in any administrative area which must be met, then meet it in that particular area by making the powers here adoptive where there is a special call but do not apply them elsewhere.  With regard to the effects of this Bill, I wonder if they have been fully considered.  A kind of legislative precedent is universally recognised, that, when any legislation undertaken by an Assembly interferes violently with vested interests or interferes with the material position of individuals, that legislation will bear on its face provision for compensating the individuals.  Take the <Col N="1977" /> medical profession.  The whole Dáil may not be very excited about this matter but the Dáil has a sense of fair play.  The medical profession in this country can be roughly divided into three classes.  In the first class, are those who rely entirely, or mainly, on private practice.  There are very few of those outside the city.</P>
    <P>The next big class are the dispensary medical officers, who in the main rely for their livelihood on private practice. Then you have the clinical hospital men and the specialist group. What do we propose to do in this Bill, if it is ever carried out in its fullness &mdash;and the Bill is not worth while taking seriously unless it is intended to implement it, and implement it early?  There is too much of a tendency to put an attractive sample in a Ministerial shop window and to have empty shelves behind in the shop; and I fear, from some remarks made by the Minister in introducing this Bill, that this is going to be one of those shams, that we will not see it materialise in our lifetime to anything like its fullness.  I am devoting myself to this Bill in the hope that it is seriously intended and will be put into operation.</P>
    <P>Take the private practitioner outside the City of Dublin.  What are you going to do under this Bill?  Every expectant mother, every nursing mother, is to get free medical attention; every child from birth to the age of 16 will get free medical attention. A couple of weeks ago, we introduced another Bill, dealing with national health, so as to raise the income level to £500, and under which every family with an income of less than £500 may get free medical benefits.  There are experienced medical Deputies opposite who will agree with me that any doctor in general practice makes anything from 70 to 80 per cent. of his income out of children, that the decent parents send lightly for a doctor when the child is sick, but the parent himself must be very ill before he will spend money on himself in feeing a doctor.</P>
    <P>If the Bill is implemented and if the people avail of it, the treatment of every type of illness and ailment, in <Col N="1978" /> every child in Ireland up to the age of 16, will be free, for every expectant mother and for every nursing mother also.  That income will be taken from the present income of the private practitioner. Alongside of that, you have this National Health Insurance Bill to which I referred.  Are you not wiping that man financially out of existence? Has there been any discussion, any agreement as to how you will compensate that man for robbing him of his livelihood?  Deputies in other Parties understand the importance of the principle I am talking about in association with doctors.  Labour men and others have always secured, as far as they could, that when legislation was going through this House which would deprive men of their livelihood there would be a court of one kind or another established to arbitrate, so that reasonable compensation would be provided. What is the proposal in this Bill with regard to this?  That type of private practitioner, if the Bill is ever worked in its fullness, will be completely wiped out.</P>
    <P>The next group affected is the most numerous group of medical men in the country, the dispensary doctor.  Let no Deputy think that any dispensary doctor in rural Ireland has ever taken up the appointment because of the salary.  The salary paid to any doctor in rural Ireland does not run his car, does not pay for the maintenance, running costs and renewal of a car.  It merely gives him rolling stock so as to put him into a district where the main end of his livelihood must be secured from practice.  You take every patient, expectant mother, nursing mother, every child suffering from any ailment up to the age of 16, and you put them on the non-fee basis.  Is there any discussion with regard to compensation? I know the Minister said in introducing the Bill that he intends to do it in steps, by nibbles, by bits, but remember once this Bill goes through, it is the law.  Then any man in a job may be told: &ldquo;Very well, that is the law and these are the duties you have to carry out, and anything you get for those duties is going to be given to you gratuitously, whatever the Minister for Finance will sanction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Has the matter been taken up with <Col N="1979" /> the Department of Finance?  We had the Most Rev. Dr. Dignan's scheme scoffed out of this House some years ago.  Why?  Because it was thoroughly unsound, the Minister told us, until it was associated directly with its cost, until the financial cost of it was laid down.  In this Bill, do we hear a hint of the cost, or have we any picture of it?  Has the Minister any idea of the cost or any idea as to how much of it will be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance?  Has it been discussed and thrashed out yet with the Minister for Finance?  If it has not, then I say that the medical profession is being very unfairly treated.  They are being walked into a rat-trap in blinkers.  The British attempted legislation along these lines, but on a much bigger scale.  How did they do it?  Did they say: &ldquo;Live horse and you will get hay&rdquo;?  Did they say: &ldquo;Walk into my parlour,&rdquo; like the spider to the fly? For two years before they came to the House of Commons with the legislation, they had been in constant session with representatives of the profession who would be affected, adversely or otherwise, by the proposed legislation. To a very great extent, the legislation was framed with the knowledge of how it affected the various people concerned. Fairly ample provision was made for dealing with them and since its introduction the provisions for compensation were increased by 50 per cent.  Here we have the Bill, and we are asked to make it law and make it mandatory on every doctor in the country and then leave the profession to the tender mercies of the Minister for Finance, and the Minister for Health will say: &ldquo;Too bad, boys, I did my best; I am sympathetic, but the lad around the corner will not give.&rdquo;  That is very consoling to a man who has lost his livelihood.</P>
    <P>Before we get through the Committee Stage, the Minister must be more expansive than he was in his opening speech.  He must let the people affected by the Bill know what they will get by way of compensation for the damage done to them by the Bill.  He must let representatives of the taxpayers&mdash;and a great many of them are <Col N="1980" /> also representatives of the ratepayers &mdash;know what this Bill in fullness will cost (a) the taxpayer, and (b) the ratepayer.</P>
    <P>The next portion of the Bill is the machinery.  What is the proposed machinery to carry out this particular Bill in its fullness?  I know the Minister does not for a moment think that the Bill can be fully operated over the existing dispensary districts by the existing dispensary men, no matter what pay is given.</P>
    <P>The estimate that I have heard is that this Bill will require from 300 to 500 extra doctors, and 1,000 nurses.  I do not know what the salaries given will be but certainly at a low figure the cost will be £500,000 a year.  On a 50-50 basis £250,000 would come from the rates and £250,000 from taxes. That figure may be an under-estimate or an over-estimate, but there should be an estimate somewhere.  If I am grossly wrong let us have an estimate. That is the salary side of it.  What about the institution side?  Where are these grand child-welfare and maternity clinics going to be held in each dispensary district?  Does the Minister suggest that 2 per cent. of our existing dispensaries could be utilised for such a purpose?  He knows and will agree with me that, in nearly 100 per cent. of our depôt dispensaries, or in the majority of our dispensaries, neither he nor I would use them to amputate a puppy's tail.  New premises will be required in practically every dispensary district.  Let us say that the cost will be from £1,000 to £2,000.  What is the estimated cost for buildings where an institution is required under the Bill?  Will any man with a sense of responsibility say that we are not entitled to get this information?  I am asking for an estimate because nobody would think of pinning the Minister to any firm figure.</P>
    <P>This Bill, when working in its fullness, will require so much extra money per annum for increased salaries for the people remaining in the service, for new salaries for the extra ones that will have to be called in, and new salaries for nurses.  Can we have an estimate of the amount for increases <Col N="1981" /> in salaries for medical people, for nurses, for lecturers and supervisors, and an estimate of the number of persons of each class required, an estimate of the annual cost of the new services, an estimate of the premises required, an estimate of what the cost of the new buildings will be, an estimate of the compensation that will be paid to people who are either liquidated or seriously injured in their livelihood as a result of this Bill?  I think everyone is alive now to the fact that this Bill is really built around the nurses.  The nurse is the foundation figure in it. The provision of even one nurse for every dispensary district in the country is a matter of finding 500 or 600 nurses. I estimate that in every dispensary district, when you take the schools and the maternity and child welfare schemes into account, two nurses will be required for each district.  That means approximately 1,000.  You cannot get them by going into Wool-worth's and you do not pick nurses off hawthorn bushes.  Every doctor in the House knows that since the end of the war, it has been virtually impossible to get the services of nurses at any price.  On account of the tragedy that rolled over Europe, and the amount of human damage done as well as the number of wrecks that were left, the reaction to replace all that by better health measures has meant that nurses have at last come into their own.  In this country they were all the time the most downtrodden class of ladies that ever practised a profession. They were underpaid and badly treated.  They had impossible service hours, but the last couple of years have brought a change so that there is a complete dearth of nurses now.  How are 1,000 nurses going to be procured?</P>
    <P>Has the Minister any suggestion to make as to when this Bill, if passed next week, will be implemented? There is no appointed day and there is no estimated price for anything. There are no proposals before the House as to where the workmen and workwomen are to come from.  I agree absolutely with the aims of the Bill, and with its provisions, subject to this slight reservation that I would like to see the compulsory powers go or kept <Col N="1982" /> only in an adoptive manner, every county being left to please itself as to whether it will have them or not.  I also want to know from the Minister how he is going to provide in the Bill for the damage done to the individual in his income, and what is his mental time-table with regard to putting this Bill into operation.  Finally, what does he think will be the cost of the Bill when it is put into operation?</P>

      <P>In spite of what Deputy O'Higgins has said, I am prepared to welcome the Bill, and particularly the Minister's approach to the matters that he proposes to deal with in it.  I am pleased that he has consulted with and is prepared to consult with the members of the medical profession.  The fact that he is prepared to do that is to my mind proof that he does not intend to do any of the things that Deputy O'Higgins fears he might do.  I am sure the Minister will consult with the members of the profession before he puts any of the controversial provisions of the Bill into operation.  I am also pleased, in spite of the objections which Deputy O'Higgins has raised to it, that he is introducing the mother and child service.  That will require examination because the nurses mentioned by Deputy O'Higgins will have to be provided.  I agree that they cannot be provided overnight.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be wise enough to see that the nurses are specially trained for that work and that he will put the scheme into operation only when he feels that it can be efficiently carried out.  The mother and child service will be a great boon to the general body of the people throughout the country and will be welcomed by them.  It will be a great help to dispensary doctors and other doctors in getting at early cases of tuberculosis, deformities, such as club foot, and other diseases like that. It will also help to improve the general health of the community, particularly as this service will be continued until the child reaches the age of 16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one type of case that will be particularly difficult to trace, that is, cases of mental deficiency.  I find from my experience in a country district that I have been visiting houses for several years without knowing that mental deficients <Col N="1983" /> lived there.  These things are considered a slur on the family by the people in general and I do not think that inspection at schools, and such like, will get at that trouble.  The Minister in his capacity as Minister for Social Welfare should introduce legislation whereby children suffering from mental deficiency would get some benefit from the State.  People might then be induced to come forward and disclose to us the extent of that problem. If some inducement is not offered to the parents of mentally defective children I fear that it will take a long time for us to discover the true extent of the problem.  It is most distressing to go into houses to discover such cases. It is only when the parents are getting old and when the son who is to get the place is getting married that I have succeeded in finding out some such cases.  Unless there is some inducement to the parents of such children in the form of a grant, gratuity or weekly allowance, we will never get at the problem as it really is.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy O'Higgins when he says that the provisions asked for in this Bill in connection with infectious diseases are too drastic.  I am perfectly satisfied that those powers will not be asked for and that doctors, as I know them, will never call in Guards or the legal profession to cope with any problem that arises.  There is one thing, however, that we propose to tackle under this Bill, and I am glad we are doing it, that is, venereal disease. I could conceive that in such circumstances we might have to invoke the provisions of this Bill.  Otherwise, I think the profession could be relied upon to deal tactfully and there would be no danger of coercion being introduced by the medical profession. Deputy O'Higgins feared that because such provisions might be on the Statute Book at some future date the medical profession might abuse these provisions.  I would be sorry to think that the medical profession would ever degenerate to the extent that Deputy O'Higgins envisaged.  I am quite sure he was not serious when he suggested that there was any likelihood of the medical profession degenerating to that extent, that they would become <Col N="1984" /> mindful of the law rather than strive to alleviate suffering and relieve distress. I believe that nurses and doctors can be relied upon, as the Minister has said, to use persuasive powers rather than coercion.</P>
    <P>There was a point raised by Deputy O'Higgins which I think is well worthy of consideration by the Minister in regard to the increased duties that will be imposed upon dispensary doctors and dispensary midwives.  I quite agree that the great percentage of income of doctors in rural districts is derived from their private practice rather than from the very meagre salary that is being paid to them at the present time, but I am sure the Minister will continue to consult with the medical profession and, when any controversial problem like this will arise, will be prepared to meet the members of the profession and to discuss any problem with them.  By so doing he will ensure the full co-operation of all sections of the medical profession in any efforts he may undertake to improve the health of the people generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no intention of intervening in the debate until I heard Deputy O'Higgins, in relation to the proposed abolition of compulsory vaccination against smallpox, referring to the mysterious gentleman who arrived from the air at Rineanna and who proceeded to&mdash;I think it was Cruise's Hotel he mentioned&mdash;took a train or bus to Dublin, stayed in the Shelbourne and then proceeded to the north and in the course of his peregrinations infected some thousands of people with smallpox.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dr. O'Higgins also said that he was opposed to forced hospitalisation of infectious cases generally.  He made no reference, however, to the fact that a man who was suffering from, say, open tuberculosis, who boarded a bus in Cork and who came to Dublin could infect a number of people in the course of his journey.  I am, I must say, altogether in favour of powers being given to the responsible medical authorities where the occasion requires it, forcibly to hospitalise, if necessary, <Col N="1985" /> certain types of infectious diseases. Deputy O'Higgins referred to cases where he had to go back five or six times, where he had to get the parish priest to persuade the parents to allow an infectious case to go to hospital. I am by no means in favour of that because, by the time the doctor has gone five or six times to inspect the case and to persuade the parents and to persuade the parish priest to persuade the parents, a number of persons in the district can be infected.  I think the power proposed in the Bill is very necessary and will not be abused by a responsible medical man.</P>
    <P>I am not quite so happy about the proposals regarding ante-natal care and the responsibility for looking after the various cases of illness in children under 16 and the responsibility of looking after maternity cases.  I am not quite so sure what the Minister proposes in that respect.  What I gather is that the district medical officer would be responsible for looking after every case of maternity which would occur in his district notwithstanding the means of the people.  I think the medical profession as a whole will oppose that because while it is well recognised that the patient has a right to choose her own doctor, there is also a well recognised right on the doctor's part, if necessary, to choose his patient.  As far as I gathered from the Bill it would be obligatory on the district medical officer to attend every case in the disrict which required his attention.  I think the medical profession generally will oppose that very strongly.  I do not think it is right that the district medical officer should be responsible for attending to all children under the age of 16 in his district irrespective of the income or the financial position of the parents.  That is not right at all. There are certain families in every district who, by right, should contribute to the support of practitioners who have to live by private practice and I do not think it should be asked of the district medical officer to attend the dependents of these people.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to ante-natal care.  Ante-natal care, as understood in medical circles, is a matter of comparatively recent growth.  There are men in dispensary districts who have <Col N="1986" /> been practising for 25 and 30 years who have not been trained in what is known as &ldquo;ante-natal care&rdquo;.  How does the Minister expect these men to assume responsibility for a subject in which they have not been trained?</P>
    <P>I must say that I welcome the Bill. We dispensary doctors generally and, I think, the medical service generally have been functioning under a medical service which I think was introduced some 70 or 80 years ago, and which is completely out of date.  Speaking for myself and, I think, speaking for the medical profession generally, we welcome this measure, but we hope that before the Bill is passed the Minister will again consult with the representative members of the profession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins, speaking on behalf of our Party, welcomed this Bill in principle.  He then criticised severely the machinery of the Bill.  To that I would like to join my voice.  While Deputy O'Higgins gave qualified approval to what is in this Bill, I for my part would rather see this Bill covering a far wider range of things.  There are things that it does not, in fact, include, but it is late in the day now.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins has questioned the wisdom of taking compulsory powers with regard to infectious diseases.  I join with him in an appeal to the Minister on that ground.  I think anybody who knows this country knows that if you want to kill any proposal, even a very good proposal, a sound proposal, a wise proposal&mdash; if you want to kill it <i>ab initio</i>&mdash;the way to do it is to take compulsory measures to carry it out.  Deputy O'Higgins has quoted from his own experience.  I have been looking through reports which he has here&mdash; one is the Ninth Annual Medical Report on County Meath, and the other is the fifteenth.  They bear out everything that he has said as to what took place there under his administration as an officer of public health.  My own experience in my native county bears that out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are always told in regard to these measures when they are being introduced that they will never be <Col N="1987" /> drastically put into operation whereas, in practice, everyone of us knows that the moment an Act is put into operation the officers of the Department concerned see to it that every one of these things will, in fact, be put into operation and, in so far as they can, have them carried out.  I think the suggestion of Deputy Dr. O'Higgins that these compulsory proposals should be made adoptive was a wise one.  The county manager and the county council, in any given case, when it was discovered that public health officers were being frustrated in carrying out the proposals of the Bill for the benefit of the people, could adopt them and make them compulsory in that county.</P>
    <P>The next matter&mdash;it is one that is on moral grounds&mdash;that gives me the most serious consideration, is the results of the Bill on the medical profession.  I hold no brief for the medical profession at all.  I approach this purely on moral grounds.  Those Deputies who have taken any interest at all in the proposals that have developed in England under Lord Woolton and Lord Beveridge will know that one of the big questions which was kept continuously under review and representation was the question of making reparation to those who were being penalised by the operation of the Act, namely, the medical profession.  It is two, three or four years ago since this matter began to be considered in detail and I forget what the actual sum of money was, but it was colossal.  Our sum, of course, would not be anything approaching that.  But if we are demanding certain things in the interests of public health and the well-being of the community we have got to bear the consequences. Speaking for myself, knowing what has happened on various occasions in the past, I am not going to be a party to and vote for this Bill until ample provision is made for doctors who are going to be penalised.  Is this House recklessly going to pass a Bill purporting to be a Public Health Bill when at the same time we are going to do irreparable damage to men whose parents provided the money to educate them and who have spent all these years in the <Col N="1988" /> public service on a mere borderline income, serving the public night and day?  Anybody coming from rural Ireland will know of the enormous sacrifices that these people have made in the cause of the sick and, particularly of the sick poor.  It is not necessary to go into specific cases.  One could not find words to describe the work they have done and the sacrifices they have made, practically without fee or reward, in the interests of the sick poor.  Now when a Public Health Bill is brought in, there is nothing specific in it as to what sum of money will be given to these men to provide for them in their old age.  Many of them are over 60 years of age.  They have trudged on foot over the bogs and the highways carrying a bag of maternity instruments for the last seven years since petrol rationing began.  They have even gone seven miles on foot and seven miles back in rain and snow. They have seriously injured their health during those years in serving the public.  At the end, we have this Bill here under which many of them will be thrown on the roadside.</P>
    <P>I ask that this Bill should not be proceeded with until such time as an actuarial examination has been made as to the actual cost of making reasonable provision for these men, not ample provision, because these men have never been amply or justly paid for the services they have rendered to the community.  We could have nothing but the profoundest admiration for the services they have rendered.  I would not like to be a party now to throwing them on the roadside without provision being made for them.  We should have a detailed statement on that matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to know whether the consultative council mentioned in the Bill has been formed.  Has it advised the Minister on the various aspects of the Bill?  Has it advised him on the sum of money which would be reasonably adequate to provide for these men who will be deprived of their livelihood? The families of many of them are at an age when their education is expensive.  They have children ranging from 12 to 20 years of age.  They require special provision to enable them to provide for their children in <Col N="1989" /> the way they would be expected to do. We had a Public Health Bill which was discussed for many months.  Now a new Bill has been introduced and, apparently, no detailed examination has been made into a vital matter of this kind.  I certainly will not accept the proposal to make representations to the Department of Finance in this matter.  I want to have the matter put in black and white, because anybody who has any experience of the Department of Finance knows what would happen.  Are we to hand over the destiny of these people to the gentlemen of the Department of Finance? I think it is only necessary to mention that to the Minister.  He has a reputation for being a decent, honourable man and, if he is, he is in honour bound to see that specific proposals are put before the House and embodied in this Bill making provision for anyone who is displaced as a result of it.</P>
    <P>As to the proposed abolition of vaccination, as a layman I wonder where this hare-brained proposal came from or who suggested it.  The reference made by Deputy O'Higgins to this matter is sufficient not only to alarm the House, but the country at a time when we are doing our utmost to attract people from the ends of the earth to this country.  I do not wish to make any reflection&mdash;far from it&mdash;on the medical profession, but everybody knows that there are not six doctors in this country who have seen a case of smallpox.  A young doctor friend of mine who after he was qualified went out East, when coming back through the Suez Canal, found that one of the people on board had been taken ill.  As the person was coming from the East he suspected it might be a case of small-pox. In fact it turned out to be a case of smallpox.  Let us assume that a visitor arriving at Rineanna or Collinstown was developing smallpox and went down to a country district where the dispensary doctor had not any experience of the disease.  If he was called in to attend that person, he might not have the faintest idea of what he was suffering from because he had never actually seen a case of smallpox.  The result might be that we would have an alarming outbreak of that disease.  I <Col N="1990" /> heartily agree with Deputy O'Higgins when he speaks about how it could be spread over the whole country.  Vaccination was a very wise precaution even before we had any aerial terminus here.  It did no harm and it eliminated smallpox in this country. Now that we have this added danger, it would be sheer madness not to enforce it.  Have we got so soft and tender-hearted that we are afraid to send a child to a dispensary to have it vaccinated in case it might cry?  We are getting too soft about these things.  If we are to take our place in the world a lot of this softness will have to go.</P>
    <P>As I said, we approve of this Bill. I should, however, like to see its scope widened.  If I were in charge of it, I would have dealt with other matters which are highly necessary.  I will not enumerate them now.  There are, however, three matters about which I am concerned.  I agree with Deputy O'Higgins that compulsory powers should be adoptive.  Secondly, I am gravely concerned that this House should remove any injustice which is being done to the medical profession. In my view, no money we could give them would recompense them for the services they rendered to the poor of Ireland.  Thirdly, this proposal not to enforce vaccination should be dropped. I do not know whether the Minister is acting on his own initiative or whether some collection of kind-hearted old ladies came to him and said: &ldquo;Put an end to this abominable and atrocious thing&mdash;vaccination.&rdquo;  Let us put an end to this nonsense and let us ensure that this country will not be smitten by a plague of smallpox from the north to the south that will have established itself before we know what it is and that will cause irreparable damage to the health of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the last Deputy, one would get a completely distorted view of what this Bill proposes to do.  The Deputy started off by making a comparison between this Bill and the Act passed in England. He does not appear to realise that in England the whole health service has been nationalised.  This Bill does not seek to do that.  When the Deputy spoke of the compensation he was <Col N="1991" /> demanding for the doctors here, he forgot, or probably does not know, that the system in England is quite different from the system prevailing here.</P>
      <P>In England, prior to the nationalisation of health services, doctors had what is called a panel practice. That practice had a certain number of patients, as many as the doctor could get in up to a certain number, and the doctor had a right, if he wished to change from the area or to retire, to sell his panel practice and that had a value based on the income of that particular doctor. Deputy McMenamin is confusing a panel practitioner with a dispensary doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did confuse them.  We are trying to increase medical services generally to the whole population, with particular reference to those under a certain income and, instead of our doctors being put out of business&mdash;which resulted in the very strenuous appeal that they should be pensioned properly&mdash;they will be put into positions where they will have increased work to do, increased incomes, and where there will be, for the first time since we had a Government of our own, the possibility of increased employment for doctors.  The same applies to nurses.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been welcomed by Deputy O'Higgins, who obviously spoke for the Opposition and who has a great deal of knowledge of what is contemplated in the Bill.  Evidently he gave it very close study.  But there is again a certain confusion.  On the one hand, Deputies over there are demanding compulsory vaccination, without recognising that if you have that it must be applied to every individual every seven years.  It is well known that if you vaccinate a person and there is an epidemic of smallpox, unless you get re-vaccinated every seven years you are not immune.  That does not appear to be understood by the Deputies who spoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1992" /> Again, while they are demanding compulsion in that respect, they are opposing compulsion in other respects. Deputies associated with the medical profession on this side of the House have welcomed compulsion in the treatment of infectious diseases in the manner envisaged in the Bill.  There are people here who have some knowledge of general requirements in connection with medical services, particularly those who have had years of service on local authorities, where we are associated with hospitals and local requirements generally.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins seemed to feel, by the way he spoke, that this Bill was merely being introduced and would then be shelved.  He illustrated that by the shop window packed with copies of the Bill, and the shelves all empty.  Then he went on to say that this Bill, if it were properly applied, would mean that the dispensaries would not be sufficiently large or well equipped to cope with the requirements that would be put upon them now under this measure.  Is it not obvious that the whole idea behind the Bill is to do that very thing, and that the State will provide, in conjunction with the local authorities, the requirements which arise from it, in the sense of money requirements?</P>
    <P>I do not understand how one can welcome a Bill and then pick holes in it, based on arguments which, on examination, are not well founded. Deputy O'Higgins pointed out with great emphasis that because dispensary doctors up to the present made their living mainly from the private incomes they received, they will now be deprived of that.  That was one of the objections he had.  Later on he pointed out that an imposition would be put on the people through increased rates as a result of this Bill coming into operation.  Surely, his approach should not be, as far as the public are concerned, that two and two make four when, in fact, it is a case of two minus two, meaning nothing.  This is the position.  The people who hitherto had to pay, those of them under a certain income, will now pay a proportion of the rates which will have to be increased as a result of the medical services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1993" /> In Dublin recently, through the Dublin Corporation, we decided that persons with low incomes could not afford to pay for hospital treatment and we put 2/6 in the £ on the rates of Dublin in order that certified persons should qualify for free treatment in hospitals because, if they had to pay out of their low incomes, their homes would suffer.  But nobody says these people who, although they are paying their share, if you like, through even a small increase in the rates, are not getting security for that in the sense that they will get hospital treatment generally as distinct from what it used to be.</P>
    <P>There are other dangerous infectious diseases besides smallpox, and Deputy Lynch pointed out that the same amount of danger applies, in connection with what he described as open tuberculosis, as in the case of small-pox. It is as infectious and you only need to have the same gentleman to whom Deputy O'Higgins referred arriving at Rineanna and spreading his infectious disease.  We have to take cognisance of the fact that our health services up to the present have not been the best and we must agree that this is a step in the right direction. If as a result of this Bill, infectious diseases and their effects will be eliminated, we shall have a much more healthy nation than in the past.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin, in the course of his remarks, appealed to the Minister three times, not only to insert a provision in the Bill to provide compensation for persons displaced in the medical profession but also to obtain a certificate from the Minister for Finance to that effect.  The Deputy further asked that the amount of the compensation should be specified in the Bill.  No medical man who spoke on this Bill made such a request.  I say that the Bill is a measure of which we can be proud.  I was abroad recently in two different countries and I discussed with certain people, some of whom were medical doctors, the developments taking place.  Strange to relate, everything that happens in this country in regard to medical legislation is watched closely in medical circles abroad.  What is contemplated in this country is examined by these <Col N="1994" /> medical men, admired and approved of.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin also referred to the terrible epidemic of smallpox which was going to overtake this country because compulsory vaccination is not provided for in this Bill.  In fact, according to him, it has been deleted. Both he and Deputy O'Higgins referred to the fact that compulsory vaccination exists at present in England, except in so far as those who object to it on conscientious grounds are concerned.  Well, there are outbreaks of smallpox in England as there are elsewhere and there is the same trouble in looking for contacts in order to try to eradicate it.  If we are sensible people, we shall apply sensible measures which we know will be effective. I was in France in the last month and on my arrival I was told that there had been an outbreak of smallpox.  I went immediately to the nearest doctor and I had myself vaccinated.</P>

For his information, may I inform him that every doctor knows on the fourth day after the vaccination, whether the vaccination has taken or not.  If it has taken the doctor is able to certify that that person will be immune from the disease for a period of seven years.  I hope Deputy Morrissey is now satisfied that I am effectively vaccinated.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to take note of the fact that at present we have a very easy and rapid method of communication between this country and other parts of the world. It may happen therefore that a person may have been in contact with infected sources in a foreign country, some short time before setting out for this country, and may on arrival here be a danger.  I think the Minister should consider ways and means by which the officers of his Department can keep themselves informed of what is happening <Col N="1995" /> in other countries, with particular reference to outbreaks of small-pox, so that steps will be taken to ensure that a person proposing to travel by aeroplane to this country from an area in which there has been an outbreak of small-pox, will not be allowed to board the plane unless he has been properly vaccinated before departure. To that extent I agree that precautions should be taken but, as I say, let us be sensible.  If we are going to insist on compulsory vaccination, let us go the whole hog and insist that everybody, including Deputy Blowick and myself, will be vaccinated and be able to present a certificate of immunity for the next seven years.</P>

I have heard, on the contrary, many compliments paid to the measures which are proposed. I do not know to what extent the Minister will consult with the medical profession as a whole, but I did speak on this matter to one very eminent medical gentleman in the City of Dublin.  I asked what he thought about the proposal in the Bill for the setting up of a medical consultative council and he told me, notwithstanding all the row there had been about this question, that in providing for a medical consultative council we are opening the way for a lot of trouble. &ldquo;It is well known,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you will never get medical men to agree about anything and I pity the Minister, if he is setting up such a body.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not think he is a black sheep.  I do not wish to canvass the name of any outside doctor in this House, but I shall give his name to the Deputy outside the House if he wishes, and I think the Deputy will admit that he is not a black sheep, that he is very white.  There are differences of opinion frequently amongst members of the medical profession.  I sit on the boards of hospitals in this city and I find medical men at great variance with other medical men.  I discovered recently that surgeons have a different outlook from that held by men who are physicians, on matters connected with hospitals.  I used to think of all of them as doctors but now I realise that physicians and surgeons are very wide apart in their outlook on almost everything.  I do not know whether Deputy Dr. O'Higgins will contradict that.</P>
      <P>I am surprised at the attitude of those who have been making comparisons between what has happened in England, as a result of the nationalisation of the medical service, and this Bill.  There are two entirely different situations concerned.  As I stated earlier, we are not forcing our doctors here to give up panel practices. The doctors here are going to get more work and better pay as a result of this measure.  There will be a much bigger outlet for the products of our universities and we shall also improve the working conditions of our nurses and ensure that we shall have within the country the number necessary to staff our institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone knows that in recent times it has been very difficult to find staffs for our ordinary hospitals.  I hope that the Minister for Health will, in consultation with the Minister for Local Government, endeavour to bring about a situation under which it will be much easier in future for hospitals to provide more attractive remuneration for nurses.  I hope that there will also be some review of the system <Col N="1997" /> under which what are called probationer nurses are taken into our hospitals, with a view to having them released from the obligation to pay fees.  You will get many excellent girls who are anxious to be trained as nurses whose parents can afford to pay a fee of 50 guineas but there is an equally good type of girl whose parents would find it very difficult to pay such a fee.  I hope that fees in such cases will be entirely abolished, that the remuneration will be on a basis commensurate with the standing of the nurse in the community and that we will live to see the day&mdash;although Deputy O'Higgins seems to think we will all be dead by the time the Bill comes into full operation&mdash;when we will be able to see the beginnings of the successful working of this Bill and its effect upon the health of the nation.</P>

      <P>I am in full agreement with many of the sections in the Bill. Such a measure as this is welcome, and indeed overdue, but I do not agree with the attitude taken up by Deputy Briscoe.  He says that Deputy O'Higgins welcomes the Bill and that he cannot understand his doing so, while, at the same time, he picks holes in it.</P>

      <P>During my four years <Col N="1998" /> in this House, I notice&mdash;and the sooner we get away from it, the better&mdash;that all the constructive criticism has to come from Fine Gael, Clann na Talmhan, Labour or the Independents, and that, with one notable exception, every Fianna Fáil Deputy, no matter what the Government introduce, opens his remarks with the old parrot cry: &ldquo;I welcome it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I must pay Deputy Briscoe this compliment, that he spoke more like a medical man on this Bill than his two colleagues, Deputies Brennan and Lynch.  I do not mean that as an attack on Deputy Briscoe&mdash; I say it honestly, and I mean it.  I, as a layman, with many of the lay Deputies, was waiting to hear their criticism of the Bill.  We had first the Minister, and then Deputy O'Higgins, and then followed Deputies Brennan and Lynch.  I frankly admit that this is a highly technical Bill and I was delighted that we had four medical men to explain its knotty points to us lay-men who are not fully acquainted with medical matters.  But what happened? Deputy O'Higgins gave us a fine exposition of the Bill, of 75 per cent. of which he approved.  He pointed out certain difficulties and certain objectionable features in a very interesting speech.</P>
      <P>I had expected that the two Fianna Fáil Deputies would have made a contribution which would have helped us along the road and helped us to do our duty as an Opposition, so that this legislation as it finally emerges would be as nearly perfect as it is possible for us mortals to make it.  But having heard them, I candidly feel that I was in the same position as that in which I was before they spoke.  I knew as much about the Health Bill when they finished as I knew before, and in fact they rather confused me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lynch said he welcomed the provisions in the Bill with regard to ante-natal care.  I cannot see a single provision made for that.  The only provision in that respect is that in which the Minister takes ample power to himself to make Orders in future, but we do not know what these Orders <Col N="1999" /> will be.  Perhaps I have not taken proper stock of the various sections, but I cannot see a single word about it, so that the Deputy is welcoming nothing, or at least merely welcoming a provision by which the Minister takes power to make regulations and Orders in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy must have misheard Deputy Lynch.  I think Deputy Lynch indicated that he was not in agreement with the proposals relating to ante-natal care.  I may be wrong&mdash;I may have misheard him myself&mdash;but I understood him to say that he was not quite in agreement on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>If I have misquoted the Deputy, I am sorry, but I understood the Deputy to say that he welcomed these powers.  I do not want to take up the position of accusing a man of meaning something he did not mean. One point in Deputy O'Higgins's speech of which I took particular notice is, that we must take into account the rapid means of travel now developing in the form of air services, and the possibility that people who may be in the first stages of the disease, who may have incubated the disease <i>en route</i>, may land at an airport, without outward symptoms of the disease.  Even to a dense layman, that is a very real and very apparent danger, and while I should not like to be a scaremonger, it would be foolish for us to stick our heads in the sand, ostrich-like, and disregard these things.  We must take them into account, because a person may land at Shannon airport without any signs of a deadly, infectious disease and, in his subsequent movements, may leave the seeds of death behind him.  It is up to the medical men in the Department to take that into account and to see that some precautionary measures to deal with it will be available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lynch asked about the man in the bus who spreads <Col N="2000" /> tuberculosis germs, but if tuberculosis were such an easily conveyed disease there would be no Irishman or woman alive to-day, in fact, nobody in any country in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>He referred to a particular type of tuberculosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal causes of the spread of tuberculosis in rural districts are under-nourishment, bad housing and many other things which should have been rectified long ago. We put a measure through the House some time ago providing for the erection of regional sanatoria in order to cope with that disease, but in no county that I know of is there at the moment ample accommodation to deal with tuberculosis.  The regional sanatoria are going up very slowly, and lots of tuberculosis sufferers will be in their graves by the time they have been provided, and, even taking into account the many serious difficulties which the Department have had to contend with in the matter of shortage of various materials, I say that better steps could have been taken to counteract the disease.</P>
      <P>A broad result of this Bill will be a steep increase in the rates in all counties and neither in the Minister's opening statement nor in the Bill is there any indication of any provision for easing the burden on ratepayers.  Some account should be taken of that position because we can no longer close our eyes to the fact that rates are becoming an almost intolerable burden in many counties.  They have reached breaking point, and I am afraid that, in the matter of piling burdens on the ratepayers, we will soon reach a position in which the ratepayers cannot or will not pay.  That will mean a complete collapse of our local institutions, and it would be better to take that aspect into account before anything serious happens.</P>

      <P>The attached tables give particulars of: (1) Subsidies paid by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to Aer Rianta in respect of air services; (2) Amounts paid by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to Aer Rianta in respect of losses in the management of Dublin Airport, and of capital expenditure incurred on equipment and minor works there.</P>
      <P>No interest has been charged in respect of the payments shown in tables 1 and 2.</P>
      <P>No subsidy has been paid directly to Aer Lingus by the Minister for Industry and Commerce or by the Minister for Finance.  The company's losses on air services have been made good by the parent company Aer Rianta from the subsidy paid to that company by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has subscribed £957,987 by way of payment for share capital in Aer Rianta.  Of this sum Aer Rianta has in turn subscribed £236,991 for shares in Aer Lingus and £700,000 for shares in Aerlinte Éireann.  The Minister for Finance has not subscribed directly for any share capital in either Aer Lingus or Aerlinte.</P>
