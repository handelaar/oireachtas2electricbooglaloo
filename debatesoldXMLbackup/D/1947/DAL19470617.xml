      <P>The number of footwear vouchers allocated between the various public assistance districts is limited to the number of pairs of official footwear available for distribution.  In both Counties Carlow and Wexford, the quantity of footwear allocated was only <Col N="1874" /> slightly less than that estimated by the public assistance authority to be required to meet possible demands in full.  Production during the 1946-47 season was approximately 5,000 pairs less than was anticipated and this deficiency affected to some extent the quantity allocated to each public assistance district.  It is hoped that in the forthcoming production season the maximum number of pairs of footwear required will be produced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware that forestry workers employed on State forestry schemes are not covered by the Unemployment Insurance Acts; whether he will state the grounds on which such workers are excluded; and further, whether he will take steps to bring forestry workers within the scope of these Acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. Forestry workers are specifically excepted from the scope of unemployment insurance by paragraph (a) of Part II of the First Schedule of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920.  With regard to the last part of the question I would refer the Deputy to the statement I made on the Vote for the Department of Social Welfare, in which I indicated that the whole position with regard to social services is being examined with a view to unification and that a scheme would be announced in due course. This announcement will include the decisions taken on questions of the scope of social insurance, including that covered by the Deputy's suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the causes of the delay in supplying bound volumes of the Public Statutes, for the years 1945 and 1946, to members of the Oireachtas; and when these volumes will be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>The delay in supplying bound volumes of the Public Statutes for the years 1945 and 1946 to members of the Oireachtas has, I understand, been due to the necessity for completing the Irish translation of the more voluminous Acts included in the volumes in question.  For instance, the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, contains 284 sections and five schedules, comprising in all no less than 110 printed foolscap pages, while the Harbours Act, 1946, contains 191 sections and four schedules, comprising in all 83 printed foolscap pages.  The bound volume for 1945 is at present in the hands of the binders and will be available for issue at a very early date.  The translations of the 1946 Acts have been completed and the annual volume can now be prepared for the printers.  It is not however possible to say at this stage when the volume will be ready for issue.</P>

      <P>The grants in respect of the heating and cleaning of national schools are not payable before the 31st March in any year and are paid following the receipt of application forms from the managers.  A delay in the printing of the application forms for the year ended 31st March, 1947, was responsible for the issue of these forms to the managers at a later date than usual.  Payment of the grants will be made as soon as possible after the receipt of the completed forms from the managers.</P>
      <P>The grants payable to managers in recoupment of expenditure incurred in the heating of national schools have been increased in view of the increased cost of fuel.  This increase is operative in respect of the year ended 31st March, 1947.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received a small number of complaints regarding delay to air-mail letters so detained.  Almost all these delays occurred during a period when detentions were very numerous and the customs centre at Limerick was understaffed.

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that I think there was general disappointment in the House that the Minister did not increase the salaries paid to district justices.  Strong representations were made here on the Second Reading of the Bill that the increased allowances payable to district justices were insufficient to meet the present high cost of living.  A case was put to the Minister for a flat rate of £1,500 a year in present circumstances and, strong as the case was a fortnight or three weeks ago, the cost-of-living figures make the case then made even stronger.  The salaries of district justices originally fixed in 1924 were, I think, £1,000 a year for most justices&mdash;a few exceptions were as low as £800 and some were as high as £1,100 a year.  The present cost of living makes it quite obvious that the figure then fixed would need to be increased by at least 50 per cent.  While substantial increases have been given to Circuit Court, High Court and Supreme Court judges, taking the cost of living into consideration and comparing their salaries with the salaries paid to district justices, I think it is obvious that while they may occupy a position in a superior court, the district justices have not been fairly treated.  I put the case to the Minister that I could see no reason for differentiating <Col N="1881" /> between justices in the metropolitan area and other district justices. I still adhere to that view, particularly since the districts and areas of jurisdiction of the district justices have been altered.  The amount of work done by a district justice, sitting outside the metropolitan area and certainly sitting in close proximity to the larger cities, is equal, if not in some cases even heavier, than the work carried out by justices in the Dublin metropolitan area.  At the same time country justices, while they are paid a travelling allowance or expenses from the point of view of running a motor car, have considerable expenditure. They have to maintain certain standards and all these expenses fall more lightly on justices in Dublin than they do on country justices who have to travel from one town or village to another. I think it is unfortunate that the Minister has not seen fit to alter the present rate from £1,300 a year in the majority of cases to £1,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I would like to refer, in view of the strong appeal made here by Deputy Costello, in view of the appeal before the belated withdrawal of Deputy O'Connor, and finally in view of the appeal by Deputy Ruttledge, is that the Minister should again consider the question of appointing the President of the Circuit Court to one of the positions on the High Court.  As the Bill stands the President of the Circuit Court will be <i>ex officio</i> a judge of the High Court.  In view of the fact that the High Court has, on occasion, to deal with appeals from the Circuit Court and the individual judges hear appeals the position differs entirely from the position of the President of the High Court who may, on occasion, hear appeals from the Supreme Court from his brethren on the High Court who will then be only individual judges out of four or five and I think the Minister should reconsider the position.  Nobody wants to derogate in any way from the peculiar new status that is being given to the President of the Circuit Court.  But, in view of the fact that the President of the Circuit Court may, in his <i>ex officio</i> capacity as a judge of the High Court, be called upon to hear appeals from his brethren of the Circuit Court, <Col N="1882" /> it is undesirable in the circumstances that he should be an <i>ex officio</i> judge of the High Court.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello and Deputy Ruttledge strongly appealed to the Minister on this matter.  It was fully discussed, and all the disadvantages arising out of the <i>ex officio</i> position which the President of the Circuit Court will have when sitting as a judge of the High Court have been put before the Minister.  So far no strong case has been made for appointing the President of the Circuit Court as an <i>ex officio</i> judge of the High Court, and I put it to the Minister that, unless a stronger case can be put forward than that which the House has already heard, it would be in the interest of the position which the President of the Circuit Court will occupy that he should not be an <i>ex officio</i> judge of the High Court.</P>

      <P>I should like to support what Deputy Cosgrave has raised concerning the district justices. The ground has been covered on previous stages of the Bill, but I should like to add my voice in support of what the Deputy has said.  It does seem that there is very little case to be made for paying a district justice who operates in the City of Dublin more than a district justice who operates outside the city, but perhaps still in the County Dublin.  That justice has to incur the same expenses as the Dublin justice and, in fact, has a somewhat further distance to travel, but actually receives less money.  That is an anomaly which it seems hard to understand. There may be a case for the lower payment where a district justice lives in a remote part of Ireland and where living is, presumably, cheaper than in the city.  Nevertheless, even in that case, against his somewhat cheaper living which would only really cover food, you have to set the increased amount of travelling which he has to do.  I would ask the Minister, therefore, to consider this matter and perhaps introduce some slight levelling in regard to the country district justices to bring them closer to the salary which the city justices receive.</P>

      <P>The question of the district justices was discussed at length on the Committee Stage and on the Second Stage.  I do not agree that there is not a case for differentiation there.  From all I hear, it is the experience of those who have worked in the Dublin court that the work there is far more onerous.  Whatever about getting an increase for the district justices over and above what is proposed in this Bill, I think there is a case for differentiation.  I think that practically everyone who goes to the Dublin court knows that it is a most trying place for anybody, while a country justice has a comparatively easy place compared with it.</P>
      <P>If I had my choice I would prefer to be one of the country justices at the smaller salary.  I also pointed out on the Second Reading that the 30 per cent. increase that has been given compares favourably with what has been given to other public officials with a like salary.  In fact, it is more favourable. These are matters upon which the Minister for Finance and the Government have to be consulted and there was no case made that we could find for giving more proportionately to them than was given to other officials. A bigger bulk sum has been given to judges, but a smaller proportion.  It is 25 per cent. in the case of a Circuit Court judge, 20 per cent. in the case of a High Court judge and 15 per cent. in the case of a Supreme Court judge. The district justices get 30 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the question of the President of the Circuit Court, I still hold that what is proposed is quite a desirable thing to do.  It gives him the status that he ought to have in the new position. I can see no point whatever in the objection.  Even if he has to hear appeals from the Circuit Court, which might not happen often, what would be wrong with that?  Is it not well known that High Court judges hear appeals from other High Court judges?  In the Court of Appeal there are often High Court judges who hear appeals from other High Court judges.  I can see nothing to object to in that.  As I said, it is not likely that the President of the Circuit Court will be called upon to sit very often in the High Court. <Col N="1884" /> The High Court is full.  It is only in the unlikely contingency of there being an accumulation of work or perhaps some judge being ill that I imagine he will be asked to sit in the High Court.  He will have plenty to do in his own court.  As I said on the Committee Stage, it is purely for the purpose of his prestige and status that this is being done.  I considered the matter very carefully.  I heard the appeals made from both sides of the House, from my predecessor amongst others; but we considered this matter very carefully and we consider that it is a desirable thing to have the president occupying that <i>ex officio</i> position.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion I was on the question of the activities of co-operative societies and their relations with farmers.  I was dealing with the question of the purchase of land by co-operative societies.  We have often asked ourselves the question why co-operative societies have gone into open competition with farmers for the purchase of land.  They are really doing an injustice to farmers and to farmers' sons who, in my opinion, should be engaged in agriculture instead of co-operative societies which have been established by the farmers. How is it that the farms which have been purchased by co-operative societies are not producing milk?  It is quite easy to answer that question. Where you have commercial herds and farmers producing milk who have to engage labour they cannot produce milk at a profit at the present price. If the co-operative societies acted as guarantors for farmers' sons who would go into agricultural production, that would be a valuable asset to the farmers and to their sons.  We all know that when farmers' sons are at the age <Col N="1885" /> when they could take over the working of an agricultural holding many of them are not in a position financially to purchase such a holding.</P>
      <P>If the co-operative societies, as they are established, acted as guarantors for farmers' sons, so as to enable them to buy land, they would be doing a national service.  There are many young, energetic farmers' sons who have not the wherewithal to purchase a farm, and their fathers have not money either.  If they were backed by these agricultural organisations, which are composed of farmers who are really the backbone of the country, they would be doing a good day's work.  During the emergency, as many people know only too well, farmers who were anxious to procure machinery for their sons, so as to provide them with a source of livelihood, could not do so, because these co-operative societies got priority in the allocation of such machinery.  I am satisfied that in the areas where young men were prepared to purchase this machinery, they could not do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure other Deputies have had the same experience as I have had in that respect.  We have tried, on behalf of our constituents, to get machinery and we could not.  If the farmers' sons had that machinery instead of the co-operative societies, they would have given much greater satisfaction to those who employed them and would have been of greater benefit to the nation generally.  As it was, it went to the co-operative societies.  It will be admitted that young men of that type, who would work on hire as it were, would give a better return as against the output of the employees of co-operative societies who would be operating that type of machinery.  Such schemes, to my mind, are only a source of organisation of labour in order to have those men engaged in such work as a weapon against the farming community. It would not surprise me if some of those co-operative societies, in the harvest time, will experience a lot of difficulty should a strike crop up at a particular time.  They are really playing into the arms of trade unionism by providing that machinery instead of acting as guarantors for farmers' sons who are well able to operate the <Col N="1886" /> machinery but who are not in a financial position to secure it.</P>
    <P>Then again, the co-operative societies have gone into the production of bacon.  If they went into the curing of bacon and the handling of other agricultural produce they would be working in the best interests of the agricultural community.  As it is, they have gone into the field of competition with the farmers.  They will be a source of danger in the country if they proceed along those lines.  It would be more serviceable to the farmers if the societies engaged in the curing of bacon and the handling of agricultural stuff instead of dealing in pins and needles in opposition to the shopkeepers, who also have the right to live.  Almost every Deputy has some relation&mdash;a brother, sister, uncle or aunt&mdash;engaged in trading.  We know that many shopkeepers are either the brothers or sisters of farmers; they are also ratepayers and taxpayers and they have the right to live and educate their families just as well as we have.</P>
    <P>If the co-operative societies would go security for the farmers and their sons, they would be doing an important national work.  How many farmers, who, during the bad winter period, lost many of their dairy cattle, would be in a position to get security in order to obtain a loan at the present time?  If these co-operative societies were doing their duty, they would be able to get adequate accommodation from them, because the societies would be in a position to collect the money advanced out of the milk or other agricultural produce they would be handling.  That is the line on which co-operative societies should be operating and not on the line on which they are working to-day.  They are in opposition to&mdash;in open competition with&mdash;the farmers and their sons.</P>
    <P>During the past few years we have been advocating protection for the farmers, even as regards the price of wool.  The Department of Industry and Commerce fixed certain prices for wool. That is another branch of agriculture that could be very usefully handled by a co-operative society&mdash;the purchasing and grading of wool and trying to obtain the best price for that commodity <Col N="1887" /> when it is marketed by the farmers.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the production of grain.  Some time ago there was a debate in connection with the price of agricultural produce.  I appeal to the Minister, in fairness to the agricultural community, to reconsider the prices that have been fixed by his Department for oats, barley, wheat and sugar beet.  Taking into consideration the increases to our workers within the past few years&mdash; and they were justly entitled to something&mdash;the price of corn, barley, oats and beet is insufficient to cover the cost of production.  The Minister promised some time ago that he would set up a commission to determine the price of agricultural produce, such as grain, and to arrange a price that would be commensurate with the cost of production, plus a small profit for the farmer.  We have not heard anything about that commission for some time.  I have discussed this matter with representatives of the farming class who are on the Minister's benches and they are of the opinion that no commission need be set up.  The Minister has in his Party farmers who are quite well able, in conjunction with the farmers on this side of the House and on the main Opposition Party, to give him the necessary information to decide what a reasonable price would be for agricultural produce of the type to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The price of oats should be £2 per barrel.  If you went into any retailer's shop in the spring you could not get oatmeal.  The position is that corn is not being grown in sufficient quantities. The people are concentrating on other produce.  A better price will encourage the farmers to grow more corn.  There might be the danger, if the price were increased, that farmers would grow corn instead of wheat, but we know that corn is a very valuable food, both as a human food and as an animal food.  If oats is used for the production of animal food such as milk, butter, bacon and beef, it will be turned to a very useful purpose for the welfare of the community as a whole. In my opinion, the fact that the price <Col N="1888" /> of oats is increased will not mean that there will be a glut of oats in the market because any surplus of that valuable food can be converted to other very necessary food for consumption by human beings.</P>
    <P>Barley is another crop that could be grown with satisfaction on many farms throughout the country which are not suitable for growing wheat.  According to the Minister's own statement, our imports of barley for the last three years were value for some £9,000,000. In other words, these imports represent a loss to the Irish farmers of £3,000,000 per year.  The policy of the Government has been that we should endeavour to produce our own requirements within the country and the fact that we have to import agricultural produce of this kind shows that we are drifting away from that policy.  If we expend £3,000,000 per annum to finance farmers outside the State, it means that we are doing an injustice to farmers at home.</P>
    <P>The Minister as a practical farmer himself, knows quite well that there are many holdings throughout the country suitable for the growing of barley but uneconomic, from the point of view of the fertility of the soil, for the production of wheat.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the prices fixed for these commodities in order to ensure that they will be produced to the full requirements of our own people at home and so that we will not have to import barley to the extent of £3,000,000 a year in future.  I do not ask the Minister to pay the price he had to pay in the outside market.  He stated in his speech that he had scoured the world in his endeavours to get these commodities.  I quite admit that he has a duty to the people in that respect and I am not criticising him for that but it does seem unfair that he should have to scour the world looking for commodities which we could produce here at home if the conditions were made sufficiently attractive.</P>
    <P>So far as wheat is concerned, I am not satisfied either that the price offered is sufficient.  I think that it would need much more than one step in the price to meet the cost of production to-day to the farmer.  Wages <Col N="1889" /> and the cost of raw materials have gone up and farmers as a whole find it impossible to produce wheat at the price offered.  The yield from the crop has diminished considerably because of the fact that the land has become worn out year after year owing to intensive production of this crop.  I am not objecting to extra tillage; in fact I am a tillage farmer myself but I consider that manures must be purchased in order to increase the yields and to improve the financial returns to the farmers.  The Minister is aware that for the last three years he has held up voucher payments to farmers.  These vouchers should have been passed on to the farmers before now in order to provide the necessary fertilisers with a view to increasing the yield and increasing the farmers' profits out of the crop.  I think it is grossly unfair that vouchers should have been held up for such a long period.  Questions have been repeatedly asked of the Minister as to why these vouchers have been held up for so long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Where were they to get these artificial manures, even if they had the vouchers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>Even to-day it was suggested to the Minister that vouchers should be made available because many farmers have not the necessary cash available to enable them to buy such manures as can be procured.  If they had the vouchers, they would be able to buy more manure.  The position to-day is that certain quantities of manures are on the market but I should like to ask the Minister is it the man who really requires that manure who is getting it?  Many a man is not able to get it because he is not in a position to pay cash for it.  As I suggested in a Parliamentary Question to the Minister some time ago, if the vouchers were made available, the men who really need the manure and who are the backbone of the country so far as tillage and production are concerned, would be able to get it, instead of the fellow who merely fires it out on grass. It is an injustice to industrious farmers that they should have been deprived of these vouchers for so long by the Minister. I did not raise that question here <Col N="1890" /> merely for the purposes of propaganda but because of the fact that people who want cash and need vouchers, had asked me to raise that point and had written to me repeatedly for information as to when the vouchers would be available.  I would again ask the Minister that the vouchers should again be made available in time to enable these deserving people to get manures for the growing season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that we shall not have a repetition this year of the trouble we had last year in the sugar factories and that, before the beet campaign starts, a decision will be come to as to conditions, wages, and the prices to be paid to the farmers.  I think that in fairness to the producers, taking into account the hardships associated with the production of this crop and the difficulty of securing workers, the price should be increased to at least £5 per ton for beet having a sugar content of 15½ per cent.  Last year the price of sugar was reduced by a penny per lb. but after the strike occurred the price was again increased by a penny per lb., in order to cover the increase in wages and compensation to farmers for beet lost during that particular period.  In my opinion, housewives and the people of the country generally would be quite satisfied if the price of sugar were increased by another ½d. per lb., if they could be assured that they would have enough sugar.  I give a guarantee to the Minister and to the housewives of the country that if producers were paid £5 per ton or if the price of sugar were fixed at 6½d. per lb., there would be an adequate supply of sugar for all purposes&mdash;not a rationed supply but, I might say, sugar for jam and for every other useful household purpose.  We know that last year a very large proportion of the apple crop in the country was lost as there was no market whatever for them.  Every Deputy, whether he comes from the town, city or country, knows full well that if the apple crop last year was such a success as regards yield and such a calamity as regards its conversion to any useful purpose, there must be something wrong.  That in my opinion is one of the reasons why more encouragement <Col N="1891" /> should be given to the people of the country to produce beet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not inform the Chair who fixed the price of beet.  Is it the Minister for Agriculture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir, but I think a recommendation from the Minister for Agriculture would be very useful.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should inform the Beet Growers' Association that a higher price would be charged for sugar so that we might have a sufficient quantity available for the purpose of making jam.  He would thereby provide a means of utilising our apple crop which was allowed to rot last year.  That would also enable us to supplement the butter rations, which are so small for consumers in general at present.  I would like to deal also, under this supplementary heading, with the loans to meet the losses in live stock.  The Minister has, in my opinion, gone a reasonable distance to meet the case, but I will not say that he has gone far enough.  I think that the repayment period is too short when you take into consideration what it costs to buy live stock and when the purchaser has to wait three years for a financial return on the money invested.  This would apply particularly to the sheep breeder on the mountainside. He will not be in a position to market any of the progeny of those sheep for at least two and a half or three years.  The repayment period should be at least from five to seven years, thereby giving those people an opportunity to improve their position financially before they would be asked to repay the loan.  There is no getting away from the fact that considerable losses have been suffered.  I know of one case where a widow who had 17 cows lost 16 and she cannot get security for a loan to restock her land.  I could instance several other cases but this was a particularly bad case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Returning to the question of the cooperative societies, I think here is a case where they could help by coming to the rescue of that type of person.  It would be a national work to help those <Col N="1892" /> people who suffered such terrible losses throughout the winter period.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the farm improvements scheme.  We find that a lot of farmers throughout the country are availing of this particular scheme. Certainly it is a scheme that commands the admiration of at least every farmer Deputy in the House.  It was a very good scheme but, as I have said already, it has not gone far enough. I have advocated repeatedly that the scheme should embrace the provision of water supplies throughout the country.  The late Minister for Agriculture stated on a few occasions that he was making investigations into the possibility of extending the scheme so as to embrace the provision of water supplies on the farms generally.  Many applications have been made to the Land Commission by old annuitants, but the Land Commission are not prepared to meet them.  I suggest to the Minister for Agriculture that some type of scheme should be embodied in the farm improvements scheme whereby water should be made available to the farmers.  It will be agreed that if we want to increase production an adequate water supply is very necessary as a commodity for live stock as well as for ordinary domestic use around the farm. I hope the Minister will see his way to make available grants for such a purpose and that he will state, when replying, that at least he will inquire into such a scheme.</P>
    <P>The great question at the present moment throughout the length and breadth of the country is that of bacon. We find that the bacon industry is in a very serious position.  Some people are inclined to attribute the bad position to illegal curers.  More people attribute it to the price.  In my opinion, the price of bacon to-day is too low.  It will not induce the ordinary producer to go into bacon production. If we take into consideration the price quoted every day we find that there is a very unfair margin between that paid to the producer and the amounts realised by the curer, the wholesaler and the retailer.  Totalling up the prices as quoted, we find that a side of bacon costs £7 17s. 7d.  For two sides that works out at £15 15s. 2d., <Col N="1893" /> and putting the price of the head at 10/-, the whole thing comes to £16 5s. 2d. Ex-factory, the price of a side of bacon is £5 9s. 4½d.  That makes it £10 18s. 9d. for the two sides ex-factory.  The farmer's price is 160/- per cwt., that is £8 12s. 10d., compared with the factory price of £10 18s. 9d., leaving the factory profit £2 6s. 0d.  The wholesaler's and retailer's prices add up to £16 5s. 0d., leaving the profit £7 11s. 4d.  I ask the Minister to consider that position. Not long ago he discussed it with a deputation.  Representing the masses of the poorer sections of the people, they were satisfied to see the price of bacon increased by 2d. a lb. provided the price to the producer who put the pigs on the market was increased.</P>
    <P>Take the position of Waterford City, the home of the pig.  The Waterford pig buyers were renowned down through the years.  We see two factories closed there, the Clover Meat Factory and Denny's factory.  The representatives of the men are quite satisfied to pay increased prices in order to ensure that the factories be kept open and their work secured. Surely the Minister is not going to turn a deaf ear to the people who represent these poorer sections of the community and who are satisfied to pay 2d. a lb. more in order to encourage production.  As you have seen, there is a very unfair margin between the ex-factory price and the wholesaler's and retailer's prices.  If there was a slice taken off that profit of £7 11s. 4d. and added to the production price of £8 12s. 10d., the wholesaler and retailer eventually would have greater profit because of the fact of the increased production and increased sales.  There will be a greater profit out of their bigger trade.  These are the facts which, to my mind, the Minister should seriously consider.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the price of 160/-to the producer to-day is insufficient.  I maintain that the price should be at least 190/- to the farmer and 140/- on a liveweight basis.  I am not advocating that from my own experience.  I have discussed the matter even with members of the Minister's own Party. <Col N="1894" /> They are quite satisfied that the prices on which I am basing my argument are reasonable if we are to keep in production that particular industry that was so valuable and such an asset to the country as a whole.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider seriously and favourably the position of those workers engaged in those bacon-curing stations.</P>
    <P>According to rumour illegal bacon-curing is going on throughout the country.  If reasonable prices for the producers and curers are stabilised, leaving a reasonable margin of profit for the wholesaler and retailer, the danger of illegal curing, if such be the case, will be eliminated.</P>
    <P>I would like also to give a warning to the curers.  I am inclined to agree that they themselves are, to a certain extent, responsible for the position which exists to-day because of the fact that when people were producing bacon, when they were in the production of pigs, they abused the producers in so far as that when the pigs were presented at the market they cut them for being overweight but, on the other hand, when the ordinary consumer went into the shop to buy his bacon he paid for his rasher and that was that.  If the position is serious to-day I want to tell the curers that they, themselves, were in no small way responsible.  However, two wrongs are not going to make a right and I would again appeal to the Minister to reconsider the question of prices of bacon in order to ensure that at least the workers in bacon-curing centres throughout the country and in Waterford City will be assured of their livelihood. We know too well also that production will not be increased overnight but if the prices are stabilised and conditions made favourable for the curers they will realise that in the long run the business will pay and, because of that remedy, the threatened danger of closing-down will go by the board and the workers will be assured of their employment.  I hope that the Minister will reply favourably on this question. Reviewing the facts which concern the two main producing branches of agriculture&mdash;milk and bacon&mdash;I hope the Minister will seriously consider the <Col N="1895" /> position and thereby keep the two main branches of agriculture which are the foundation and the bedrock of our national economy alive to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's speech was brief and did not give much indication of the Government's policy in so far as agriculture in general is concerned.  To my mind it was disappointing to find that, with a new Minister and in view of the present position of agriculture&mdash;the shortages of so many essential commodities&mdash;we had not a more extensive survey or a clearer indication of the Government's policy.  The present position of farmers in this country is unusual in very many respects.  A number of farmers are enjoying a transient prosperity, if high prices for certain commodities can be regarded as indices of prosperity or of a satisfactory condition.  However, comparing the general position, we find that after a number of years of intensive cereal production not merely have we not sufficient cereals for ourselves but that our general position leaves many things to be desired.  There is a shortage of butter, bacon, and milk.  While various remedies have been suggested and while some remedies have, in the past, been put into operation the general position has shown no signs of any substantial improvement. It is extraordinary that we find ourselves&mdash;after so many years of attention by the Department of Agriculture and, in particular, after intensive cultivation coupled with the Compulsory Tillage Order&mdash;unable to provide ourselves not merely with sufficient cereals but also with sufficient butter, bacon and eggs.  Faced with that position, I think it is only natural that the Government should be expected to display a graver sense of urgency of the situation and that it should indicate to the House more clearly the steps which they consider necessary, after consultation with their advisers, in order to improve the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to consider the recommendations and the conclusions arrived at by the post-emergency committee on agriculture.  That committee <Col N="1896" /> submitted three reports and, reading the reports, one is struck in particular with certain findings in the majority report.  It may be argued that we can never get a policy or a programme for farmers, either from farmers themselves or from elsewhere, which will find universal acceptance.  It is very often contended that farmers can never agree amongst themselves and that, that being so, other sections of the community have either to consider or adopt measures which might facilitate or improve the position in agriculture. It is true that in this country and in many other small countries the pattern of agriculture differs greatly from county to county.  That is one of the reasons, more than any other, why, I think, a unified farmers' organisation of any kind has never been successful here.  It is true that the type of farming carried on in different parts of the country, while differing in many respects, is nevertheless complementary to that carried on in other areas.  The small live-stock rearers in one part of the country provide the basic stock for sale to the larger farmers in other areas.  Over a number of years that system has worked satisfactorily and has not merely enabled small farmers to reach a fairly high level of prosperity at times but it has enabled other farmers to get good basic stock.  It is true that this system has always operated much more in favour of the large farmer than the small farmer. The heavy expenses, the risk, the outlay and the insecurity are all borne by the small farmer who rears live stock and subsequently sells them, mostly as immature cattle, either to other farmers or to cattle dealers who subsequently export them.  So far as I can see there is no rapid or radical solution for this situation.  These farmers are obliged for many reasons to rear calves and are obliged for other good reasons to sell them at an early age. Moreover, in the past they also reared and produced pigs on a very large scale.  Both those lines of agriculture are particularly suited to the small farmer.  The risk, however, and the scarcity of foodstuffs have, to a considerable extent, militated against this type of farming economy.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to consider <Col N="1897" /> this question, as I think it must be considered in the near future: What are the Government's plans or views on the present system under which, or the present agreement under which, this country is selling unfinished stores to the British farmers and under which the British farmers after keeping them for anything from two to three months are in a position to get high prices for them?  I believe that this agreement always operated against the farmers of this country.  It may be that in the particular circumstances in which it was concluded no better agreement could be secured, but it is a fact that, having seen it in operation and noted in particular how unprofitable it is at any time to sell immature cattle, the position must be reviewed.  It may be that many of those cattle exported are not immature, but they are certainly sold at a stage at which the greatest margin of profit is available to those who have them at the stage before they reach the butcher.  Under the agreement which was originally in operation there was a differential price for cattle that had been three months in England.  During the emergency this price differential was reduced so that cattle two months in England now benefit by it.  The position for some time past is that stall feeding has ended in this country, or, at least, it certainly is at a scale that bears no relation to its former size, and this position has had, throughout the emergency, a number of results which were undesirable and which if allowed to continue must have very serious consequences not only for the farmers but for the agricultural labourers.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any aspect of agricultural economy that gives greater employment in the winter time than the stall feeding of cattle.  Most farmers throughout the winter months find it extremely difficult to keep on some of their agricultural labourers. The present high wages, to which of course the agricultural labourers are fully entitled, are making it more difficult and will make it more difficult in the future and if there is one result more than another that is likely to accrue from this during the coming winter it is that farmers will dispense <Col N="1898" /> with, say, an additional man or two, temporarily at least.  If we can adopt the policy here, or if we can get an agreement under which our fat cattle can be sold to Britain or sold anywhere else that it is possible to get such an agreement&mdash;I think experience shows that the safest market and the one most readily available and with the present shortage of meat in England the one most likely to be available in the future is the British market&mdash;we can not only absorb here considerable quantities of foodstuffs but a very considerable number of additional agricultural labourers or, at any rate, retain here during the winter agricultural labourers who are obliged and have been obliged in recent years to seek employment elsewhere.  On top of that we will have available an increased supply of farmyard manure which every farmer knows the land to be in need of at the present time.  It seems to me that there are two possible methods of returning to the stall feeding of cattle: one is by securing an agreement under which it will be possible to sell fat cattle directly.  Alternatively, if we cannot get this we should pay a bounty here on stall fed cattle.  It may be that a bounty on fat cattle may enable farmers in general to rear more calves and that, in the long run, may have advantageous results on our milk production. No matter from what angle the matter is approached, no matter what system is adopted, it is essential to have an agreement under which it would be possible for our farmers to stall feed cattle here on a greater scale than ever before.  The sooner that is done the better it will be for the farmers and the agricultural labourers.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer for a moment to a matter that has often been discussed on this Vote in the past, that is, the question of milk production.  Listening to Deputy Heskin, I got the impression that his solution was increased prices. It is true that the cost of everything concerned with milk production has risen considerably in recent years; wages have gone up, feeding-stuffs, when available, have increased in price and the cost of transport has increased.  Generally speaking, costs have considerably increased since the <Col N="1899" /> pre-war years and since the early years of the emergency but I think we have reached a point when we must stop to consider the position especially when we consider the Minister's speech on the Agricultural Produce Subsidies Vote and the fact that the increased price payable as a result of the advances in the price of milk early this year will result in a sum of not less than £2,000,000 per year being paid by the Exchequer in order to maintain if not to increase our milk production.  I think we must consider what other methods or what other policy can be operated in order to improve the position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Heskin referred to the fact that the average cow supplying milk to the creameries yielded about 500 gallons.  I think that is the kernel of our whole problem.  Unless we can substantially increase the average yield increased prices will not secure any increase in milk production and increased prices will not keep those farmers in production who are now proposing to go out of production.  It is often said that dairy herds are broken up because the farmers find them uneconomic.  Unless the farmer is prepared to use only that cow which is more economic than the 500-gallon yielder no artificial device, either by way of subsidy or enhanced price, will enable the farmer to keep in production. Subsidising farmers at the present moment in relation to the 500-gallon cow is merely subsidising inefficiency. The country should not be called upon to pay enhanced prices to the farmers while that situation continues.</P>
    <P>The question then arises as to the way in which the yield can be increased or as to how we can make available in this country a supply of suitable cattle of good quality and high milk yielding potentialities.  That is something which will require careful and thorough investigation.  In his opening speech the Minister referred to the fact that he hoped to have the assistance of a committee of experts to advise him in this matter.  Numerous proposals, a number of pamphlets and many addresses have in recent times <Col N="1900" /> been issued on this question.  The only comment I have to make upon it is that my own experience over a number of years has shown that it is not an easy matter to build up a good dairy herd. It is expensive.  It takes a considerable period of years of intensive study and work.  One wrong cross from the point of view of continuing high milk yielding cattle may have results which it will take a considerable number of years to eradicate.</P>
    <P>In view of the shortage of butter at the present time and the fact that we are unable to produce sufficient milk to supply our own needs a number of farmers have been prompted to seek a remedy for this situation by importing and establishing here herds of cattle of a high milk yielding dairy strain. In view of the fact that we are dependent to a considerable extent in our particular agricultural economy on the sale of store cattle, it would be undesirable for us to embark on a too widespread encouragement or use of the more noted dairy strains of cattle. Whatever may be said for increasing the yield of shorthorn cattle and, at the same time, improving the standard by extending the premiums available for shorthorn bulls, I think it would be undesirable that we should embark on a widespread encouragement of particular strains of dairy cattle such as have been established in other countries.  In the last analysis the situation would become infinitely worse if we were to encourage exclusively in the future or on too large a scale the use of dairy shorthorns, particularly the English dairy shorthorns.</P>
    <P>One salient feature stands out here and that is that farmers and breeders can always recognise these cattle at fairs and elsewhere when they wish to purchase them.  If dairy shorthorns are encouraged here together with the use of dairy bulls, either imported or bred at home from existing shorthorn herds, we shall in time reach the position with which they are now faced in England where they have dairy shorthorn cattle of a very light type entirely unsuitable for beef production and entirely unsuitable for store cattle.  If we were to reach that position here it would be impossible for the farmers to differentiate between the highly developed <Col N="1901" /> milk breeds and the ordinary cattle.  If we are going to develop a policy of intensive milk production in particular areas we should consider, long before any encouragement is given to these English dairy shorthorns or to the extension of premiums here for dairy shorthorns produced at home, all these difficulties and problems which may arise in order to ensure that we shall not reach the position they have reached over there.</P>
    <P>The Livestock Breeding Act is in certain respects a good Act, and it has had many good results but it was never intended, certainly it was not intended in the way in which it has been worked, to improve the milk recording capacity of our cattle in general and it was merely adopted to eliminate indiscriminate breeding and to eliminate the production and the breeding here of nondescript cattle. While I know that there has been an improvement in recent years under the changed system, no attention has been paid at all to the question of milk production or to the ancestry of the bull selected for licence.  I cannot understand why the two cow-testing schemes should be operated separately. The scheme for the registration of pure-bred cattle is carried out under the county agricultural instructor or the county agricultural inspector.  He is sent there by the Department of Agriculture and he operates in a particular area.  At the same time, covering not merely the same area but very often the same herds, you have the local supervisor operating and in his reduced area he is in a position to pay more frequent visits.  I think both schemes should be amalgamated and the work should be left to the cow-testing supervisor. In that way it should be possible to cover the area more frequently and at the same time enable the employing authority to pay a sufficient income to the supervisor while releasing the inspectors or instructors for other work under the Department of Agriculture.  As the schemes are run at the present moment there is a considerable amount of overlapping. Under my suggestion of amalgamation a different set of records and a different set of particulars would enable the <Col N="1902" /> schemes to be kept separately but the work could be done by the same supervisor and the local cow-testing association could do the work much more easily.</P>
    <P>The supervisors at the present moment work extremely hard.  They travel over considerable distances and, even with the small increase granted in their incomes in recent years, they are still not paid commensurate with the work they do, and the income is insufficient to attract the right type of man.  In some districts it has been impossible to get applicants for the position of supervisor.  I suggest that the amalgamation of these schemes is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>Considerable stress has been laid during the course of this debate on the desirability of increasing production. The majority Committee on Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy refer in paragraph 214 of their report to the utilisation of land in a manner that will produce the maximum profitable return: &ldquo;In the cropping of land the objective to be aimed at is its utilisation in a manner that will produce the maximum profitable return in relation to the comparative advantage it derives from soil character, climate and market opportunity.  Provided that fertility is maintained to the maximum extent attainable with economy, the national advantage will be best served by producing from land the goods that command the greatest exchange value for the minimum of production cost.&rdquo;  They go on further in the report to say: &ldquo;Since 1939 we have had what is little short of a large scale experiment in total agricultural self-sufficiency accompanied by substantially higher prices, and yet the result has been that our gross volume of agricultural output has not increased.  In the light of that experience there would be no prospect of an increased volume of output if we were to adopt a full agricultural self-sufficiency policy for an era in which the threat of insufficiency of food and the realisation of high agricultural prices will no longer operate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that the committee in those two paragraphs have shed light on the whole agricultural position.  No matter how you look at the position, it gives <Col N="1903" /> no grounds for complacency.  In view of the intensive cultivation which has taken place, and in view of the fact that we have for the first time adopted an all-out policy from the point of view of cereal production and self-sufficiency, we ought to be in a position to assess accurately the success or otherwise of that policy.  It has, as I said, left us in an unusual position.  It has left us with fewer people employed on the land and with less agricultural produce.  For that reason, one of the first steps that should be undertaken with the greatest possible vigour and with the least amount of restriction is the importation of artificial manures and fertilisers.  In the past great stress was often laid on preserving the home market for farmers.  We see now that the home market has limits; that, coupled with the shortage of fertilisers and foodstuffs, home production has limits; and that we can farm what amounts to a larger area by making available a larger supply of fertilisers and feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>I understand that there is still in operation an Emergency Powers Order which limits and controls, not merely the importation, but the sale of fertilisers. It is difficult for anyone to understand why that Order should still be in operation.  I think that all restrictions on fertilisers or maize or any other feeding stuffs should be withdrawn. No case can now be made for directing fertilisers that are available into particular channels.  It may be that the Department should, if they think fit on the information available to them, direct that the available supplies of fertilisers should go first of all to certain farmers.  But certainly no case can be made for restricting the supply of fertilisers to particular firms or restricting the import of these fertilisers in any way.  For some reason that is not apparent there is still a restriction in force.  I do not think that there is a similar restriction on the importation of maize or any other feeding stuffs that can be imported. We must take all tariffs or restrictions off these commodities.  It is very often contended by those not engaged in agriculture that a tax on agricultural <Col N="1904" /> machinery or fertilisers should be borne by agriculturists, just as a tax on industrial machinery is borne by industrialists.  It is not generally realised that agriculture in most cases only permits of one crop a year, that agricultural production cannot be expanded rapidly, or new channels opened up as rapidly as is the case in industry.  It is not possible for farmers to expand their production rapidly or to engage in new lines of agricultural production or farming economy.  I think that any tax, restriction, quota or prohibition operating on the supply or distribution of artificial manures or fertilisers is detrimental to the farmers and should be not merely modified but withdrawn completely.</P>
    <P>The only other matter I should like to refer to is the Supplementary Estimate.  A large number of farmers have suffered grievous losses as a result of the weather experienced in the late winter and early spring.  Those of us who have in our constituencies upland areas realise possibly more than others how severe these losses were.  I can only speak from my own experience.  The difficulties and losses experienced by farmers in certain parts of County Dublin, such as Brittas, Glencullen, and other upland areas, have been unparalleled.  Loans are being made under this scheme to facilitate farmers to restock their holdings.  It is not generally realised, however, that these farmers will have to restock at a time when cattle prices have reached heights not attained for a considerable time. They have to restock at the dearest time.  They are trying to get back again into production.  In some cases they are faced, not only with heavy losses, but the wiping out of their entire stock.  I think, therefore, that the period allowed for the repayment of these loans is insufficient.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty is that in order to get a loan a farmer must have two guarantors.  I appreciate that it is difficult for the Agricultural Credit Corporation or the Department to make a loan to a farmer without some evidence that he will repay it or without some security for the money advanced.  A farmer whose stock has been wiped out or whose supply of <Col N="1905" /> seeds, if he has any, is barely sufficient to seed his farm and whose machinery is out of date is not in a position in most cases to secure guarantors. No farmer or shopkeeper will act as guarantor for a farmer whose stock has been wiped out.  I think that the Department will have to adopt a different system and get a personal report from an inspector on the conditions of such a farmer.  They will have to consider whether such a farmer is likely to repay a loan.  From the farmer's point of view, it is almost impossible to get a guarantor in many of these cases.</P>
    <P>I think that the Department should also, in cases where farmers have suffered losses, make representation to the local authorities to extend the period for the payment of rates.  I have known cases of farmers who, owing to the severe weather during the harvest, were not in a position to sell their oats, hay or wheat.  If they did sell any, the quantity was largely reduced and, in certain cases, it was not sold at the best prices obtainable. During the last 12 months these farmers have had a very hard time.  The weather during the autumn, the winter and the spring nearly put a number of them out of business, while others were on the brink of having to go.  I suggest that the Department should request the Department of Local Government to ask local authorities to view sympathetically the payment of rates in such cases.</P>
    <P>I should tell the Minister that I was disappointed that he did not give the House an indication of the conversations which officials of his Department had last week with two officials of the British Ministry of Food.  In reply to a question in the House of Commons, it was stated that certain matters had been under consideration.  No matter how we view the uncertain conditions in agriculture, or in the world, the House would be anxious to get from the Government information as to the plans they have for making a new agreement, dealing not merely with live stock but with agricultural products generally.  I referred at an earlier stage to the price differential that is operating against our farmers. <Col N="1906" /> It is time that that price differential was dropped and that every effort was made by the Minister to get a more favourable agreement.  Unless a more favourable agreement can be got conditions in agriculture are bound to be more uncertain.</P>
    <P>In so far as other commodities are concerned two things are essential before considering a new agreement, and these are an increased supply of fertilisers and feeding stuffs in order to increase production.  If we could increase production at a cost that would enable us to supply ourselves with sufficient butter, bacon and eggs, it might be possible to come to an agreement to sell the surplus to Britain or to some other country.  Unless we can increase production at a cost which will enable our farmers to sell at a price that will not merely give them a profit, but that will be within the capacity of the average wage-earner, nothing will convince me that increased prices hold any solution of our problems.  Any increase in the price of agricultural products which results in an increase in the selling price of commodities, not merely to farmers, who may not have sufficient for their families, but for the cities and towns, must ultimately increase the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The Department should consider the problem, not merely from the farmers' point of view&mdash;who are the first consideration of the Department&mdash;but in relation to other sections of the community. It should be borne in mind that the present high prices of certain agricultural products, such as meat and butter, leave no margin for a further-increase, and whatever steps may be desirable to increase production must be taken in the light of that situation. I am anxious to hear the Minister's views on the whole question of our aims and policy, not merely on live-stock production and on the sale of cattle, but to supply our own needs and enable us to sell the surplus at a good trade price abroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate was introduced by the Minister's predecessor, who is now Minister for Social Welfare, and who, for about 15 years, <Col N="1907" /> he succeeded in steering the industry through many difficulties.  He also succeeded in providing for the people of this country as well as for our live-stock needs during the period of the war.  When the war commenced the then Minister was compelled to change his policy almost entirely, but he had foresight enough to make some preparation beforehand to meet what was coming.  He was wise enough to prepare the people by introducing measures for the production of bread. But for that fact, the troubles and difficulties of people here would have been much greater.  I am not saying that the period of the war did not bring about a change that has left many scars and many problems that the present Minister will have to overcome.  Having to face that position, I wish the new Minister well in his task.  Knowing him for a number of years and knowing the experience that he brings to his office, I am quite sure that he is capable of getting over our difficulties. It is essential for the life of this country that he should do so.</P>
      <P>I do not believe we could have any manufacturers operating here if it were not for the agricultural industry and the farmers.  Through their efforts now and in years gone by, by adding to what is known as our foreign assets, they enabled manufacturers to purchase raw materials with which to operate their factories and to employ residents in cities and towns.  Therefore, agriculture is our most important industry.  It is by the industry of farmers in creating credits to meet liabilities, that the business people obtain the raw materials with which to carry on.  They may have been assisted somewhat by Guinness' Brewery and Jacob's biscuits but Deputies will agree that was the only other assistance available with which to purchase the commodities that were needed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fairly obvious that the new Minister has very big difficulties to contend with because these credits were created entirely by the fertility of the soil. We have exhausted a great deal of that fertility.  That was inevitable.  We have created dislocation in the ordinary economy of our agricultural production. <Col N="1908" /> That was also inevitable.  We have now to face up to the task of trying to get back that fertility, because without it I do not see how we are going to increase production.  As Deputy Cosgrave mentioned, if we do not increase production we will reach a position of stand-still.  The new Minister is in a better position than his predecessor because no artificials were available in the past.  The former Minister had a struggle to get corn and wheat produced without any machinery and was on all sides beset with difficulties.  It is to his credit that he got through almost all of them.  Scars have been left.  On every side, no matter where you go, you hear the cry about the scarcity of milk.  As soon as the milk became scarce, the pigs became scarce.  The milk was scarce because we had to use something like 37½ per cent. of the land to feed ourselves. Around our towns milk became extremely scarce and that was entirely due to the fact that the people had to get something to eat and 37½ per cent. of their land had to be put under tillage. Straw may stop the gap a little bit, but it will certainly not produce milk and, therefore, the problem of milk production is not so much a question of breeding as of feeding.</P>
    <P>I have as much experience as anyone in that sort of thing.  I have seen Hereford cows quite equal to the shorthorn or any dairying cow, but they were fed.  We got out of that habit during the war-and it was not altogether during the war that we got out of it; we had begun that many years ago.  There are reasons for it. There is the high cost of production which, again, I agree with Deputy Cosgrave, can only be overcome by increased production.</P>
    <P>The Minister should try to persuade the Minister for Industry and Commerce that all the artificial manures that can be got in here, slag and everything else, should be got in free of duty and as cheap as possible.  No type of agricultural machinery should have any duty imposed on it.  We owe no debt whatever to the industrialists. Our fathers and grandfathers prepared the way, as farmers, so that they could purchase the raw materials.  Without <Col N="1909" /> our aid they could not have done it. Consequently, we owe no debt to them in protecting anything in the line of machinery or artificial manures.</P>
    <P>In that way I believe we would be able to restore fertility to the land and, if we succeed in doing that, we will succeed in increasing production and the standard of living and we will be able to meet the wages that can hardly be met to-day.  The average farmer, doing his best and good as he may be, finds it extremely difficult, because of his low production, to meet the fixed standard of wages.  That is due to the fact that the land is not producing because it has not had sufficient manure.  There was a dribble of manure this year, but it was only a dribble.  Ten times as much manure would be required, but it is not available. I hope every step will be taken to see that more manure is made available.</P>
    <P>In this country we shall all have to work a good deal harder.  Artificial manure and the fertility of the land will not do it all.  We shall all have to work harder.  Take production in the United States of America.  The latest returns show that a man working for two hours there on the land will produce as much as a man working for five hours here or in Great Britain or any other part of Europe.  If that is the case, we will drop out unless we make an effort to improve the position. It is quite true the American is mechanised.  I believe that is the secret of his success.  I trust our new Minister will do his best to see that to the greatest extent possible our agricultural community is mechanised. He should see that the people have available the most modern type of machinery.</P>
    <P>Lots of people will ask, what good is that to the small farmer?  So far as I know, there are tractors and ploughs made to suit the small farmers and, if it is the case in America that production per man can be increased to that extent&mdash;and possibly production in Denmark is more of less on a par&mdash; then it is due to a large extent to mechanisation.  As long as we have to continue the slavery and drudgery that go on here, we cannot progress.  Here <Col N="1910" /> we have a man humped up behind a plough all day with a pair of half-fed horses.  He goes home in the evening and lies in the corner, not even able to wash his hands.  It is that form of work here that drives quite a lot of people off the land.  The young people have imagination and they see what is happening and they promptly conclude: &ldquo;I will not get into that type of rut; I will get out of this in time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We want to induce the farmers to make conditions better for themselves. Machinery is one of the ways to increase production and it is one of the ways to make life easier and better on the land.  I say that because I believe we shall have to stick to production; we shall have to produce off the land. I do not see how any of the foreign countries that formerly supplied us with Indian meal, practically for nothing, can resume those supplies.  In these countries, apparently, they have decided that there will be no slavery either.  They will not get their people to work for slave wages, and perhaps that is a good job, because the cost of production will be more or less equalised.  If we have to pay as much for commodities produced abroad as we have to pay for them to be produced here, the preference should be given to home production.  Conditions seem to be developing in the direction that we will be compelled to do that, and the sooner we set about getting our land back to normal conditions and provide ourselves with ample machinery and ample instruction in the use of that machinery, the better will it be for ourselves.</P>
    <P>In connection with harvesting, I have seen the best of crops produced in County Meath.  There were some excellent crops produced there; I had them myself and I followed them up on other farms.  It is a strange thing that we can grow the best of crops, but, when it comes down to the point of harvesting, everything fails.  I have seen people opening stacks that were apparently well made.  Very experienced men were got to make those stacks and the greatest possible trouble was taken with them.  They were reasonably well thatched, yet the first rows, the first couple of barrels, were <Col N="1911" /> all damp.  Sometimes they had to be thrown down and they might reach the pigs or the fowl.  Generally it was covered up in the straw and lost altogether.  Sometimes it is threshed and it spoils all the rest of the corn because it is all damp.</P>
    <P>I saw people with big hay barns that were built by the Board of Works. The jobs were sound ones and these barns are perhaps the most useful thing around any farmhouse.  Those who had them were able to put corn into them and it was threshed there with practically no loss.  The biggest loss of the average farmer is at the threshing mill and it is all due to the fact that he has no modern shelter for his corn.  The Minister should take up this matter with the Board of Works. There is not much use in talking about the Agricultural Credit Corporation, because I believe that is a hide-bound body which will not get anywhere and could not; it is too far away from the people.</P>
    <P>Efforts should be made to provide farmers with shelters for their carts and their machinery at a reasonable cost.  That is one of the most important things we can do.  We shall have to increase production in every branch of agriculture.  We must always have hay; I believe that is an extremely useful thing from every point of view. So far as pig production is concerned, we are not very big pig producers in County Meath. The districts of Athboy and Oldcastle produce a reasonable number of pigs and formerly there were important pig markets in these centres. To-day production is somewhat restricted; just as in other areas many pigs are not produced in these districts. As I have already said, that is entirely attributable to the scarcity of milk.  If there was more milk, there would be more young pigs fed as milk is essential in the feeding of young pigs.  If that industry is to be revived &mdash;and I hope it will because I think it is a good industry; there is no use in talking beside the matter&mdash;it cannot be revived without cows.  Cows will not yield milk unless they are fed and the land will not be able to feed them in <Col N="1912" /> sufficient numbers unless we get fertilisers. I do not see any other remedy for the matter.  We have heard a lot of misleading propaganda on these matters but that sort of talk does nobody any good.  Even the people who make use of this propaganda are themselves injured by it in the long run; it does them more harm than the people against whom it is directed and it gives the people generally a distorted view of affairs generally.  The very same remarks apply to the diminished production of butter.  The real reason for the diminution in production is the same as that for the lower pig production&mdash;in other words, the diversion of the land from hay production and grass to the growing of commodities which we required for ourselves.  The whole problem is one of the people eating directly what comes out of the ground rather than allow it to be fed to animals.  If we want to get out of that position it does not necessarily mean that we must have 37½ per cent. of the land tilled.  My candid opinion is that if we till 20 per cent. and do it properly we will have sufficient for all purposes.</P>
    <P>The new Minister has to face up to all these problems.  His predecessor, Deputy Dr. Ryan, through sheer necessity was compelled to leave a scar on the agricultural industry.  The new Minister's job will be to heal that up. It is a difficult task because this is one of the most important Departments in the State.  I suppose there is no more involved industry than the agricultural industry.  One day the Minister has to deal with fruit farms, the next day with dairy farmers, the next day with pig farmers, and the next day with poultry farmers and glasshouse farmers.  The handling of the various problems associated with these different types of farming calls for a lot of diplomacy and ability.  I am satisfied that the new Minister has both the ability and the diplomacy to deal with the involved and intricate administration of the Department of Agriculture.</P>

      <P>There are two ways in which this Estimate can be approached. We can approach it from a destructive angle or from a constructive angle. The last Deputy's speech, I will <Col N="1913" /> acknowledge, was slightly provocative in some respects and would tempt an Opposition Deputy to be somewhat destructive in his criticism of Governmental agricultural policy, but when we realise that the present Minister for Agriculture is in his early infancy, as Minister for Agriculture at any rate, I think it would be wise if we endeavoured to be as constructive as possible on this important Estimate. One fact of course is universally acknowledged.  There has been no real increase in the volume of agricultural output in this country for the past 25 years, since the establishment of this State.  That is a lamentable fact but it is a fact that has got to be faced up to.  There are two attitudes which we might adopt towards that fact.  We might say that there is no possibility of an increase, that there is no scope for any extension in the agricultural industry, that we have reached the maximum output of our land and that nothing further can be done.  We might be inclined to take that view if guided by our own experience over the past 25 years, but if we look around us and see other agricultural countries which have expanded their output by 50, 60, 70 or even 100 per cent., we are compelled to admit that there is something radically wrong here, something that requires to be remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all we have got to ask ourselves are those engaged in the agricultural industry receiving their fair share of the national income having regard to the produce of their industry. We know that in the last figures published of national income, the national income was given as £250,000,000 of which the farmers received £90,000,000 or 35 per cent.  In the last so-called normal year, 1938, national income was given as £154,000,000, and of that the agricultural community received about £40,000,000 or one-fourth.  Thus you had the people engaged in the most important industry in the country, the people contributing the largest portion of the nation's wealth, the people who, as Deputy O'Reilly has stated, were the only people who supplied the necessary exports to provide us with purchasing power abroad, receiving <Col N="1914" /> only one-fourth of the national income between them.  When you realise that, you are forced to the conclusion that the national income is inequitably distributed amongst the people and that therefore there is a just case for the State assisting in a more equitable distribution of the national income by providing financial assistance out of general taxation for the assistance of agriculture.</P>
    <P>There are many people who believe that any kind of subsidy is undesirable but when you face up to the fact that the agricultural industry is not getting paid for its produce in the ordinary course of events, you have to admit that some form of assistance must be given to agriculture if you are to equalise matters as between those engaged in agriculture and those engaged in other occupations.  In the last figures of national income, the average income of those gainfully employed outside agriculture was given as about £5 per week while the average income of those engaged in agriculture was given as 52/- per week. There is a problem to be faced and overcome.  It is quite easy to say that the position can be rectified by the farmer increasing the output of agriculture and thereby increasing his income.  We would want to have an assurance that every increase in the output of agriculture and, therefore, in the income to the agricultural community will not be accompanied by a greater increase in the income of the rest of the community.  It has been found that when the income of those engaged in agriculture was stepped up, as occurred during the war years, there was a still greater stepping-up in the income of the rest of the community so that the ratio between the earnings of those engaged in agriculture and of those engaged outside agriculture has always been unfair to the agricultural producer.  There is no use in telling the agricultural producer that he has got to work harder, produce more, and be more efficient unless we guarantee to him that the remuneration which he will receive will be equitable, having regard to that of those engaged outside agriculture. That, I think, should be the first and <Col N="1915" /> most important consideration in framing agricultural policy for the future.</P>
    <P>Having decided that there must be a more equitable distribution of national income in the future, having decided that the farmer and the farm worker are to get a bigger share out of the total bill of income produced by the entire community then we can go on to consider how to bring about a substantial increase in agricultural output.  Deputy O'Reilly said that the war had left scars on agriculture.  He might have gone a little further and said that the economic war left even greater scars on agriculture.  One of the greatest scars on agriculture at the present time is a deficiency in the fertility of our soil.  We know that there was a substantial importation of artificial fertilisers, particularly of phosphates, in the years prior to the economic war.  We know that that importation almost ceased during the economic war period and that the position was only gradually recovering during the years immediately before the war.  That reduction in imported fertility for our soil is perhaps the most serious injury the agricultural industry has suffered.</P>
    <P>As recently as last Sunday I visited a farmer in County Wicklow.  I was struck by the appearance of fertility on his farm.  His pastures and crops all looked exceptionally well, having regard to the area in which his farm is situated.  I asked him to what he ascribed that condition.  He told me that one of the main reasons was the fact that he purchased an extremely large quantity of rock phosphates during the year immediately preceding the war.  That is not the type of purchase an ordinary farmer would make. This man is fairly prosperous with some capital.  He was able to make that purchase and that rock phosphate applied to his soil kept up its fertility during the entire period of the war. We know that rock ground phosphates are not quick-acting.  In fact they are very slow-acting and their effects are not felt for one or two years, but they are felt for six or seven years afterwards. Thus, by a big application of phosphates to his land, this farmer <Col N="1916" /> maintained its fertility and was able to reap good crops and have his pastures in good condition.  If we are going to plan for the future we ought to go allout to get all the phosphates we can secure imported into this country. When shipping is available and when ordinary business transactions can be carried through between nations we ought to bring into this country all the phosphates that can be brought in.  In this connection the Post-War Agricultural Commission, sitting down to plan for agricultural policy, failed to reach agreement on a great many points. However, all the members of the commission were in complete agreement on one point, i.e., that artificial fertilisers and lime should be heavily subsidised during the post-war years.  I think all the reports agreed that a subsidy of 25 per cent. on artificial fertilisers was necessary.  I think all agreed that a subsidy of at least one-third of the cost of lime was also urgently essential. Those two suggestions have, I am sure, been noted by the Government but I have not heard that anything very definite is being done about them.  We know that the post-war commission differed widely on other questions and it may, therefore, be difficult for the Government to decide how to act having regard to recommendations on which this commission gave divergent views.  I think, however, with regard to this matter on which all members of the commission were in complete agreement, that the Government should have no difficulty whatever in making up its mind to implement these suggestions and see that fertilisers and lime are supplied to the farmers at a price very considerably below the import or production cost.  I think that is a fundamental necessity.</P>
    <P>Next, of course, and more or less in conjunction with that proposal, we have the urgent desirability of having our soil tested to estimate the requirements of the soil on different farms. To refer once again to the discussion I had with that progressive farmer on last Sunday, he informed me that lime was of very little use&mdash;that farmers require phosphates.  My own view on the matter is that lime was probably not required on that particular man's farm <Col N="1917" /> because, in all probability, there was enough lime in the soil for the crops. His need was to supply the necessary phosphates.  That farmer, of course, wisely perhaps, was judging from his own personal experience.  On the other hand there are other farmers who have found, because of the acidity of their land, that phosphates give very little return and they are inclined to say that phosphates are of very little use and that lime is the one thing that is essential. It is for the Department of Agriculture to advise the farmers as to what their soil needs.  They can only do that by instructing their officials to go out and encourage the farmers to have tests taken of their soil.  I think our agricultural instructors are not sufficiently insistent upon farmers getting their soil tested.  One very rarely hears them advocating it and one very rarely hears them encouraging farmers to have such tests carried out.  Yet one cannot accurately estimate what the soil requires to bring it up to its maximum fertility unless a scientific analysis is carried out.  A farmer may know that certain crops do well on his land.  He may know that certain types of manure give good results, but until such time as a complete test is taken it will be impossible for the farmer to know what his soil urgently requires.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the matter to which I would like to draw attention. At the present time there is a semi-Government concern fixing agricultural wages.  These wages are fixed at different rates in different areas.  The Agricultural Wages Board must, I suppose, grope blindly in the darkness in deciding which areas shall have the highest rates of wages and which areas shall have the lowest rates.  I hold that you cannot accurately estimate what return land is capable of giving and agriculture is capable of paying in any area unless you know what the quality of the soil is in that particular area.  I have had this matter brought forcibly to my notice in West Wicklow. As everyone knows, West Wicklow contains some of the poorest soil in Ireland.  Up to two months ago it appeared in the fourth group as regards rates of wages.  Now it has been brought into the highest wage <Col N="1918" /> group.  I am convinced that if a test of the soil were taken in West Wicklow &mdash;one or two samples in each townland &mdash;it would be found that the quality of the soil as regards fertility is much lower than in any other of the counties included in the lowest wage group. That is one aspect which demonstrates the necessity for an effective soil testing.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently made a promise that he would set up a tribunal to investigate agricultural costings. Agricultural costings cannot be either thoroughly or usefully investigated until you first of all find out the comparative nature of the soil in each farm under test.  In order to have an intelligent or scientific test the first essential is to classify the soil on the farm according to its chemical constituents. When does the Minister propose to initiate the work of investigating agricultural costings?  There is no use in people coming in here to this House or going elsewhere and stating that the farmer is getting a good price for his wheat, a good price for his milk or a good price for his pigs unless there are official costings which cannot be disputed showing what it costs the farmer to produce each particular commodity. The Minister smiles at the idea of a costings which cannot be disputed. I quite agree that any costings produced will immediately be questioned. They will be questioned by the farmers and they will be questioned by those who are seeking to buy the farmer's produce.  They will be turned down by the farmers and they will be turned down by the purchasers.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture is an impartial body.  It is a disinterested body.  We expect the Department to produce figures of costings which will be acceptable to all.  We have at the present time an official cost of living figure.  We have an agricultural price index.  As far as they go, those figures are accepted as official and they are used as the basis of argument.  I take it that when the Minister sets up his machinery for investigating agricultural costings we shall be presented with figures which will generally be acceptable and which can be accepted as a basis of computation.  To some extent we will be in a position to know <Col N="1919" /> whether or not on an average the farmer is making a profit from his land.</P>
    <P>Now, the law of averages enters in here.  As I said at the outset, the quality of agricultural land varies so much that you have got to test not only the rich land but the very poor land also.  You have to classify the different types of farms.  It might be suggested that in an investigation of costings you should confine yourself to the different types of farms and to different sizes of farms&mdash;the large farm, the middle sized farm and the small farm.  In addition to that you would also have to classify your investigation in regard to the different qualities of land-first grade land, second grade land and third grade land.  I hope that the Minister will get down to this job immediately so that next year when we come to discuss prices we shall have authoritative figures upon which to base our arguments, either for or against higher agricultural prices.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out that the farmer can make himself more prosperous by being more efficient and by increasing his output through his own efficiency.  Before that efficiency can be obtained and before the output can be increased the farmer must be guaranteed a square deal.  It is no use telling a farmer that he must keep better cows in order to build up a good dairy herd if he has no guarantee of getting a good return.  It is no use telling the farmer that he must feed his pigs on the best possible ration and breed to the best advantage if his industry is not going to pay.  The farmer must have some security and some guarantee that he will be paid a fair price in the future.  Agriculture is a long term policy and it is the duty of the State to stand behind the farmer and guarantee him long term prices which are both fair and equitable.</P>

      <P>At the recent conference of primary food producers this question came up for consideration and I think the unanimous agreement was that <Col N="1920" /> trade agreements should be made between the various nations which would ensure that the primary producer would get a more equitable price in future and over a longer period.  It is absolutely essential, as our trade is mainly with Great Britain, that we should set about getting down to a long-term trade agreement with that country.  We ought to be able to convince the people of Great Britain, if they are intelligent people, and I think they are, that their economy is to a great extent bound up with ours, and that it is in their interests, just as it is in our interests, to ensure that we will be producing in future what they urgently need.  If the British Government are prepared to give us favourable terms, we can produce the type of exports that they require.  If it has been recognised in regard to eggs; and something has been done in that direction, it can also be recognised in regard to live stock and various other agricultural products.  There is no reason why we should not be able to fit in our economy with that of Great Britain and ensure that we are planning long ahead to produce what they urgently require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this question of the desirability of security for the farmer in the matter of price, I had a very striking personal experience to-day as I came to this city.  I passed through one of the leading towns in Wicklow where a pig fair was being held.  The fair was exceptionally large, but I must say that the faces of the farmers were extremely long.  There were plenty of good bacon pigs exposed for sale, but there were only a few buyers.  These few buyers could pick and choose and buy at any price they thought fit.  The majority of the pigs were being purchased at the bare minimum price fixed of 160/- per cwt., a price which means a very considerable loss for every man engaged in production.  While the farmers were hanging around the streets hoping for some good-natured buyer to come along and give them a little more, I went into a grocer's shop. A woman came into the shop and asked for bacon.  The grocer told her that he had no bacon and that he had just got a circular from one of the big bacon factories which supplies him informing <Col N="1921" /> him that, owing to the shortage of pigs, they were unable to supply any bacon and would not be able to supply any for a couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>While that unfortunate shopkeeper was trying to explain to that woman that there was no bacon, there were six first-class bacon pigs outside the door.  While he was explaining the position to me, one of these first-class bacon pigs, about 17 stone in weight, was scratching his neck against the jamb of the door.  He kept on scratching his neck against the jamb of the door while the grocer was telling me of his troubles in trying to secure bacon.  The grocer said to me: &ldquo;If it were not for the regulations and for the Pigs and Bacon Commission, I would have that pig there and a dozen of his comrades hanging up in my yard and it would not be long until I would have bacon.&rdquo;  That is what Governmental regulations, control and interference have done to the bacon industry.  In that particular town there was bacon, bacon everywhere and not a bite to eat.  The ordinary working people who wanted bacon and who prefer bacon to any other type of meat and find it more economical could not get it, except of course they were to go to the black market, which is hardly a desirable way of developing an industry.</P>
    <P>What is the cause of the complete breakdown in regard to our supplies of bacon?  The cause is that the producer has not been guaranteed a sufficient price to enable him to produce.  If, for example, the Department, seeing the conditions which prevailed during the emergency, had withdrawn all control, the position would not be as bad as it is to-day.  The prices of pigs and bacon would have risen and the result of the rise would probably have been an increase in production and matters would have rectified themselves.  But the unfortunate activities of the Pigs and Bacon Commission have resulted in the producer being driven out of production, and the growing up of a large and extensive black market in bacon which is utterly undesirable.  If there was no control there would not be all the complaints that are heard about the bacon curers.</P>
    <P>There is a wide margin between the <Col N="1922" /> price of the pig purchased from the producer and the price charged for bacon.  That margin would be drastically cut down by competition if the curers and wholesalers were charging too much, and consumers would get bacon at a more reasonable price.  That is inevitable.  Inept and inefficient control has resulted in reducing supplies and in undesirable methods.</P>
    <P>Deputy Commons referred to Deputy Ward.  Why he did so I do not know. There is one matter which was very forcibly brought to my notice some time ago, and that was the complaint made by a shopkeeper, that pork butchers in Dublin could get pork delivered to them from a factory in County Monaghan.  I do not know if there is any law to prevent a bacon factory supplying pork butchers.  I do not know if there is any law sufficiently watertight to keep bacon curers under control.  If bacon curers and pork butchers are not controlled the sooner all control over the bacon industry is abandoned the better.</P>
    <P>The Government set up a committee of inquiry to deal with post-war agricultural policy and their recommendations were issued in the form of a White Paper or draft scheme to regulate the bacon industry in the future.  I have very little hope that any progress will result from that White Paper.  I believe that regulation or control by Government should be the minimum, and that beyond fixing a definite minimum price, that was as far as it should go.  Outside that, far-reaching State encouragement should be given to the establishment of co-operation in the bacon-curing industry.  If co-operation could work well in the production of butter it should work equally well in the production of bacon.  There is no reason why the bacon-curing industry should be in the hands of people who have no interest whatever and no knowledge of the production of pigs.  The producers of pigs are the important persons.  They should be co-operatively organised for the completion of the process of finishing pigs and conversion into bacon.  It is along the lines of co-operation that the bacon industry must be reorganised, and it is along those lines that we will have to fix minimum <Col N="1923" /> prices, based on costings.  That is the only way to make the bacon industry secure.</P>
    <P>With regard to the dairying industry a great deal has been said about the decline that is taking place in production. Much has been said about our failure to get increased output in that industry.  Much has also been said about the dual-purpose cow.  Some Deputies believe that we can get the maximum production of milk from a type of cow which will also produce best quality beef.  That view has been held by the Department for the past 25 years, and while a great deal has been done to produce a dual-purpose cow, such as the dairy shorthorn, I am not convinced that any real success has been achieved.  If we look at any country which has stepped up butter production during the past 15 or 20 years, we find that an enormous increase was brought about mainly by concentrating upon a milking strain.  The matter was dealt with in a report by Dr. Kennedy. He stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The factors responsible for the increase in the volume of New Zealand's dairy industry have been analysed.  Of the total increase 57.4 per cent is attributed to better feeding&mdash;that is, better pastures and more food conserved for winter use&mdash; and 26.2 per cent. to &lsquo;change in breed composition, including grading up through use of pedigree sires.&rsquo; While the limiting factor in milk production in this country at present is undoubtedly lack of adequate and nutritious food, improvement of yield per cow is essential to a progressive and prosperous industry. The change of breed in New Zealand during the period of expansion is very significant.  Jerseys increased from 29.6 per cent. of all dairy cows in 1921 to 75 per cent. in 1938 while Shorthorns in the same period decreased from 56 per cent. to 5.6 per cent., the other breeds in 1938 being Friesians 7.9 per cent., and Ayreshires 7.8 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is very significant that in countries where a large increase was brought about there was concentration upon the dairying strain.  Here we find that <Col N="1924" /> farmers engaged almost exclusively in milk production are going over more and more to the milk producing strain. That tendency would have been very much more marked over the last ten years, but for the resistance of the Department, which has fought desperately for what they call a dual-purpose breed.  It is easy to dogmatise on agricultural matters.  I do not intend to dogmatise on this question. I believe it may be possible to produce a dual-purpose breed, but we have not produced it yet; we have not produced a breed of cows that will give a satisfactory all-round yield and at the same time be satisfactory from the point of view of producing store cattle.</P>
    <P>There will always be occasional dual-purpose cows, but they will be more or less individuals of their class.  There will be cows which will produce the highest possible quantity of milk and which will produce first-class store cattle, but to get a distinctive breed that will give those results is, I think, an extremely difficult matter.  It is an ideal that has never been achieved in any country up to the present.  We know that in Denmark and New Zealand and the United States, wherever farmers go in extensively for dairying, they concentrate on a dairy breed, and where they go in extensively for beef production, they concentrate on some beef variety.  One or two cows will be dual-purpose cows, just the same as you will have the dual-purpose Deputy, the Deputy who will kick the Government at one moment in the House and then kiss the Government in the division lobbies.  That type of Deputy is more or less unique.  The type of cow that will produce a high yield of milk and first quality beef is more or less in the nature of a freak.</P>
    <P>Taking a long view, I do not think we will injure the live-stock industry if we encourage those farmers who are mainly concerned with milk production to go in for a purely milk-producing breed and, on the other hand, if we encourage those farmers who are mainly interested in beef production to go in extensively for a first-class beef-producing type of animal.  It is along those lines we shall have to develop in the future.  We cannot maintain the <Col N="1925" /> dairying industry, as other Deputies have pointed out, upon low milk breeds of cows, and the sooner we recognise that the better.  On the other hand, we can do a great deal in the non-milk-producing districts, the mixed farming districts, to improve the beef-producing qualities of our cows.  We will get a still better type of cow from the point of view of producing store cattle.</P>
    <P>Thus, in certain well-defined areas we would get the highest production of milk and we could bring about a great improvement in the breed of cattle for beef purposes.  It is along those lines that eventually we shall have to proceed, but the matter is one of very grave importance and any steps taken must be weighed very carefully, because it is not a matter into which farmers should rush blindly. There are certain dairy varieties which, if crossed with other types of cattle, would produce the worst possible type conceivable, and it is to avoid that and to ensure that both branches of the industry will be allowed to develop normally that we should aim.</P>
    <P>I have a feeling that if there had been no Department of Agriculture, no inspections and none of the schemes for the improvement of live stock, the farmers themselves, groping in their own way towards a better paying type of stock, would have reached a more efficient type of production.  The farmers in the dairying districts would be relying to-day, as in New Zealand, America and Denmark, on a purely milk-producing strain, while the farmers in the mixed farming districts would be concentrating more on a better type of beef animal.  The Department, to a great extent, has interfered with the farmer's intelligence and has restricted his enterprise.  It might be that the farmers would have made some mistakes, but they could not have done much worse than the Department has done over the past 13 or 14 years.</P>
    <P>The matter cannot be allowed to rest. We cannot allow the dairying industry to depend upon its present low-producing types of stock.  For that reason there is an urgent necessity for an investigation of the whole position and, once a decision is arrived at, it must be promptly acted upon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1926" /> As Dr. Kennedy pointed out in that paper to which I have referred, the second factor in regard to milk production is feeding.  On this question, also, both inside and outside the Department there is a wide divergence of opinion.  We have the Department from time to time recommending the production of ensilage on our farms for the feeding of live stock over the winter. There have been various suggestions issued by the Department and advice given, but little practical work has been done, and the time has come to investigate why ensilage has not caught on in this country.  If it has all the advantages claimed for it, if you can preserve the best of the grass for winter feeding with comparatively little loss by this means, why has it not been adopted more extensively here? That is a matter which ought to be immediately investigated.  Is it because farmers have found that the methods of preserving grass, or the types of silos established, have not been successful?</P>
    <P>We know there are various ways and means of preserving grass.  It can be preserved without the addition of any acid or molasses.  I do not think any extensive experiments have been carried out in order to decide which is the best type of ensilage, which is the most economical and the most efficient. If there have been experiments, I do not think there have been sufficient public demonstrations indicating the best type.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the Department throughout the various counties to embark more widely upon demonstrations of what they consider the best type of farming.  Some time ago I sponsored a motion here asking the Department to take, in every farming district, a farm that would be typical of that district and run it for the purpose of demonstrating how well the Department can run a farm.  They have never allowed themselves to be tempted to do so and I think it is a pity. If the Department of Agriculture has any real worthwhile message to give to the people, they should give it by demonstrations rather than by lectures <Col N="1927" /> or leaflets and the farmer will absorb it more quickly in that way.</P>
    <P>There is a Supplementary Estimate to provide loans for losses due to the abnormal weather during the winter months.  I do not think that the losses the farmers suffered owing to the abnormal weather during the past year have ever been accurately ascertained. The figures which the Department will receive from farmers who are applying for loans will not cover more than a small percentage of the losses suffered because there are tens of thousands of farmers who have suffered who will not apply for these loans.  I think it is unfortunate that the Government, realising the magnitude of this problem, were not a little more generous.  An attempt was made by the Irish Farmers' Federation to ascertain the losses suffered by farmers in County Wicklow.  The returns given by 128 farmers in that county showed that these farmers lost between them 4,512 sheep, 570 cattle and 15 horses, but even the Irish Farmers' Federation was unable to obtain a full list of the losses because, in a matter of this kind, farmers are inclined to keep their losses to themselves and forget about them.  The figures which I have given for County Wicklow show that a very grave calamity befell a large percentage of the farmers of that county.  Some farmers, of course, lost only a small percentage of their total stock but there were some farmers who lost as high as 80 and 90 per cent. of their total stock.  I feel that farmers who suffered most severely should have been treated in a more generous way than by the provision of a mere four year loan.</P>
    <P>It is true that this loan is provided free of interest but there are very grave disadvantages in seeking a loan at the present time.  Live stock, both sheep and cattle, are at higher prices than they have been for a long time but I think there is very little certainty or even probability that these prices will remain.  Therefore, the farmer who sets out on borrowed money to purchase cattle or sheep is taking a very grave risk and at the end of three or four years he may find himself perhaps <Col N="1928" /> in a worse position than that in which he is to-day.  Even in Great Britain this calamity was met by the provision of a certain amount of compensation. There was a nation-wide appeal to the public to subscribe funds and the State provided 100 per cent. of the amount subscribed&mdash;that is £ per £ of the amount subscribed.  That scheme if adopted here would have relieved some of the worst cases.  The man who lost 5 or 10 per cent. of stock might not benefit but the man who lost 80 or 90 per cent. was certainly entitled to some definite direct aid.  I think it was unfortunate that some scheme of compensation no matter how inadequate, was not provided.</P>
    <P>In Britain also, the abnormal weather compelled the Government in spring to revise their prices for finished products and to increase their acreage subsidies.  They realised that owing to the circumstances under which farmers had to labour during the winter months they would be unable to secure the same volume of production as if there had been normal weather and, therefore, they supplemented the prices which had been promised.  Nothing in that way was done in this country.  The farmers who suffered losses were just left to suffer.  I think that, even now, it may not be too late for the Government to reconsider their attitude.  It may be possible now to ascertain more accurately than some months ago what the losses really were.  I think if there are, as everyone realises there are, some very grave cases of severe losses, something should be done to recompense the farmers concerned.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable sum in this Estimate for research and this moves me to draw the Minister's attention to a report which I have read somewhere in the Press of experiments which have been carried out in Australia in regard to mastitis and abortion in cattle.  The surprising discovery has been made in that country that inoculation with goat's blood has proved an effective remedy for these two deplorable diseases.  I am not putting that suggestion forward from any selfish point of view on behalf of County Wicklow, since it is noted for its mountain goats, but if that experiment proved successful <Col N="1929" /> in Australia it should be at least investigated in this country.  We all know that practical farmers over a long period insisted on keeping at least one goat with their dairy herds.  They claimed that by keeping one or two goats amongst the dairy herds there was less incidence of discase than otherwise.  I once asked a farmer if he could give any explanation of that matter and he said that his only explanation was that if you had a goat about the place amongst the cattle, you would spend so much time cursing the goat that you would not have any time to curse any of the rest of the live stock, therefore you would have better luck with your cattle and other live stock.  That, of course, was one explanation, but if this experiment in Australia was as successful as it was claimed to be, it provides another explanation.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever on the case made that goats have always been immune from almost all diseases&mdash;there seems to be some special immunity for this animal and this animal's blood, which may be utilised with great advantage. There is no doubt that the losses of farmers, particularly dairy farmers, from those two diseases are abnormal.  If a small sum of money is spent on investigating this particular suggestion I think it will not be foolishly spent.</P>

      <P>The Minister has, undoubtedly, inherited a difficult problem. The war dislocated our agricultural economy in many ways.  It is very doubtful if it will ever assume the same pattern it had prior to the war. We were obliged, through circumstances, to undertake the production of certain commodities for which the land of this country was not really suited but the production of which was undertaken in order that the people should be fed.  In the course of doing so we had, naturally, to depart from agricultural tradition.  The effort to get back to the economy that really suits the needs of the country and that will be able to provide adequately for the people in the future will be rather difficult and will certainly make the Minister devote many hours of anxious thought to the methods he will <Col N="1930" /> have to adopt in order to overcome these difficulties and handicaps. The question of food production is receiving more attention to-day throughout the world than ever before.  Certain highly placed gentlemen, inspired by humanitarian motives, have established an international organisation in order to ensure that essential foodstuffs shall be equitably distributed and that the people of the world will not run the risk again of suffering from want or the fear of want.  We do not know what measure of success that organisation will meet with but we do sincerely hope that it will succeed in achieving its objects and that it will link up all the nations of the world for the purpose of bringing about this ideally happy state of affairs.  Not merely is it the desire of these people to ensure that want shall be banished from this world altogether but there is another vitally important point they wish to achieve, i.e., that the prices of these essential commodities shall be maintained at a reasonably economic level.  I think that is very important. The backward position of agriculture in many countries is due to this question of prices.  In fact the problem of prices is responsible for many of our own agricultural problems and difficulties. It is because of the violent fluctuations in prices that so many farmers, and especially so many farmers' sons, are anxious to leave the farms to-day. If this organisation succeeds and spreads its tentacles through every country in the world it is quite conceivable that, in the course of time, some agricultural organisation will be established in the country for the purpose of ensuring that the prices of our primary agricultural products will always be maintained at a reasonably economic level whether there is a plentiful supply or whether there is a scarcity.  That is the problem we have to face up to in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am reluctant to use the expression &ldquo;fixed prices&rdquo; nevertheless any Minister for Agriculture who faces up seriously and honestly to the problems that confront him must take into consideration this question of fixed prices for certain essential commodities. As I say, I am reluctant to use that expression.  Nevertheless I realise <Col N="1931" /> we cannot do without it in discussing the policy of the Department of Agriculture to-day.  It is a question we must always keep at the back of our minds.  I am anxious to see in what way this new international organisation proposes to tackle this question of fixed prices.  I am perfectly certain, if they do succeed in devising a means for dealing with this difficult problem, we in this country will be able to derive a useful lesson from it and that it will enable us here to solve one problem which undoubtedly we will have to face up to in the near future.  Our agriculture has always been in a precarious position on account of the insecurity of prices and it seems to be useless to speak about production on the land unless the farmers have some sense of security and some guarantee that, as a result of their labour and toil in order to produce more, they will get remunerative prices.  That is a problem that we shall have to face up to very seriously in the coming years.  The Minister has been taunted with the fact that he made no reference whatsoever to the report of the committee established to deal with post-war agricultural problems and that he has given no indication as to whether he has formulated any policy based on that particular report.  I am perfectly certain that perhaps the delay in formulating such a policy is due entirely to the difficulty I have mentioned just now&mdash; the difficulty of the guaranteed price. After all, in the absence of a guaranteed price&mdash;I will say it again even at the risk of repeating myself&mdash;I do not see how production on the land is going to be increased more substantially.  We all realise that production must be increased if we are going to hold our place in the world to-day.  It is vitally important that an effort should be speedily made to increase production and especially production on the land. So far as I can see we will have to rely for at least another five years, perhaps, on increased production from the land in order that we will be able to buy in the markets of the world the essential goods we require.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce stated quite recently that he cannot <Col N="1932" /> hold out any hope for an increase in industrial production because the essential machinery for that increased production is not obtainable at the present time and the parts for existing machines cannot be obtained either. So far as my recollection goes the Minister said that it is very unlikely that there will be any increase in industrial production for at least four or five years.  We must, therefore, fall back on the land for the increased production necessary to enable us to purchase the materials we so urgently require for the country's needs.  It is a difficult problem I admit.  As several Deputies have already mentioned agricultural production has been stagnant for a number of years past.</P>
    <P>Recently I was looking through some figures and I found that in 1929-30 we exported 51.4 per cent. of our agricultural output.  In 1942-43 the proportion was 23.5 per cent.  I admit that in the intervening years the pattern of our agricultural economy had altered substantially, but during all those years the volume of our output remained somewhat the same.  Prior to 1929 we imported sugar.  After 1929 we produced the bulk of our own requirements.  Prior to the war years we imported huge quantities of wheat. During the war years we produced substantial quantities of wheat for our own needs.</P>
    <P>The production per man per acre in this country is notoriously low as compared with other countries.  Until we succeed in increasing the output per man per acre I see very little hope of any immediate improvement at all events in agricultural output in this country.  The biggest problem which confronts the Minister is to find out what exactly is wrong with our agriculture at the present time, what means he must adopt in order to increase output and what are the factors which are to-day responsible for the almost static position of agriculture over the past 25 years.  Until an answer is found to these questions it appears to me that the Minister cannot hope to do very much in order to increase output.  We all recognise that if we are to survive at all&mdash;unless, as <Col N="1933" /> the Minister for Industry and Commerce pointed out recently, we are obliged to reduce our standard of living&mdash;we will have to find some ways and means of increasing our output. That is one of the reasons why I am so interested in the work of this international organisation.  It appears to me that those who were responsible for starting that organisation have got down to the real essentials and to the fundamentals of this problem of agricultural production.  It is worth while watching their work and learning the lessons which they will undoubtedly have to teach, not only to the people of this country but to the people of other countries as well.</P>
    <P>Earlier in the debate to-day it was suggested that we should avail of every possible opportunity for the purpose of securing the most favourable market obtainable for our agricultural exports. Since the war we have had people from Belgium, Holland and other European countries here to purchase our cattle and some other agricultural products.  But since then I have not heard of any inquiries being made by those people with the object of making trading agreements in the future.  I think we were told some time ago that no such inquiries had been made.  We are left then with that country with which we always traded in the past.  That is Great Britain.  In view of the changes which are taking place in the world to-day and the further revolutionary changes which will take place in the world in the future it is essential that we should enter into some agreement with Great Britain to ensure that we shall have some foothold there for whatever agricultural products we shall have to market.</P>
    <P>At the present time most of the meat consumed in Great Britain&mdash;and it is not very much&mdash;comes from South America.  Denmark is speedily getting back into butter, bacon and egg production. New Zealand is still sending big quantities of butter to Great Britain and there are other countries also sending large consignments of agricultural products.  It seems to me that the time is now opportune to make overtures with a view to securing some <Col N="1934" /> share of that business.  We do not know what bargains with Britain these other countries have made.  We know that Canada has made a trade agreement with her.  We know that negotiations are going on with America at the present time.  Agreements have also been concluded with New Zealand and Australia; and Denmark is anxious to secure a trade bargain with her for the supply of butter, eggs and bacon. There is an old adage which says: &ldquo;It is always advisable to take time by the forelock.&rdquo;  It seems to me because of the anxiety of these other countries to get a foothold in the British market we should take steps immediately to secure some share of that market for ourselves.  There will always be a market for a certain percentage of our live-stock exports&mdash;a valuable and a profitable market I hope.  But England is herself now going into live-stock production and we do not know to what extent she will be prepared to take our live stock in the future.  We may find ourselves limited and restricted and for that reason it is important that we should have some definite agreement with her now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the British price policy which favours the export of store cattle and penalises our export of fat cattle which to some extent deprives our agricultural economy and our tillage policy of an essential live-stock basis.  The British, of course, look at this question from the point of view of their own essential needs.  Up to the present their policy has been to insist that we send them our stores which stores will then be fattened by the British farmers.  There is an obvious advantage to them in this particular policy and it should be our purpose in any discussions in the future to ensure that that restriction will be modified to such an extent as to enable us to fatten a substantial percentage of our own store cattle in this country.  It is important from the point of view of our agricultural economy that we should continue stall feeding.  The Scotch farmers who go in for stall feeding on an extensive scale are not so much concerned with the profits which they make although that profit is an important factor&mdash;they <Col N="1935" /> are concerned more with the manurial advantages they derive from stall feeding.</P>
    <P>I suggest these are all matters that should be discussed with Britain.  It is obvious from the visit recently paid to this country by officials of the British Ministry of Agriculture that they are interested in our agricultural economy.  I do not know what transpired at the discussions which took place but I am sure that the officials of our Department of Agriculture are alive to the advantages of having an understanding with Great Britain at the present time and I feel certain that they pressed home the advantages which a trading agreement would have for the mutual benefit of both countries. In any event, I would take it that the visit of these officials is an evidence of goodwill.  It would appear as if the atmosphere at present was favourable for making some agreement or bargain with the British regarding our live stock, in fact all our agricultural products.</P>
    <P>The question of milk production was raised here by a number of Deputies. The Minister did state that he was setting up a consultative committee to advise him on the operation of the Live Stock Breeding Act.  I am glad the Minister is doing that.  I think it is a move in the right direction, because it was never intended that that Act should stereotype our live-stock policy. We realise that the Act may have operated favourably for the production of beef, but perhaps unfavourably for the production of milk.  Milk production is a rather difficult problem.  It is a difficult problem for any country such as ours which is engaged so extensively in the export of store cattle I know there are many farmers who believe the shorthorn cow is unsuited for milk production; at least that it is not possible to develop a type of shorthorn cow suitable for the production of milk and suitable, at the same time, for the production of a calf that will realise a good price on the export market.</P>
    <P>There are two minds apparently on that subject.  There is one that seems to think that, if we are to increase milk production, we will have to bring <Col N="1936" /> in some of the recognised milking strains of cattle.  There is another school of thought which still stoutly maintains that it is possible to evolve a type of dual purpose shorthorn cow capable of producing milk in large quantities and, at the same time, of producing the type of calf we want for feeding for export purposes.  Personally, my own views lean to the latter class of people, because I still think that it ought to be possible for us to produce the type of dual purpose shorthorn cow which we have been striving to get for a considerable number of years past.  I personally would regret that efforts to find that type of cow would be discontinued.</P>
    <P>It should be our aim in our dairying policy to preserve at all costs our present exports of live stock, and I sincerely hope that the Minister will not be unduly influenced by those other people who want to bring in the Friesian and other breeds of cows with high milk yielding records.  There is no doubt that many of these breeds produce a large quantity of milk, perhaps of poor quality.  But, in estimating the relative value of a purely milking strain cow and that of the dual purpose cow such as we are trying to get, the value of the calf must be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>There are some farmers who are inclined to argue that the calf is actually more valuable than the milk. A well-known exhibitor at the Dublin Show argued to me no later than Saturday last that it was a mistake for certain people to advocate the introduction of purely milking strain breeds of cows; that we should try to raise the milk standards of the shorthorn, but by all means preserve the calf.  In fact, he argued, convincingly to me at least, that the calf was even more valuable in certain circumstances than the milk.  However, that is a matter which will be investigated by the committee, and I am sure the Dáil will be given an opportunity to discuss the recommendations of the committee before they are given effect to by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred at some length to a circular letter sent to Deputies <Col N="1937" /> by the Bacon Curers' Association.  The members of the Bacon Curers' Association were at liberty to circularise Deputies or any group of individuals if they thought that by doing so they would succeed in ventilating their grievances.  Anybody reading the circular would be forced to the conclusion that they have a legitimate grievance and that it should be possible to do something to meet the case which they have made.  The broad fact is that pig production has decreased very substantially.  The Minister referred to the White Paper which has been issued.  The recommendations in the White Paper were accepted by the Government with a promise to introduce legislation later for the purpose of implementing these recommendations.</P>
    <P>On reading through that White Paper I found that the number of pigs required to be slaughtered annually to satisfy home requirements may be tentatively estimated at 800,000.  On page 5, there is a table given showing the pig stocks in this country on 1st June of each year from 1928 to 1945. Prior to 1935, the year in which the Live Stock Breeding Act was passed into law, the number of pigs in this country averaged about 1,000,000.  They averaged roughly about 1,000,000 up to 1940.  Each year since 1940 the number has decreased.  It decreased from 763,000 in 1941 to 426,037 in 1945. Therefore, if it takes 800,000 pigs to supply the requirements of the home market, in 1945, the last year apparently for which figures are available, pig stocks in this country were only 426,037, approximately half of the requirements of the country.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that food undoubtedly had an important bearing on the decline in pig production.  But surely there must be some other reason.  Many farmers who bought Indian meal for the feeding of pigs, cows and hens in the past and who could not obtain Indian meal or maize during the war years grew barley.  We were told even by the Minister's Department that barley was a very good substitute for Indian meal or maize.  In fact, there are certain officials of the Department who would <Col N="1938" /> argue that barley is even a better food for pigs than maize or Indian meal.  As I said, many farmers who were engaged in pig production grew barley specially for the purpose of feeding pigs and fowl and even cattle.  Yet, pig production declined consistently from 1941 to 1945.</P>
    <P>I was one of those who argued when the Bill regulating bacon products was going through the Dáil that it was a mistake to introduce control, that for certain psychological reasons control of any description did not suit our people and that it would have a detrimental effect on the industry.  I do not imagine that the removal of control to-day would affect the position one way or another.  The position is so bad that it is very hard to know what to do to restore pig production to the position it occupied in the years prior to 1945 when the Act was passed.</P>

      <P>There is the Pigs Marketing Board with an army of inspectors going around making investigations: There are also returns to be made by those who are engaged in pork production and in the sale of bacon.  It appears to me that from the day control started the pig population began to decrease.  If it is ever to be restored control in any shape or form will have to be removed and the army of inspectors employed by the bacon board given some more lucrative employment.  I suggest to the Minister that he should deal with this problem in a much more serious way than <Col N="1939" /> he did when introducing the Estimate. He should tell the House the real reasons for the decline in the pig population.  After all the food position is only one aspect.</P>

      <P>If the Minister racks his brain he could give another.  He should also tell us what steps he proposes to take to restore the industry so that we will be able to provide all the bacon we require.  According to the White Paper 800,000 pigs are required every year for home consumption.  Surely we should be able to supply our own needs in bacon when it is remembered that prior to 1935 we were able to export large quantities of bacon.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem should be examined seriously.  If the Minister decided to set up a consultative council to deal with milk production I suggest that he should also set up another committee to investigate the real reason for the decline in the pig population, and to ascertain what steps should be taken to restore the industry to the position it occupied prior to the introduction of the Act of 1935.  I was glad that Deputy O'Reilly advocated the removal of all duties on raw materials needed in the agricultural industry.  He referred especially to artificial manures and to agricultural machinery.  As a farmer I am sure the Minister realises, as well as I do, the importance of getting supplies of artificial manures in order to restore the fertility of soil which depreciated considerably during the war years.  It is criminal in present circumstances that there should be any duty whatever on such things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not any.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Minister will do his best to get in the largest possible supply of artificial manures so that farmers can use them generously in making up for the ravages of recent years.  As to loans for the replacement of stock that was lost in the blizzard, I may say that <Col N="1940" /> the losses were more extensive than the Minister realised when he first dealt with the matter.  The losses in every county, and more especially in mountainous districts, were severe.  I doubt if the Minister is yet aware of the total number of people who suffered losses during that period.  I do not like grants in any shape or form, but I am thinking of a poor district in County Leitrim with which the Minister is familiar, Glenade, where farmers, who live almost exclusively by sheep rearing, lost all their stock. I have been told that some farmers are not going to avail of the loans as they feel that they would not be able to repay them.  Their case may be an extreme one and perhaps the degree of poverty there would be greater than in other parts.  I mention the matter now so that the Minister would bear that area in mind, and perhaps be able to devise other means to help it.  Assuming that a loan was granted, I understand that the people there would not be able to buy more than half the numbers of sheep that they had before the blizzard, in view of the present price of sheep.  I understand that special representations have been made to the Minister about the position in that district and perhaps he would devise some means to help it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to Deputies dealing with the decline in the pig population, I think the explanation is a very simple one.  From 1940 up to the present time we were concerned here with a major problem, and that was the provision of food for human beings.  We have heard a good deal about the decline in the pig population, but I wish the Minister to take note of the fact that in each county, and especially in County Dublin, we have numbers of model farmers who make farming a success.  Not alone do they make the industry a success by going in for a particular type of farming, but they are able to produce and to give a good living to their employees.  I am afraid the State has not given sufficient recognition to such farmers.  We have not enough good practical farmers.  When I see a good practical farmer who has succeeded in making a success of his business, that <Col N="1941" /> is proof that there is a model farm in that district.  I know numbers of such farms where, in addition, there are poultry, pigs and other agricultural products.</P>
      <P>Reference was made by previous speakers to the possibility of increasing the price of agricultural produce. I definitely would welcome that, because I would like to see the farmer getting a decent return for his labour so that he will be able to pay his workers a decent wage.  But if we increase the price of agricultural produce and keep on increasing it, at what stage are we to stop?  If the nation is to become prosperous, there must be increased production.  I can give the Minister several examples from my own county where farmers, who have been practical in all aspects of agriculture, have succeeded in making farming pay.  Not alone have they made themselves wealthy, but the State has benefited as a result of their labours.</P>
      <P>We have been told that agricultural returns have declined.  Certain aspects of agriculture may not be developed as highly now as they were some time ago, but we must realise that we were living through a transition period.  Some years ago certain agricultural products, such as wheat, went up by over 500 per cent.  I should like to see the Minister giving greater recognition to poultry farms.  If it is possible, where expert poultry keepers have not enough land the Minister should encourage the Minister for Lands favourably to consider an addition to their holdings.  Such people should get special recognition.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to learn that the Minister is about to set up a committee to deal with milk production.  That is an aspect of our agricultural policy about which a number of questions have been asked.  The man in the street would not mind giving a little more for butter if he could get enough of it.  The Minister's predecessor did his best under very adverse circumstances and I welcome this Minister's proposal to set up a committee to help him in solving this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's broad view with regard to the dairying industry. Representations have been made to him <Col N="1942" /> about compulsory tillage in dairying districts and it was stated that it would be detrimental to milk production if dairy farmers were obliged to comply fully with the tillage regulations.  The Minister has taken a practical interest in that aspect and he has indicated his anxiety to encourage the production of milk.  Milk production has been a source of annoyance to everybody. People who have been short of butter, whether they are poor or rich, would not mind giving a little more for an improved supply.</P>
    <P>The farm improvements scheme has been welcomed throughout the country. I would like to see the scheme extended so as to help farmers to get a supply of water into their farmyards.  A supply of clean water is most essential from the point of view of dairying and hygiene.  I would like to see the Minister introducing a scheme whereby farmers could lay water on to their farmyards.  Perhaps the Minister might consider giving grants towards the sinking of pumps.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt a little with the bacon position.  I would like to see the country people going in more for pig rearing.  Years ago, no matter what the circumstances might be, every man with a little holding reared pigs. Of course, when food became short, that had a detrimental effect on pig rearing, but we will soon reach the position when it will be possible for our people to resume the rearing of pigs.  I would like to see small holders buying bonhams and adopting the methods that were so common in the country years ago.  It was sound economy when the small farmers and labourers, and anybody else in a position to do so, kept two, four and even six pigs.  I would like to see pig rearing on those lines encouraged.</P>
    <P>In the transition period our aim was to feed human beings instead of animals.  Many people then got out of pig rearing, but it would be a catastrophe if that position were allowed to continue.  I am sure the Minister has all these matters in mind.  Being reared on the land, I realise the difficulties and how hard it is to get the people to go back on something they have given up.</P>
    <P>So far as artificial manures are concerned, <Col N="1943" /> I think that is merely pushing the open door, because the Minister is keenly alive to the need for artificial manures.  During the past 12 months I am aware that certain farmers, who were compelled to till their quota in counties bordering on County Dublin, kept tilling the same land over and over again.  In that way they destroyed the fertility of their land and retarded the drive for food production.  One cannot have much sympathy with people who are so devoid of a national outlook as to keep tilling the same land, so destroying its fertility.  The good practical farmer will rotate his tillage every four or five years and he will then have meadow.  You have a number of farmers with lots of land at their disposal and they have tried to destroy the fertility of the soil by having the same crop, wheat or oats, for five or six years.  No soil can stand that.</P>
    <P>The model farmers in each county are worthy of special attention from the Department.  There are many little farmers in this country who take a practical interest in their holdings and they should be given every encouragement.  We know there are State model farms, but these are too far removed from the people.  In my county we have as good farmers as could be got in any part of Europe.</P>
    <P>I heard some references to cow-testing associations and I am inclined to agree with the remarks of the previous speaker in regard to these associations. I should like to see the activities of these bodies co-ordinated.  I know they are co-ordinated in a general way already, but I feel that more practical results would be obtained if we had one definitely recognised body.  I was speaking only last night to the supervisor of the cow-testing association in my area and I was satisfied, having learned the amount of work he had to do and the small remuneration which he received, that it was not sufficient to induce a man to work in a practical way.  In referring to another matter, I may perhaps impinge on the affairs of another Department, the Department of Lands, but I think that the Department of <Col N="1944" /> Agriculture should instruct their inspectors to encourage farmers to plant shelter belts in the vicinity of the houses and farmyards.  Not alone do these shelter belts beautify the place, but they also enhance the appearance of the holding in every way.</P>
    <P>As regards horticulture, I feel that farmers generally do not produce sufficient fruit.  In other countries farmers produce a wide variety of agricultural products, so that if one type fails they will have something else to fall back upon.  I should like to see fruit growing encouraged amongst large and small farmers as this would be a type of production which would pay them handsomely in the end.</P>
    <P>In so far as loans for restocking farms are concerned, the Minister has already extended the time within which applications may be received.  I have here a letter which shows that in one small section of the mountainous district of County Dublin, practically 1,000 head of sheep and cattle were lost during the abnormal weather of the early spring.  I have attended meetings of these people and, seeing that the losses have been so heavy, in that small district, I feel that the total losses all along the Dublin mountains would run into thousands.  Whilst the people are most grateful for the loans which are being provided, they feel a certain difficulty in asking their neighbours to become guarantors for these loans.  I know the Department must have some guarantee that the loans will be repaid within a certain time but I should like the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to some alternative means of guaranteeing the repayment of these loans.  If an inspector went round he could easily ascertain whether these people were honest and his word should be sufficient to show that they would repay the loans within a reasonable period.  I know some cases where these people were completely broken financially.  I know one case of a man who had 120 sheep and who lost 100.  That man was only too anxious to get work on the roads afterwards and he is not able to pay his annuities or his rates.  There are several others of that type.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the Minister should consider the possibility of <Col N="1945" /> spreading the repayment of the loans over a five-year period instead of over a four-year period.  If the people were not called upon to pay, say, the first moiety before three years' time, it would give them great encouragement.  At the present moment, cattle and sheep are very dear, and if these people are to reap any benefit from these loans, it will take them at least three years to reap that benefit.  I suggest therefore that the Minister should favourably consider spreading the repayment of the loan over five or six years and that the beneficiaries should not be asked to repay any part of it before three years at least.  There is always the possibility that next winter may also be a very bad season and that these people may be faced with the very same problem.  The Minister is a practical farmer and I recognise that he has been most sympathetic to any representations which I have had to make to him from time to time.  It is with the utmost confidence, therefore, that I appeal to him to consider sympathetically the suggestions which I have made in regard to this problem.</P>

      <P>Since the last Estimate was introduced for this Department I am glad to see that there has been a welcome change.  We have a new Minister.  I hope he will prove to be a good Minister because, as far as I could see, our last Minister for Agriculture was the world's worst.  I am sorry to have to say that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I always did.  The first aim of those in authority in this country should be to increase production. <Col N="1946" /> I do not think that we are going to solve the difficulties of the present situation by higher prices and increased wages.  We must have increased production and the only way to bring about that increased production is to put the farmers of the country in a position in which they will be able to produce at a profit to themselves. I am living in the midst of a community which I can definitely state are not carrying on agriculture as they should like to carry it on.  They are carrying on from hand to mouth.  I am speaking for the small and middle-class farmers in my county and in the Midlands generally.  They are not doing 10 per cent. of the work they could do if they were provided with proper facilities.  The immediate necessity is to provide them with money to enable them to buy machinery in particular. So far as I know, the ordinary small farmer has no machinery worth speaking of.  He has some old ramshackle machinery that is of no use.  We want to put these farmers in a position, by providing them with long-term loans, to get up-to-date machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that there would be an immediate increase in production if we equipped our farmers properly.  The first essential towards providing them with proper equipment is to secure credit facilities for them.  At the present moment, they are unable to till their land until such time as they can borrow the necessary equipment from some of their better-off neighbours. They have to wait until somebody else has all his tillage completed before they can get that equipment, with the result that their tillage is always late.  That is not agriculture. That is the position all over the Midlands as the Minister knows.  The first problem the Minister will have to tackle is to see about a credit system for our farmers for the purchase of agricultural machinery and the abolition of the tariff on foreign machinery and fertilisers.  I am glad to see that Deputy O'Reilly is a new convert to our way of thinking.  For the past few years he has been bawling about self-sufficiency, native machinery, and so on.  However, he has changed his opinion now and he has come over to our side of the House as far as the <Col N="1947" /> question of free importation is concerned. I hope he is a sincere convert. I am afraid it is purely a political cry and that the change of face is the result of the growling and talking he has heard from farmers on this matter.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see we in this country should give great attention to the agriculturist who carries on what is known as mixed tillage farming&mdash; the man who produces bacon, poultry, cattle, etc.  However, the man who gets the ear of the Minister, the man who is able to have Deputies going here, there and elsewhere on his behalf is the man who goes in for one line&mdash;racehorses or cattle, and so on. The man I want to see the Minister looking after is the mixed tillage farmer&mdash;the man with perhaps 50 or five acres of land who produces pigs, poultry, bacon, eggs, etc., year in and year out, whether it pays or not.  That man is the foundation and the bedrock of the nation.  The other man is living in a highfalutin kind of way.  He has plenty of money to spend on himself and to gallivant with.  The other man cannot do that and he is the man we should fend for.  He is the man who will give us increased production, enough for ourselves, and enough to export.</P>
    <P>There is one line of agriculture which has come into prominence in my own county in the last eight or ten years. I hope it will be a permanent feature. I cannot say much about it at the moment because I do not know where my county stands as regards milk production. A big number of farmers are spending a vast amount of money in putting up sheds and buying cows to produce milk for Dublin.  However, if the rules and regulations are tightened up, I wonder how these people will be able to stand up to the competition, to the checking for cleanliness, etc.  If they will not be able to stand up to that competition they will be nearly broke.  I want to ask the Minister if there is a future for those people.  I hope there is because, if there is not, they will be absolutely destroyed.  I would ask the Minister to see where these people stand.  I know definitely that if he goes back to the rules, to <Col N="1948" /> close inspections, where men have to wear white aprons and have their fingers manicured, where the cows and stables have to be washed two or three times a day, many people will go out of business immediately because I do not think they will be able to stand up to it.  I would ask the Minister if he can say if these people are in a happy or secure position.</P>
    <P>This country will have to be zoned as far as agriculture is concerned.  We have a dairying area which is, roughly, the south of Ireland.  We have a tillage area&mdash;Louth, Carlow, Monaghan, etc., and we have a live-stock area&mdash; Meath, Kildare and Westmeath. The Minister should cater separately for these areas.  I think he should quite definitely have a policy for these areas and that special attention should be given to each particular area.  I do not think we can have an agricultural policy without that system, and work should be carried out to the highest pitch in each particular area.  So far as County Meath is concerned, I must say that the vast majority of the tillage drive is carried on at a loss&mdash; not so much to the farmer as to the nation.  I would say to the Minister that he is tearing up the finest land which would give more production from the point of view of live stock and dairy products and that he is really going against nature.  If that land is suitable for live stock, as it is, why cannot it be kept for live stock?</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave spoke in connection with stall feeding.  Our agricultural production in this country has deteriorated rapidly since stall feeding died out.  It would be a national asset if this industry could be revived.  We should try to reach agreement with the British whereby stall feeding could be revived in this country.  I know that if it is not, a large number of men, owing to the high wage increases, cannot be kept in their employment. The farmers cannot be blamed because they will not be able to carry on.  For that reason I would ask the Minister to bring back the stall feeding industry. It was a great industry.  It gave employment to farmers' sons and to all the men of the district.  It kept them working night and day and it was a paying proposition.  I would ask the <Col N="1949" /> Minister to revive that industry if only for the amount of manure produced. It was worth while, if for nothing else than for the manure it produced for the tillage drive in the year afterwards. It was a great industry.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to refer is the covering-in of farmyards for the in-feeding of cattle in the winter&mdash;stall cattle and store cattle. Some of the farmers say, at the moment, that they are feeding the cattle on their own beef.  We should have learned a lesson from last year, i.e., the famishing and starvation of our cattle in the high lands and fields. Such would not have been the case if we had been in a position to house the live stock.  If we had covered-in farmyards we would have the live stock to-day which was lost last winter.  I would ask the Minister to consider seriously the introduction of some such scheme so that we could bring in 30 or 40 of the farmyard stock and house them for three months in the winter.</P>
    <P>At the present time in the County Meath we have a vast area of heavy land in which store cattle are up to their knees in mud in the winter time. The land is deteriorating rapidly.  The cattle are there tramping on that grazing land with the result that in April or May the land is not at all fertile and it is nearly June before there is proper grass.  On the other hand, if the cattle were kept in during the winter and let out to graze in the first week in April the position would be satisfactory.  In Meath there is a rich verdure of grass and I would say to the Minister that if we could in-feed more cattle, it would mean that we would have more root crops and a mixed tillage policy.  If we do not have a mixed tillage policy we will not have proper farming.  We are making very little headway because we do not know where we stand.  We have had no fixed policy up to now and the farmer does not know from year to year where he stands.  I would ask the Minister, as a courageous man, to take his courage in hands and go across and beard the lion in his den.</P>
    <P>I would say to him that he should not send civil servants but that he should go across himself to the Minister for Agriculture on the other side, <Col N="1950" /> shake hands with him, and tell him in a friendly way that he is as good as he is.  He should tell him that we have problems over here to be solved and that as they too have problems perhaps some agreement could be reached.  He should ask for a ten-year agreement on agriculture.  He should tell him that we can produce in this country what will suit him and that he can give us the price.  He will have the goodwill of everybody and I am sure that he will bring back something that will have a lasting and permanent effect and not something done by a couple of civil servants who go over knocking at the back door.  The Minister should go over himself and knock at the front door and he should walk right in as an equal.  I am satisfied that he will meet with more respect if he does so.  Until he does that, we shall get nowhere.</P>
    <P>We want a ten-year programme for our live stock, our eggs, our poultry and our bacon.  Our farmers would then be in a position to know what goods and in what quantities they ought to produce.  They would know to what end they were working and they would know what they were going to receive at the end of that period. That is a practical and common-sense suggestion.  There will be no inferiority complex behind that approach or no feeling of going with one's hat in one's hand to beg for something to which one is by right and justice entitled.  The Minister should go over with a business proposition.  If some agreement is brought about in this way, then I think it would go a long way towards solving not only our agricultural problem but also our Border problem, because it would then be obvious that the political tomfoolery had ceased.  There is no use in the Minister sitting at home snug and dry, talking about agriculture but doing nothing.  What the farmers want is a man of action.  They have never had that up to the present.  Perhaps the present Minister will bring about the much-desired change.  If the Minister wants the goodwill of the people then he must do his job and do it efficiently. He must get markets for the farmers. He must stop interfering with the farmers in their own private business. <Col N="1951" /> He must take away his inspectors and let the farmers fend for themselves as they did so successfully in the past when there was no interference.  It is interference by officials which is to-day to some extent responsible for the present plight of agriculture.  I ask the Minister to withdraw his bloodhounds and to leave the farmers to themselves.</P>
    <P>In County Meath we have a large fruit-growing area and the people there find themselves in much the same position as the farmers do all over the country.  They do not know where they stand from year to year as regards price.  In one year they have a very good crop and they get a bad price for it.  The next year they have a bad crop and they get a good price for it.  The Minister should make some effort to stabilise prices and give these people a chance of making a livelihood out of fruit growing.  The farmers in East Meath are going in in a big way for fruit growing.  Some of them have specialised in it and I am satisfied that their produce compares very favourably with the best imported produce from other countries.  If large quantities of fruit are allowed in, these farmers in Meath will be ruined and the little industry which they have built up will die out.  It will be a shame if it is permitted to do so.  At the present moment it is giving good employment and there should be a good return from it.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that a change of policy will come with the change of Ministry. I think the change was brought about chiefly because it was realised that the policy of the past had been a bad one and was in fact no policy at all.  The Minister is bound to have a new policy. I hope it is going to be a vigorous one and I hope the farmers will know where they stand for the next ten years.  The Minister comes from a part of the country which bears a long and proud tradition of hard work and a fair return for work done.  The North Meath farmer is a fine type of man. Some of those farmers living on eight or ten acres of land have, by their thrift and their industry, been able to buy big farms in South Meath.  They have been able to give three or four daughters dowries of £300 or £400 each. <Col N="1952" /> The farmer with 100 acres of good land in other parts of the country has not been able to do that.  I think the Minister from his own personal knowledge of County Meath should be able to define a vigorous policy for the future to suit the middle-class and the small farmer.  He need not worry about the big farmer who really only farms as a sideline.  When it comes to producing eggs and poultry and pigs the big farmer is out of the picture altogether.  The policy of this country should be for the middle man and the small man and they are the men who are the backbone of the country.</P>
    <P>You want in this country the mixed type of farmer&mdash;the man who does not keep all his eggs in the one basket.  It is said that the pig no longer exists in this country.  How could the pig exist to-day when there is no food for him? I myself could have ten pigs to-morrow if I had the feeding stuffs for them.  I think the Minister should allow in suitable foodstuffs into the country even though he may be criticised for doing so, because we grow our own oats and barley.  But I am satisfied that the imported foods are better than anything we produce ourselves.  If the Minister will make some effort in that direction he will bring back pigs and poultry to this country and he will put agriculture on a proper basis.  If the Minister does his job we shall all stand solidly behind him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on agriculture is one of the most important, if not the most important, which comes before this House each year.  Every Deputy in this House maintains that agriculture is our basic national industry and that it should receive more attention than any other industry. Unless we have a good agricultural output we can have no export.  At the present moment there would seem to be something very fundamentally wrong with our agriculture and I doubt if even the present Minister will be able to bring our agricultural policy under proper control for quite a number of years to come.  Certainly it could be in no worse position at the moment&mdash;if that is any consolation to anybody.  Perhaps that is due in large <Col N="1953" /> measure to the Minister's predecessor's policy and to his lack of agricultural training.  I do not know.  But I understand that the present Minister is himself a farmer.  I would advise the Minister to cut himself away from his officials and from their advice and control. Being a farmer himself he ought to be able to bring about some improvement in the agricultural position. I know that it takes a good deal to bring back something that is gone but the effort must be made.</P>
      <P>I am afraid it will take more than an effort from the Minister and his Department to put more butter, more bacon and more eggs on the market at the present time.  It is a simple matter for Deputies to stand up in this House from these leather-backed chairs and lay down broad lines of policy for the future in order to bring agriculture back, but everybody realises that it is on the farmsteads down the country that farming is really done.  It is the farmer or the farmer's wife who carries the food out to the pigs and calves.  It is the farmer who milks the cows in the morning or goes out with the plough and horse to till the fields and to grow beet, oats and barley for man and animal.  They are the people who control agriculture and they are the people who will bring agriculture back to the level at which it ought to be and who will put it on a foundation where it will become a permanent structure of the country.  In order to encourage those people to do that, they must be given a guaranteed market for their produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the years since we have got a native Government there has been a very up and down tendency in regard to agriculture.  A farmer did not know when or where or how he will get the best price for his produce.  A man might bring cattle to a fair one day and might find that there was a slump in the cattle market and that if he held them up for a month or two he might get £3 or £4 a head more for them. The same thing applied to eggs.  A few score of eggs brought to a merchant on one day might sell for threepence or fourpence a score more in a week or a fortnight.  There must be a fairly long-term policy for agriculture if <Col N="1954" /> agriculture is to be made attractive.  If it is not made attractive, this country will not produce anything for export.</P>
    <P>There are so many branches in the Department of Agriculture that the Minister has a very hard and tedious job.  On one day he has to listen to complaints from the dairying industry. On another day he has to give his attention to the bacon industry.  On another day he is questioned as to the poultry industry.  On another day he has to listen to complaints in regard to tillage, etc.  Then he is hauled over the coals on another day in regard to the price of beet.  Candidly I think that if he makes a success of his job he deserves a lot of credit.  I voted against the appointment of the present Minister, not because I had anything against him personally, but because I am of the opinion that under the system on which the Department is run at present, no Minister, no matter how great his ability, could make a success of it.  There was no understanding between the former Minister and the people who are the producers.  I congratulate the present Minister on the fact that, when introducing his Estimate, he informed us that he intended to establish a consultative council so as to keep in close touch with agriculturists.  If he picks the right type of individual for that committee, I have not the slightest doubt that he will get very valuable information, information which will make the running of his Department much easier for himself and for his officials.  I would suggest that he should pay more attention to the men who will constitute this consultative committee than to some of the higher officials who are under his control.  If he does that and listens to genuine complaints, I think he will go a long way towards making a success of his Department.</P>
    <P>It will be a difficult task to put agriculture into a proper position.  We have complaints from the dairying industry that milk and butter are not a paying proposition.  If we increase the prices, we are told that a subsidy will have to be given or the price of butter and milk to the community will be beyond the capacity of the people to pay.  To satisfy all sides in regard to butter and milk is a very difficult <Col N="1955" /> job.  There is no doubt that the foundation of the dairying industry lies in the southern part of the country. There is very little dairying in Connaught. In my county there is practically none.  It was tried about 12 years ago but it was found that the people preferred the rearing of store cattle, pigs and poultry.  Therefore, the dairying industry was not a paying proposition and eventually the creameries had to be closed down.  As the previous speaker said, I think the country will have to be divided into zones.  If that could be brought about and if we could get the fullest production from the dairying zone, from that part of the country which goes in for store cattle and heavy cattle, and that part where tillage is a success, we would have the best system of agriculture. But in bringing such a scheme as that into operation we would be faced with a big lot of problems.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot about the dual-purpose cow and the dual-purpose bull. Anybody who understands live stock knows perfectly well that dairy Shorthorn cattle are not fit to produce beef as quickly or as economically as the Aberdeen Angus or Hereford types. A farmer in the West when going through a fair can see with a glance of his eye the bullock that will put on condition or make a good stall-fed beast or thrive well on grass.  All types of cattle will thrive if they are fed.  Deputy O'Reilly said that feeding means everything, and I agree with him.  A Hereford or Aberdeen Angus cow if well fed can be made produce milk, but a dairy Shorthorn cow with an equal amount of feeding will produce infinitely more.  If we could arrange that no dairy Shorthorn cattle would go into the live-stock producing areas and no Aberdeen Angus or Hereford cattle into the dairying areas, we we would be doing a very good job. Candidly I think, however, that is an impossibility.  There would be different crosses no matter how the Department tries to bring about such a system and it would be very difficult to operate successfully.</P>
    <P>A few months ago I heard complaints in the House about the slaughter of <Col N="1956" /> calves in the southern area.  The Minister in reply said that when farmers thought it more economical to slaughter calves he could not interfere. He was perfectly right in that. In the western area we rear a good lot of store cattle, as well as pigs and poultry.  If those calves were brought into the western area they could be bought cheaper than the Hereford or Aberdeen Angus calves.  That would upset the whole scheme which I am trying to envisage.  Therefore, as I say, it is a very difficult problem.  If the Minister could bring the standard of agriculture in this country up to that of Denmark or Holland or other countries like that he would be deserving of great credit.</P>
    <P>There is an outcry against grass-fed cattle on large ranches.  There is no Deputy more opposed to ranches than I am.  At the same time, there is a lot to be said for an area which is not suited for tillage going in for live stock.  Deputy Giles said that even in the fertile plains of Meath and Westmeath there are portions which will not produce good crops.  I have seen instances of that in areas in Roscommon where the best of farmers have failed completely to produce a decent crop of oats.  They ploughed well and put in good seeds, nevertheless the grass grew up through the oats and, in the poorest parts of Mayo, we could show a better return, acre for acre, than that on better land.  I understand the same applies to Westmeath.  While there should be no ranches, if grass-fed cattle are to be kept in certain parts, then they should be on farms from 30 to 50 acres and not on farms of 200 to 500 acres.</P>
    <P>Bacon is what might be termed a lost commodity here.  The man who can now go to a shop where he is registered and buy five or six pounds of bacon is lucky.  That is solely due to the bungling brought about by the Pigs and Bacon Commission, by the former Minister for Agriculture, and by boards and factories that have succeeded in doing no good to anybody.  We have been told that hordes of officials were let loose so that the pigs would be up to a certain standard.  The White Paper laid down the type of sty that a pig should be fed in.  There is too <Col N="1957" /> much interference with the bacon and the pig industry by the Department. No matter what happens pigs will have to be fed in a sty, will have to be carefully reared until they are eight or nine weeks old, then sold, fed again for three or four months, and brought to the fair and sold to bacon factories.</P>
    <P>All the talk in this House will not improve pig production.  The only thing the Minister can do to help is to get in as much maize as he possibly can.  Bring in maize solely for pig production and bring it in duty free.  We have harbours at Westport and Ballina into which maize could be brought direct.  In that way a second handling, as well as a journey across the country by train, would be avoided.  There are complaints in the West, where pigs and bacon are regarded as the mainstay of little farms, about the price of maize that is coming in.  Merchants point out that if maize were imported through Westport and Ballina it could be sold much more cheaply.  The Minister can help by allowing ships to bring maize into western ports so that those in pig-producing areas can get it. I know that it is almost impossible to get all the maize that is needed, but with the amount of barley and oats grown here that would help to bring pig production back.  The same applies to poultry.  There is no necessity for imported feeding stuffs or maize for poultry, as the fact is that if we could treble the supply of eggs and the number of hens that would create a good market for oats.  No matter how much oats is grown it could be easily absorbed.  Anybody who is interested realises that oats is a most important food for poultry.  Barley, wheat and maize if given to hens will never bring about such a high return in egg production as when they are fed on oats. The poultry instructresses all over the country are doing good work as they really understand their job and have been very successful.</P>
    <P>As in the case of cattle, there is a type of poultry useful as layers and another type for table use, but the production of both types should be encouraged. If the Department and the Minister could help householders, egg production could be quadrupled.  When life on the land in present circumstances <Col N="1958" /> is by no means attractive, and while statistics show that it is from the land the flight of people is taking place, it should be remembered that up to 20 years ago a farmer's son, if he had money, looked around to see if he could buy a farm, while now the idea is to look out for labour in urban areas because life there is cleaner and easier.</P>
    <P>In order to offset drudgery on the land, agriculture must be made more attractive.  That can be done by providing better out-offices and machinery. We have a few factories here producing agricultural machinery.  Undoubtedly, certain types of machinery turned out by Wexford factories are as good as any, but there are other types which are not as well produced.  I refer to machinery for haymaking&mdash; swathe turners, scythe delivery rakes &mdash;and harvest binders.  I do not think binders are produced here at all. Machinery that is not produced here should be allowed in duty free.  I would not be averse to a slight tariff on machinery that we can produce here, and produce well, but I am opposed to a tariff on any machinery that cannot be made at home, but that is essential for increased production and output per acre as well as for relieving hard work the small farmers have to do.  We have been told that a certain tractor company, if they got any encouragement, would supply a reasonably cheap tractor that could be manoeuvred in a small field, and thereby give a return that would be useful.</P>
    <P>In the West two small farmers generally combine to do the spring ploughing as neither of them can afford to keep two horses.  If a middle sized farmer, with from 20 to 40 acres, could be supplied with a reasonably cheap tractor and if necessary the money were provided by a Government subsidy, farm work could be cut down immensely and a heart-breaking and back-breaking job eased.  Farmers could then turn their attention to other things instead of spending two or three weeks ploughing.  If that type of farmer were encouraged he could double the amount of ground he would sow and as well escape some hard work. If the machinery I have talked about could be allowed in duty free, and if there was an effort made to provide <Col N="1959" /> as much of it as possible, it would be a great step forward on the part of the Department.  It is their job to see that the producers in this country are provided with all their requirements.</P>
    <P>Let me take potatoes as an example. Until two years ago potato diggers were practically unknown along the western seaboard and then, even though the price was high, a few enterprising persons purchased some. There is now a clamour from every farmer, even the 10-acre farmer, for a potato digger so that he can sow an acre of potatoes where formerly he sowed only a rood, and he can get them dug in three or four days instead of the usual month or six weeks.  These are the little things that really are the great things.  They are the things in regard to which agricultural producers look to the Department for assistance.</P>
    <P>As regards out-offices, there is a clamour for better types of farm buildings. The people do not so much want loans.  It is bad for the Government to give individuals free grants to build houses.  I would not ask them to give free grants for the building of out-offices so much as I would urge them to give loans at a low rate of interest, with a long period of years in which to repay.  If there are too many free things given out, the country as a whole will eventually have to pay.  If these loans are given to farmers they will be paid back and the whole scheme will repay both the farmers and the Department many times over.  The money would be put into circulation for the benefit of everybody.</P>
    <P>But there is no effort made by the Department to give better facilities to farmers by way of loans for the erection of out-offices.  The Agricultural Credit Act went through the House a few months ago, but there was no talk of giving farmers loans at a cheap rate of interest.  There was a figure of 4 per cent. or 4½ per cent. quoted, but that could be obtained by anybody who would go to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  Until such time as the Department take it on themselves to provide loans at a cheap rate of interest for the purchase of farm machinery and the erection of more <Col N="1960" /> modern out-offices and buildings, the Minister cannot expect anybody to feel inclined to work on the land as people did 15 or 20 years ago.  Even though taxation may go up a little, the Minister will hear no complaint from any side of the house.  It is surprising that out of the £70,000,000 asked for in the Budget, £1,000,000, £2,000,000 or even £10,000,000 could not be found to aid the most important industry we have.</P>
    <P>Farmers the country over are eager for a better supply of artificial manures.  I realise that we cannot expect the Minister to provide artificial manures with a wave of his hand, but it must be remembered that the fertility of the land has gone down considerably, most of all in the larger farms where there is no farmyard manure and no rotation of crops.  Anyone who understands the cultivation of land will realise that if there is a proper rotation of crops, a root or grain crop every year or every second year, you will keep heart in the soil much longer and you will be able to till the same ground year after year.  I have known years when as many as 12 crops have been taken off, one after the other.  The land in question was seeded down, broken after eight years and tilled for ten years more.  It was in a fertile condition because of the amount of farmyard manure distributed over it and because there was a proper rotation of crops.</P>
    <P>Even on the small farms, where the farmers distribute farmyard manure for the production of potatoes and turnips and expect to have a small bit left over, as in years gone by, for meadow land, they find it is not now possible to do it because, owing to the scarcity of artificial manures, the potatoes and turnips have to get double or treble the amount of farmyard manure that they got heretofore and that leaves none for the grassland or the meadow.  If we could have adequate quantities of artificial manures at a reasonable price, farmers all over the country, both small as well as big, would welcome it.</P>
    <P>The big farmer who ploughs 15 or 20 acres for wheat and who grows that crop two or three years in succession, may try to get a crop or two of oats after that.  He does not do it for the <Col N="1961" /> love of breaking his land or tilling, but simply and solely because he is afraid of the Department and of being brought to court.  That type of man is crying out that he should get more artificial manure.</P>
    <P>Very rarely have the 40-acre or under farmers been found defaulting in the tillage campaign.  I listened early this year to a Fianna Fáil Deputy telling us that the only people in his constituency who were reluctant to till were the ranchers, but they were compelled to do it through fear of the Department. The same applies to the constituency from which I come.  There are a few ranchers there and they would not till a perch only they have to do so.  If their land was divided into small farms there would be more farmyard manure, more attention to the fertility of the land, and better crops.</P>
    <P>This tillage campaign will have to be carried on for many years, because the prospect of getting food from abroad does not look very bright.  We shall have to rely on our own efforts to produce sufficient to meet our requirements. If artificial manures can be secured, the big and the small farmers will be glad.  The Minister said that it is difficult to find artificials and that he is getting in all he can; in fact, he would be glad to get in ten times the quantity.  I hope he will be able to tell us that the prospects are bright, if not for this year, at least for the years ahead.</P>
    <P>There is a type of penal law in this country which, with a number of other laws and Acts of Parliament hanging around this national Assembly for a number of years, should have been handed over during the turf scarcity to the Dublin householders to enable them to boil their kettles.  I refer particularly to the law which claps an increased valuation, and consequently an increased rate, on the progressive farmer who builds a better type of out-office or farm building.  That is entirely and definitely wrong.</P>

      <P>I am only suggesting that he might converse with his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, who turned such a deaf car to a motion moved in regard to that matter from this side of the house some months ago.  If he could induce him to abolish or to bring about some alteration in that system he would have the blessing of many small and middle-sized farmers in the country.  In addition to the encouragement which he has given by means of farm improvements schemes, and different schemes to assist the erection of manure pits, water tanks and the laying down of concrete paths in the vicinity of stables, if he could take some action to abolish the system under which a valuation is increased in the case of any man who carries out any of these improvements, that would be a step that would be very welcome.  The Minister has a hard job before him.  If he is to succeed in clearing up the muddle in his Department he will require not alone the genius of that famous Frenchman, Louis Pasteur, who did so much to ensure that a pure milk supply would be available for succeeding generations; he will require the brains and the genius of the famous Gracchi brothers who long ago turned out a large section of the population of Rome to work on the surrounding farms.  I understand that he has been a small farmer himself and that he has a thorough understanding of agriculture. If he uses that thorough understanding which should have been beaten into him as a boy because of the fact that he had to work upon the land, and if he pays more heed to genuine practical farmers than to the inspectors and officials of his Department, he will get somewhere.  If he does not, I can assure him that he will follow on the path of his predecessor and the only hope then left to this House will be to see that he and his colleagues will be driven out of office as quickly as possible and their Departments handed over to others who know something about them.</P>

      <P>The main complaint of Deputy Hughes, in moving that this Estimate be referred back for reconsideration, was that the Minister had <Col N="1963" /> not made preparations or had not taken the House into his confidence, to build up an export trade in agriculture so that we would be able to import commodities which we require to import.  I think that so far as the agricultural community are concerned, they have been long enough &ldquo;hewers of wood and drawers of water&rdquo; to bring in luxuries for other classes of the community.  If we are to judge by the statements made by Deputy Hughes and Deputy Roddy, their sole anxiety is to get back again to the British market and to get agriculturists to export to that market. Deputy Roddy dealt with the preparations made in Denmark to export butter again to Britain, but I do not think the Danish farmers are so enamoured of the prices they are offered in Britain.  I do not believe that any farmer here would keep a milch cow for one day in order to send butter to the British market at the price Britain is paying to-day or which Britain paid for the last 20 years.  Where is the use of talking about exporting butter if we had it to export in the morning?  There is no man here who would venture to suggest to the farmers that they should keep milch cows and sell their milk to the creameries at 6d. a gallon.  That is the price Britain will pay for butter.  Where is the use of talking about producing butter for that market?  It is only waste of time.</P>
      <P>Our actual position at the present day is that we have a grand market for everything we can produce here at home and we need not bother about export markets, except for live stock, of which we have some surplus.  So far as fat cattle are concerned, you will get more from an Irish butcher than you will get in England.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hughes should not be so anxious to prevent the Minister paying a price for milk.  He should not be so anxious to see that the skim milk is forced back into the farmers' hands.  I shall give the House a little idea of the skim milk we have in the South to-day.  The price fixed by the Minister for milk is 1/2 per gallon. Anybody travelling in the shops in Dublin to-day will see a lot of chocolates in the windows at 4/6 per lb.  That chocolate was imported from Denmark.  The price paid during the past month by some of our factories in the South who are manufacturing chocolate is 1/6¾ per gallon for milk. I happen to be a member of a milk board in Cork City and I have had on two occasions in the past month to send to those creameries for milk but I was told that I could not get it because they were sending as much to the chocolate factories as they could give them.  Is there any farmer or any man connected with farming in this House who will stand up and agitate for the rearing of calves when we get 1/6¾ per gallon for milk for making chocolate?  That is what it all boils down to.  The working farmer of the South who has to get his men and his sons up early in the mornings for milking is not going to go rearing calves for the Midland rancher or the Kildare stall-feeder when he <Col N="1965" /> can get a price for his milk that will pay him better.</P>
      <P>There is a good export market for powdered milk and it would pay us better to sell powdered milk than to go rearing calves to sell to the boys who have all the profit sitting in the ditch watching the bullocks grow.  I regret that we have not had the satisfaction of dealing here with the Tribunal on Prices Bill which was promised by the Minister's predecessor.  I am more than anxious to know how soon that Bill is going to be presented to this House and how soon that tribunal is going to be set up.  That tribunal will cover the whole question of farming.  I had occasion here last week to deal with producers of other essential products&mdash; to deal with the distributor and buyer. etc.  In my opinion they should be placed on the same level and under the same conditions as the agricultural community.  We are bound, whether we like it or not, to put a certain percentage of our land under wheat.  If we do not do so we are liable to be prosecuted and penalised.  We are the only industry in this country which is liable to be prosecuted and fined for not making use of the materials which we have, i.e., the land.  We are also the only industry in this country that has no tribunal to go to to have our prices fixed in relation to cost of production plus profit.  The only thing we are compelled to produce is wheat. I say that to ask any manufacturer to produce wheat or a crop at less than the cost of production is unfair.  The law that would compel him, under pain of prosecution, to do so without making sure that he is going to get the cost of production is still worse.  I have gone very carefully into the cost of production of wheat on lea land. Unless the crop which I have growing at present yields me something over one ton to the acre it is not going to pay the cost of production.  I can prove what I am saying, and anyone can examine the case.  I say here definitely that to compel a man, an industrialist, to produce a crop that is not going to pay the cost of production is wronging that farmer.</P>

Only last year I met the Sugar Company on the subject of costings and they thought they knew everything until they tried to get the farmers to grow beet.  Other people were sceptical too.  Deputy Hughes referred here to-day to a statement I have been giving in this House ever since 1932 when the late Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Patrick Hogan, made the statement from these benches in regard to what was going to happen under the Live Stock Breeding Act and the kind of cows we were going to have.  I have quoted it here every year in this House for the past 13 years but had it any influence on the Minister's Department?  Not a bit! They went on their own happy way. Then they are surprised and amazed because we have a butter ration of only four ounces to-day! In the same way Deputy Cogan a while ago took occasion to abuse the Minister.  When he started he wanted dairy cows, then he wanted beef cows and he ended up on the subject of goats.  To tell the truth I do not know where I am with the dual purpose farmers.  We have one farmers' Party here which wants land taken from other farmers; we have another farmers' Party which wants the farmers kept on the land whether they be good or bad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I hope now that the Minister has got the demand from all three Farmers' Parties that he will speed it up.  Judging by what I heard from Deputy Cogan to-day I would advise him to keep to the goats. He finished up his speech here talking about goats.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes, Deputy Roddy and Deputy Cogan are very fond of going abroad and looking for information&mdash; information that they could get from their own farmers here at home if they wanted it.  Deputy Cogan told us about some experiments carried out in Australia.  Deputy Hughes adumbrated at some length what was being done in England and Deputy Roddy told us about Denmark.  Deputy Cogan, having gone to Australia, told us about inoculation against abortion in Australia. All my cattle in Cork have been inoculated against abortion for the past seven or eight years and that inoculation has been most successful. Every farmer who has had it done has got 100 per cent. results.  I would suggest to Deputy Cogan and to those other Deputies who are so fond of going abroad for information that they should get into communication with Mr. Seán Hyde, the veterinary surgeon down in Cork, and he will inoculate all their cattle for them.  He does his job well and successfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly anxious to find out from the Minister, now that the Department has become wise to some extent, whether he is going to keep breeding beef bulls and dual purpose bulls, and cross-breeding them again until you have the mongrel with which we find ourselves to-day and which we proudly designate the &ldquo;dairy cow&rdquo;.  Is the Minister now going to settle down in this country to a decent milking strain of cattle?  The Minister has become wise to the fact that the policy in the past does not pay.  Our county committee of agriculture has time and time again appealed to the Minister to give premiums for Friesian bulls.  I know that it approximates to a sacrilege to even utter the word &ldquo;Friesian&rdquo; in the <Col N="1968" /> Department of Agriculture.  It is an outrage. But, after all, our people must have milk.  If we are ever going to get away from butter rationing we must have decent milch cows in this country. If the Department refuses to give premiums to purely milking strains of cattle how can it justify itself for butter rationing and for the shortage of milk by giving premiums to Hereford bulls and Polled Angus bulls?  Where is the justification in taking the taxpayers' money and distributing it in premiums for beef bulls in a country where butter is rationed?  I can see no justification for it.</P>
    <P>We will be told by the Department that we have the dairy shorthorn.  We have the dairy shorthorn.  But what kind of dairy shorthorn is it?  We have the dairy shorthorn that must be crossed every two generations with a beef bull brought over from Scotland. If that were not done the owner of the herd would get no premium from the Department.  Nobody knows that better than the Department's officials themselves.  I know a prominent breeder down in Cork who breeds dairy shorthorns.  He was chairman of the county committee of agriculture for many years.  One year he took nine or ten bulls into the Cork Show in order to get premiums for them.  To his amazement he only got one.  He came home again.  I suppose he met some of the Department officials and he thrashed out the matter with them. The following year he came up to Dublin for the Royal Dublin Society sale.  There he bought a bull imported. from Scotland.  He brought him down to Cork and crossed him with his dairy herd.  A couple of years afterwards I saw him coming out from the show with a whole big line of red flags stuck in the bulls' horns.  The Department then says they are dairy shorthorns. Whether they are single dairy, double dairy or treble dairy I do not know, but I do know that they are damn little use for milk.</P>
    <P>In the South we are definitely breeding for milk and milk is practically three-quarters of our income.  We are entitled to some help and some assistance in order to keep a decent milking strain of cattle in this country. Let the gentlemen in the Midlands who <Col N="1969" /> want stores for fattening go gaily along with their Hereford cows and an old bull running with them.  Let them see what calves they get.</P>

      <P>I remember being in County Westmeath and I discovered that it was a crime there to get up before eleven.  Your first job then was to ramble down to the store for the morning's paper.  Then you went out and had a look at the bullocks.  You came back and had your dinner and, having finished your dinner, you went out and sat on the ditch and read the paper.  At four o'clock you had another look at the bullocks to see if they had got any fatter in the meantime. After that you could take the rest of the day off for a game of cards. It was the grandest life in the world. Let the man in the Midlands keep his fat stock, but do not try to make the man in Cork and Limerick put in a Hereford bull with his cows to give him &ldquo;white faces&rdquo; at scrap prices so that the man in the Midlands will have them to fatten and live easy.  I do not blame them for that.  The game suited and it paid.  But it did not pay the unfortunate man who was rearing the calves.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that the time has come when premiums must be given to the purely dairy strain of cattle.  There is no justification in this country for any shortage of milk or a butter rationing brought about by the giving of premiums to beef strains of cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard a lot about the responsibility of the Government in connection with the shortage of bacon and pigs.  We all know that the production of bacon in this country depends mainly on (1) the import of maize; (2) the growing of barley; and (3) flour offals&mdash;pollard and bran.  So far as flour offals are concerned, we know that during the past 12 months they had to be put into the bread.  As far as barley is concerned, we know that the amount grown has not been nearly sufficient to supply the quantity necessary to go into the bread and the quantity necessary for the brewers and maltsters. <Col N="1970" /> There was none left for the pigs.  I am wondering, therefore, when Deputies are raising outcries about the scarcity of bacon, where they expect to get the feeding from.  We have no flour offals for the pigs; we have no barley and no maize for them.  How are they to be fattened?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I went around most of it and I did not see any.  There is no use in expecting an increase in pig production when we have no flour offals, barley or maize.  There is no use in making complaints about the position in regard to the bacon industry until we have some one of these three to start with.  There is no good in blaming anybody for it.  The fact of the matter is that the feeding is not there for the pigs.  None of us wants to see the brewing and distilling industries going down.  We know that last year and the year before portion of the barley that was purchased for malting had to go into the bread.  I suggest to the Minister that he should put it up to the brewing and distilling industries to get their barley grown under contract. For a number of years we have been endeavouring to get a proper price for barley from these people.  We have been held up by the Department saying: &ldquo;If you put up the price of barley too high, the farmers will not grow wheat.  If you put up the price of barley too high, there will be none left for feeding.&rdquo;  During the past two years it has been the other way round. The maltsters could not get sufficient barley because they had to buy at a fixed price and the greater portion of the barley went into another market, about which we will say nothing at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should remove the fixed price for barley and <Col N="1971" /> allow the maltsters to get their quota by entering into contracts with the farmers for the growing of it.  If they want 1,000, 2,000, 10,000 or 20,000 acres, let them get that grown by contract with the farmers, just as the Sugar Company gets the beet grown, and let us have a price that will compensate us for the cheap wheat we are growing for the Minister.  Let the person who grows an acre of wheat get permission to grow three acres of barley and let us deal with maltsters ourselves.  In that way I think the position will be more satisfactory.  I remember that in the years from 1918 to 1922 the price of barley was around about 52/- per barrel and the brewers were able to pay that price for it.  In the days of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government I remember the price of barley being as low as 13/- a barrel.  Farmers were told then that if they did not like the price they could take the barley home and unless the barley was particularly good it would not be taken. We have seen all those rises and falls. The time has come now when farmers are not going to be fooled.</P>
    <P>In a country like this, where agriculture is the chief industry and where the people from 1939 up to the present day have been practically completely dependent on the agricultural community to save them from starvation, I think it is wrong that the agricultural industry should still be the worst paid industry in the country.  With the prices which are being paid for agricultural produce, the farmer cannot afford to pay any higher wage to the agricultural labourer than he is paying at present.  As a matter of fact, since 1943 while agricultural wages have been increased, no increase has been given to the farmer for his produce.  To-day, the price of wheat, which is a compulsory crop, is the same as it was in 1943, although the agricultural labourers' wages have been increased four times.  When the Prices Tribunal is in operation, the country will realise how the agricultural community has been robbed during the past six or seven years.</P>
    <P>We were short of milk on two or three occasions during the past month in Cork, and then we found that <Col N="1972" /> farmers ten or 15 miles from the city could get more for their milk at the creameries.  The chocolate factories were also paying a decent price for milk.  How Deputy Roddy thinks that people here will endeavour to enter into competition with Denmark for butter I do not know.  I congratulate the Minister on the steps he has already taken in the Department.  He has shown definitely that he, at least, understands the farmers' problems and is endeavouring to solve them.  I should like to know if he intends to put through the tribunal that was suggested before the Summer Recess. Farmers are anxious to have it under way, and are anxious that those who produce wheat would appear before it before the harvest, so that they could get a price fixed before they are again swamped.</P>

      <P>I do not think that anybody has doubts about agriculture being our basic industry, one upon which most of our people rely for a living.  It has been the one industry that brought this country into prominence in the past, as far as exports are concerned.  I realise that the Minister has now a very difficult task before him, that of putting agriculture into the position in which we would all like it to be, and in which it was in the past.  Hitherto we had for ourselves ordinary country produce and were able to export a large amount.  Such exports brought much money to farmers.  Now we find ourselves rationed, and we have to ask how that has happened, and on whom and where the blame lies.  I do not mean to be in any way personal towards the officials of the Department or the Minister. Nevertheless, there is a fault somewhere.  Without wanting to find fault unduly there is definitely something wrong, and I feel that it is the Minister's task&mdash;one that I am certain he does not want to avoid&mdash;to try to set the position right in 1947.  I realise the Minister's difficulty, but I want to find out where exactly the blame is to be placed, on whom it is to be placed and how we can get over the shortage, for instance, that prevails in butter.</P>

    <P>Going through the country I heard farmers on many occasions stating that <Col N="1973" /> they were getting out of dairying completely because it would not pay-not because they wanted big profits, but to save themselves and their families. They stated that the present price paid for milk was an impossible one.  They stated also that the only way that the dairying industry could be built up to what is was in the past was by giving a subsidy for milk production.  A subsidy should not frighten the Government, because they have poured out subsidies on less deserving sections of the community than dairy farmers.  I ask the Minister to consider carefully advice given by experts.  As the position may be much more serious next winter, now is the time to take steps to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Personally, I have not very much faith in the new experts when one considers what a dreadful bungle was made of the pig trade.  We were told some years ago, when the Pigs and Bacon Board was set up, that it was going to revive the industry, and that not only would we have better bacon and more pigs, as well as an export trade, but that generally we would be in front of our competitors.  Without any feeling of antagonism I ask any Deputy on any side if such a revolution has taken place.  Was the change one for the better or one for the worse? Nobody but a fool will contradict what I say, that the bacon industry, which was a valuable one, is at a standstill. For those interested in it, it really presents a dilemma.</P>
    <P>I noticed recently that there was an admission of difficulty about the pig position, but if other Deputies had the honour that I have, to represent a constituency that is very gravely concerned about the present situation, they would not think the present complaint an unworthy one.  They would think as I do, that it was justified when it is remembered that there are hundreds of people, who have been for years employed in different factories in Waterford, faced every Friday with the possibility of unemployment.  As to the steps that might be taken to deal with the dairying industry, let us hope that the agricultural experts will have better advice to give than that given by the Pigs and Bacon Board.  My <Col N="1974" /> object at the present time is to ask the Minister who, I believe, is genuinely interested in the whole of the agricultural industry&mdash;and not least in the pig trade&mdash;to give this a trial, to cut out the Pigs and Bacon Board that has ruined the trade, as everybody who is absolutely genuine and truthful, must know to be a fact.</P>
    <P>What has it done?  It has tried to dictate to the curers and to the producers so far as prices are concerned. Incidentally, it has cut out a body of men who formerly were competitors, one with the other, in the ordinary fairs for the buying of these pigs.  That meant competitive prices, and everybody knows that competition is the life of trade.  I refer to the pig buyers.  It was stated, when legislation was put through this House some years back, that certain things would happen.  It was then prophesied that in years to come the Government would lament the day that it put this body in charge of such an important trade; that not only would we not have enough pigs for our own consumption&mdash;which, as you know, some years back was quite an unheard of thing, and there was bacon on every man's table, be he poor or rich&mdash;but there would be absolutely none for export.  That position has been reached to-day.  Indeed, it is a compliment for anyone, whether he is very well off or poor, to get a pound of bacon.  We have no surplus of bacon with which to carry on an export trade.</P>
    <P>We want to find out what is at the root of all this.  We have this Pigs and Bacon Board.  It is, perhaps, composed of very honourable men.  I do not know them, but I am quite sure they are in the highest category; otherwise they would not be on it. Nevertheless, my opinion, and the opinion of many people connected with the bacon trade, is that those who know the business and whose families have been in it for generations are the people best suited to manage it and there is no need to bring in people as inspectors, so to speak, to lay down rules and regulations on matters about which they seem to know nothing whatever. This Pigs and Bacon Board has curtailed prices and has cut out competition in the open market, not to <Col N="1975" /> speak of taking their livelihoods away from decent men.</P>
    <P>People have not the same inclination, as in other years, to rear pigs.  There is not the same incentive to producers, even if they had the food, because they know they will be confronted with one price, and one price alone, and they cannot count on buyers coming from all over the country as heretofore.  If the Government wants to help the producers and to encourage them, surely it would not be impossible for the Minister to persuade his colleagues to allow the meal suitable for pigs&mdash; maize meal&mdash;into this country free of duty, knowing how much depends on it, knowing what the pig industry meant to this country long ago.  We are not now catering for rich people. It was stated here on many occasions that the tendency was to cater for the rich.  At the moment I am pleading for the poor man and his wife who, in other years, used to keep pigs.  That meant money for them at the end of so many months.  It was something for the poor man's wife; it was a nice little nest-egg.  That little nest-egg has disappeared; it has been almost forgotten by those people.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the seriousness of the position.  I ask him to think of the plight of the producers and of the people employed in the factories, who are facing destitution.  It means that if they are sacked out of their jobs now they are finished because they will find it hard to get another job, unless these factories reopen.  It is a very serious thing and it need not be thought that there is too much fuss about it.  So far as I am concerned, there could not be too much fuss, and if I can do anything, I will.  I am sure that if the Minister can do anything, he will.  He realises it is not merely a matter of making a fuss but that this is one of the most serious crises that has been reached in that trade in our time.  The Minister has received deputations about it and I am certain he will no longer allow a board, which has proved itself inefficient, to dictate a policy, which has created ruin in the trade up to this date.  It is time that we should get results and we have got none.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1976" /> I say, in all sincerity, that we should cry off the board for six months and see how things will go.  The Minister should take his courage in his hands. Everyone may make a mistake at one time or another and it is never too late to mend, but it will be too late if we allow our factories to be closed and our pig industry to be killed.  We have almost forgotten that we once had an export trade.  We should try to build it up again.  Let us give our people enough and then build up an export trade, something like the trade we were so proud of long ago.  I ask the Minister to take the bit in his teeth, as they say in a racing way, and discard this board.  I would have more confidence in the Minister than in the members of the board, who do not know how the business in the bacon trade should be conducted.</P>
    <P>We have also to consider the cattle trade.  In past years we had a great surplus of cattle and we carried on a good export trade.  No matter how one may sneer at the market you sell in, give me any market provided we can supply our own wants and have sufficient for an export trade.  That is what every other country is clamouring for, and why should we be isolated? We do not want to be in isolation.  We should not slaughter calves.  It seems to be an unlucky thing, and it is a serious thing for the people in the country instead of getting a decent price for their cattle to find themselves up against existing difficulties.  They sell their calves at the fairs merely for slaughter.  I met a man a few months ago in Dungarvan and he gave me facts and figures which were undeniable.  He said it was a crying shame to have people paying such prices for meat in the cities and all over the country while at the same time we are slaughtering calves.  Almost in the same breath we are talking about building up trade for our country and we are pouring money into industry.  All the while we are killing the very pith of the whole thing.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider this matter carefully and to understand that the practical farmer is not at all keen on this way of progressing.  He does not feel he is progressing by the slaughter of calves and he feels that <Col N="1977" /> something must be done from the top to stop it rather than encourage it.  We should endeavour once more to build up a trade of which we were so proud long ago, and out of which the farmer got a good living.  No matter whether it is from John Bull or any other Bull, the farmer was pleased to take the money and they were pleased to take the article and pay a good price.</P>
    <P>Then we have to consider poultry. Nobody knows better than I do what the poultry industry means to this country.  You have only to drive through the country to realise how the poultry population has declined.  Long ago, every small holding, as well as keeping pigs, kept three or four dozen hens.  That meant money.  They had eggs and there, too, we had a fairly good export trade and that meant money in the farmer's pocket.  Surely there must be some way to recover that condition of prosperity.</P>
    <P>I am not one of those people who think that everything was prosperous in 1924 or 1927, but I think we ought to come back to our senses and try to build up that trade and concentrate, as somebody remarked, on an extra acre of oats which could be kept for the increase in poultry&mdash;and that would be well within the reach of every small farmer.  The small farmers would then have something to put them on their feet.  Everyone knows the severe time they had during the winter and the losses they sustained.  The small man was not able to stand up to that as well as his neighbour on the other side of the road who was fairly well off, and to whom such losses did not, perhaps, mean so much.  Everything possible should be done to increase production in the case of the small farmer whether by means of cattle or sheep, poultry or pigs.</P>
    <P>It would be a source of great satisfaction to farmers generally, no matter what their politics might be, if they knew that for the next five or ten years they had a stable market, such as could be secured by a trade agreement with any other country you care to mention&mdash;and I mention in this connection Great Britain.  They would feel secure if they felt that they had a definite <Col N="1978" /> market for commodities the production of which the Minister for Agriculture might think it well to foster.  It would give some definite incentive to the farmer to work, as at the end of each year there would be no necessity for him to wonder what the following year's prices would be or whether it would pay to produce a specific commodity. He should be assured that, if he engages in a certain line of production, he will have an outlet for that produce which will pay him.  I would urge on the Minister to try to arrive at some trade agreement within the next few months and in that way to have some definite goal towards which the farmers might work.  In the first place, they would have a home market for everything we could consume here and then they would have an export market for anything surplus to our requirements. There is no question of feeding anybody for nothing; we should be prepared to feed any nation which is prepared to enter into an agreement with us that they will accept our products and pay for them on a reasonable basis.  I would ask the Minister to try to arrive at some agreement on these lines so as to give our farmers a little heart because they have had a rather gruelling year as a result of the exceptional weather, for which, of course, nobody could be blamed.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister might also make some effort to induce his colleague to remove the duty on farm implements, at least for a couple of years, in order to enable the small farming community to equip themselves with implements that so far they have only heard of or read of in the papers.  At present they are dependent on the goodwill or the generosity of their more well-to-do neighbours for the loan of these implements, but naturally they cannot expect to get a loan of them until such time as the other man has finished his work. Even then, they are sometimes asked to pay so much for the use of those articles.</P>
    <P>I think it would be most helpful to the small farmers if the Minister could arrange to have the duty on these implements abolished and also if he could introduce a hiring system which would enable the small farmers to avail of these implements or alternatively introduce <Col N="1979" /> some methods by which farmers could get loans to purchase them. Unless small farmers are assisted in that way, they will, to use a popular expression, always be dragging the devil by the tail.  If the Minister could arrange to supply them with these implements by means of loans at a cheap rate of interest, he would be holding out some measure of hope to these farmers that they could make a decent living on their holdings.  At present no one realises the drudgery which these men have to endure.  They supply us with various necessary commodities but at the same time they have the feeling that they can never get the full fruit of their labours and that they are destined to be just strugglers all their lives.</P>
    <P>So far as loans for restocking farms on which losses occurred during the recent abnormal weather are concerned, I understand that loans are to be made on a valuation basis.  I do not think that is the most equitable method of allocating those loans because if a man has a farm which is valued only at £10, a loan of £50 does not mean an awful lot to him, whereas the man who has a farm with a high valuation will be able to get a worth-while loan.  Yet the man with the high valuation may be in a better position to restock his land out of his own resources than a man with a holding of mountainy land.  I have in mind particularly the district of Ballymacarberry near Clonmel where the compensation would not represent very much to the people if it were based on valuation.  It certainly would not be sufficient to compensate them for the losses of sheep and other stock which they have suffered.  I would ask the Minister to try to devise some more equitable method of allocating these loans.  In conclusion, I would suggest to the Minister that if he had fewer inspectors visiting farmsteads, more work would be done and there would be less evasion.  Very often these inspectors are more of a hindrance than anything else and farmers feel that it is just so much waste of time and waste of money in having to meet these officials who have no general knowledge of the work of a farm.  If the money spent on these inspectors were devoted to <Col N="1980" /> providing compensation for people who have lost stock or to some other means of increasing production on the land, it would be far more usefully spent.  I would ask the Minister to reduce their numbers as far as possible and also to abolish the Pigs and Bacon Board.  We shall then get the bacon industry going as well as before the board was instituted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I observe that this Estimate has been increased by £532,242.  The Minister has given variour reasons for that increase, one of which I welcome.  That is, the 50 per cent. increase in the expenditure on the Faculty of Dairy Science and Agriculture. I think most Deputies will recognise that a large section of our people will derive some benefit as a result of that increase.  I could hardly believe, if I were not present in the House myself and had not heard the statement, that a Deputy could stand up in this House, particularly a Deputy who farms something over 200 acres of land and who has something like 700 acres, and tell the House and the country that an export trade does not really matter and that, if it does matter, we should find an exportable surplus in some other industry rather than agriculture.  No doubt Deputy Corry does say some sensible things but I could not help seeing the Minister smile and hang his head when the Deputy made that statement.  I wonder if Deputy Corry realises the foolishness of his statement.  After all, I know of nothing that we can export which could be compared with agriculture. I doubt if such an industry as Guinness's or our linen industry&mdash;of course, most of our linen industry is out of our control&mdash;could, and there is no doubt that agriculture is our main industry.  As agriculture is our main industry we should be concerned, not only in developing it in so far as supplying our own needs is concerned but in developing it in order to create a surplus for export.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A short time ago the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when introducing his Estimate in this House, pointed out the seriousness of the situation.  He pointed out the gap that exists between our exports and <Col N="1981" /> imports which runs into some £30,000,000.  He went on to tell us that there are only two ways of remedying this.  Firstly, to increase production and, secondly, to reduce consumption. Naturally enough, the Minister for Industry and Commerce would realise that in so far as reducing consumption at the present moment is concerned we cannot do so because we have not enough for ourselves.  Therefore, the only alternative is to increase production.  To my mind there are a number of ways in which production can be increased.  One of the ways I have in mind is the employment of every man capable of being employed and putting him to work: also the placing of as many men as possible on the land because out of the land, Sir, comes the food and the produce which we export and the food and the produce we need to put on our own tables.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Redmond spoke about inspectors.  I suppose these inspectors to whom she was referring are the gentlemen who go about telling the farmer what acreage he should till and what part of his land he should till. There is no need for the Minister to withdraw these inspectors but there would be no need for them at all if the gentlemen whom these inspectors have to visit had not so much land on hands and if more people were placed upon it and if it was more reasonably allocated.  In such circumstances we would have better provision, better production, and an increase in the necessary products required at home and abroad&mdash;abroad, with a view to closing the gap that exists between our exports and imports.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said about the pig industry.  I was listening to Deputy Moran, who represents the same constituency as myself, and he gave many reasons for the fall in pig production. He also made a point as to how such a fall could be avoided and how an increase, to his mind, could be brought about.  I myself maintain, like Deputy Mrs. Redmond, that the Pigs Marketing Board, and other boards that have been established in the past 14 or 15 years, have helped in so small way to bring pig production down to the level at which it is to-day.  I believe, like Deputy Mrs. Redmond, <Col N="1982" /> that the removal of the control or the interference with the marketing of pigs and their production would tend for the betterment of the industry and I would encourage the Minister to take steps in that direction&mdash;at least to try, because the outcome cannot be any worse than the position obtaining at the present moment.  Deputy Moran made one very sensible suggestion. He talked to the Minister and, no doubt, as he is a director of the Castle-bar Bacon Factory he has figures which I have not, but which I know are reasonably correct.  I also know that there is a certain amount of truth in what he said.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Take an average Wiltshire side, as a matter of fact, the lighter type of Wiltshire side that would weigh, say, 61 lbs.&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>and then he goes into the prices which this is supposed to be sold at.  He points out the profit which the retailer has&mdash;a profit of £1 13s. 10½d. on a 61 lbs. side.  The Minister knows the many grades attached to that side, and the Minister knows that the retailers are supposed to sell according to the grades, but when the consumer goes into the shop he does not know what grade he is getting.  However, there is one thing that he does know&mdash;that he pays as much for the poorest cut as for the best cut and that the retailer is enjoying a handsome profit at the expense of the producer.  I maintain, Sir, although Deputy Moran did not go that far, that the profit allowed to the retailer is too much: that a part of that profit should be taken away and passed on to the wholesaler and, in turn, to the producers.  I believe that if that were done it would help to encourage pig production in so far as it would increase the price of pigs.  I think it is unfair that the man or the woman who stands behind a counter and cuts up 61 lbs. of bacon can have a profit of £1 13s. 10½d.  It is unfair that that person should have such a profit in excess of the man or the woman who rears the pig at home and feeds it for four months of the year, takes it to the market, disposes of it at a lesser profit than that of the gentleman who has very little work to do except to stand <Col N="1983" /> behind the counter.  I think the Minister should consider that and, if there is anything in what I have suggested, that he should adopt it.</P>
    <P>In relation to the breeding of cattle, I understand that there is a regulation which lays it down that licences are only granted for one Aberdeen Angus bull or one Hereford bull for every dairy bull in my county.  The Minister will recognise&mdash;certainly his officials must be well aware of it&mdash;that the Aberdeen Angus or the Hereford bull is a more profitable proposition for us than the dairy bull.  I am speaking merely now for my own county and for my own constituency but I feel at the same time that I must be speaking, too, in some degree for the larger part of County Mayo.  For the small farmer there the Aberdeen Angus or the Hereford bull is a more profitable proposition than the purely dairy bull.  I think the Minister should give this matter some sympathetic consideration and he should instruct the different committees of agriculture to grant licences in accordance with the nature of the farming carried on in the district and the particular type of cattle breeding which the farmers in the district desire.</P>
    <P>In connection with the slaughtering of calves, I think that is something which arises mainly in those areas where you have an intensive dairying industry such as perhaps Limerick, Tipperary, Cork and elsewhere.  The slaughter of calves in Mayo would be a negligible percentage.  We in Mayo rear our calves at a time when it costs us more to do so than it would perhaps later on.  We rear them from sucks&mdash;that is, from the day they are born until they are six, 12 or 18 months old.  We dispose of them then to the larger farmers in the Midlands, in Leinster and Munster.  While it costs us a considerable sum to rear those calves to 12 or 18 months, it costs the farmer who buys them from us very little to put the finishing touches to them.  That farmer reaps a profit at our expense.  I think something should be done to remedy that because we are the people who endeavour to maintain the trade and we should be given a <Col N="1984" /> chance to live and a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    <P>The farmer is, I am afraid, very much misrepresented in our larger towns and in our cities.  The people in the cities and towns who have to buy our farming produce are under the wholly erroneous impression that the farmer must be a very comfortable man and that he is extorting from them an undue profit on his produce.  So far as home marketing is concerned, I hold that there should be some change made in the present system.  Possibly such a change would require the services of a number of competent experts in order to examine into it.  I do believe a change is necessary and I maintain that so far as the development of agriculture and the marketing of our produce is concerned, very little headway will be made until that change is brought about.  Our produce at the same time passes through too many hands before it reaches the consumer.  The people who handle the produce are reaping an undue profit out of it at the expense of the producer and the consumer and they are creating in the minds of the consumer the false impression that it is the producer who is enjoying that unfair profit at the expense of those living in the towns and cities.  The Minister is well aware of that.</P>
    <P>I am told&mdash;whether it be right or wrong I do not know&mdash;that in the City of Dublin you are bound by certain rules and regulations with which you must comply if you wish to market your produce.  The market is governed by a ring or group of men.  I think that is unfair and I think it is a scandal that such a state of affairs should be permitted to continue.  I understand that ring which regulates prices in the Dublin market is composed of those farmers around the City of Dublin.  I think the sooner the Minister does something to bring an end to the present situation the better it will be for all concerned.  This city should be thrown open to every farmer no matter where he lives.  That would introduce an element of competition and the people in the City of Dublin would no longer suffer under the injustice of extortionate prices particularly in times of scarcity, such as happened during the hard weather in the past <Col N="1985" /> winter.  The farmer who lives in Mayo and Donegal should have equal access to the Dublin market.</P>

      <P>That is what you think.  I think we should have in this country certain centres where our produce could be collected.  We should have centres where a farmer could leave a ton of potatoes which he did not require for himself, or a ton of corn, or a ton of anything else.  He should be able to leave that surplus in a particular centre and that centre should, in turn, transport that surplus to the consuming areas where it is required.  Farming should be carried on in the most up-to-date fashion and the farmer should be assisted in every possible way in the disposal of his produce with as little inconvenience to himself as possible and with every facility so that the meagre profit he does enjoy will neither be reduced nor wasted by a clumsy system of marketing such as exists to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies become annoyed if you look to Denmark and Holland for an example.  That is the wrong way to look at things.  No matter what country you may look to, you can always see something well worth copying or bettering if you go into the matter and examine it.  In Holland and Denmark, particularly in Holland, I understand that before the war nearly every farmer had a phone in his house.  There were central distributing bureaux.  If a farmer had two hundredweight of potatoes to sell, he was informed where to despatch them and overnight he was given a reasonable price for his potatoes.  Those potatoes, before reaching the consumer, had not to pass through the hands of two or three gentlemen who enjoyed considerable profits at the expense of the producer and consumer.  We require some distributing centres in this country.  We require a more up-to-date marketing system and a more up-to-date transport system for the transport of farming <Col N="1986" /> produce to the towns and cities.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should do everything possible to ensure the provision of better accommodation for the housing of cattle, corn, hay and machinery on farms.  Many farmers would erect such houses but for the fact that, if they did so, their valuations would be increased.  A system such as that is a drawback to farmers and a stumbling block in the way of the development of agriculture.  Everybody recognises that the farm labourer is the worst paid person in the community.  Farmers may point out that they are very good to their farm labourers, but that does not get over the fact that the farm labourer is badly paid.  I acknowledge that the farmer is not in a position to pay these labourers properly.  It is the duty of the Government and the Department to give every possible assistance to the farmer so that he in turn will be able to pay his labourers a reasonable wage. It would be unreasonable to expect a farmer to pay his labourers a reasonable wage if he has not the means to do so.  I understand that the farm improvement scheme comes up under this Estimate.  Is that correct, or does it come under this Estimate?</P>

It is an encouragement to the small farmer to brighten his homestead and to provide improvements which are required on his farm.

      <P>No other scheme has produced such good results as the farm improvement scheme.  As I say, I should like the Minister to make it permanent and to extend it to the erection of such things as barns, stables and pigsties.  I would also ask that those who fail to complete works under the scheme within the specified period should be dealt with leniently. A farmer has many things to contend with.  His plans may be affected by bad weather.  I am sure the Minister realises that many schemes started last winter were not completed within the specified period.  Frost interfered with concrete work and snow prevented all kinds of work from being carried out. As I say, the farmer cannot make any definite plans.  For that reason, I ask the Minister and his officials to be lenient with those who have not completed the work within the specified time.  If it is the provision of a manure pit, the construction of a road to a dwelling house, the fencing of an acre of land, or the drainage of an acre of land, and the farmer has to put part of it over until next year, when it is completed he should get whatever grant he is entitled to without any unnecessary trouble.  I can only speak in the highest praise of the officials administering this scheme. Any of them with whom I have come in contact have done their work very well and are deserving of every consideration from the Department, whether they were supervisors or officials who were encouraging farmers to adopt the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of the poultry industry should not be minimised.  It is a very important industry from the point of view that the housewife depends a great deal on the income derived from the sale of eggs.  It helps to buy tea, sugar, butter and other things necessary to keep the house going from one Friday to another.  In many instances it helps to buy tobacco for the husband. If the egg trade was cut out, it would be very difficult to run a home in rural Ireland.  The former Minister for Agriculture with some of his officials <Col N="1988" /> went to London to negotiate an agreement with regard to the export of eggs and turkeys.  I was disappointed with the way they handled the turkey trade at that particular time.  When the Minister came home he did not know exactly what the agreement was in relation to the turkey trade and had to approach the Minister for Food in Great Britain for a second explanation.  I do not see why the price of our eggs should depend upon the quantity we export.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his staff should recognise, in making that agreement with the British Government, that they could give no guarantee that they would be able to get producers of eggs to produce a quantity in excess of what we require at home in order to satisfy the British Ministry of Food.  I think it was an unfair bargain, an unreasonable bargain, and for an old customer it was something we did not expect from the British Government.  We expected more from the Department and the officials who went over there.  It was a poor agreement, when the price of eggs depended upon the number of hundreds we would have to send to Britain.  If we were a couple of hundred short of the specified number, the British Government were prepared to give only so much.  I think that was unreasonable.</P>
    <P>Egg production can be, and would be, increased if the housewife had some guarantee over a period of a year or two years.  A pullet has to be four months old before she starts to lay, and if you have got only a six months' guarantee in the price of eggs you cannot be sure whether it would pay to go into the production of poultry, not knowing what will happen during the next six months, and whether the agreement will be upheld or otherwise. If there was an agreement in relation to the price of eggs which would encourage production it should cover at least two years, the life of a hen.  A hen is worth keeping from two to three years.  Any longer than that she is not worth feeding, from the point of view of laying or eating.  If we could secure a reasonable understanding for our eggs with the British Government, that understanding to cover two or three years, the Irish housewife would <Col N="1989" /> put all her energy into egg production.</P>
    <P>Committees of agriculture are unable to meet demands in relation to poultry houses, and something should be done to provide grants for their erection.  I know of one instance where a young man wrote to me&mdash;it was about a year ago&mdash;asking me to contact the committee of agriculture. I am not on that committee, although I am a member of the county council. He wanted to know whether he would be entitled to the grant if he erected a poultry house in advance and complied with all the regulations.  He was told he would not be.  I think that is unfair and it is merely red tape.  He is only one of many who would, perhaps, erect poultry houses.  Here was a man prepared to comply with all the regulations and to have the poultry house supervised and examined.  He was prepared to erect the hen house with a view to producing fowl and eggs in compliance with the appeal made by the last Minister for Agriculture. He was told if he did erect it he would get no assistance, even though he complied in every way with the regulations. I reckon that as nonsense and it prevents an increase in the poultry population and in egg production. I agree with the regulations in the egg trade that ensure that eggs are marketed properly, that they are clean and fresh and can compete against the eggs from other counties, but at the same time this can be overdone, and I hope the Minister will request those who carry out inspections not to be too hard on people with small shops in rural areas.</P>
    <P>As regards the cattle trade, one of the things the small farmer suffers from is lack of surgical assistance from the veterinary point of view.  It is a downright shame that a small farmer, living on an uneconomic holding, who has only two milch cows, two heifers and perhaps two suck calves, with one of the cows struck down with milk fever or any other disease, in order to get assistance must send for a vet. and that vet. charges him £3.  A small farmer with ten acres, eking out a bare existence and trying to rear his family in keeping with Christian traditions, has to pay out £3, perhaps for five minutes' work.  It is time that free <Col N="1990" /> veterinary assistance should be made available to small farmers.  I consider it a shame that in 1947 we are still as backward in that connection as we were in 1917.  It is no credit to an Irish Government and the sooner a remedy is brought about, the better.</P>
    <P>I believe we should make more scholarships available for agriculture. We have young men going into the universities to-day, studying law and medicine; you have solicitors two a penny and doctors who are not required at all, there are so many of them.  They are entering professions which have no future, to a certain extent, unless they have luck on their side.  If we are sincere, and I believe we are, about the development of agriculture on a scientific basis; if we believe we are going to develop our main industry in a way about which we can feel proud, and that we can compete with any other country in the world, no matter how long it may be established and no matter what tradition it has behind it; if we are going to aim at reaching the top, then we need to give our young men a knowledge of farming.  They can acquire that knowledge not only on the farm but in the agricultural schools.</P>
    <P>I think more scholarships of that description would be better than scholarships for medicine, law or other faculties.  The more of these students and the more of these colleges we have the better for the country, the better for agriculture and the better for the young men themselves.  It must be made clear&mdash;I think it is not very clear at the moment&mdash;that if a young man takes up a course in agriculture, it does not follow that after he leaves the agricultural school, no matter how brainy he may be, the Department is bound to find him a job running around on a bicycle or in a motor car or over in the Department of Agriculture itself. Undoubtedly some of them will get positions but it must be made clear that the big majority of them are expected to go back to the land and apply the knowledge they have gained to cultivating the land with a view to building up agriculture.  I think that should be made clear to these young men because many of them really <Col N="1991" /> believe that in going to these schools, up to Albert College or down to Cork, they will get jobs, pen and pencil jobs.  That should not be the case and I do not think it is the case.  At least I hope it is not the case so far as the Department of Agriculture is concerned because if that were so, the purpose for which these colleges were erected would be defeated and we would not be using them for the best purpose.  The best purpose for which they can be used is to give these boys a knowledge of farming from the scientific point of view so that they can apply that knowledge to their own home farms.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that if we are to save this country and save agriculture we must put as many men on the land as possible.  The land is there and no matter what may be said about there being no land for division, the land is there and the men are there who are willing to take up that land. If they were on the land, there would be no necessity for compulsory tillage. There would be greater production and there would be no necessity for rationing many of the commodities that are rationed to-day&mdash;bread and butter, as well as bacon and mutton&mdash;in fact all these things which are essential for our people at home and so essential, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce has pointed out, if we intend to balance our export and import trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two items in connection with this Estimate which I should like to put before the Minister.  The first matter to which I should like to refer has been made the subject of reference by practically every Deputy who spoke since the Estimate was introduced, namely, the question of the decline in the pig population.  I want to point out that if the Minister allows many more days or weeks to pass without taking some steps to remedy this decline, he will find that the situation has become even worse.  According to the second paragraph of the circular issued by the Irish Bacon Curers' Association, in 1940 the total number of pigs killed at all bacon factories in Éire was 1,099,000.  By 1943 <Col N="1992" /> the number had fallen to 223,000.  The years 1944, 1945 and 1946 all showed small but steady increases, but in the first four months of 1947, 22,000 fewer pigs were received by the factories than in the first three months of 1946.  That is a very serious matter, but it is not the most serious aspect of the situation. In the absence of any arrangement between the Minister, the committee and the factories, the price of pigs has fallen anything from 10/- to 15/-per cwt. in the last fortnight.  If you take the price of pigs to-day as against the price for the same period last year, there is a difference of anything of £1 to 25/- per cwt.  In other words, you may safely say that they are £1 per cwt. cheaper to-day than they were at the same period this time 12 months. So far as pig production during the fall of the year is concerned, I can see no hope of any improvement in the situation if the present conditions are allowed to continue.  In fact, I can foresee that the Minister will arrive at a situation in which he will be forced to ration bacon.  Unless the Minister does something, and does it soon, you are bound to reach that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to point out to the Minister that pig production can totally disappear in a month whereas it would take at least 12 months to re-establish it, once it is lost.  The farmers say they cannot afford to produce pigs at slightly over £6 per cwt. live weight and they have no alternative but to dispose of their sows.  Once a farmer reaches a decision to dispose of his sow, it will take him only one month to fatten and dispose of that sow but if the same farmer decides to get back again into pig production it will take him 12 months at least to replace the sow.  You can therefore get rid of the pig population in one month but it will take at least 12 months to get it back again.  I believe that there is only one way to handle this situation successfully. If the Minister took the factories into his confidence, between them I believe that they would be capable of formulating some scheme that would make a success of pig production in this country and provide an increased quantity of bacon for consumers.  The factories are established but the factories will not be there unless the pigs <Col N="1993" /> are there for them.  It is the duty and the responsibility of the factories to make all necessary arrangements to see that prices are fixed at such a level as will yield a profit to the producers for their work.  These prices could be fixed with due consideration to the fact that there are periods of the year during which the producer can rear pigs more cheaply than at others.  The farmer can rear and fatten pigs from the 1st September or the 1st October until the 1st February much more cheaply than from the 1st February to 1st August.  He has certain offals or refuse from his crops in the harvest.  He has certain quantities of oats, barley and other types of grain, small potatoes and waste potatoes which can be utilised for pig feeding.  He can produce pigs for these months at a much cheaper rate than during the summer months.</P>
    <P>During the summer months the price of those commodities is more expensive. For instance, potatoes will deteriorate in weight.  A quantity of potatoes which weigh a hundredweight in October will not weigh a hundredweight in the month of June.  It is doubtful if it will weigh 6½ stones.  That brings up the value of the feeding stuff by roughly 20 per cent.  The same applies to oats.  Oats lose value as far as price is concerned during the months of September, October, November and December as compared with May, June and July.  The same applies to barley and any other feeding stuffs. Therefore, there is only one alternative and that is to give the difference in price during different periods of the year.  I am in very close touch daily with the farmers.  I have an idea of their needs and of what they feel is the minimum for which they can produce pigs for the purpose of putting bacon on the market.  I believe that during the period from October to the 1st April anything less than £6 10s. per live hundredweight will not pay him, and even then it is doubtful if he will have much of a profit.  I believe from the 1st April until the 1st August nothing less than £7 10s. per live hundredweight would be a paying proposition. Those weights are live-weight and if the two prices are taken live-weight the dead-weight value can be calculated. <Col N="1994" /> In that way I believe there is a possibility that the bacon trade and the pig population may be kept alive.  The decrease in the pig population and the consequent shortage of bacon has very serious effects.  It has the effect of being replaced by eggs or by one thing or another.</P>
    <P>The fact that the shortage of bacon would be replaced by eggs would mean that we would be shortening the quantity that would be available for export to meet the increased price we were promised by the agreement if we were able to meet the increase of 100,000 cases in excess of what we exported last year.  I am perfectly satisfied that if the Minister takes the bacon curers into his confidence he will have no trouble between the two of them.  That is one method by which the pig industry would be continued. I am perfectly satisfied also that unless he does so before the 1st July the situation will be serious because the sows will be fattened and sold.  If the industry declines or disappears it may be very difficult, if not impossible, to revive it.</P>
    <P>I want to say on this Vote that there is a grave shortage of machinery. From what I know of the retail trade, it is impossible to get any mowing machines just now and there is the danger that no mowing machines or potato diggers will be available this season.  I would like the Minister to make inquiries as to the number available, and if none are available to find out the date on which they will be available.  My own opinion is that the possibilities for this season are that there may be no mowing machines and no diggers.  This is a very serious situation.  In some areas, owing to rotation of crops&mdash;especially in my own district&mdash;very big crops of potatoes have been planted.  There are farmers with two, three and four acres of potatoes and it would be impossible to do the work without potato diggers. The same remarks apply to mowing machines.  For big crops of barley and wheat mowing machines are essential because when those crops are ripe they cannot be left out for a week or ten days.</P>
    <P>My last point is in connection with the improvements scheme.  As far as <Col N="1995" /> the improvements scheme is concerned I would like to say that it is of great benefit and that it is a great success in my part of the country.  I have only one complaint to make in regard to the matter.  I am informed that at times the amount of money allocated to certain areas is not sufficient to meet the number of applicants who desire to have improvements carried out.  I would ask the Minister to make inquiries and to find out if such is the case.  I am speaking in particular of North County Mayo and, if sufficient money is not available, I would ask him to make it available immediately to cover the number of applicants who have applied.  Further, I would like to point out that, this year, owing to the shortage of cement, there may be delay in the carrying out of some of these schemes.  Works which would have been completed by 31st March and for which people would have drawn their grants will not be completed until, perhaps, two or three months later than originally intended.</P>
    <P>I am especially interested in the production of pigs and bacon.  I happened to be in a town this morning and I saw a number of farmers with pigs in the streets.  Deputy Corry said that there are no feeding stuffs for pigs.  I say that there are.  I am perfectly satisfied that it is doubtful if in 1937&mdash;ten years ago&mdash;there were more pigs at fairs than there were at the fair this morning. The food is available.  The farmers have the potatoes and the oats.  It is simply a question of getting the production cost.  The farmer has to make up the cost of his pig.  The Minister must bear in mind that if the farmer goes to the market to-day he will base the cost of production of pigs on the prices he will get for potatoes and for oats.  If potatoes and oats are more profitable than pigs, naturally the farmer will not continue to produce pigs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>And still the feeders are giving £5 10s. 0d. for bonhams!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good reason to show that there is going to be a shortage of pigs.  If bonhams are only making £3 10s. 0d. the public must be aware that the foundation is not <Col N="1996" /> there.  When the young pig&mdash;the bonham&mdash;is able to make £5 10s. 0d. at eight or nine weeks old one can take it that the breeding sows are being sold&mdash;with the result that the numbers will lessen&mdash;and the foundation of our pig population is gradually disappearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>If it was not paying why are they giving £5 10s. 0d. for the bonhams?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a reason.  If there is a shortage of bonhams the price in operation, due to severe competition, will have to be paid.  There are plenty of farmers who want one or two bonhams to eat up the refuse of the house.  One or two bonhams are very useful.  They are like a little savings bank.  If the farmer feeds one or two bonhams for five or six months he will draw £25 or £30 for them.  But if they are paid £5 for the young bonhams there is a danger that they will fatten the sows and the pig population will disappear altogether.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieSnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to find myself in a position this evening to congratulate our present Minister for Agriculture on his appointment, but I think that it might perhaps be premature to congratulate him at this particular stage.  I feel at the moment more like sympathising with the Minister rather than criticising him.  I know that he is faced with an onerous and difficult task.  I know that this very important office has been handed over to him at a time when agriculture is in a most deplorable and undesirable condition.</P>
      <P>I realise, as everyone else does in this House, that our present Minister has come from farming stock.  I know that he has been reared on a comparatively small farm.  I know that for once in the history of our present Government we have got a practical farmer in office.  I expect great things from our present Minister.  I shall be surprised if, when this Vote comes up again next year, I do not then find myself in a position to congratulate him on the successes he will have achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because agriculture is such a very, very important industry in this country <Col N="1997" /> I think the foundation for our future agriculturists should be laid in the primary schools.  I made some suggestions along this line on another occasion to the former Minister for Agriculture.  In my young days the textbooks in the schools were devised with the idea of making us &ldquo;agricultural&rdquo; minded.  The textbooks dealt with the various phases in agriculture. We had textbooks dealing with pig production.  We had textbooks dealing with seeds and fertilisers and so on. The young students were given some knowledge of agriculture.  I would suggest to the Minister now that he should, in co-operation with the Minister for Education, devise a set of textbooks for the young students in the schools which would give them a definite agricultural bias.  It has been stated here on more than one occasion that there is a continuous and disastrous flight from the land.  We all know the unhappy position we find ourselves in to-day in regard to our most essential foodstuffs.  The shortages of butter, eggs, and bacon are due in large measure to an insufficiency of labour on the farms at the present time.  We could produce much more if we had more labour on the farms.  The scarcity in large measure can be attributed to lack of labour.</P>
    <P>In order to stop the drift from the land, steps should be taken now to make agriculture more attractive.  In order to make it more attractive several things must be done.  More money must be poured into agriculture. Every penny spent on the development of agriculture is money well spent.  Subsidies should be given for farm buildings, out-offices, machinery and so on.  Grants should be made available to the farmers.  We have reached a stage now when, if we are to be successful in our agricultural industry, we must become mechanicallyminded. Other agricultural nations are moving very fast and we have not yet reached the scientific stage reached in other countries.  We will have to use more machinery in the future.  I think the use of more machinery would be an incentive to the young people to remain on the land.  We will have to provide better houses and better out-offices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1998" /> Production is the first essential.  We must produce.  If we want to have more production we must employ more people on the land.  We are all agreed that the farmer's life is a precarious one.  The farmer has to plan every year.  In spite of all his plans he may suffer many reverses due either to weather conditions or labour troubles. Some stimulant would be given to the farmer if the Department of Agriculture would formulate a long-term agricultural policy for the country.  The farmer of to-day knows only for the time being where he is.  He has some idea of what his produce will realise. He can carry out no long-term policy on his own because he does not know, or cannot know, what his produce will realise in twelve months' or two years' time.</P>
    <P>A long-term agricultural policy should be inaugurated so that the farmers would have some idea as to what the future might be, what the market values might be and what their produce might be worth in a year's, two years' or three years' time.  In that way the farmer could produce sufficient for our own requirements and a surplus for export. In addition to that he would be providing much-needed employment in the country.  The farmer at the moment cannot tell you whether he will need one man, two men or more men this time next year because his plans may be altered or disrupted by some Governmental interference next year.  I would strongly urge upon the Minister the necessity for formulating a three-year plan, for instance, so that the farmer could plan his activities for the next three years.</P>
    <P>A Deputy from the other side of the House spoke about a costings tribunal. In these times of compulsory tillage I think that is most essential and is overdue. I hold the same view as the Deputy that many of our crops are not produced at a profit.  As a matter of fact, my views might be even more extreme than the Deputy's.  I can assure the Minister that in some parts of the country, particularly some areas in my county, the growing of wheat is an absolutely dead loss.  From patriotism and love of country and in order to keep the wolf from the door people may have grown wheat for four or five years at a <Col N="1999" /> loss, but I cannot visualise anyone being so foolish as to grow wheat for the next four or five years at a loss.  Whatever ideas the Minister may have in connection with wheat growing, I can assure him that in my county it very often happens that the crop does not equal the amount of seed put into the land.</P>
    <P>Last year my own experience was this: My wheat quota is 3½ acres and I put four barrels of seed wheat into that.  The cultivation was good as I supervised it myself.  The manuring, the ploughing and the harrowing were good.  Everything was done well.  Out of that four barrels of seed I got 17¼ cwts. of wheat.  When you take the cost of seeding, cultivation, reaping, binding and the other incidental expenses, I wonder will the Minister sympathise with me and many others like me who are making the necessary effort to grow wheat.  We are not growing it simply to comply with the compulsory tillage Order.  We are trying to grow it at a profit.  That is my experience and I am living amongst many people who have had a somewhat similar experience. In conditions like that, I do not see how the Minister can expect that people will continue to incur such losses over a long period.  The Minister may know best how we are to tackle that problem.  I am not by any means opposed to compulsory wheat growing. For the last six or seven years it was most essential; but now that the emergency is practically over and we are returning gradually to more normal times, that state of affairs cannot continue. I am sure the Minister will agree that we cannot continue to work at a loss over a number of years.</P>
    <P>There is scarcely anything left for any of us out of the pig business.  I attribute the decline of the pig population to Government interference, particularly the interference of the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  In my early days when we had not Government control there were plenty of pigs in the country.  As in other branches of agriculture, a man who goes in for pig production cannot plan in advance.  He does not know what the price will be when he is selling his pigs.  Let no one <Col N="2000" /> say that the pig population has gone down owing to lack of foodstuffs.  So far as I know, particularly in my area, there is a surplus of foodstuffs.  There is a surplus of oats which cannot be disposed of, which, if ground with some potatoes and other root crops, would make good feeding for pigs.  I attribute the decline to the interference of the Pigs and Bacon Commission which leaves people in the unfortunate position that they do not know what they will get for the pigs when marketing them.  In order to stimulate pig production a big effort will be required for several years to come.  I would say that the importation of maize is most essential.</P>

      <P>Of course, you will not give a direct answer.  I know that the Minister believes that what I am saying is right, that maize is about the best food pigs could get to bring them to maturity and to make them saleable. My county has not a tillage <Col N="2001" /> tradition but I think our activities, so far as compulsory tillage is concerned, will compare favourably with any one of the other Twenty-Six Counties.  We were working at a big disadvantage. As I said, we have not got a tillage tradition.  Neither had we got machinery.  We were making an uphill fight, yet we responded as well as we possibly could under the difficult circumstances.  In a few isolated cases drastic action had to be taken to compel people to comply with the tillage regulations.  There are always a number of black sheep in every flock.  In many of these cases I would say that the investigation was not carried out properly.  I have known cases where compliance with the tillage regulations was the cause of hardship to certain individuals. There were cases where individuals were prosecuted and severe fines imposed upon them although their failure to comply with the regulations was not their fault.  I know of a case where two old ladies were not in a position to comply with the regulations <Col N="2002" /> because they could not get labour; yet they were prosecuted and fined severely.  In such cases I would say that, on compassionate grounds, a little more leniency should have been shown.</P>
