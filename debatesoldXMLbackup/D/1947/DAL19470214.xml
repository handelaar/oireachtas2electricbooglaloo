    <P>Sections 1 and 2 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" /> In the table to the section to delete reference No. 5, column 2, and to substitute therefor the reference &ldquo;Maor or (in English), Major.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister's reasons on the Second Stage of this Bill for altering the rank of &ldquo;major&rdquo; to that of &ldquo;lieutenant-colonel&rdquo; were rather unconvincing. By this change, we shall get out of step with, I think, every other army.  It is proposed to abolish the rank of &ldquo;major&rdquo; and to substitute that of &ldquo;lieutenant-colonel.&rdquo;  In all other armies, so far as I know, there is usually a rank between that of &ldquo;major&rdquo; and that of &ldquo;colonel.&rdquo;  But in other armies, there is no rank between that of &ldquo;captain&rdquo; and that of &ldquo;major,&rdquo; with the possible exception of the French army.  As I said on Second Stage, in almost every case in the French army, the rank of &ldquo;commandant&rdquo; is regarded more as an appointment than as a rank.  The use of the rank of &ldquo;commandant&rdquo; in the French army is, I understand, now much less frequent than it was formerly.  When officers of our Army are engaged on courses abroad, it will be incongruous to have no rank of &ldquo;major&rdquo; and to have the rank of &ldquo;commandant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there may be sentimental reasons for retaining the rank of &ldquo;commandant&rdquo;.  But they are no greater in the case of that rank than in the case of numerous other ranks which obtained in the pre-Truce I.R.A. These ranks have since been changed. There were ranks of &ldquo;commandant&rdquo;, &ldquo;colonel&rdquo;, &ldquo;commandant-general&rdquo;, and &ldquo;brigadier-general&rdquo; in the pre-Truce days.  All these ranks have been altered.  Almost since the inception of the Defence Forces, these ranks have been abolished, with the exception of the rank of &ldquo;commandant&rdquo;.  We are now proposing to get out of line with every other army by abolishing the rank of &ldquo;major&rdquo;.  If the Minister considers it desirable to introduce the rank of &ldquo;lieutenant-colonel&rdquo;, he should not do so at the expense of the rank of &ldquo;major&rdquo;.  If necessary, it should be introduced as an additional rank.  When our officers meet officers of other armies on special courses or in competitions, they will look very foolish <Col N="1107" /> if we carry out the change proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accepting the amendment.  It would have been desirable to have the rank of &ldquo;commandant&rdquo; changed to that of &ldquo;major&rdquo; but a sentimental appeal attaches to the rank of &ldquo;commandant&rdquo;. Most of the leaders of Easter Week held the rank of commandant and were executed in that rank. A large number of men who fought for the independence of this country, in the struggle which is past, held that rank and it was regarded almost as the outstanding rank in that struggle.  It is the equal of the rank of major in other armies.  The rank of lieutenant-colonel now brings us into line with all the other armies.  In other words, when in future a captain meets a captain he knows he is meeting an officer of equal rank; a major of a foreign army meeting a commandant of our Army will now realise for the first time that he is meeting an officer of equal rank; and the lieutenant-colonel meeting a lieutenant-colonel will be meeting an officer of equal rank.</P>
      <P>Heretofore, that was not the position. Our major who, in fact, was the equal of a lieutenant-colonel, was being regarded naturally by the majors of the army he was meeting as being of only equal rank with themselves, whereas he was a rank higher.  The difficulty in the future will be that the only rank which will not have the same title is that of commandant, but it will be made very clear.  It will be clear that an Irish captain is equal to a foreign captain and our commandant is the equal of the major of the other armies, and the lieutenant-colonel rank brings us on the same level with other armies.  I do not think there is anything very serious about the amendment.  I do not think the Deputy is really serious about it.  I think the Deputy is just taking up the line that he opposed it on the Second Reading and continues to oppose it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no very vital principle involved, but it is nonsense for the Minister to suggest that, when <Col N="1108" /> majors of other armies in future meet commandants, they know they are meeting a person of the same rank. How could anyone suggest that, when there is a rank of major in every single army, including the French army?  It is childish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Because there will be no rank of major in this Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>He will not know then whether it is a commandant or a lieutenant-colonel.  There is a rank between that of major and colonel in every other army.  In all armies, except the French, there is no rank between captain and major.  There may be sentimental reasons for retaining the rank of commandant, but it is ridiculous.  This proposal was originally put up in the Army to change the rank of commandant.  When that was not accepted by the Government they should not be making a laughing stock of themselves now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that what is in this Bill is the continuation of the Defence Forces and, that being so, the House is entitled to discuss the Defence Forces, while at the same time refraining from repeating what was said on the Second Stage.  I submit that the House is fully entitled, under the Standing Orders and under the procedure, to discuss what is in a measure and that this particular measure deals with the Defence Forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If I wish to oppose this measure on the Fifth Stage, arising out of the information we have got here, am I entitled to give reasons why we should not pass this Bill, and in the development of that go into the fact that we have been told that, although the Government want an Army larger than we have at the present time, they have no policy for equipping it and do not intend to have a policy for equipping it until they make up their minds on certain other things?  I have no intention of developing unreasonably a discussion of this matter.  I have no desire to force the House into a division against the Army Bill, but if I were to take seriously some of the proposals and some of the information given to us on this measure, I would feel in duty bound to oppose the Bill.  I would ask whether, in discussing this matter, I cannot discuss some of the matters that arose, which show that, in the first place, the Government unnecessarily want a largely increased Army and, though they want it, they have no plans and no policy for equipping it. We have been advised from the <Col N="1111" /> Government Benches that it is unreasonable and surprising that we want to discuss these things and it is said we ought to keep our mouths shut.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>In the very near future, I will be introducing a Supplementary Estimate, in which there are items which will provide all the opportunities the Deputy will require for discussing the question of equipping and policy, if he so desires.  I do not think there is any foundation for the statement that the Government has no policy in regard to equipment&mdash;or for some of the other suggestions made by the Deputy.  If he wants to talk about equipment, I feel that the place to do so fully would be on the Supplementary Estimate, which will be before the Dáil in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some things I want to say on this matter, and if I were deliberately opposing this measure on the Fifth Stage, arising out of the information or the facts disclosed to us on the Second Stage, I take it I would be entitled to traverse some of that ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy understands clearly what has been the practice, that, on the Fifth Stage, Deputies are confined to what is in the Bill, and, on the Second Stage, to what they think should be in the measure and to general policy. Debate would be interminable if it were possible on the Fifth Stage to repeat everything said on the Second Stage.  Business would be impossible if we could have the Second Stage debate resumed on the Fifth Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has been put in a very difficult position by the manner in which the Minister and some members of the Government Party have discussed this matter.  I appreciate the point the Minister <Col N="1112" /> makes that we will have a Supplementary Estimate for the Army&mdash;I think it is on the Order Paper now&mdash;and will have the Army Estimate in about a month or so.  I have no desire in any way to stretch the range of my discussion on this measure outside the limits of order, but I want to suggest to the Minister that he is driving us into the position of opposing the Bill for an Army at all if he faces the House in the spirit and in the way in which he has faced it on this occasion.  Take one point, General Sir William Slim, who commanded the British 14th Army in Burma, in the middle of last year, dealt with the circumstances of war from his particular point of view and said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;War means all the activities of the nation, economic, scientific, industrial, financial and political, as well as martial.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On behalf of two countries in which we are closely interested, New Zealand and Australia, following a discussion of defence planning generally for themselves and other members of the British Commonwealth the statement is made that no more than the British Government can Dominion Governments examine their defence needs without asking themselves how soon and how far economic recovery will enable them to bear the expense of satisfactory defence plans, and that so far, the meetings have made it clear that Australia and New Zealand are prepared to bear a considerably larger share of defence expenditure than in the past, provided that these other common aims, full employment and a secure standard of living, are not endangered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Briefly, the Minister tells the House that, for 100 officers he had in 1939, he now has 194, but he is not satisfied with that&mdash;he wants 236; and for every 100 men he had in 1939, he now has 134, and he wants 198.  That is, if you like, a reduction from what he declared to us in November last he wanted, and he will reduce that more if we are not driven, as Deputy de Valera would drive us, into the position in which we are to be told that these matters are not for discussion here.  They are matters for discussion here as, in the <Col N="1113" /> first place, our economic strength is the real source of our defensive strength, and if our defence machinery is to be used, is the attitude to be taken up that, so far as the ordinary people of the country are concerned, theirs is not to reason why, theirs but to do and die&mdash;neither they nor their representatives are to be allowed to discuss either policy or any other matter connected with defence?</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera said that, from the point of view of how we were to organise ourselves in the future and how we were to equip ourselves in the future, what he wanted to do was to look back and see what would happen, that time was necessary for doing that, that we could not possibly make up our mind on how we were going to equip ourselves to-day, and because we could not do so, we could not make up our minds on how we were to organise ourselves.  We do not know how we are to organise, if we do not know how we are to equip ourselves, and if we are to stand absolutely aside, as the Minister suggests, from any other nation in the world which has been in the practice and which has the power of assisting us in getting our equipment for war and helping us in our defence, we are imbeciles to be organising an Army, as the Minister said, two and a half times as large and to be paying for it to-day when all the great war-makers in the world are sitting down in conference to see whether they cannot bring about peace and the avoidance of war.</P>
    <P>Surely the men who made and commanded our Army during the past difficult six years should be trusted to regard and to examine the situation for us, and we ought not to be asked to accept the word of the Government that they have considered representations from our military experts and that they are satisfied these military experts want these provisions and want them in circumstances in which we are not to examine how these men are to be trained, equipped and organised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of equipment is one which I would say is solely for military experts to decide.  I do <Col N="1114" /> not think that Deputy de Valera at any time suggested that discussion of defence problems should be prevented in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed he did, repeatedly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think he suggested that there should be any curtailment of discussion on defence problems.  He made reference to the fact that discussion of certain aspects of defence problems in the House was not desirable, but what I want to say in respect of what Deputy Mulcahy has just stated is this&mdash;I cannot say exactly when I gave the information, but it was some time ago&mdash;that I told the House in very plain language that we had withdrawn all contracts for equipment, wherever we had placed them, and the reason why the contracts were withdrawn was that we did not want to have unloaded on to ourselves equipment which had perhaps become redundant or which was not up to the standard we would require in the future.  Our great desire was that whatever money we had to expend on warlike stores should be spent on the most up-to-date possible type of equipment.</P>
      <P>The Army authorities who were examining the matter, in discussing the question with me, felt that there was going to be a very great advance in the matter of future equipment and that it was highly desirable that we should withdraw these orders, await developments and make our decisions in the light of these developments. We did that and since that, with the exception of the purchase of the naval vessels and some flying equipment, which is very necessary for the training of our pilots, we have not purchased anything in the nature of warlike stores.  I think that was a good policy.  I do not think that we erred in taking that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not at any time, to my knowledge anyhow, attempted to prevent discussion on the question of equipment or on the question of defence policy.  In fact, I went to the trouble of making a very detailed statement on defence policy.  But, as I said in my concluding statement <Col N="1115" /> on the Second Stage of the Bill, I have a suspicion that Deputy Mulcahy is mixing up two different problems&mdash;the problem of external relations and the problem of defence. In reply to a question which he asked, I told the Deputy that we had no discussion with any other nation in regard to our defence policy and that was merely a statement of fact.  I take it that that does not mean that we could not have such discussions, if they were deemed necessary.  If they were deemed necessary, these discussions would not be a matter for decision by me; they would be a matter for decision by the Government.  The fact that Deputy Mulcahy and his colleagues can discuss defence policy on this Bill, as they did in the fullest possible manner, refutes the Deputy's own statement that they are being prevented from discussing defence.</P>

      <P>However, I am assuring Deputy Mulcahy and other Deputies, but I am sure the assurance is hardly needed, because I think most of the Deputies during the debate went very much further even than some members of the Opposition would think desirable.  Some of the statements made were of a character that should not be made in a Parliamentary debate.  I am only mentioning that to show that, far from attempting to curtail debate on the question of defence, we have, in fact, encouraged it.</P>

      <P>The Minister says I am associating external affairs with <Col N="1116" /> Army policy.  There is no use in discussing the Army here as a museum piece.  When we discuss the Army here, we discuss an Army which has to be equipped with the assistance of the outside world, which has to be trained with the experience of the outside world, and which is only wanted here because of the outside world.</P>

      <P>The Army is as fully equipped to-day as it was during the emergency when the Deputy was giving the fullest possible support he could give to the policy of the Army in relation to the defence of the nation.  It is just as well equipped now as it was then.  What I did say in the course of my reply is that we are withdrawing orders in order that we may, if the necessity should arise, purchase much more up-to-date equipment.  I think that is what the Deputy wants.  Is it not?</P>

      <P>I want to know why an Army of the size which the Minister is planning for is to be maintained. In relation to that question, you are up against organisation and equipment and the whole position in the world to-day, and that will have to be discussed thoroughly, because the numbers and the cost of the Army spoken of here are such that the matter requires the fullest possible examination in every detail.  The Minister should not saddle the people belonging to other Parties, who were members of the Defence Conference, with approving completely of everything done during that particular time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>On several occasions I have raised the question of the inadequate pensions of teachers, especially of those who retired pre-1938. With other members from every section of the House I have appealed to the Minister to grant them an increase to meet the rapid rise in the cost of living.  I know several teachers who have retired under the age limit, and <Col N="1117" /> I am aware that their commitments in respect of house purchase and the education of their children had not been discharged by the time they reached 65 years of age.  The Minister last night reviewed the position.  He inferred that at 65 a teacher should have his family reared and placed and should almost have something on reserve.  I made a casual interjection. I asked what salary had such a teacher 30 years ago.  At that time the teacher would have been educating and rearing his children.  I asked the Minister what he thinks such a teacher could have saved so that at the age of 65 he could have something on reserve to eke out his small pension.</P>
      <P>I will try to make it clear that on the salary such a teacher was paid, either by the previous Government, by the British Government or by this Government, he could have nothing on reserve when he reached the age of 65. I put it to the Minister that to-day they are finding great difficulty in meeting the cost of living and it appears to all of us terribly unfair that that should be the position of men who gave of their very best in the troubled period.  In fact, it has been stated that it was the teachers who were responsible for bringing about the change that took place following 1916, that it was the dissatisfied teachers of the pre-1916 period that encouraged the revolt amongst our people, and that the teachers, to a large extent, are responsible for the setting up of an Irish Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember some 30 years ago bringing a teachers' deputation to the Minister for Education in Westminister and I say that the attitude towards such deputations appeared to be more sympathetic than the attitude of the Government to-day.  At the time when female teachers had the magnificent salary of £40 a year, I went on a deputation to the Minister for Education in Great Britain with Sir Edward Carson, John Redmond and Joe Devlin, and made a case for an increase.  Little did I think that, when our own Government would be set up and we had control of our own affairs, we would meet in a Chamber, <Col N="1118" /> as we are now meeting, with the Prime-Minister of the country, a teacher, with the bronze statue of Pádraig Pearse looking down on us, appealing that retired teachers should not have to bear the hardships that are now imposed on them.</P>
    <P>The Minister's excuse for not dealing with the case of teachers is that, if we deal with the teachers, we will have to deal with all other State pensioners who may think they have a claim.  No one in this House will dispute the fact that there is a case for all those others, such as postmen and civil servants, who retired on very small pensions.  We are standing by them also and are appealing to the Government to see that all those who are on fixed State benefits of any kind should get an increase to meet the increased cost of living.  They should at least be put in a position to purchase the same quality and quantity of food and clothing that their pre-war pensions purchased for them.  We are well aware that their pensions are not worth half their purchasing value at the time they were fixed.  Members of the Government Party support this appeal and would give a sigh of relief if it were granted.  I know some of them have privately pleaded with the authorities that reasonable pensions should be paid and that the discontent that is growing every day should come to an end.</P>
    <P>I think the Government ought to be generous in this matter.  The Minister made the casual remark that it would cost £1,000,000 to give 2/6 a week extra to the old age pensioners.  One is tempted to ask him why did the Government give back the excess profits tax to the extent of £4,000,000?  Why did they not hold it for a little longer, for, perhaps, a year or two, and give it to the pensioners or in unemployment benefits or to the widows and orphans or generally to those in receipt of small allowances?  It is deplorable to see an ex-teacher who has given 30 or 40 years' service going through the city wearing a well-brushed, shiny suit of clothes, worn practically threadbare, trying to uphold his dignity, trying to look the part that he was once a teacher.</P>
    <P>I join in the appeal made by other Deputies to the Government to see <Col N="1119" /> that the teachers and all other pensioners and people drawing small allowances and small benefits are better treated.  I think the time has come when the Government should be generous to those unfortunate people; they should make an Order increasing their pensions and allowances.</P>

      <P>This debate must conclude at 12 o'clock.  There are at least three Deputies who desire to participate.  Any Deputy who does speak might bear in mind that there are others anxious to take part in the debate.  The mover of the motion, Deputy M. O'Sullivan, must get at least a quarter of an hour.  There is still half an hour left and I would like Deputies to bear that point in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this motion and in doing so I want to stress the need of the pensioned teachers on the lower scales.  If, as Deputy Byrne said, the Minister has made the case that teachers at the retiring age should have met all their commitments, I would like to impress upon the Minister that pension is deferred pay and that teachers, throughout their years of service, have contributed a percentage of their pay towards a pension.  In essence, what they have earned by way of pension is in the nature of deferred pay.  Therefore, it is idle to say that in this motion we are endeavouring to upset a contract as between the teacher and the State and that every time there is a rise in the cost of living the pension must be reviewed.  The pension is virtually in the same position as the question of pay.</P>
      <P>However that may be, I would like to impress upon the Minister that most teachers who have families have very heavy commitments.  They generally make an effort to educate their children for the teaching or for other professions and, generally, they spend a great deal of their money educating their children for various professions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, throughout their active lives they probably use most of their capital resources in providing for the education of their families and in that way many teachers find themselves, at the time when they should look <Col N="1120" /> forward to a period of ease, in dire distress.  They probably have to retire before their children, in their various professions, have begun to give any monetary return for whatever has been spent on them.  I would like to impress that aspect of the matter upon the Minister.  Many of the children go for the Church and perhaps they will never give a monetary return to their parents, so it is idle to argue that these people in their old age have no commitments.  If anything, they have left themselves in a very serious financial position by reason of the sacrifices they made whilst they were in a position to make them.</P>
    <P>I want, in particular, to direct the Minister's attention to the case of teachers who went out in the inter-regnum before the higher scales of salaries obtained.  There are many teachers in my constituency who went out under the old British scale of salaries and never had the benefit of the new scales while in office and, therefore, never had the benefit of the higher pensions.  Many of these men are in dire want to-day.  Many of them are in receipt of pensions of something like £1 to 30/- a week.  Does the Minister really think that any teacher, perhaps an old man left alone without any family, or an old man left with his wife, with his children gone away, and, perhaps, not in a position to contribute to the family needs, can carry on in present circumstances on a miserable pittance of £1 or 30/- a week?</P>
    <P>I can give instances in my own and in the Minister's constituency of old teachers, old Volunteers, who are struggling to live on £1 a week.  That £1 a week debars them from claiming the old age pension.  Many of these men are scholarly men and it is a terrible thing to see them living in circumstances of dire poverty, unable to meet the daily bread bill.  It is a sad ending for them.  Some of these men gave sterling national service in the Volunteers and Sinn Féin organisations; they were prepared in their day to sacrifice everything for the cause. Now they find themselves in a pitiable <Col N="1121" /> position.  I can produce many letters from such people, but I do not want to go into detail or mention of specific cases.</P>
    <P>There are in the Minister's constituency many of these men who are not living, but who are simply awaiting death on the miserable pensions which this State allows them.  I can give him instances where men served 42 years and more and they are to-day receiving the miserable pittance of £1 or 30/- a week.  I could instance the cases of men who served 15 years in a British Army school and they are getting three or four times the amount of pension those ex-teachers have.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will make some effort to examine the cases of people who are below the £2 level.  Whatever may be said on the general issue, I believe the House would approve the Minister examining specifically the cases of those below the £2 level.  In 99 per cent. of these cases the individuals are not living, but are merely awaiting death in the most miserable circumstances.  I rose particularly to make a case for those men and women and I ask the Minister, if it is at all possible, to make an exception of these people and endeavour to relieve them in their dire necessity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephHallide" hpid="Mr. Halliden Mr. Halliden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make an appeal on behalf of a section of the pensioned teachers who, to my mind, have been very unjustly and callously treated by the Government.  I refer to the lady teachers compelled to retire at the age of 60 years.  A great many of them have not had service sufficient to warrant their getting the full pension. In the circumstances, I think the Government should have added some years to their service to qualify them for the full pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a considerable number of those teachers.  The difference between their present pensions and what they would get normally would not amount to a very big sum.  That money is being held each year by the Treasury and I think, in common justice, there should be a refund made to those teachers. They were obliged to retire at the age of 60 years, five years before they were able, as it were, to balance their budgets <Col N="1122" /> and make arrangements for their families.  They were not only cut off from their salaries for five years, but they labour under the injustice that they are not getting full pension.</P>
    <P>Many of those teachers have spent the best years of their lives trying to teach the Irish language.  They spent many days, weeks and months trying to fit themselves for the onerous duty entrusted to them of teaching the Irish language.  They went to considerable expense in doing so.  They obtained their bilingual certificates and had highly efficient service, but still, at the age of 60 years, before they were prepared to go out, they had to retire in order to make room for others.  I make a special appeal to the Government to take the cases of those teachers into consideration.  They have been very badly treated and I hope something will be done to improve their pensions and to refund to them at least some of the money that has been so unjustly taken from them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak on this question not from any Pilatical complex but from absolute conviction.  It is sometimes, no doubt, rather embarrassing in a situation like this, when the Minister has already declared his intentions, for a Deputy on these benches to decide whether he should express his views or maintain a discreet and uneasy silence.  In this instance I have decided to express my convictions on the <Col N="1123" /> motion before the House.  This is a very important question.  The mover of the motion has stated that there is a special case for the teachers.  There can be no doubt whatever but that that can be established.  As a Deputy on these benches, I am not prepared to accept the suggestion that if the pensioned teachers' claims are conceded, the bottom is going to fall out of the Exchequer purse.  Let us go back to the work these teachers did at a time when they had four pay days in the year, that is when they had quarterly salaries, the work that they did for this nation when there was, as has been said here, very little secondary education and very little transport to bring the rural community to the centres where such education was available. Let us come from that time of their miserable salaries and their four payments in the year to the time of national resurgence, at the start of the Gaelic Athletic Association and the Gaelic League, when they established branches here and there throughout the country and when they worked, not only after school hours by day, but again by night to revive our ancient language and to inspire the rising generation with a sense of their duties to their native land.  It was said once that the famine and the national schools were partly the cause of losing the Irish language.  All I can say, with reference to the teachers with whom we are dealing now, is that to their efforts in the early days of the Gaelic revival more than to those of any other section of the community, is due the fact that the Irish language holds the position that it does to-day.  They laid the foundations for whatever work has been done in that regard.  We all know that at their own expense and often at great personal inconvenience, even though they were only a couple of chapters ahead of their pupils, they came after a hard day's work to teach the national language at various centres.  In every other national movement they took a creditable part.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, if we consider the position that they had built up from the penurious salaries they were getting, we must agree that they are <Col N="1124" /> entitled to special consideration.  In 1934, the Government took over £2,400,000 odd from a fund that was there to provide pensions for the teachers.  Of that fund, £1,535,000 was money they had themselves subscribed. They had subscribed a surplus of £250,000 to their portion of the fund. From that fund, as the Minister has admitted, there is an investment income of £83,000 a year.  That does not apply to any other branch of service, Government or otherwise.  With that £83,000 we could give 20 per cent. of an increase to the pensioned teachers.  Why not do it?  Can any case be made why it should not be done?  I do not see any.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ua Donnchadha raised the point that some money was saved to the Government during the strike.  A sum of £165,000 approximately was saved and even though mention has been made of a small portion of that that has been paid out, I say now deliberately, while I take a very poor view of that payment&mdash;I do not want to drag any other controversy into the case I am making for the pensioned teachers&mdash;that that saving of £165,000 would provide these increases for two years in full without any charge to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I have a document here to which the name of my old teacher is appended. Since that document was written, he has passed to his eternal reward. When I was only 16 years of age he asked me to become secretary of the Gaelic League and of the Feis in the parish&mdash;a branch of the Gaelic League he himself had established.  He was only one of many like him who did their utmost to propagate the language. They are passing from us rapidly; soon they will be gone.  Let us at least pay some tribute to the service of those of them who are left other than mere flamboyant words.</P>
    <P>We have some very plausible arguments put up to us from all sides of the House, but in 1922, shortly after our own Government was established, the first thing that happened in the case of the teachers was a withdrawal of fees for teaching Irish as an extra subject.  That was the first gesture towards the teachers and their work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1125" /> In 1923 there was a 10 per cent. cut in salaries, bonuses, capitation grants, fees for mathematics and for teaching monitors and pupil teachers.  That was a good start.  Let it be understood that every cut in salary meant a cut in pension.  In 1926 there was another withdrawal of grants to teachers for teaching monitors and pupil teachers, and in 1929 there was a total withdrawal of fees for the teaching of rural science.  Now we hear that rural science is not being taught in these schools.  Why should it, when the grants were withdrawn in 1929 by the Government then in power?  In 1933 there was a cut from 1 to 8 per cent. in salaries and in 1934 there was a further deduction from 6 to 9 per cent. in salaries.  In 1938 there was a restoration of 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>That is the treatment which the teachers have got under a native Government. I do not wish to draw comparisons with what has occurred elsewhere, and the treatment which teachers have received there.  The burden on the public purse is always an excuse for not doing things. When, however, there is a war of destruction on, plenty of money can be got and there is no question about getting it, but when it comes to economic construction, then we have no money for anything.  We have no money to build up, but we have plenty of it to destroy.  That is the cry of the world.  While it may be considered financial heresy from the official point of view to say this, I hold that, as long as we are attached to the £ sterling, the man doing work here, whether it be picking potatoes, working on the roads, or teaching in a school, is entitled to the same monetary recompense as the man teaching in another country where the same monetary system obtains.  I thought that I might have got some enlightenment or some ideas on that from Deputy Flanagan, but since he has not enlightened me, I shall have to persist in my heresy.</P>
    <P>It is certain that a special case can be made for the teachers because of the fact that the fund, which was built up by the teachers themselves and which had a surplus of £250,000, was taken <Col N="1126" /> over by the Government.  The Minister, instead of turning down the motion, should go into that aspect of the case and reconsider it&mdash;the special case that is made for the teachers by reason of that fund.  I agree that the whole case for exceptional treatment rests on that particular fact.  Therefore, I think the Minister ought to go into that and see whether a special case can be established to his satisfaction as it has, I am sure, been established to the satisfaction of the House.</P>
    <P>I know, of course, that if a division is challenged on the motion that, under the Party system of government, I will have to go into the lobby against my own convictions.  As a Deputy I often feel like one pulling against the current.  It is so overwhelming that one has to go back and take another approach to his objective. That is the Party system.  I suppose that any other system would not work here.  Irrespective of what I may have to do on the matter subsequently, I think that in tribute to the men who taught me and taught the members of this House, in tribute to their work for the nation and in appreciation of the high duties they performed on the miserable salaries, this occasion ought not to be allowed to pass without making a special appeal to the Minister for Education. I know that he would be sympathetic but that, like me, he is being overwhelmed by the Party system, and by all the other things that might happen if we were to do this.  Despite all that, I think a special case can be established for these men on the documents which are in the possession of the Government and of the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>I make a last appeal to the Minister to consider the case of those men and the circumstances under which they live.  It has been said that they should have their families reared, but with four payments in the year how could they have got married early in life and settled down?  They could not have done so until circumstances altered for them.  Their work was carried out in many cases in damp, cold, insanitary hovels.  They did their best to educate <Col N="1127" /> the rising generation, and one wondered &ldquo;how one small head could carry all they knew&rdquo;.  Now, in their declining years, in the evening of their lives, let it be said that this Irish Parliament is prepared to show appreciation of the work of men who, at a juncture in our history, when new life and hope were coming to the nation, took a leading part in laying the foundations for its future greatness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Deputy MacCarthy did not preserve the sweet silence which, I am sure, the Minister hoped he would.  He has made an admirable speech in support of the motion.  I agree with him that the teachers to some extent have been the playthings of Party politics.  They have suffered more under the present Government than they did under the previous one.  While I agree with what the Minister said yesterday, that the bill for superannuations is undoubtedly a very heavy one, and that it is his duty as Minister to examine microscopically practically every application for increases of pensions that comes before him, I still think that a special case can be made for these teachers, especially the old teachers in receipt of pensions of under £2 a week.  I do not agree with the Minister that they can be regarded as being in the same category as teachers who retired during the last ten or 12 years.</P>
      <P>It can be argued that the case of a teacher is different from that of a civil servant or of most State servants.  We all know that State servants usually get a gratuity on retirement.  The teacher does not.  If he did, it would be of the greatest help to him during the period when, so to speak, he was transferring from the type of life that he has been leading to another life. When he retires, the teacher has to live on about half the salary he had been earning heretofore.  The civil servant, as I have said, gets a gratuity on retirement, and that makes all the difference in the world between his case and that of the teacher.  Therefore, the teachers' case deserves to be considered on an entirely different plane altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> I agree with Deputy MacCarthy that this country owes so much to the teachers that it can never show a full appreciation of it.  The extraordinary transformation that has taken place in the country during the last 30 or 40 years is due almost entirely to the work of the teachers, and particularly, to the old teachers.  They were foremost in the literary revival, the national revival, and in the dramatic and cultural revival.  In fact, they were responsible for revolutionising the life of the country in almost every sphere.  Therefore, the old teachers have deserved well of the country.  It is unfortunately true that a great many of them are petering out their lives in a state of almost absolute destitution. On many previous occasions I have spoken on behalf of those in my own constituency.  I know their circumstances and I know they are very badly off.  Some of them are living in labourers' cottages, and many are in miserably poor circumstances.  Yet the Minister tells us that he cannot reopen their cases for further investigation.</P>
    <P>I submit that there is a moral obligation on the Minister and on the Government to do so on behalf of men who have performed such herculean work for the country.  In their old age they ought to be treated fairly and decently and given suitable recompense for their invaluable work on behalf of the country.  This generation owes it to them that they should be allowed to live out their lives in decent comfort. For that reason, I support most enthusiastically the motion moved by Deputies O'Sullivan and Murphy.  I had a great deal more to say but, having given an undertaking to occupy no more than five minutes, I want to honour that undertaking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to close this debate on a personal note.  If I had one ambition more than another since I entered public life, it was to avail of the opportunities of public life to advance the claims of aged people.  Like other members of the House, I hope to be old sometime.  If and when that stage is reached, I should like to feel that my circumstances should be such as would guarantee <Col N="1129" /> to me, at least, a measure of peace and reasonable comfort.  That is the reason why I have sponsored this motion.  That is why I have sponsored motions on other occasions regarding different classes of aged persons.  I must confess to profound disappointment at the manner in which this most serious question has been approached by the Minister.  I was innocent enough and optimistic enough to believe that, if the Minister could not see his way to concede the claims adumbrated in this motion at this stage, he would, at least, indicate to the House that the question of pensions as a whole was engaging the serious attention of the Government.  I was good-humouredly twitted by one of my colleagues regarding the moderate language in which I presented my arguments in support of the motion.  My colleague prophetically commented that I might have used very extreme language for all the purpose it would serve.</P>
      <P>Again, I want to express a complete sense of disappointment at the manner in which the Minister came into the House to deal with this question.  He did not attempt to controvert the specific points made in support of the motion.  He made one point which was unworthy of him.  He indicated that the teacher invariably held the position of leading citizen wherever he was located and that his remuneration was, at least, on the same basis as that of the local clergy.  That is not the type of argument one expects on an occasion such as this.  There is, perhaps, a more serious implication in what has occurred in this debate than the Minister's refusal to concede the points made on the motion.  I am a comparatively new member of the House and, in view of what has taken place, I am beginning to question the utility of parliamentary procedure in so far as Private Members' time is concerned. If a motion carrying serious implications can be dealt with in the manner in which this motion has been dealt with by the Minister, one begins to question the utility of such motions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I may address myself, for the first time, to the rank and file of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I have no particular <Col N="1130" /> right to address them but I want to say to them that they must bear some share of responsibility for the treatment which this motion has received.  I greatly appreciate the action of those members of the Party who were good enough to stand up and support the motion.  But I say that the members of that Party, as supporters of the Government of the day, are in a position of tremendous power.  It would appear to me, from the experience we have had on this motion and other motions, that certain Ministers come in here, taking their tasks lightly, if not indifferently, listen to the debate, merely make a nominal contribution to it and then let the ordinary machinery of the House&mdash;a division&mdash;end the matter.  I suggest to members of the rank and file of the Fianna Fáil Party who shared our views on this occasion that they should make the Minister realise in the councils of their Party that he has a duty to this House, to his Party and to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Minister's approach on this occasion was merely a series of platitudes, the recital of which must have been distinctly offensive to the persons covered by the motion.  He did not attempt to controvert the contention that his administration was responsible for casting out on the roadside 630 lady teachers in 1938&mdash;the lady teachers referred to by Deputy Halliden.  That was all due to his administration because, if the same precautions had been taken in the case of lady teachers as had been taken in the case of the other sex, that crisis would not have arisen.  It arose through redundancy in the service. The obvious course would have been that which was adopted in the other case&mdash;to close the colleges for a year or two years.  Instead, 600 teachers were thrown out of employment, deprived of their earning capacity for periods of from one year to five years and suffered a reduction of their pension. The hardship of that act has been recognised since by the withdrawal of the regulation responsible for this reduction.  That, unfortunately, means nothing to the 600 teachers who are now on a lower rate of pension than <Col N="1131" /> that on which they would otherwise be. As some Deputies have rightly stated, the Minister seems to be playing one set of pensioners off against another. There is a case for better treatment of the old age pensioners.  That case has been made and will be made again.  It has already been turned down in this House.  I do not know if it will fare better on the next occasion.</P>
    <P>As one with experience of public administration in other directions, I know that, in corporations where there are heads of sections, it is expected of the chief of those sections to stand up for his staffs.  The staff in this case, so far as the Minister for Education is concerned, consists of those who are out of employment as well as those who are in employment.  His defence is that he is carrying out his contractual or legal obligations and that his main concern, if there are to be increases, must be with those who are in employment.  The obvious inference from that statement is that the Minister is concerned with those in employment simply because they have a bargaining power because of their work.</P>
    <P>Those who are past their years of work and who have lost that bargaining power are to be thrust aside.  Is that the attitude which has been adopted in another portion of the country?  That was referred to early <Col N="1132" /> in the debate.  The same argument which has been advanced here was put forward in the Belfast House of Commons. Notwithstanding that, the Minister for Finance was subsequently able to introduce proposals substantially to improve the position of the retired teachers.  Has not similar action been taken in the British House of Commons for almost all sections of pensioners, including teachers?  What is wrong here?  Because the amount involved seems high, is it considered good policy for one Minister to say that if he yields in one place, the Government will have to yield all round?  The outstanding feature of this debate is the revelation that the greater number of 3,000 cultured people are on the fringe of want, if not on the border-line of destitution.  It has been admitted on all sides of the House that they are in distress.  By the Minister himself it has been admitted that some of them are in distress. Citizens, particularly citizens who have given good service, who are in distress, have, at least, the right to claim that the causes of their distress be removed.</P>

      <P>Before we proceed with the next business, I want to say that I applied to the Ceann Comhairle for leave to raise on the adjournment certain matters relating to the Board of Works.  I got that permission last Wednesday evening, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce was dealing with the question of flour and the House thought it right that he should be given time to answer the debate, and accordingly I withdrew to allow him to say what he had to say.  The Ceann Comhairle informed me that either last night or to-day I would be afforded an opportunity of raising this matter.  I am now informed that I am not to be allowed to raise it on the adjournment to-day.  I do not think that is right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephHallide" hpid="Mr. Halliden Mr. Halliden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>The agricultural industry is our main industry.  It is the main source of wealth of our people, the great majority of whom are engaged in it.  In spite of that, it has never been raised to the dignity of an industry, with the result that we have many shortages at present&mdash;shortages of milk, butter, bacon, eggs and even bread&mdash;and these shortages seriously affect the health and economic outlook of the whole community.  The object of the motion is to get this industry raised to the status of other industries. When a company or speculators set out to establish an industry, they make an estimate of the cost of building and machinery, investment of capital, wages, and so on, and, in addition to all that, they leave a margin of profit. That initial cost, plus the margin of profit, regulates the price which they put on the manufactured article.</P>
      <P>In the case of the farming industry, the position is quite different.  The farmers have to take what they get. Very often, notwithstanding serious overhead charges, the prices they are to receive are pegged down.  Notwithstanding the services rendered by the farmers to the nation generally, and particularly in emergencies such as we have just gone through, when they extracted the last ounce of food from the soil and did it well, it is obvious that they are not getting a fair deal. The result is that I am afraid there is now what we call a sit-down strike. The farmers are not encouraged to do the work which they are otherwise inclined to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ask that a tribunal should be set up to inquire into the costings of the various products which the farmer produces from his land and that the farmer should get for that produce, not only the cost of production, but also a decent profit which will enable him to work efficiently, employ proper, labour and pay his workers properly, have something for the rainy day and, if needs be, make provision for his family.  A great deal of the work on the farms at present is done by the farmers' own families with very often <Col N="1138" /> little reward.  We know that the sons and daughters work on the land day in and day out with very little compensation for their labour.  When they come to the age of 22 or 23 and they find they are getting very little for their labour, there is nothing open to them but the emigrant ship.  The result is that we are sending out of the country every year 29,000 or 30,000 people to make a living abroad.</P>
    <P>I think that the price of farm produce should be related in some way to current wages and to the overhead charges which the farmer has to bear in order to carry out his work effectively. Since 1914 we find that agricultural workers' wages have risen by 500 per cent., but the prices of the commodities which the farmer produces have not risen by that high percentage. We find also that the price of fertilisers has gone up by leaps and bounds.</P>
    <P>For instance, a few years ago superphosphate could be bought at £3 per ton and is now costing £10.  The price of nitrate of soda and of sulphate of ammonia has doubled or trebled, thus increasing the overhead charges on the farmer.  In the case of milk, we know that the price is pegged down and, from figures produced to us by Professor Murphy of Cork, we know that for years past farmers have been producing milk at a price far below the cost of production.  There has been no appreciable improvement in that connection and we are looking forward to the time when the farmer will be paid a decent wage for the work he is doing.</P>
    <P>I do not want to stress the matter further, because the Minister has already told me that he has on hands proposals for the establishment of such a tribunal as this motion asks for.  He has also given me an assurance that he is going on with that Bill as quickly as he possibly can.  I appreciate that and accept his assurance that he will leave no stone unturned to have the tribunal set up at the earliest possible moment.  I have, however, to make a very serious request to him&mdash;that during the time that tribunal is sitting and producing its findings he will reconsider <Col N="1139" /> the price of milk in the light of the White Paper issued by the Government, which states that the price of milk would be raised or lowered according as the cost of production increased or decreased.  My contention is that the cost of production has gone up very considerably in latter years and that, therefore, the time is ripe for some improvement in the price of milk. I would ask the Minister to investigate the whole matter and not allow the dairying industry to reach a state from which it cannot be resurrected.</P>
    <P>In my portion of the dairying counties dispersal sales of dairy cattle are being held week after week.  I can tell the Minister that a very valuable herd of dairy cattle was sold recently and that those in-calf cows were taken to the canning factories.</P>
    <P>There is also a widespread rumour&mdash;&mdash;of course, rumour can be a lying jade &mdash;that even two-year-old heifers in calf are being taken to these canning factories. That is a matter which I should like the Minister to investigate in order to find out whether it is true or not.  But the dairy herds are being dispersed or reduced in numbers. There is a shortage of milk and butter, and, in that way, the most valuable of all human foods is being denied to the community.  That is why I appeal to the Minister, during the period between now and the issue of the report of the tribunal, to see if anything can be done to encourage farmers and workers to raise the dairying industry to the position which it always enjoyed as the key industry of the country.</P>
    <P>We were glad to notice in the public Press to-day that the Minister has decided to restore the issue of fertiliser vouchers for the wheat crop, which is tantamount to an increase of 2/6 a barrel for wheat.  I am afraid, however, that that is not sufficient, because I know from experience that, while six or seven years ago we could produce perhaps a ton or more of wheat to the acre, we find now, for want of fertilisers and owing to the depreciation of the soil, that that yield is <Col N="1140" /> practically reduced by half.  Consequently, I think that the price of wheat at present is not attractive enough. In appealing to the Minister for an increase in the price of wheat, as well as in the price of milk in the interim period, I think I am voicing the views of the great majority of farmers who are anxious and willing to help in every way they possibly can.  I say that they need encouragement, that they need something for their time, something to meet the extra cost of living and to compensate them for their overhead charges.  I feel that I am pushing an open door and I have great confidence that the Minister will do his best to make the position what it ought to be and to raise our great industry to the status of other progressive industries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I am aware that Deputy Corry's motion is now being taken as an amendment. I have no serious fault to find with that amendment.  There is another amendment standing in the name of Deputy Heskin requesting that pending the result of this inquiry the price of wheat be increased to £3 per barrel.  That is a very moderate request, a very reasonable one, having regard to the enormous increase in the cost of production. I appreciate that the Minister has gone some distance to meet the demand made in this amendment but it would have been a more generous gesture on the part of the Minister to have conceded the entire demand, which was reduced to the most moderate dimensions.  There is only a difference of half-a-crown between the demand contained in the amendment and the present offer of the Minister. We farmers are not in the habit of haggling about sums of that kind and I do not believe any farmer will hesitate to grow the maximum amount of wheat possible, irrespective of whether the demand is granted or not.  Farmers will realise the national need and will rise to meet it, regardless of whether the price of wheat is increased or not. But taking a long-term view of agriculture I think it would be better if the Minister paid more for wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion demands that a tribunal <Col N="1141" /> be set up to inquire into the costs of production of farm produce.  It goes further.  It asks that that inquiry be made for the purpose of ensuring that farmers will get an economic price for their produce.  We have been told that the Minister intends to introduce a Bill for the purpose of setting up machinery to investigate farm costings.  We should be told a little more.  We should be told whether it is definitely the policy of the Government, having ascertained the cost of production, to ensure that the farmer will be paid that cost and perhaps a small margin of profit.</P>
    <P>That is the point on which we want definite assurance from the Minister. Does he merely intend setting up this tribunal, spending a certain amount of money on investigating farm costings and pigeon-holding the statistics ascertained in his Department for the information of future generations and the guidance of future commissions of inquiry?  That is not the object we have in view.  That is not what is required.</P>
    <P>Agriculture passed through a very difficult period, from 1920 until the outbreak of the war, not because of any difficulty in regard to production but because of great difficulty in finding a favourable market.  Since the outbreak of war, agriculture has been through a very difficult period, not so much because there was no market, but because the problems and difficulties of production were intensified one-hundredfold. We trust the world crisis in food supplies will pass in the course of a year or two.  Will agriculture in Ireland then face the same crisis as it had to face after the first world war?  Will farmers be compelled to hawk their produce from market to market, and find it spurned and despised and unsaleable?  We must guard against that.</P>
    <P>I am not expressing any view that I have not expressed in the past. Since I came into this House, in 1938, I have asserted repeatedly that it is the duty of the State to ensure that the farmer gets a reasonable price for his produce.  That has been denied in many parts of the House.  We have been told that the obligation does not <Col N="1142" /> rest on the State, that the State has nothing to do with the fixing of prices for primary produce, that it is purely a matter governed by the law of supply and demand.  I believe the majority of this House, the majority of the people of this country and even the majority of the people of the world are coming around to the viewpoint that the remuneration of those engaged in primary production should not be left to the law of supply and demand, should not be left to chance and, perhaps, to the manipulation of speculators who, without producing anything, would seek to control the remuneration of the primary producer.</P>
    <P>Now a step is being taken in the right direction.  The Minister has stated that at least he will investigate costs of production.  That is a valuable step forward.  When farmers' associations, individual farmers, farmer Deputies make demands for fair prices for their produce, for increases in the price of various products, they are frequently told that they are already getting a fair price, and that they ought to be able to derive a good profit out of the prices they are getting.</P>
    <P>If the farmers put up figures in regard to the cost of production, they are told that these figures are not official, that these figures are one-sided, that they are only the farmers' figures and do not carry any weight.  But, if the Government, on behalf of the community, investigate the cost of production; if the Government set up machinery to ascertain what it costs to produce potatoes, wheat, oats, a gallon of milk or a store beast, then we shall have figures which are at least official; we shall have figures which must be regarded as not being one-sided, at any rate.  On those figures we can decide whether the farmer is making a reasonable or an extravagant demand for what he produces.  That step, once taken, will end for all time the frequent assertions that the farmer is battening on the rest of the community, holding the rest of the community up to ransom and making excessive demands.  The cost of production will be published in regard to every item, or at least all the main items, of agricultural produce. <Col N="1143" /> The public can see what it costs the farmer to produce and what profit he derives.</P>
    <P>That is a valuable step forward, but it is not a new step.  In the first world war the British Government set up machinery to investigate costings in agriculture and they made very useful surveys over a very wide number of farms.  But, when the war was over, when agricultural prices began to collapse, and when our own Government saw that it would be very difficult to do anything about the matter, they dropped their machinery for investigating costings.  If that machinery had continued in operation during the 20 years between the two wars, it would have revealed an appalling condition as far as those engaged in agriculture are concerned&mdash;an appalling condition in regard to the margin of loss which they had to suffer trying to feed the nation.</P>
    <P>However, the powers that be decided that agricultural costings should not be continued and no machinery was maintained to ascertain them, with the result that farmers had to make their claims as best they could and, seeing how they were misrepresented, they possibly had occasionally to exaggerate their claims.  That condition will, I hope, be brought to an end.  It is a welcome sign to see that one big industry, the sugar manufacturing industry, has decided, in co-operation with the representatives of the growers, thoroughly to investigate costings.  The experience which they will gain and the investigations they will make will be of immense value to the Department of Agriculture in the work which they propose to undertake to implement the terms of this motion.</P>
    <P>I hope we will not be disappointed when the Minister intervenes.  I hope he will not tell us that it is his intention merely to make an investigation and that nothing further will be done. If that is the sole intention of the proposed legislation, it will be a mere waste of money and of time to a very large extent.  It is inevitable that world production will increase in the post-war period.  It is inevitable that that increase will have an effect upon <Col N="1144" /> agricultural prices and, unless the primary producer here is protected by the State, it may happen that he will be forced back to the conditions under which he had to labour during the period between the wars.</P>
    <P>I think public opinion is, to a very great extent, being prepared to condone a serious reduction in agricultural prices generally, because we have it asserted from a thousand platforms and from a thousand organs of opinion&mdash; pamphlets and newspapers&mdash;that the farmer has done remarkably well out of the war, and an attempt will be made to convince people that if he gets into a bad period it will be his due, as some recompense for the good times he enjoyed while the war was on.</P>
    <P>I wish the House to consider what these good times amounted to.  The national income is estimated at £250,000,000.  Of that amount the agricultural income is estimated at about £88,000,000.  About half the population are engaged in agriculture.  Divide between them that £88,000,000.  Divide between the other half, not engaged in agriculture, £163,000,000.  You will see that the half not engaged in agriculture enjoy an average income twice that received by those who are so engaged.</P>
    <P>That is a fundamental fact, an incontrovertible fact.  It is a fact which is borne out by the anxiety of every farmer to get his sons into some occupation other than farming, to get them away to business or some other job.  It is borne out by the anxiety of the young people themselves to get away from the farm even when the farmer tries to keep them.  It is borne out by the very remarkable fact that you hardly ever hear of a farmer dying and leaving a large legacy to distant relatives or for any charitable purpose.  He is lucky if, when he comes to die, he has sufficient capital accumulated to pay his funeral expenses.  On the other hand, we read in the papers of large sums being left by people engaged in commerce, in the professions and in other walks of life&mdash;by everybody except the farmer.  That, of course, could not be otherwise when we consider the low average income of those engaged in agriculture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" /> It is said that our position has improved enormously.  Has it?  Prices of agricultural produce are from 100 to 120 per cent. higher than they were in 1914.  How much higher are the costs of production?  We have no official figures, but we know that wages alone are 300 per cent. higher than in 1914.  That is a very significant figure. The farm worker in 1914 was compelled to live on a wage which was one-fourth of the wage paid the average agricultural worker to-day.  No one will object to the wages paid to the agricultural workers at present.  They are not high wages and they compare very unfavourably with the wages paid to people in other occupations, but they also create a difficulty when we compare the wage increases with the increases in prices since 1914.  They create a problem for the farmer which only the Institute of Cosmic Physics could solve, namely, how a farmer with costs of production increased by 200 per cent. can make a profit in view of the fact that prices are up by only 120 per cent.  The Institute of Higher Studies could worry over that problem for some time and might possibly arrive at a solution which nobody but themselves could understand.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind the fact that we cannot revert to the conditions which prevailed before the war.  We cannot allow our national economy to go back to those conditions.  Things have changed and they cannot be unchanged.  We have two policies which we can consider in regard to agricultural prices.  We could adopt one method and leave these prices to be fixed by the ordinary laws of supply and demand, let the price of every commodity find its level, but if you are going to adopt that policy you will be forced to repeal certain legislation. You will be forced to repeal the Agricultural Wages Act and allow the wages of agricultural workers to be governed also by the laws of supply and demand.  Does anyone contemplate, taking such a step?</P>
    <P>I believe we cannot put back the hands of the clock.  A revolutionary advance was made when the wages of the agricultural worker were fixed.  To <Col N="1146" /> follow that legislation to its logical conclusion, you must fix the remuneration of the farmer.  You cannot, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce pointed out, take five naggins out of a pint pot.  You cannot take more from the farmer than he is able to earn as a result of the prices which he obtains. Therefore, having fixed the remuneration of his employee on the land, you must follow that step to its logical conclusion and ensure that the farmer is placed in a position to pay such wages. I am not going to suggest in detail how this should be done but it must be done.  There are of course two ways by which it can be done.  The State itself here can do it or it may be achieved by international co-operation. Steps are being taken by agricultural organisations throughout the world to ensure that the remuneration of the primary producer shall not again be seriously reduced.  Those steps may or may not be successful but whatever is done, it is the duty of the State here to secure that the primary producer is protected from the storms which may sweep over the world as far as the price of agricultural produce is concerned. We all know that the main causes of serious depression in agricultural prices all over the world are the fluctuations in the world output of grain.  Some steps may be taken internationally to control the distribution of output and these steps may have a very important bearing upon agriculture.  Whether that is done or not, the home Government has a duty to the primary producer and that is to see that he is amply rewarded.</P>
    <P>There are people who give expression to foolish platitudes on this question.  They say that this is a country whose economy is based on agriculture and that because of that the State can do nothing for agriculture, because if any increase is allowed in the price of agricultural produce or any help is given to the agricultural community, it merely means subsidising agriculture at its own expense or, in other words, feeding the dog on its own tail.  It is time to get away from that mentality.</P>
    <P>There are in this country two sets of people, those engaged in agriculture <Col N="1147" /> and those not engaged in agriculture. The people engaged in agriculture at present enjoy an income which is half that of those not engaged in agriculture. Surely it is not feeding the dog on its own tail if the people not engaged on agriculture make some contribution towards levelling up the price of agricultural produce so that the farmer and the agricultural worker will obtain 50 per cent. of the national income?  Since there are 50 per cent. of the population engaged on agriculture, that is not unreasonable.  It might be said that this would lead to a lowering of the conditions of those not engaged in agriculture.  That does not follow.  The guaranteeing of a just remuneration to the former will inevitably have the effect of increasing agricultural production.  An increase in agricultural efficiency will increase the standard of living for all sections of the community. That is a consideration that must be borne in mind.  It is suggested that farmers are trying to better themselves at the expense of the rest of the community.  The whole community can enjoy better conditions, provided the farmers are given the opportunity and the encouragement to increase output. I should be glad to hear the Minister deal with that aspect of the question when replying.  No doubt he will give us some outline of the machinery that he intends to set up to investigate costings.  It is desirable that, as the new Minister for Agriculture, he should give the House some outline of his views in regard to the right of the farmer to fair prices based on his costings. It is the duty of the State to see that the farmer gets that.</P>

      <P>What I am afraid of is that somebody might think that what is proposed in Deputy Halliden's motion is what is required by the farming <Col N="1150" /> community.  On behalf of the farming community, I am thankful for every convert that I make to the point of view that the farmer is entitled to his costs of production, plus a profit, and that the agricultural community should be treated on exactly the same lines as every other industry, namely, that we are going to have a tribunal set up before which the agricultural community can go.  The difference between Deputy Halliden's motion and mine is this: Deputy Halliden has some idea with regard to a tribunal or commission that would take evidence and then make a report&mdash;something like the Post-War Commission on Agricultural Policy about which nobody could agree, or the proposed arbitration court on beet some years ago.  In that case, the few professors and hobby farmers called in said: &ldquo;Oh! It is quite all right.&rdquo;  I want none of that.  I want a tribunal set up before which the agricultural community can give proof with regard to their costings, and from which they will get the costs of production plus a profit.  I want a permanent tribunal.  Deputy Halliden wants a tribunal of some sort that will make a report.</P>

      <P>There is the saying that hell is paved with good intentions. We have Deputies rushing in with half-baked motions.  They want to cash-in to-day on things to which they gave very reluctant support in other days.  Our first job when the Government came into office and decided to help Irish industry was to see that the agricultural industry, which was entitled to the full home market, got that market.  We secured that, despite all the shouts and noise which was made for Australian bacon, Chinese eggs, and all the rest.  Our next job is to see that the agricultural industry &mdash;the greatest industry in the country &mdash;is treated on the same lines as every other industry.  I first expressed those views in the House on the 17th May, 1945.  Right along from that period.  I had to carry on my campaign. I welcome with open arms <Col N="1151" /> those who now see my point of view and who support it.  On the 18th May, 1945, speaking on the Vote for the Department of Agriculture, I related my experience in the following words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I had a rather amusing experience about a month ago in that connection. Some constituents of mine asked me to go with them to the Department of Supplies.  They are milk retailers in Cork City and they were looking for a larger margin.  I went with them, they put up a case and I thought the situation was rather funny.  Those men, who filled the gap between the producer and consumer, could go to the Department to get an increase of their margin; they could go in and put up their case giving their costings. I was in the position that I was one of the producers of the milk that they were selling and yet I possessed no right to go before any tribunal, or any other board, to have a price fixed on my costings, plus profit.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was the distinction which was made between the manufacturing end and the middleman end of Irish industry and the primary producer in our greatest industry&mdash;agriculture.  I have kept on the fight.  That was on the 18th May, 1945.  I have searched the records of this House as well as I could to find out when I first got the support of my friends.  I find that, on the 23rd May, 1945, Deputy Halliden, speaking, I presume, on behalf of his Party, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When we put up the demand that the price should be increased to 1/- per gallon for milk all the year round, we were told `The price we are paying meets the cost of production.' We think it does not meet the cost of production and that, instead of the Department asking us to produce our costings, the Department should produce their costings.  Therefore, I support Deputy Corry's proposal that we should have a costings board so that we would know exactly what it cost the farmer to produce a particular commodity.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1152" /> That was the first time I obtained support from my friends in this House. There is a wide difference between asking the Government to come and find costings and what I want done. When I first got a guarantee from the then Minister for Agriculture, Dr. Ryan, at the end of 1945, that this tribunal would be set up, I immediately set about putting our house in order. Last September, we reviewed the position of farmers supplying milk to Cork City and commenced to prepare official costings which would give us the cost of production of winter milk. Next May, we shall be able to give guaranteed figures to the Minister for Agriculture regarding the cost of production of winter milk and we shall be able to go before his tribunal.  Meantime, I headed a deputation to the then Minister for Agriculture, Dr. Ryan, regarding our position.  We had taken what I may call unofficial costings before then.  We took them over to the Department and Mr. Breen said: &ldquo;You produce more milk than that,&rdquo; and turned them down.  We are getting something now that he cannot turn down.  On our costings, we succeeded in getting an increase of 2d. per gallon.  When we finish with our costings next May, the increase will be somewhere between 8d. and 1/- per gallon.</P>
    <P>I found the same position in regard to the production of sugar.  The price of beet was fixed in 1943.  Various Bills were brought into the Dáil since then which completely changed the aspect of affairs so far as the production of beet was concerned.  On the 28th May, 1946, on the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce, I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Some few years ago a Bill was passed here giving a fortnight's holidays to industrial workers.  All the boys came to the Department a few weeks afterwards showing the cost to them and that was quietly passed on to the fellow who cannot pass it on to anyone else, the individual farmer.  At present, when you buy a half ton of artificial manure, you have to pay for the bonus and the holidays for Goulding's <Col N="1153" /> workers and for the railway workers as well.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The farmer has to pay all these charges, but he cannot pass them on. His price was fixed in 1943, before those proposals were brought before the House.  We were then left in the lurch.  However, we succeeded this year in getting a joint board set up between the Irish Sugar Company and the Beet-Growers' Association which will go fully into the cost of production of beet.  These costings can be laid before the Minister's tribunal when it comes to operate and we can get our cost of production plus a profit.</P>
    <P>At present we have the amazing situation in an agricultural country that butter is rationed, sugar is rationed, bread is rationed and milk is practically rationed.  I say, with all respect to the Ceann Comhairle, that none of them should be rationed, that none of them need be rationed and that none of them would be rationed had the farmers been treated in the same way as other industrialists and allowed their cost of production, plus profit.  No man is going to grow a crop at a loss. The greatest outrage you can do a man is to compel him to produce an article at a loss.  That is what is being done at present as regards wheat.  The primary duty of agriculture is to produce sufficient bread for the people of the country.  I regard that as the first duty of agriculture.  Rightly or wrongly, the Government brought in a compulsory wheat-growing scheme under which every man is required to put a certain proportion of his land under wheat.  The Government does not know what it costs to produce an acre of wheat.  There is a very wide margin between the farmer with poor land who will get from four to five barrels of wheat per acre and the farmer who will get a ton to the acre. If you are to compel the farmer who will get only four or five barrels to the acre to put a certain amount of his land under wheat, you must pay him the cost of production, plus a profit.</P>
    <P>Nobody in his senses will say that it is fair to go to the farmer who can get only four and a half or five barrels of wheat out of an acre of ground and say: &ldquo;You will have to put five or six <Col N="1154" /> acres of that ground under wheat, at a price fixed at random by the Department of Industry and Commerce plus the Department of Agriculture&rdquo;.  It is unjust and wrong; it is something no one would dare do with any other industry.  Something like 25 per cent. of our wheat last year was grown by farmers who grew over the quota, on good wheat land where they were getting eight to ten barrels and more. Farmers getting about eight barrels went out of their way to grow it. Maybe it was on national grounds, in order to supply the people with bread, and they saw it was their duty. The price was fixed in 1943 and there have been many changes since then. Agricultural wages have gone up; the price of artificial manures has gone up; the price of farm machinery has gone up 150 per cent., but the price of wheat still remains as of old.  That is why I want a permanent tribunal set up, before which the farmers can go. There can be a notification that the beet growers are going before them this year on account of the increase in so-and-so, or that representatives of the Wheat-Growers' Association are going before them in connection with the price of wheat; and that tribunal, after examining the costings and finding that prices have gone up or down, may recommend to the Minister that the price be increased or lowered. That is what is wanted, and I am very glad we have got that guarantee from the Minister.</P>

      <P>&mdash;since 1943, or since 1939, when the emergency was first declared, I was completely at sea this year as to what the Government's requirements were regarding wheat.  There were plenty of nationally-minded farmers who did not know what was wanted either. What did the Government do?  They reduced the price of wheat by £1 per ton, as the 2/6 a barrel in manure vouchers was taken off.  There was something else besides.  They increased the price of barley by 50/- a ton.  That made men like myself think it was not wheat the Government wanted but barley and made us decide to give them barley.</P>

I am not dealing with prices here, there and elsewhere, on the black market or otherwise, but with the prices laid down by the Government for certain commodities.  They have withdrawn the manure vouchers of 2/6 a barrel, thereby reducing the price of wheat by £1 a ton.  I am glad to see that the representations which I have been making to the Minister have already been successful, and I see in this morning's paper that we are getting back the vouchers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was always behind, but that is not our fault.  I am very much afraid that the situation will lead, not to an increased acreage, but to a reduced acreage of wheat this year.  That is something we cannot afford.  I say frankly that, even with the extra half-crown, the price of wheat to the majority of farmers who have to grow it is very definitely an uneconomic one. If the Government requires bread for the people, the Government must be prepared to pay the cost of production, plus a profit.  There is no reason why we should be treated in any different way from the Cork Milling Company or the Mill Owners' Association.</P>
      <P>The earliest we can expect this new Bill to become law is about April or May next.  In the meantime, the farmers are compulsorily sowing wheat this week and will be sowing it next week&mdash;every day they can get.  I ask the Minister if he is satisfied that he is going to get a sufficient acreage of wheat grown this year to render bread rationing unnecessary next winter.  If not, why not?  That is the kernel of the whole situation.  There is no other means of approaching it. The people want bread; the farmers are prepared to supply that bread, on one condition, and it is a fair condition, that they be treated the same as every other Irish industry and that they get the cost of producing that wheat, plus a profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1157" /> I have gone very carefully into the figures.  I have taken 12½ acres of ground which I have been preparing for wheat this year.  Next harvest, when I finish with that 12½ acres, it will have cost me somewhere around £250, between ploughing, harrowing, liming, manuring, seeding and harvesting. If I get a ton to the acre, I will get £270, that is, £20 profit on 12½ acres.  How many farmers last year got a ton to the acre?  How many farmers got four barrels to the acre? Is it right, therefore, that the agricultural community should be asked to put 400,000 acres under wheat to be grown at a loss?</P>
    <P>That is the question the Minister must ask himself, and, from my knowledge of him, he is not a man to be led away by anybody.  He will come to his own conclusions, and I hope that the day when the Minister's advisers, as we used to call them, possessed so much power is gone.  The Minister will come to his own conclusions, and, in his own hard-headed way, fight the thing out and make his decision, but I say here definitely that in an agricultural country like this the scarcity of milk in the cities, the rationing of butter, sugar and of bread should not exist, need not exist and would not exist if the principle which is now being accepted in relation to setting up a tribunal to examine agricultural costings had been in operation since I first asked for it in May, 1942.  We would have no rationing of bread to-day in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>I do not say that because I want to say: &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;.  I say it as one who regrets every day seeing somebody going short of an essential article of food, and these are essential articles of food.  We have got the Minister's assurance and I ask him, as the responsible Minister, closely to examine the cost of production of wheat.  He is compelling every farmer to grow a certain acreage of wheat, and, when the Government compels anybody to produce an article, they need to make very certain that that article will give the man who is compelled to produce it his cost of production, plus a profit. <Col N="1158" /> I submit that the present price of wheat very definitely does not do that.</P>
    <P>I was glad, as I say, to read in the morning's newspapers that the foolish step taken by the Department of withdrawing the manure vouchers this year and reducing the price of wheat by £1 per ton has been withdrawn.  I am glad that has been done, but, at the same time, I did not expect, and I do not think anybody in the country who went through the emergency without seeing bread rationing, expected to see bread rationing this year.  We all know the kind of harvest we had.  Does the Minister think it a wise step, after that kind of harvest, after the losses the agricultural community had to suffer as a result of that harvest, to reduce the price of wheat for the coming year? These are the matters I am anxious the Minister should deal with.</P>
    <P>The same position prevails with regard to milk.  Certain areas have been fixed for the supply of milk to Dublin, Cork and other cities.  These areas are not supplying that milk. Why?  Because 25 per cent. of the farmers who kept cows have gone out of them, owing to the uneconomic price fixed by the Department of Industry and Commerce for milk, the completely uneconomic price for winter milk, and owing to the policy of the Department of Agriculture for the past 20 years of producing beef rather than milk.  It is well to remember in these days a wise saying.  I remember the first year we took over here as a Government in 1932, seeing the late Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Patrick Hogan, God rest his soul, standing up here and saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is one warning I want to give my successor in office.  If the Live-stock Breeding Act is worked as it has been worked in past years under my control, we will have very fine looking cattle in this country, but it will be impossible to get a cow that will give a decent bucket of milk.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a bit, because these are the things that count in the cost of production of milk.  If you breed to <Col N="1159" /> get the hind leg for beef and the middle for milk, as the Department of Agriculture have been doing for the past 20 years, you will not be paying 1/- a gallon for milk but 10/- a gallon, because the old cow will not milk a quart.  That is what is wrong.  These are the things we have to thresh out and consider.  I can assure the Minister that the organisations with which I have the honour to be associated will be ready with their costings as quickly as possible.  We will be prepared to lay our costings before this tribunal as soon as it is established.  In the meantime, I ask the Minister to deal with these two problems as urgent ones which cannot wait for the tribunal's findings.  If the Minister waits for the findings of the tribunal with regard to the price of wheat, it will be no good for a farmer to know next May that he is to get 10/- per barrel more for his wheat, because he cannot sow the wheat then.  Now is the time for the Minister to decide, not next May.  It is already nearly too late for a decision. If the people are to be supplied with bread next winter, the Minister must make a decision now.  He must take a bold step in order to ensure that there will be sufficient bread for the people next winter.  There is only one way to get that, and that is to pay the people who are compelled by law to produce the wheat the cost of production, plus a profit.  As I said, he is losing the 25 per cent. over the quota which some people used to grow.  They were people who were getting eight to ten barrels an acre and that is a severe loss.  I appeal to the Minister to do his duty in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry reflected <Col N="1160" /> very much on Deputy Halliden's and Deputy Cogan's motion.  He described it as a half-baked motion.  The same description could be applied to his motion.  It is possibly half-roasted instead of half-baked.  I would not be satisfied with this sort of thing.  I believe that what Deputy Corry will get is a Civil Service tribunal which will put him on the spot and give the Government an excuse for saying: &ldquo;There is your price.  You gave your evidence, you had your tribunal, and that is all about it.&rdquo;  If I were putting down a motion like that I certainly would make some attempt to prescribe the sort of tribunal I wanted.  I would want a tribunal independent of the Civil Service and Government control.  I would not want the Minister whispering to the personnel of the tribunal that he wanted such-and-such a price fixed.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Corry wants machinery of this sort and wants to reflect on the attempt of other Deputies to make a suggestion as to the type of machinery that might be provided, and if he feels he has completed the picture in his motion, I am afraid I am not in a position to compliment him.  He talked about the average cost of production and compared the average cost of production with what the industrial people in this country are getting.  He seems to forget that the millers are guaranteed a profit of 6 per cent., based on the working of mills in the most remote and inconvenient parts of the country; not mills near a port, but those placed in the worst position from the point of view of milling and securing supplies.  The Deputy accepts that for the millers, but he wants the average cost of production for the farmer.  He is not worried about the farmer working under adverse conditions on a mountainside or on poor thin soil, possibly highly acid, which it would take more than the skill of Deputy Corry to get anything like average results from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry should be a little more realistic about this.  He talked about four barrels to the acre.  Surely the consuming public cannot be expected to pay what may appear to be an <Col N="1161" /> economic price to the individual who can only get four barrels to the acre. The man who only gets four barrels to the acre must turn to something else, to something more economically suitable. There is no use in saying that we can grow large areas of wheat in this country regardless of cost.  The consumer must have a say in the matter and we must have some regard to that if we are to have security.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Ask Deputy Corry what he grows.  I do not know anything about that.  He will probably give you some useful information. There is a great deal of talk in Great Britain at present about this whole matter.  As a matter of fact, the primary producers of the world are concerned about security and stability to which they are entitled.  There is a new concept in the world in that respect.  There is an Agriculture Bill before the British House of Commons dealing with the whole matter of security and stability and an attempt is being made during the emergency to provide a fair margin for primary producers in Great Britain.  It has produced results; it has encouraged production and has stepped up production by 70 per cent.  According to the Budget statement, our production fell by 10 per cent.  Machinery has been in operation in Great Britain.  The National Farmers' Union have been producing costings and the methods adopted there for the fixation of guaranteed prices is by consultation between the National Farmers' Union and the Minister of Agriculture.  Can anyone believe that the sort of machinery suggested in this motion will be effective and that you will get satisfactory and acceptable results from it?  Will the majority of Deputies listening to me agree that, in the last analysis, you will find that, having set up that machinery, it will be all fixed by haggling in the end?  The problem is very difficult and highly complex.  It is not nearly as simple as Deputy Corry feels it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy adverted to the joint machinery set up by the Beet-Growers' <Col N="1162" /> Association and Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.  I am not at all enamoured of that.  I think it is a highly complex problem.  It is almost impossible to segregate the activities of farmers and to cost each one.  Costings must be kept over the whole phase of their activities.  For instance, it is almost impossible to cost a horse in relation to a particular crop.  It must be on the basis of cost over the entire year, cost of his food, capital cost, depreciation and replacement, the number of wet days on which he was standing idle in relation to the various crops, and so on.  Weather conditions and good and bad seasons must be taken into account.  The costings must cover a period of years to produce anything like average results.  The cost must be found in relation to the individual, the group of farmers he falls into, whether he is in the category of farmers of 1 to 20 acres, 20 to 50, 50 to 100, 100 to 150, and so on.  That has a considerable bearing on production. It must be considered whether his circumstances are such as to produce the most economic results; whether his holding is just big enough to maintain two horses and to engage them all the time and not to have them standing idle on a fine day when they ought to be working.  The type of soil the man is working will have a profound effect on the results of his activities.</P>
    <P>It is well that our attention should be directed to this whole matter.  The attention of the world has been directed to it.  The Hot Springs Conference was the first international assembly to deal with this matter.  Possibly they read something about Deputy Corry's activities here.  I do not know, but they did get the idea.</P>

      <P>He does not like the medicine.  I have the greatest sympathy in the world with the unfortunate people of this country who are compelled to grow crops that are absolutely unsuited to the conditions of their holdings.  There has been no scientific application to this problem and the voice of the few agricultural <Col N="1164" /> scientists that we have is stifled and their advice has not been listened to. To be strictly fair, I must admit that yesterday, when he was addressing a food conference, the Minister gave way to some extent and inspectors are going to get a little more discretion. It is unfortunate, however, that the primary producers in this country have to accept civil servants walking into their yards, with discretionary power to say whether they should sow wheat in a certain field or not.  In the tribunal that Deputy Corry is boasting about, those factors are completely overlooked.  Soil and weather conditions which must affect the farmer's economy are completely overlooked. Deputy Corry apparently wants to regiment our people and, having regimented them, and having Civil Service control, we will have a tribunal of civil servants that will put the agricultural community on the spot. The price will be fixed by that tribunal and you cannot be critical any longer because you will be told, &ldquo;There is the tribunal.&rdquo;  If there is to be any machinery of that sort, the House ought to insist that an independent tribunal is set up, that it will not be a civil servants' tribunal.</P>

      <P>I have referred to the Hot Springs Conference and to the resolution that emanated therefrom. It simply said that the people of the world should be fed, that that was the right road to happiness, that huge nutritional problems in the world would have to be tackled; that the capacity of the world was sufficient to meet human requirements; that, in the words of Sir John Orr, farming should be married to nutrition; that that could only be done by ensuring, so far as the primary producers of the world are concerned, that they would get a fair margin of profit and were not forced to destroy nature and thereby cause the erosion that has occurred in many countries because of depressed conditions; that nature had to be repaid for what she gave; and that it was the duty of statesmen to <Col N="1165" /> ensure that the erosion that has been taking place for many years is stopped, because the acreage of the arable lands of the world is rapidly reducing.</P>
      <P>I have felt for a long time that the whole problem of fair prices and reasonable margins for the primary producer cannot be solved in one country alone, independently.  You cannot solve in Ireland the conditions that obtain in other countries. Markets in other countries inevitably affect and have repercussions in not merely the particular country but the world.  If we want to solve this question and to ensure that the primary producer will in future be in a better position than he has been in the past, we must collaborate with other nations.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Government decided to join F.A.O. and that they attended a meeting last summer at Copenhagen but I am not satisfied inasmuch as they sent a delegations of civil servants. If we attend F.A.O. in future we ought to send people who can speak for the primary industry, people who have a real, practical knowledge of the conditions in the primary industry in this country and who can tender advice on their experience as practicable farmers.  It should not be impossible to find men in this country capable of speaking on behalf of the primary producers at such a conference. It is to be regretted that we started off by sending a delegation of civil servants.  I am not reflecting on the ability of the civil servants who were sent but I do suggest that it is not their job, that it is the job of the primary producers and that they should be properly represented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>On Wednesday last I addressed a question to the Minister for Agriculture in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Agriculture if he will state: (a) whether any of the continental countries now purchasing cattle here have indicated their intention of making imports of Irish cattle a permanent feature of their economy; (b) to what extent the present continental trade is likely to become permanent; and (c) whether any discussions took place, at any time, between the British Ministry of Agriculture and his Department regarding the question of live-stock exports to the Continent, the resultant reduction in exports of forward stores to Britain, its effect on British live-stock economy and on the future of our live-stock trade with Britain.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That question was tabled before a statement was made by the chairman of the Cattle Traders' Association, which aroused a good deal of public interest in the last few days.  I do not agree with the statement made by the chairman of that organisation.  I do not object to this country sending a gift to the Continent to help the distressed people there.  I think we should feel there is an obligation on us to do everything we can do in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as exports recently were concerned, as a farmer I welcome any competition that is there.  God knows, the people who feed cattle over the winter have rarely got a margin of profit out of it.  They were more interested in producing good farmyard manure, and it is only occasionally, if they were interested in costings, that they would discover they had a margin over and above what that particular residue was worth.  I am particularly interested in competition.  It is a stimulus to production.  But the competition to be sound and healthy ought to be of a permanent nature.  We talk a lot about stability and we ought to have stability in our agricultural policy.  The necessary prerequisite to increased <Col N="1170" /> production in an expanding economy is a secure market.  The Minister's reply to my question was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As regards the first and second parts of the question, exports of cattle to continental countries are arranged seasonally through the diplomatic or consular representatives in Ireland of the countries concerned and no long-term arrangements for export have been made.  I cannot predict the extent to which this trade may continue in the future.  As regards the last part of the question, no discussions of the kind referred to by the Deputy took place between the British Ministry of Agriculture and my Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It appears to me, from that reply, that the Minister and the Department are not concerned with a long-term view of this question of marketing and at this particular stage I think it is of the utmost importance that we should clearly understand what the position is likely to be in the next few years.  It is pretty fashionable that we should do that.</P>
    <P>Most other countries are making long-term trade deals to ensure that their future markets are assured.  As a matter of fact, Holland recently made an announcement about her economic position and probable development. There is an indication of what they have been doing to re-establish different industries.  It is indicated that within 12 months their steel industries will be all right and in three years their agriculture will be all right. We know that Canada has made a long-term deal on wheat for the next four years and that they accepted a lower price on the four years' deal than they would get in a free market for wheat.  We know the Argentine Government is concluding negotiations with Great Britain for a long-term trade deal on meat.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply clearly indicates that we are not concerned with long-term deals of any sort.  We are simply availing of the opportunities that are there at the moment, owing to the shortage of meat all over Europe.  It is true that the primary producer is getting the benefit and cattle fed this winter are leaving reasonable margins <Col N="1171" /> of profit.  We have sent something like 23,000 cattle to the Continent in recent months and it is proposed to can 25,000 animals to be sent as a gift to the Continent.  It has been suggested by the cattle traders that it is unwise to do that.  I feel myself that if the activities of the canners are confined to a particular type of animal, they may be very helpful to the small farmers of the west and in the Border counties to produce a type of animal that is not suitable for the forward store trade of Great Britain.  The canning of these animals will help the people who have been receiving poor prices for cattle which had to go to the British Minister of Food.  An attempt was made to obtain an increased price for the small quantity of beef that we sent to the British Ministry of Food&mdash;we sent something like 14,000 animals last year&mdash;and it was increased by 1d. per lb.  The British Minister of Food in reply to a question in the British House of Commons said that it was only second-class meat.  I felt at the time that if it was second-class meat, he was offering us a third-class price.  The canning of these animals, I feel, enables the people who produce that type of animal to get a decent price for their beef.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I do not think any damage has been done so far by the taking of these animals for the Continent, but if the Minister is satisfied that there is no future in the continental trade&mdash;and it appears to me that there is no future&mdash;we want to be assured that whatever animals may be taken for the Continent in the next two or three years will not have any injurious effects on the future of our live-stock trade with Britain.  I want to make it clear that there is a very large number of farmers in Britain who have based their live-stock economy on Irish stores and who swear by them.  They felt that the Irish store was the very finest in the world to buy, cattle up to 11½ cwt. or 12 cwt. when leaving this country. The English farmers were prepared to carry these up to the peak of the market and, incidentally, to hold them for the minimum period to qualify for <Col N="1172" /> a subsidy.  It does not follow that they took a big margin because the competition in recent years for animals of that type, particularly from Norfolk, has been very keen.  It would be a pity if the men who believed in that economy were forced away from Irish stores.  If that happened, they might be forced to adopt a different policy and to breed their own cattle.  If they once bred their own cattle, and if in three or four years the continental trade disappeared, they might not be prepared to switch back to Irish cattle again.</P>
    <P>It is true that at present most British farmers are reluctant to raise young cattle because the price of milk is very attractive and the demand for liquid milk is so big that they prefer to sell milk for human consumption.  Our people here are not in that position. The demand for milk is not so great in many areas and our farmers must direct their attention to live-stock production and the rearing of animals.  I have always felt that that situation gave this country a golden opportunity of integrating our live-stock conditions here with the live-stock conditions existing on the other side, remembering the good name which Irish stores have in Great Britain.  We must remember that over a year ago the British Department of Agriculture were switching the agricultural community over to live-stock production.  They felt that the cereal problem was over but their anticipations were rather premature. The cereal difficulty was not over and they had to switch back to wheat again last year.  I believe that the cereal problem will be cleared up after the next world harvest and that you will see Great Britain again devoting all its agricultural efforts towards live-stock production.  They appreciate that the world has always been very short of protective foods of a high value and that their climatic and soil conditions equipped them in a special way for the production of protective foods. We have the same conditions prevailing here.  Notwithstanding artificial intervention by particular Parties or particular Ministers, we are equipped in a special way for the raising of live stock.  Now is the time to consolidate that position; now is the time to integrate <Col N="1173" /> live-stock conditions here with those obtaining in Britain.</P>
    <P>We must appreciate that even in the Agriculture Bill, at present passing through the British House of Commons, the British people anticipate that they must, because of their difficult financial position, rely much more on their own economy.  They will have to intensify agricultural production. These are circumstances leading to the creation of a favourable atmosphere for action such as I suggest, if the case is properly presented to the responsible British Minister.</P>
    <P>Sometimes agricultural experts suggest that it is regrettable that we have to export store cattle.  They point out that it takes a great deal of calcium and phosphates to build up cattle, but if the policy were adopted of selling independently of the British live-stock trade we would probably be put into the same category as the Argentine. I feel that the particular economy now in operation under which there is a certain interrelation between our live-stock trade and that of Britain is one that should be consolidated.  It is the most desirable form of live-stock economy, one that is suitable to both countries.  We are selling to-day in a seller's market, but we are not looking forward to a long-term deal as we should.  The time is opportune now. The time to make a deal is when the market is favourable to the seller. We ought to make that deal now.  I asked the Minister about the continental trade and he was not able to tell me whether there is a future for it.  I do not believe there is a future for it.  If they were interested in our live-stock industry as a permanent trade, they would have been able to buy our stock during the economic war.  There was no one to offer a price for our cattle at that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>When they get back to their feet again, it is unlikely that they will be interested in our cattle. Their purchases are welcome at the present time, provided, as I said before, that they do not injure our trade with the purchaser who is going to <Col N="1174" /> be the permanent stand-by for our market.  We must take a long-term view.  I am not suggesting that any injury has been done so far.</P>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to one aspect of it.  Looking to the future, we want to ensure that we will have animals coming to meet the demand in two or three years' time. Our young animals under one year of age have fallen in numbers by nearly 70,000 in the last few years.  In the category of cattle of one year and under the figure for 1944 was 932,000. That number has fallen to 874,000, a reduction of 60,000.  That reduction is going to be reflected in our exports in two or three years' time.  I think that the Minister, in going around to his food conferences, ought to stress that aspect of our policy, because he ought to be interested in our exports. They provide the most effective means for us of securing necessary imports so that we can ensure that we will have purchasing power.  As I say, he should be interested in stressing that aspect of our policy so that in the next few years we will have enough cattle to meet the demand that will be there.  Our exports in 1939, including fats and stores, numbered 704,000 animals.  That figure had fallen by 1945 to 451,000.  I venture to prophesy that in two years' time there will be a very keen demand for forward stores in the British market.  We should prepare for that so as to ensure that we will be able to cater for the only permanent customer that we have.</P>

      <P>On Wednesday Deputy Hughes had a question down in regard to this matter that was followed by another question yesterday. I am very glad that the Deputy has disassociated himself from the public utterances of people interested in the cattle trade which were likely to do very serious damage to people who are not in a position to market the forward stores which fetch the best prices across Channel.  I understand that the canners are catering particularly for these, and that of the 25,000 cattle mentioned upwards of 10,000 of them are to go from districts which would not ordinarily provide the <Col N="1175" /> forward stores that fetch the best prices on the cross-Channel market.  I am glad that Deputy Hughes has publicly disassociated himself from the scare which people tried to start and which was being used in a rather sinister way&mdash;a scare that suggested that, if the canners were allowed to start with these 25,000 cattle, there would be a regular famine of fresh meat in this country.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Ua Donnchadha there was in my mind, until I heard Deputy Hughes yesterday, some confusion as to what it was that he was driving at in his Parliamentary Question to which I gave him a reply on Wednesday.  I feared that he had fallen for the propaganda that had been doled out by the Cattle Traders' Association in relation to the contract given to Irish canners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want the Cattle Traders' Association to think for me.  I am quite capable of doing that for myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that, in our opinion, the contract so placed was not likely to have any effect whatever upon the supplies of meat for our people.  Even if that risk were taken, I am not at all convinced that it should be the concern of that particular association. I gave a reply as best I could our opinion, the contract so placed is to the three matters that were referred to in the Deputy's question. He asked me to say if there was any understanding or agreement entered into which would give this continental trade any permanency.  I replied that there was no agreement and no contract of any kind with continental countries, and if I did not say it then I want to say now, that it is impossible to say to what extent the trade holds any future.  During the last few years we were glad of any little trade that existed here.  It was not very large, but at certain times it was very helpful.  Like the Deputy, I naturally would be glad if it offered prospects of continuity.  A man who has something to sell to a customer this year will be glad to know if he <Col N="1176" /> will have him as a customer next year, and if the customer is a fairly reasonable person must make the best of him.</P>
      <P>With regard to the last matter referred to by Deputy Hughes&mdash;the advisability of having consultation with the British and the general effects of this continental policy on their needs&mdash;I do not think that any man in my position would have any hesitancy about approaching a customer&mdash;that is, if it could serve the kind of purpose to which the Deputy has given expression&mdash;on a matter of this kind, provided he is satisfied that such an approach will produce the type of result of which Deputy Hughes speaks.  Now, I do not know&mdash;it is a matter of judgment&mdash;if the course which he has suggested would appear so attractive to me as he seems to think.  I would ask him to realise this, that when you approach a Government or a country and draw their attention to the fact that you have something for sale which they require&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder whether Deputy Hughes regards it as good tactics in such circumstances to keep on pulling the customer by the shoulder, and to be continually drawing his attention to facts of which he is no doubt himself well aware.  These are all matters on which we can have our own opinion. The important matter is that anyone in my position would take what would appear to be the best course in order to secure the best results.  Just as we would like to have an understanding with the continental countries that have been doing business with us for some years we would like also to have an understanding on this matter with the British.  We would like to know what they wanted, what they were going to give us, how much they wanted and so on.  I believe the people who approach this matter in a commonsense way will, in the main, agree with my conclusion that it does not always <Col N="1177" /> serve your purpose best in circumstances such as I have outlined, and of which Deputy Hughes himself is well aware, to keep on reminding somebody else of a fact of which that person is already well aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was, as I indicated at the outset, very pleased that Deputy Hughes' attitude was not one of hostility to the contract which had been given to Irish canners, because, as I have said, I do not believe that the execution of that contract will have an injurious effect on our meat supply here.  While it might have been more satisfactory if it could have been placed at a different season of the year, even now it will have beneficial results.  As regards the Cattle Traders' Association, I do not approve of doing propaganda <Col N="1178" /> stuff and then coming along and seeking an interview with the Minister.  If the Minister is prepared to meet them, let them discuss matters first, and then, if they are dissatisfied with his approach, they can do all the propaganda they want.  While this may not be the ideal time of year for this contract, that being due to circumstances over which neither my predecessor nor I had control, I do feel it will bring beneficial results to people who have a certain class of beast for sale.  The right time to sell a beast, in my opinion, is when you can get the most attractive price for him.</P>
