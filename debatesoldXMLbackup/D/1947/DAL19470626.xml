      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether further consideration has now been given to the feasibility of extending the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, so as to include employees of local authorities, and thus permit such workers to avail themselves of the conciliation and arbitration machinery of the Labour Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if the supply of flour now available or likely to be available is sufficient to permit an allowance of bread to small caterers, and owners of tea shops in country towns who have not, at present, regular allowances of butter, sugar or tea, and who supply refreshments at irregular periods, such as fair days, sports meetings, feiseanna, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to the uncertainty of the flour supply position, it is not yet possible to grant an allowance of bread to the type of caterer mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to say when he proposes to remove bread rationing, inasmuch as supplies <Col N="302" /> of flour seem now to be abundant and inasmuch as we are threatened with an inundation of wheat in a couple of months, far in excess of our ability to consume?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The question asks if the Minister will take off rationing in respect of tea shops.  Why does he not remove bread rationing in view of the largest wheat crop the world has ever seen?  What is this figment of a famine in bread?  It is the purest &ldquo;cod&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that no cheese is available to the public at the moment as the producers are holding their stocks pending the fixing of prices by him; and if he will arrange to have such prices fixed without delay so that this food may be available to the public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Tadhg Ó Murchadha Tadhg Ó Murchadha">
      <NameTxt>Tadhg Ó Murchadha</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware of serious shortages of food in many households in the rural districts of Bantry and Schull, owing to the fact that potatoes and oatmeal are not available and to the further fact that bread supplies in such households are inadequate; and if he will have supplementary food supplies made available for purchase in such districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that growers' stocks of potatoes in some districts in West Cork are running <Col N="303" /> short, but that supplies can be obtained in the open market.  Oatmeal has been scarce generally due to the poor yield from the last harvest, but imported supplies are now available and allocations are being made to the areas referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a large surplus of potatoes in South Monaghan which the growers there apprehend may go to waste if they are not permitted to export them? If he does not intend to allow them to be exported, will he consider using the facilities of his Department to bring the areas of scarcity, such as those referred to in the question, in direct contact with areas of surplus such as South Monaghan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is not one of a general scarcity of potatoes, but of the reluctance of people, who normally relied on their own production, to pay market prices for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider using the machinery of his Department, in an advisory or other capacity, to persuade the people who have quantities of potatoes in South Monaghan, believing it to be possible to dispose of them, to dispose of them to these people in West Cork or any other area of scarcity?  It is silly to let the potatoes go bad and the people of Schull to go hungry for want of bringing the two together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFlorenceODris" hpid="Mr. O'Driscoll Mr. O'Driscoll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Driscoll</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate in what towns in West Cork are potatoes for sale?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that arrangements have been made to ensure adequate supplies of potatoes in all the towns in West Cork.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFlorenceODris" hpid="Mr. O'Driscoll Mr. O'Driscoll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Driscoll</NameTxt>
      <P>Potatoes are not for sale in the towns in West Cork.  Has the Minister sent inspectors to Skibbereen and other districts where complaints have been made to investigate complaints of the food scarcity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Inspectors of the <Col N="304" /> Department were in the Beara Peninsula.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFlorenceODris" hpid="Mr. O'Driscoll Mr. O'Driscoll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Driscoll</NameTxt>
      <P>When I complained about the Beara Peninsula, I informed the Department that a scarcity on a smaller scale existed in Skibbereen.  Is he taking any steps to inquire into that scarcity?  If anything happens down there, the Minister and his Department will be held responsible.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Distribution of Tea Supplies.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce what are the arrangements for distributing tea supplies henceforward; and whether wholesalers, who used to draw supplies from London, will receive their supplies from Tea Importers, Limited, on the same terms as were available heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The teas imported by Tea Importers, Limited, will be distributed through the wholesale merchants who receive licences or permits under the Tea (Wholesale Distribution) Order, 1947.  Tea will be supplied direct from Tea Importers, Limited, only to those licensed or permitted wholesalers whose quotas are not less than 5,000 lb. a month.  This restriction is necessary because Tea Importers, Limited, cannot handle issues below 5,000 lb. a month.  Those wholesalers who do not receive supplies direct from the importing company will obtain their supplies from other licensed or permitted wholesale merchants entitled to draw directly from Tea Importers, Limited, and the terms for the supply will fall to be settled between the parties concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the terms he has now announced operate to create in this country a vicious little monopoly, that the restriction excluding persons whose monthly consumption is less than 5,000 lb. has been devised to cut out every rural wholesaler in Ireland and to leave the wholesale distribution of tea in the hands of a couple of dozen wholesalers in Dublin, Cork and Limerick so that they get their rake-off, while we small <Col N="305" /> wholesalers throughout rural Ireland, who had free access to the Dublin market, the London market or the Belfast market in the past, are now constrained to buy from Tea Importers, Limited, on the board of which is represented each of the wholesale firms who are going to constitute the monopoly created by the 5,000 lb. minimum?  Is there sense, meaning or justice in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy misunderstands the position.  These small secondary wholesalers will draw their tea from the primary wholesalers in the same way as before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>These small secondary wholesalers were wholesaling tea in this country before some of these &ldquo;bucks&rdquo; were ever heard of and they are now to be required to sell themselves, body and soul, to any <i>arrivistes</i> who have landed in this country during the past 30 years.  Many of these small wholesalers have been in the business for 100 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy asking a supplementary question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it fair or just that our own Parliament should take ordinary enterprising businessmen throughout the country by the throat and force them into the hands of a couple of dozen fellows who want to plunder us when, if we are left alone, we have access to London, Belfast, Calcutta, or to anywhere we want to go for the best value for the people of the country.  Is the Minister aware that that is open plunder?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say whether there will be a flat rate for the tea under the new arrangements or whether there will be different varieties of tea at different prices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as we are working on a ration, there will be a flat rate. With regard to what Deputy Dillon has said, I think he misunderstands the position.  The export of tea from Great Britain to this country has stopped by order of the British Government. There is, therefore, no way by which wholesalers in this country can obtain supplies from Great Britain.  The tea <Col N="306" /> is being imported direct from the countries of origin by the organisation set up for that purpose which will then make it available to the wholesale firms here who will distribute it to the secondary wholesalers and the retail trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What is this new description of &ldquo;secondary wholesaler&rdquo;?  Is the man who has been in the wholesale business for 120 years to be told by a brat who landed into the business 30 years ago that he is a secondary wholesaler and must, therefore, go with his hat in his hand to take whatever is offered?  Is the man whose firm has been in the business for 120 years and who has the right to choose what he wants and to use his skill in selecting what is best for his customers, to be reduced to the level of a beggarman and must he take what is given?  I ask the Minister if that is fair?</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Anthracite Supplies.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce why supplies of anthracite coal for domestic cookers have become so irregular; and what steps he will take to ensure that authorised quotas shall be regularly delivered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Supplies of anthracite are available to meet the permitted allowances for domestic cookers, and the question of regular deliveries is one for arrangement between the permit holders and their fuel merchants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister's attention been directed to the fact that, particularly in and around the City of Dublin, small allottees, notably residents in the Crumlin area, have been told by their supplier that they have not got the anthracite and that, on occasion, these people have had to endure for ten or 12 days with their cooking apparatus out and have been forced to try and cook on the parlour fire on logs?  Would the Minister look into that question with a view to ensuring that if these small purchasers cannot get supplies from their regular supplier they might place <Col N="307" /> themselves in the hands of an officer of his Department who would refer them to some other supplier?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that such is the case.  The Deputy made representations to my Department on behalf of one lady.  On inquiry it was ascertained that she was anxious to obtain anthracite beans and refused to take any other kind of anthracite fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that, although I did make representations in regard to the case to which he is now referring, the information furnished to him is false.  The lady in question asked for anthracite and I do not know if in her 90th year she knows the difference between anthracite beans, chips, logs, or anything else.  She would be very glad to get anything.  I assure the Minister that there was no stipulation of any kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether an allottee of coal who is unable to get it may refer to an officer of his Department with a view to being referred to some other supplier if his own supplier is temporarily out of stock?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The supply of anthracite available is equivalent to the amount that can be purchased under permits.  If the lady on whose behalf the Deputy made representations is prepared to take any other form of anthracite fuel except beans her merchant is in a position to supply her.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce why a price in excess of £7 per ton is to be charged for American coal which costs from 95/-to 115/- per ton c.i.f. Irish ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Charges in respect of unloading, short weight, demurrage, handling, local delivery and overheads <Col N="308" /> must be added to the c.i.f. cost of coal before the selling price can be determined. In certain instances it is possible to avoid the full incidence of these costs, but in the case of coal sold by merchants, the addition of these charges to the average c.i.f. cost of American coal, which was £5 10s. 6d. per ton during April and May, and will be higher for June when the first shipments of West Coast coals arrive, brings the selling price to over £7 per ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it suggested that the gas company, Córas Iompair Eireann, and the other large corporations to whom this coal is allotted will, in fact, be charged a price in excess of £7 per ton or will they come within the category of persons who will avoid a number of additional charges?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the factors which are taken into consideration when deciding on applications for permission to bring turf into Dublin; and if he will take steps to ensure that in all cases where persons or associations or parish councils have arranged or can arrange for the cutting <Col N="309" /> and saving of turf, which otherwise would not be cut or saved, all facilities will be given to them to enable them to send that turf to Dublin before next winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions were published in full in an advertisement which appeared in the daily newspapers on the 17th March last.</P>
      <P>Apart from turf or fuel merchants, the main factors governing the issue of movement licences in respect of turf for household use are that the turf in question has been produced by an individual applicant or group or association of applicants either (a) by his or their own personal labour or (b) by labour directly employed by them and recruited either outside the scheduled turf area or, through employment exchanges, from special areas in the congested districts.  Licences are granted without these conditions where the turf is intended for free distribution to the necessitous poor.  Any person who complies with the regulations will have no difficulty in obtaining the necessary licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not reply to part two of my question, in which I asked if he would take steps to ensure that in all cases where persons or associations or parish councils have arranged, or can arrange for the cutting and saving of turf, which otherwise would not be cut or saved, all facilities will be given to them to enable them to send that turf to Dublin before next winter.  Will the Minister allow that to be done?  Will he allow people in the country who have relatives and friends here in the city and who offer to send them a ton or half a ton of turf, and will cut it themselves for them in the country, to send it to Dublin and thus ease the claim on the national pool later on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give any reason why a relative cannot cut turf for his relations and family in the City of Dublin which would thus ease the claim on the national pool?  I am not asking that turf be drawn from the pool.  I want a special effort, as the Minister does, made in connection with <Col N="310" /> the cutting of turf.  I consider that to send it to friends and relations in Dublin would ease the demand on the national pool later on.  Will the Minister give any explanation why that will not be allowed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows as well as I do that any such concession would be abused and that it would be impossible to prevent its abuse.  If people in the country are prepared to cut more turf it is their duty to cut it and to cut all the turf that can be produced.</P>

While it is true that they got a gratuity which must be set off to some degree against the 10/- loss which they sustained through retiring before the date of the new pension scheme, does it not seem a hardship that these men who sought to be co-operative should, in fact, find after their retirement, that they have suffered a material loss in pension?

      <P>With your permission, a Chinn Comhairle, I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together. I am aware that a certain amount of dissatisfaction exists at the results of the recent competition for appointment to posts in the Radio Eireann orchestras, particularly amongst unsuccessful candidates.  I have, however, no reason to question or disagree with the findings of the selection board which was composed mainly of persons of distinction in the musical world. <Col N="315" /> While there is no alternative in the circumstances to going outside the country for performers of adequate standard, I am, nevertheless, anxious that Irish candidates should have a further opportunity of securing appointments in the orchestra.  I have accordingly arranged that a limited number of vacancies shall be reserved for a further competition.  As regards training facilities, it is not the function of the broadcasting service to provide such facilities for candidates for employment in the broadcasting orchestras.  Facilities for students of music already exist in Dublin and elsewhere in the country and, apart from these, the Department of Education arranges special summer courses for advanced students of music in which the broadcasting service co-operates.</P>

As the Press seems to misunderstand some of my statements last night, I would like to make the position clear.  When I referred to pensions for Deputies, I had in mind deceased members, Deputies who are called away suddenly to the next world.  What has Fianna Fáil done? The members of Fianna Fáil have played on the dead; they have put up their widows as candidates.  That is the old game with Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>I will, Sir, if you will make Deputy Killilea hold his tongue or leave the House.  As long as there are strikes in this city and throughout the country, I can see no justification for increasing our own salaries.  A few weeks ago when the workers employed in the flour milling industry announced their intention of going on strike to obtain better conditions, the Taoiseach threatened that the strike would be declared illegal.  I say to Deputies who are supporting this Bill that they should think of these people.  Go down O'Connell Street and you will see men, insurance agents, carrying placards demanding a living wage.  These men were offered 6d. a week.  Deputies are so anxious about their own interests that they want to provide themselves with high salaries, but most Deputies here as I understand it have two or three positions each.  My policy is one man, one job.  If a man is elected as a Deputy that is a full-time job and he should not be looking out for a sideline. <Col N="324" /> That is what is happening in this Dáil.</P>

      <P>I was sent in here to serve the people and as long as the Minister for Local Government will not sanction any increase in wages for road workers or gangers in County Wexford or for men working in institutions or mental hospitals, I shall vote against any increase in salary for Deputies.  Deputies knew when they went before the country the salaries they would receive but they are like some men who are prepared to accept a job under any conditions.  They do not ask the boss what the salary is. They get in backways but they are not a month in the job until they are looking for increased remuneration.  That is the policy to-day of the Government Party.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kennedy, who has now left the House, told us yesterday that it costs him £240 a year for a motor car. There is a nice statement from a Deputy while half the people of the nation are trying to exist on miserably low wages, small pensions and, in many cases, no pensions at all because of the means test.  Other old people because of the same means test are given only 2/- or 4/- a week.  Yet we have Deputy Kennedy complaining that it costs £240 to run his motor car.</P>

      <P>Deputies on the far side of the House do not like to hear facts.  As long as I am representing the poor people of my constituency, the small farmers and the labourers to the number of 8,000 who sent me here, I am going to raise my voice to tell the House and the Minister that, so long as they keep these people down, I am against you and always will be.  As I covered a lot of ground last night and as some other Deputies are no doubt anxious to join in this debate I shall conclude by saying here and now that if this matter is taken to a division I am going to vote against the Government. In doing that I feel that I am acting in the interests of my fellow workers whom you have kept down by Standstill Orders for the past four years and against whom you are now using the threat to take away the only weapon they have, the strike weapon. When election time comes you will have a different story.  You will be dangling something else before the eyes of the people but your day is run.  You are already too long here and you will soon meet the fate that awaits any Government with your record.  The day will soon come, the day that occurs only once in every five years when the people of the Twenty-Six Counties can use the one effective weapon they have and that is the secret weapon of the ballot-box.  That is the greatest weapon they can use.  It is better than all the revolvers or all the agitation which they have used in the past.  Their only weapon then will be the pencil but they can use it very effectively after carefully examining the credentials of the <Col N="327" /> candidates and by deciding who will best serve their interests and the interests of the country as a whole. What action has the Government taken to keep down the cost of living and to stop all this thing of higher salaries? If a working man gets a few shillings of an increase under an award from the Labour Court there is no control by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and prices go up.  The Government is doing nothing to control those people who are fleecing the unfortunate workers by increasing the price of commodities.</P>

      <P>All the Deputies have talked about the cost of living, and that is what this increase is for&mdash; to meet the cost of living.  The Government has done nothing to keep down the price of commodities.  Until that is done you will have nothing but strikes and uneasiness.  The poor people have no back door to go to.  They have to go to the relieving officers in their areas where they are handed the paltry sum of 6/- or a docket to go to a shop.  Is that the Irish Republic and the great prosperity that we were promised?</P>

      <P>It is forgotten.  Every Deputy who spoke from the Government Benches spoke about the cost of living and the value of the £1, but I say they have no argument to make.  If there was any argument to be made there is no one who could make it better than I could from practical experience. <Col N="328" /> I had to live on a wage before I came in here in 1943.  We are spending £7,000,000 on the Army and yet we are told that the country cannot afford this and that it cannot afford that.  What will the people down the country say to the T.D.s, especially to those who are going to vote for this increase in their salaries?  They will say that the Government kept down wages until the war was over and until times were supposed to be getting better, but that now they were looking for increased salaries for themselves.  I say in all earnestness to the Minister, and I am one of the poorest Deputies in the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The rate-payers are carrying so many burdens that they are like a sinking ship and are going down daily.  Taxation has been piled on, although the Government said that they would do away with all taxation and all the red tape, and all the extravagance that was going on before they came in.  Now, they are feathering their own nests because the day of the Fianna Fáil Government is getting short.  They are going to make themselves secure for the last few months or last two years.

      <P>This is a debate that should be conducted in a temperate way and with as great an approach to objectivity as the subject matter of the measure allows.  It cannot be wholly impersonal, because the personnel that is going to be affected by the proposed measure is the personnel <Col N="329" /> in this House.  Nevertheless, I think the matter could have been dealt with in a way that would have made this House stand higher in the estimation of those who sent us here as their representatives.  Two Deputies decided that they would deal with this on the lowest level of personalities, Deputy Corry outstandingly so.  I was not here yesterday when he spoke, and in that way was saved the shame of having to listen to what he said. It was reported to me that his speech was one which degraded the House.  It was certainly a speech which can be regarded as debasing the Deputy, that is if there is any point lower in the scale of either human or social values to which that Deputy can go.  He thought fit to attack me amongst others.  I suppose I am unfortunate in that I have to live my life in the open, and that any moneys that I earn are very easily open to the curious scrutiny of envious and slanderous sort of people to make up what charges they are going to level against me.  I heard myself once described as a briefless barrister&mdash;that was one side of it&mdash;while almost in the same breath people outside talk about the lucrative emoluments that I derive from my profession. I am either the tattered kind of gentleman that Deputy Corry referred to last night or I am not. People cannot have it both ways. If these things are going to be examined into, do not let me or my colleague, Deputy Costello, be the only subjects for examination.  Let us go round the House and see who are the secretaries to the Beet Growers' Association, the people of the new landlord class who have emoluments of different types in this House.  I do not decry them for having emoluments. It is all the better that people should get them.  Then they are not wholly dependent on what they can get from political life, but it ought not to be held against a man if he seeks to add to his emoluments as a Deputy.</P>

      <P>I understand that Deputy Corry did depart from the proper tone of this debate.  Now, a departure from the straight path should not make a headline for every subsequent Deputy.  However, any Deputy <Col N="330" /> aggrieved by the remarks alleged is entitled to reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that Deputy Corry made the astounding claim in that gross speech of his that he was worth £30,000 a year to his constituents. I do not know what he trades in except one commodity, and that is vulgarity.  I never knew that there was a black market in it.  Apparently, it is a thing that is not in short supply with him, and, apparently, he charges well in his own estimation for what he gives to his constituents.</P>
      <P>Deputy Killilea talked about hypocrites. That is another method of levelling the same charge as that which Deputy Corry made.  Deputy Killilea hates hypocrisy.  He hates the bad emotions which a man may stir up on occasion and thinks he should get rid of those unwholesome emotions.  If the Deputy wants to get purged of any feeling that he has against hypocrisy will he do this for me?  Will he get a picture of himself in the year 1932 when he first presented himself before the people for entry into this House?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it may not have been that year.  Was he a hypocrite when he then presented himself&mdash; I suggest that he ought to be proud of the advance that he has made in life since 1932 or whatever the date was&mdash; before the people and said that anybody who came into this House came into it to get money?  That is the lowest kind of thing that one could get in politics or in any other walk of life. He has got away from that.  We cannot forget what the President of this establishment did say, and it is not something that we ought to be asked to forget.  We can forget it if there is an apology for it, and if people say that they have better minds now and confess that the campaign that they ran on this basis was a mean, discreditable campaign.  Deputy Cogan remarked here a couple of nights ago that that propaganda still lives and that it is that propaganda that was helping to destroy public life in new Parliamentary associations here.  I think the <Col N="331" /> Deputy behind me said it helped to destroy it even at the end of the old Parliamentary Party days.  So it did. Those who were responsible ought to confess it was wrong and those who led this campaign and got your places through it ought now at least make confession and say that it was wrong. Remember what the calculation was. Five hundred pounds a year was in the considered view of the Taoiseach the amount of money on which any citizen of this State could be expected, not merely to live, but to marry and rear a family and in a mood of generosity the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;Let us double that and call it £1,000.  Surely that is sufficient.&rdquo;  That was, of course, for men who were going to occupy Ministerial posts with all the responsibility that is put upon them or even the headship of the executive council with the full responsibility that that had.</P>
      <P>Deputy Killilea remembers when he came into this House in 1927 that a debate was raised here on one occasion reminding Deputies, as I want to remind them now, if only for the sake of getting the statement that the thing is wrong, that Deputies were not going to take their salaries of £350, that they were only going to take so much as would provide for their necessary expenses.  And the hypocrisy of Deputy Killilea&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>You are not repudiating statements.  The view was <Col N="332" /> held by that Party as a whole.  Deputy Killilea repudiates it now or stands over it.  The situation to which hypocrisy was carried in those days was that a committee was set up of the Party to investigate the needs of Deputies and what they did not require for their personal needs was put into a fund.  I was told in November of the year 1927, when I queried in a curious way how much was in the fund, £107.  The hypocrisy went that length that some poor gawms on that side were fleeced of the little bit of emoluments they got and a little fund was piled up just to have it to say: &ldquo;We are acting up to our public promises&rdquo;.  There was £107 in the fund, because that £107 could be saved from the salaries of Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party in the year 1927 and there was the fund for necessitous people or possibly for the more gravely necessitous people in the Party.  That was the mood that prevailed in 1927 and up to 1932.  It is not the mood now.</P>
      <P>Why would not people realise that confession is a wholesome thing and say they were wrong and repudiate all that very bad, mean, discreditable period and try to parade themselves before the people at least as folk who learned in the hard school of experience, the only one in which folly can be disciplined and the one in which the Fianna Fáil Party have at least learned some lesson?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy said here last night, in an effort to justify this, that he has long experience of politics in this country, and that no men who were colleagues with him in this House or opponents had died having left a fortune out of what they had made in politics.  That was quite right.  He goes too far when he says, as I understood him to say last night, probably in a mood of exuberance, that in respect of most of the people who had died being Dáil Deputies the whip had to be sent around to assist their relatives. That is not so.  Many Deputies have died, having previously given good service, for whom there was no necessity to have the hat sent around, but it may be said that those people had outside emoluments.  Deputy Kennedy is perfectly right in saying that, and <Col N="333" /> the records of this House can be searched and it will not be discovered that any man really made money out of a political career in this country. One man we did find doing it and he is no longer in the position that he occupied although unfortunately he is still a member of the House.</P>
    <P>It does not carry the case to say that. The profession to which I belong and which is called forth in this House for the purpose of trying to discredit it by representing every member of it as living in the height of luxury, is a profession about which the same thing could be said, not, possibly, so comprehensively. There is a benevolent society attached to the Bar and there are many drawings on it for people who cannot make good at their profession.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kennedy I heard making the statement.  I am referring to Deputy Kennedy.  The Deputy may not understand that I am partially agreeing with him.  I suppose that is a surprise.  I say it does not carry the whole case.  There are many professions in this country, many walks of life, in which when a man dies his relatives have to be assisted.  It is almost the exception where it is not so in life in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are seeking to do is this&mdash; we are trying by this measure to put ourselves into an extremely privileged position and we are going to associate with membership of this House a salary that is very much beyond the dreams of anybody's imagination at the time when he put himself forward as a candidate. Should we do that?  The question may be raised that is going to the root of the whole matter as to whether Deputies should be paid at all or not.  I am leaving that aside.  I think the world has advanced as far as to realise that men who give service here or in any other Parliamentary assembly cannot be expected to serve completely in an honorary way.  The question is how much should be given. That puts itself on the other point, is payment to be arranged and secondly, and the great point in this case, is this <Col N="334" /> the opportune time to have this move made and should it be done as a result of a debate in which there take part only those who are interested in the matter?</P>
    <P>I want to ask people to remember what was revealed by the pamphlet on National Income and Expenditure.  The living of life in this country from the point of view of income is very low. The standard taken as the low point in that pamphlet which the Government have published is the £3 a week person, the person drawing £150 a year.  They parade those figures that I have so often tried to get before this House. Here we are a community of 3,000,000. Of that 3,000,000 something in the neighbourhood of 1,250,000 are gainfully occupied.  The rest&mdash;the aged, the young, the invalid, all the people who are not able to work or who cannot get work no matter how able and willing they may be to do it&mdash;live on the 1,250,000.  One and a quarter millions are those who are gainfully occupied and, according to the pamphlet, at the moment, and taking the purchasing power of the £ as having been reduced to half, there are only 66,000 people of this whole community who are over emoluments equivalent in 1938 to £3 a week.  Now, merely as Deputies&mdash;I leave outside emoluments completely out of the question&mdash;merely basing ourselves on the emoluments derived from this House, we are putting ourselves not merely amongst the 66,000 of the community but high up in the 66,000. Is this the time to do it?</P>
    <P>When one mentions the old age pensioners here, the thought immediately occurs that that, of course, is the odious comparison, that is the comparison that will have to be used at the crossroads afterwards, that is the comparison that will defame Deputies: &ldquo;See what they did to the old age pensioners and see what they did to themselves.&rdquo;  The old age pensioners used to get 10/-when 10/- had 10/- purchasing value; to-day they get 12/6, with a purchasing value of 6/3.  Why should we not pay better attention to the old age pensioner than we do to ourselves?  If any old age pensioner is in a position that he has any outside emolument&mdash;a point which makes Deputies so annoyed here&mdash;we take that into consideration <Col N="335" /> and the means test is rigorously applied.  If we have a poor person who, by thrift, by some process of semistarvation in his early period, put some little bit aside against the day when old age would be creeping on him, we penalise that man for his thrift and we mulct him because of his previous good citizenship.  We do not do that here.  I do not say we should.</P>
    <P>I can go up the scale to all sorts of groups&mdash;pensioners of different types, people in different State services, people reduced to the point of living and being dependent upon the various forms of State charity there are.  To all those, we lessen whatever little assistance they are getting.  The scandalous thing is that we in this Dáil who, through the Government, have been responsible for reducing the purchasing power, before we rectify the situation for the weaker, the poorer, the badly served members of the community, now in our righteousness think we ought to give this extra emolument to ourselves.  I think we do ourselves an injustice and do the institution a serious disservice by asking the country to consider with any type of calm a group of 138 people who meet here and propose to add on to their emoluments.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputies to ask their Ministers to leave this over.  Let us wait a year or two at least, until we see how prices settle.  Let us wait until we see what the Dáil is going to develop into from the point of view of full attendance here and whether any obligation will be put on Deputies to serve as some of the newspapers want us to be obliged, by attendance here and possibly by speaking here every day. Let us allow the matter to develop a little longer and not have these shocking comparisons made to the point to which we&mdash;I hope I will be excused from any responsibility for it&mdash;the point at which the majority in this House, acting through the Government, have brought the country.</P>
    <P>When the standstill Orders were introduced before, if I may make a reference to them, I often asked the Ministers to remember that what they were doing was going to lead exactly to the situation to which we have been brought and to get out of that was <Col N="336" /> going to cause tremendous trouble, that the adjustment to new conditions, whatever new conditions might operate with the purchasing power of the £, would be painful.  We have for many years imposed great pain, great suffering, disease, possibly driven to crime, a considerable number of people in this country, and at the end we think we have handled the one outstanding problem of the time, which other countries could handle differently, in such a way we are entitled to get an extra £12 a month added to our emoluments.</P>
    <P>When these rates of allowance were originally fixed here, and it was thought there should be some improvement in the payment made to Deputies, we at least took the good course of asking an outside body to report and Dr. Shanley and his committee were asked to consider the financial position for Deputies and say whether they thought the emoluments given were insufficient.  That report said that they were considered sufficient.  So far as we have an outside judgment on our case, it said that the old money was not insufficient.  We did not accept their advice in 1938 but brought in legislation which increased the allowances by £120.  The Minister who brought that in, now the Minister for Local Government, said that the figure possibly was beyond even what had been suggested to the committee and which the committee had turned down.  But if we were making a little better provision than at any time suggested, that was to meet future contingencies. Remember, we had asked to have our case examined by an outside body and that body produced a report which was not in our favour. We did not attend to the report, but gave the increased emoluments.  In giving them, it was agreed that they were more even than had been requested and the excuse was that there was provision made for emergencies or contingencies.</P>
    <P>Now, have we not done well enough out of this, at least well enough to remain where we are until, say, a new election has come and gone?  The point has been put to me&mdash;and I think it is a good one to put to the House&mdash;<Col N="337" /> that when people are thinking in terms of the cost of living, it is not the 1938 figure that we must relate it back to, but to the state of the cost of living at the last general election at which Deputies presented themselves to the electorate&mdash;1944.  On that occasion, people went forward who had by that time got very nearly the full impact of the cost of living and they presented themselves as persons willing to serve under the conditions which then held. What great changes have taken place since then?  I ask Deputies to consider that they give the public an opportunity to decry service in this place, if at this moment they in their wisdom say we are the people who ought to get a high-up place in the queue and we measure the extra value of our services by this extra £12 a month.</P>
    <P>I am certain there are Deputies who are not making anything by coming in, but definitely are at a loss.  The commission which reported on Ministerial salaries before 1938, stated that the view had been expressed to them that the position with regard to Deputies&mdash;and I am going to suggest that that should be somewhat the position regarding Ministers&mdash;was that this service should be somewhat idealised, that a man should not completely commercialise it or look with a commercial eye on the hours he is giving here, hours taken away from other occupations, time spent working up different work for debates here or work on committees.  One should not meticulously go into these matters and say that a certain amount of time has been used, up to such a point that we must ask for an increase, owing to the increased cost of living&mdash;not the full increase, but a part.</P>
    <P>I say that the matter should be left over until conditions have been allowed to settle.  It has been said in this House and not denied that no demand came from any Party for the increase.  Apparently, Deputies were content to remain at the old emolument.  If that be the case, why cannot we present ourselves to the people, not trying to get into their good graces by saying something in which we do not believe.  We should recognise the harm that has been done <Col N="338" /> to the community, in the main by Government activity, backed by the majority Party here.  We ought to recognise the harm and try to improve the situation and make it as easy as possible.  We should try to remake it first for those at the lowest point of the scale and we should be well enough off at least to wait a bit.</P>
    <P>The calculation has been made that, if these emoluments come in the increased form and if they are still to be maintained free of income-tax, the position then arrived at is that a married Deputy, whose wife is still alive and has only one child, can earn as much as £1,000 without paying 1d. in income-tax.  I do not say that every Deputy is in that position, but it applies to a Deputy who is adding to what he is getting here what he could get or may get, or may be lucky enough to get, in his position.  If they do, they come to the point at which, because their salaries here have been raised to this extra level and the whole salary is removed from any charge to income-tax, they can earn £1,000 per year without subscribing 1d. to the Exchequer through the direct tax of income-tax.  The citizen outside on £1,000, married and with one child, subscribes nearly £150 to the Exchequer.  Is our state so low, do we really feel the pinch so badly, do we, when we compare our situation with that of those lower down the scale, feel that we ought to get the extra emoluments and ought to get the special safeguard against income-tax, leaving us in the position in which we can arrive at £1,000 a year, very high up in the national scale, without making a contribution, through income-tax, to the Exchequer which the ordinary citizen, not having our privileges and benefits, is asked to make if he reaches that point?</P>
    <P>I do not ask that the House should consider that Deputies should be put in the position where a demand is made upon them to serve without payment. We have got beyond that stage.  We have got to the point at which salaries have been arranged and have been the subject of rearrangement two or three times, but this is the first time that such a proposal has been made without <Col N="339" /> examination by an outside independent body.  Is it wise to take this step of giving ourselves these moneys without outside consideration at this particular time?  I do not think it is.  One thing is certain after this debate&mdash;the old idea with regard to payments here, that they were only to meet expenses, has gone.  We are now being paid, to some degree, as having adopted the profession of politics.  I do not say that to decry politics.  It may be proper that it must be made a profession. It may be the only way in which you can get in here the people whom you would like to see serving here, but we can forget hereafter this talk about an allowance to meet expenses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Killilea says, and says with great point and force, that certain Deputies have higher expenses than others.  So they have.  My expenses must be very slight indeed, living in the city, in comparison with those of Deputies from the country, but remember that there is an answer to that.  It is not the method we are taking here. If we gave people even a higher salary than is suggested and made the salary subject to income-tax, the ordinary income-tax code allows people to make a case for what are called necessary expenses, so that Deputies from the country could make a bigger case and get taken away from the impact of income-tax a greater portion of whatever the emoluments are than the town Deputy could.  We have avoided that set-up.  We apparently do not like this idea of having the salary subject to income-tax, with all that the income-tax allows in connection with necessary expenses.  That is the only point I heard made with any force, and I suggest that the counter to it is not to give the extra money, leaving everything free of income-tax, but when at another time and in better circumstances&mdash;I do not suggest it should be done at the moment&mdash;this whole matter comes to be considered, it would possibly be a better approach if higher emoluments were given, the whole amount being subject to income-tax, leaving Deputies to plead for remission in connection with whatever they were able to satisfy the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="340" /> were necessary expenses involved in carrying out their duties.</P>
    <P>I want to protest against the view, which has become current throughout the country, that Deputies ought to be coerced into attending here.  I do not believe in that.  I do not think that a Deputy's work is to be regarded as confined to what he does here in the chamber.  I think we would find ourselves in a worse position than that in which the British House of Commons finds itself at the moment, if everyone was forced to come here and if, out of boredom, we were to have more people deciding to speak than even those who bore the House at the moment.  I want to protest against another thing&mdash;that Deputies are taking on themselves duties which, I think, are not theirs.  It seems to be a scandal in this country that the main work which some constituents seek to put upon Deputies is sending them nosing around various Departments to try to get from these Departments what these constituents are entitled to under various pieces of legislation, but there are some Deputies who have apparently decided that this is what they are good at and that this is a duty which they will take on themselves. I do not count that a good Deputy's work, but that may be an individual viewpoint.</P>
    <P>I want to protest against the view that work in this House should be measured either by attendance or even by speech-making.  Deputies play an important part on committees&mdash;quiet work which is sometimes not regarded at all.  There are many ways in which Deputies may serve and many more ways if that committee system were developed in which Deputies could be allowed to serve&mdash;those who do not want to serve by explaining their points of view in speeches.  In any event, the whole thing is futile, because if there were some system of attendance, you would have people coming up, signing the book and hopping off again as quickly as possible.  You cannot coerce people by that sort of method into giving good service, if they are not desirous of giving that type of service.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken on the income-tax point and I suggest that in any <Col N="341" /> further arrangement of the matter we should base ourselves upon a salary, the amount of which is fully known and understood by the people, and let Deputies try to derive whatever comfort they may get from an approach to the Revenue Commissioners showing what their necessary expenses are.</P>
    <P>I wind up as I began.  It has been said with regard to the people of the world that they are divided into two classes, the righteous and the unrighteous, and it has been cynically added that the classification is nearly always done by the righteous.  We are making that classification nowadays. The old age pensioners and a few others down the line are not as righteous as we in this matter of attracting better emoluments to the service we give.  I do not think we should approach that point of arrogance. I do not think we have yet justified Parliamentary life, as a result of all the foul propaganda of some years ago, as being somewhat idealised. I wish we could, and I think this is the wrong time at which to approach this matter, and, if we persevere in this measure, we will certainly convey a wrong impression.  The phrase has been used to me over and over again with regard to a number of people that they are limpets who have fastened themselves on to the rock of the national revenue.  We are not regarded entirely as being without that characteristic of the limpet&mdash;the whole group of us&mdash;and it will only be said of us that we have made our hold more tenacious still, and that at a time when the national revenue is not just as solid a rock as it was.  I do not think we should put any further strain on it.</P>

There is no Deputy who is more adept at that than Deputy McGilligan. He is quite capable of putting his point in a less crude way than Deputy Corry or some other Deputy, but he will nevertheless admit, although I do not expect him to do so here, that he is as good a politician as is in this House, and is able to make the welkin ring to suit his own political point of view.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan told us, in effect, as he has told us on a number of occasions during the last four or five years, that he was never in debt until he became a member of this House.  As we all know, Deputy Flanagan got his seat in this House as a member of the Monetary Reform Party.  He got his seat originally because of his attacks on financial institutions, banks, etc., in this country.  That was why he was elected.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that Deputy Flanagan was elected to this House as a Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>He was going to do away with the banks.  He was going to give the people all the money they wanted. I think I am not doing any injustice to Deputy Flanagan by making that statement.  However, according to the statement which he made here yesterday, he went into debt immediately he became a member of this House.  He told the House that he got an overdraft&mdash;I will quote from some notes I took.  Deputy Flanagan said in this House yesterday that some people think the local T.D.s. are like the mint and that they can shovel out money. He said he found, before he became a <Col N="344" /> Deputy, that he could not get a penny &ldquo;tick&rdquo; in any shop but that now it is forced on him and that he can get anything he wants.  Credit is forced on him and he can get anything he wants. It is an extraordinary thing that since Deputy Flanagan came into this House four or five years ago we have not heard him attacking the banks or the financial institutions of this country. He dropped that when he wanted &ldquo;tick&rdquo; as he calls it, and an overdraft. It was good policy on his part to cease attacking the banks and financial institutions outside and to turn instead to attacking the Ministers of this Government in this House and to make personal attacks on the members of the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Flanagan's whole attitude since he was elected has been hypocritical.  He told us, too, in the course of his remarks, that after paying all his expenses&mdash;making provision for his hotel and travelling expenses, meeting his constituents, entertaining them, and doing everything that a Deputy has to do&mdash;he had £1 1s. 4d. per week to live on, and that if he did all he would like to do he would be going into debt each week. I want to suggest to Deputy Davin, who is a good trade unionist, that he should see to it that Deputy Flanagan should not be allowed or asked to exist on the miserable pittance of £1 1s. 4d. a week.  I think it is something Deputy Davin should take up immediately.  He should carry a campaign through the country to see that Deputy Flanagan and other Deputies like him will not be asked to exist on £1 1s. 4d. a week&mdash; or less than £1 1s. 4d. a week if Deputy Flanagan, who comes from the same constituency as Deputy Davin, were allowed to do his duty as he thinks it should be done.  I suggest that Deputy Davin should take up the cudgels and see that Deputy Flanagan does not have to exist on £1 1s. 4d. a week after paying his expenses as a Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Deputy Davin will see that other Deputies in the House will be given such remuneration or such expenses as will allow them to do their duties properly by their constituents after having paid for hotel expenses, for car hire, for clothing, for the maintenance of their homes, for meeting their constituents and for travelling around their constituencies for which the allowance of £480 is not sufficient.  I think the time has come when somebody or some section of the community should look into the matter.  I feel sure that, as a Labour leader, Deputy Davin would be the most qualified man to see that some change is made, if this House in its wisdom and judgment is not prepared to accept the proposals of the Minister for Finance.  It is very awkward at any time for Deputies to come in here and discuss this problem of allowances.  It is much simpler and much easier for any of us at any time to get up either in this House or in the country and to say: &ldquo;We are getting too much.  No increase should be given.&rdquo;  That talk may be good, politically, in the country from any Party.  We know that quite well.  That kind of talk can be done at any time.  I want to put it to the House that the Opposition groups or many members of them are acting in a hypocritical way on this matter.  I want to say that within the last six months different Deputies of different Opposition groups in this country have discussed this matter with me privately and have expressed to me the view that <Col N="346" /> something would need to be done in the immediate future to increase the allowance to Deputies, because they found they were getting into debt and that they were unable to carry out their duties! That was not confined to the members of any one Party.  Up to a half a dozen of them at least said that to me in private conversation.  I am not giving any secrets away in stating that.  Let those Deputies be honest and say in the House that they have been suggesting that their allowances should be increased, because they found these allowances were not sufficient to maintain them, to allow them to pay their way, to travel round and meet constituents, and to do everything that a Deputy should do.</P>
      <P>There is no need for anyone to say that the expenses of Deputies have gone up very considerably.  If a Deputy finds that the cost of travelling around is too expensive, he will give less and less service to his constituents. When the economic pressure comes upon him, he will be forced by circumstances to give them less service.  He will not be able to travel around his constituency as he should and will not be able to meet his constituents as often as he should.  On many occasions he will be forced to neglect doing the things he should do as a Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested by Deputy Dillon and Deputy McGilligan that there may be necessity for this increase, but that the time is not opportune. From my experience of public life, I can say that the time is never opportune for any increase to any section of the community.  I took the view in regard to the recent increase to persons employed in the public service that the time was not opportune for it, that probably the Government were not wise in introducing proposals to pay these increases at that time.  That is the natural view for anyone to take. I can understand Deputies on any side of the House stating that the time is not opportune.  The time is never opportune for increases.  If you can prevent increases being forced on individuals or on the community in general, it is all the better for the country. Some people will hold that, if you do not increase taxation in order to raise <Col N="347" /> more money to improve the social services, the country cannot progress.  It is very hard to know when it is right to increase taxation or the remuneration of any section of the community. It is very hard to determine the right and proper time, if any time is opportune, to increase taxation.</P>
    <P>No employer, whether he is a farmer, an industrialist, or a commercial man, will ever admit that he can afford to pay more to his employees.  No employer or group of employers will ever admit that the particular time is opportune to pay more to their employees; they will always genuinely believe that they cannot afford it.  Deputies may think that the country cannot afford to pay this extra 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>Comparisons were made with the old age pensioners.  If Deputies were honest in making these comparisons, I suggest that they should not take the £480 per year they are getting.  If they want to make those comparisons, why not make them on the basis of the allowances given for the last ten or 12 years, since Deputies who made these statements came into the House? Why do they cash their monthly vouchers for £40?  They cash them voluntarily.  If a voucher is not signed by a Deputy it cannot be cashed.  A Deputy receives his voucher every month and he can destroy it or he need not present it for payment.  I suggest to these Deputies, if they are honest, that that is a way for them; they need not cash three or four of these vouchers every year.  They are not drawing on the funds in the Exchequer if they do not cash them, and they will not be doing any injury to the taxpayer or to themselves.  If they think they are receiving too much at present, that is a simple way out for Deputies who make this comparison with old age pensioners or any other section of the community.</P>
    <P>I think it is rank Bolshevism to be talking in that way, because at no time could the means of livelihood of different sections of the community be compared.  You cannot make all men equal; all of them have not the same brains and intelligence.  Different sections of the community will never be on <Col N="348" /> an equal footing.  It has been tried out in some countries, but it is now going in the other direction again.  Our duty is to see that no section of the community suffers from want or destitution. But it is not our duty to bring the allowance given to old age pensioners up to that paid to Deputies. It is not the duty of the State to do that, and it can never be claimed to be the duty of the State.</P>
    <P>I say that Deputies are opposing this increase purely on political grounds. They are entitled to do that if they wish.  They do it because they believe that their constituents are not satisfied with this proposal.  But, as Deputy Dillon pointed out, constituents will never be satisfied.  The public are the worst paymasters in existence; they will never pay a fair price for anything.  I made a calculation that, with this increase, Deputies will be costing their constituents about 5d. or 6d. per head.  I am sure that, if Deputies are doing their duty at all, they are giving very good service to their constituents for that sum.  This increase will not mean more than 1½d. per head in each constituency.  I do not know whether that is a fair calculation or not.  But I suggest that, with the increase in expenses, Deputies' services to their constituents would be very much reduced if the increase were not given.</P>
    <P>Mention was made yesterday by some Deputies of a scheme in operation for a number of years in other countries, such as Australia and Great Britain, under which an allowance, in certain circumstances, is given to ex-members of Parliament and to the widows of members.  I suggest that such a scheme as this should be considered. I trust the Minister will, on the Committee Stage, bring in an amendment for the purpose of putting such a scheme into operation.  The scheme in Great Britain does not cost the taxpayer one penny.  The members of the British House of Commons contribute each month; there is so much a month stopped from their allowances and put in the fund.  If a member dies while in the service of the House his widow or dependents get an annual allowance, provided their income does <Col N="349" /> not exceed a certain figure.  The principle I suggest is a good one.  If a member of the House is over 60 years of age and his income does not reach a specified figure annually, he gets an allowance out of the fund.  The scheme has worked out well in Great Britain. Seven members of the House operate it.  It has worked out well in the interests of those who find themselves in particularly bad circumstances through no fault of their own.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said about speeches we made in the past in relation to salaries.  I do not believe I ever made a speech of that type, but, as a member of a Party, some members of which did make such speeches, I may say I never thought there was anything in them. Whatever speeches were made, we know, after 20 years here, that no member of this House ever made any money through being a member.  I do not care to what Party he belongs, no member of the Dáil ever left the House the richer of being a member.  Indeed, a great many left it far poorer than when they came into it.  We have seen from time to time where Deputies have died while being members of the House and their dependents found themselves in very bad circumstances.  It would be well to help them in so far as we can do so.</P>
    <P>I suggest that there is something important in this scheme, that the Minister should examine it, and he should make provision on the Committee Stage to stop each month from Deputies' allowances whatever is needed to build up a fund and have it available for necessitous cases that may arise from time to time.  The poorest member of the community may become a member of the House; he need not be the owner of property.  A man may find himself earning a decent livelihood in commerce, or industry or agriculture.  He will find, when he becomes a member of the House, that he is cut off from his outside employment. He may spend a number of years here and then he may be called out of the world and his dependents might find themselves in bad circumstances.</P>
    <P>Such a scheme as I have referred to would obviate a lot of distress and I think we should have one in operation. I am not suggesting it simply because <Col N="350" /> it is operating in the neighbouring island.  It is also in operation in Australia and there, too, it has worked to the advantage of the dependents of those who happened to be called away while members of Parliament, or those who, because of old age, were unable to provide for themselves or those depending on them.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposals are deserving of the serious consideration of every member of the House, irrespective of Party.  They are worthy of consideration, apart from the political aspect.  If Deputies are genuine, they will support these proposals.  If certain Deputies had not to face their constituents again, I have no doubt they would give an honest view about this proposal.  It is because of their idea that their constituents object to these proposals that they speak against the Bill.  Perhaps it is because they think it is good Party politics to play up this Bill against the Government Party that they object to the increase in these allowances.  I do not believe they will serve their interests in that way.  If Deputies want to be hail-fellow-well-met with their constituents all the time they should publish in the daily and weekly newspapers that they will not take any allowance for their service to the nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies have that way out all the time.  They need not cash their monthly allowances.  That is quite a simple way.  I am not accepting that procedure.  Deputies who may wish to do it need not cash two or three of their monthly vouchers if they think they are being paid more than they need.  I do not believe they are.  Any Deputy honestly doing the work in his constituency, coming up from the country and spending a week or half a week here and neglecting his business, whether it is in industry, commerce or on a farm, is losing by doing so.  Even if he has other means to keep him going, I believe he will find himself considerably out of pocket as the result of his services in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many Deputies who, as a result of the services they have given <Col N="351" /> to the country, are far poorer than when they came into this House.  That is no reason why some of us should accept something to which we are not entitled, something that is not justified. We should not do that if we think it is not justified.  I believe the Minister's proposals are quite justified.  If a Deputy gives the service he is expected to give to his constituents he should get a fair allowance to pay his out-of-pocket expenses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the strongest argument against the Bill is the debate itself, because there was no logic in the approach to this measure.  The charge of hypocrisy which Deputy Allen made is based on this, that we are all dealing with this measure politically arising out of the conditions in which it has been introduced. Deputy Allen seems to forget that this is a political institution. We come here to deal with politics.  There are times when, by arrangement, we agree to settle things on non-Party lines, but the occasions on which that happens are very rare. It lies within the province of the Minister to keep this debate free from the political atmosphere, if he so wills.  It would have been very simple to consult with the Parties or refer the matter to some outside body so that we could be spared a debate that has not been very meritorious or does not add to the reputation of the House as a Parliamentary institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been and there will be, in the course of this debate, a lot of hypocrisy.  It is true that probably every Deputy in the House will take the increase.  Everybody knows that. It is equally true that not all Deputies are equally in need of such an increase and it is because of this confusion between whether we are getting a salary or an allowance that we have this kind of atmosphere created to-day. Even Deputies who ordinarily are regarded as speaking in a logical manner seem to have lost their power of logic on this occasion.  May I say quite clearly that there are Deputies who are entitled to consideration in regard to an increased allowance and, either <Col N="352" /> as a member of a Party or as an individual member of the House, I would be prepared to go on any platform and support that consideration being given to them?  I say equally strongly that the majority of the members of this House, in existing conditions in this country, and because of the responsibility placed on this House, are not entitled to seek an increase in their allowances at present.  May I safeguard myself immediately against any suggestion that I am introducing personalities by saying that I regard myself as being one of that group?</P>
    <P>My objection to this Bill is that we, as Deputy McGilligan pointed out, find ourselves in a very difficult position, one which requires an effort from every section of the community to get our feet on stable ground again.  A little earlier in the year an appeal was made to the Government to give some assistance in that direction by taking certain steps in regard to the control of prices and an adjustment of wages and salaries.  That appeal received no response and now we are faced with the situation in which the paltry increases that were granted to workers are neutralised by further increases in the cost of living.  I suggest that, in the circumstances, we are only adding fuel to the fire by bringing forward a measure of this kind and seeking to justify our action by the continued increase in the cost of living.  The latest cost-of-living index figure shows that there has been an increase of 12½ points within a few months.  Over the last few months adjustments in wages have been made for important sections of workers.  They have been in the main patient.  They have tried to adjust their claims to the desirability of bringing about some stability in the economic situation, but they now find themselves in the position, owing to the fresh increases in the cost of living which I have mentioned, of falling back on the old course of trying to catch up on prices by seeking further wage increases.  They are forced to do that because of our failure, the failure of the Party which has got the responsibility and the power of dealing with that problem.</P>
    <P>When we entered on the emergency <Col N="353" /> the Government were quick enough to use that power to impose controls on the great masses of the people but they were weak in not imposing controls on the small minority until finally they created the situation which confronts us to-day.  When they are asked to use that power to bring about necessary readjustments as between wages and prices, they refuse to do so.  If on top of that situation we now are going to set a headline by increasing our own allowances then we have got to take the consequences.  If we want to see in this country a continuous condition of instability for some years, let us follow the course recommended to us by the Minister for Finance, to grab all we can from the general pool and set a headline for every other section of the community.  We have that headline set by various groups in industry and commerce but so far it has been repudiated by all sections of this House. Deputy Allen in his peculiarly illogical manner gave us an historical lecture on the position of the poor people and the distress which is general amongst them. He could have spared our feelings and spared himself the effort.  Nobody in his sane sense would suggest that an old age pensioner should be brought up to the level enjoyed by Deputies of this House.  Some of us may think they are entitled to it but we have not reached that stage yet.  What is suggested is that we ought to give an earnest of our good faith and, where possible, remedy and improve the position of these old age pensioners and similarly distressed people.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of saving £30,000 or even the total sum spent on this House.  That is a flea-bite so far as the national economy is concerned but we are expected in this House to set a headline and we are not setting a headline by this Bill.  Is it fair or equitable that we should come into this House and seize the opportunity of increasing the allowance or salary of every member of the House, when we know that a large number of members have other sources of income?  Is it fair, not from the point of view of the money available, but from the point of view of principle and the example we are giving to other sections of the community <Col N="354" /> and the responsibility we have to the most distressed sections of that community?  That is the problem involved in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to say that I believe that there are Deputies in this House&mdash;and I speak from personal experience, because I had the unpleasant duty of going into these matters&mdash;who, I am satisfied, cannot in present circumstances live up to any reasonable standard and carry out their duties on their present allowances.  These remarks are not confined to Deputies from the country.  But if we are going to deal with the difficult position of these Deputies, let us deal with it in respect of these Deputies alone and let us not at the same time place this House in the unenviable position of having persons outside saying that we are giving to members of the House, who are already in receipt of three or four sources of income, an addition to these incomes out of the Exchequer.  That could be quite easily done if the Minister were prepared to see what machinery could be devised to meet that particular problem.  Deputy Norton has mentioned the question of inquiring into the means of individual members of the House in order to solve that difficulty.  I appreciate that there might be some difficulty in applying the means test, seeing that there has been such strong objection to the application of a means test in regard to other sections of the community, but the difficulty might be solved without the application of any means test.  Ordinary members of the community frequently have got to make statements to the Revenue Commissioners in regard to their incomes in order to establish their claim for certain expenses, and the same method could be applied in regard to members of this House.  A statement of income from all sources might be supplied by each Deputy, and where it was clearly shown that a certain minimum was not available to Deputies, then they could be given such subsistence or such increased allowance as would be equitable in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The peculiar thing about the whole debate, as I said in opening, is the complete lack of logic exhibited by <Col N="355" /> certain Deputies.  Deputy Flanagan spoke very earnestly on this matter. He told us that he found it was impossible to keep completely clear of debt on the present allowance and yet he says that he is going to vote against the Bill.  That is a peculiar position in which we are putting members of the House.  Deputy Coogan, after a long historical survey, going back to the 14th century, told us that he believed that every member of the community should be in a position to enter this House if his constituents are prepared to send him here.  Then he went on to suggest that we should be prepared in certain circumstances to bear the expenses attached to a Deputy's duties ourselves, in other words, that there should be no allowance, and that we should make no provision for those who have no private incomes of their own.  Deputy Dillon does not want a salary but he wants an allowance, yet at the same time he does not seem to be prepared to measure out whether the allowance to-day is sufficient to meet the expenses of certain members because he feels that on principle he must vote against the measure as a whole.  Deputy Corry is in the most peculiar position of the lot; he usually is.  He is a member of the Party responsible for introducing the Bill but he makes a violent attack on Dublin Deputies.  He does not think that they are entitled to any allowance whatever and so far as any claim arises for expenses, he thinks they can arise only in respect of a Deputy coming from the country.  I agree with that in the main, but Deputy Corry will then go and vote for the Bill to give increases to the Dublin Deputies the same as anybody else.  Is not that wholly farcical and illogical?  Surely we should have found some simpler way of dealing with this.</P>
    <P>We are told that we are hypocritical because we listen to the viewpoint of our constituents on this Bill, and that, whether we like it or not, we are going to vote against it.  Is not that what we are supposed to do here?  We are supposed to represent the people who voted to put us here.  If they have any strong objection to their representatives <Col N="356" /> taking this action at the moment, that is a reason why we should reconsider the matter.  I am as quick as anybody to take an unpopular line.  I have often done so.  I think that I am doing the right thing on this particular issue.  We are in the rather peculiar position of being our own paymasters.  We are in the position of fixing our own salaries and fixing them out of other people's money.  For that reason we should be very careful not to bring odium on our Party or upon ourselves as individual members of the House.  A number of Deputies have reminded us that if there is any feeling in the country that we are not giving service in this House and if the Parliamentary institutions are not serving the purpose they are intended to serve, the people to blame for that are the members themselves who, in the course of inter-Party warfare, indulge in all kinds of attack and criticism.  All that is retained in the minds of the people outside and is directed not so much against Parties or individuals but against the institution itself.  From that point of view I think it is worth while trying to find a way out of this impasse.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that, whatever may be the result of a division on this Bill, it is not going to affect the next election.  The Government Party is not going to lose the election merely because they carry this Bill through by the weight of their numbers, but I believe that the carrying through of the Bill will lower a little more the prestige of this House as well as that of the members, irrespective of the Party they belong to.  It may be quite a good question to ask why the members of the Government Party take, if you like, the risk of trying to force through this Bill when, from their point of view, as they told the members of the Opposition Parties, it is good politics to take the opposite line.  I think that has been symptomatic of the Government Party for some time.  On numerous occasions in this House they have shown themselves completely incapable of appreciating or understanding many of the problems which face the ordinary people of the country.  Of course, they may tell me <Col N="357" /> that that is not so because they have got back after the elections.  They have, because they have fought on some other question.  In the next election the effect of this Bill may be very slight.  At the elections the politicians who come along will have some other issue on which to fight the election, and this Bill will be forgotten.  If the Government Party think that they will not feel the full blast of the line they are taking on this Bill at the next election, why will they not stop and think for a moment as to the headline this House is setting for the great masses of the people?</P>
    <P>I have to approach this not merely as a member of the House, but as a trade union official.  I do not know how I can go back to the members of my own union and tell them that their claims and demands for wages have got to be related to the general economy of the country, in view of the fact that we are now doing the very thing that I am to ask them not to do.  This is a very serious problem.  It is not merely a question of voting ourselves an increase, but you have the contrast of our attitude to the old age pensioners, to the widows and to the orphans. What we are doing on this Bill is, we are opening the doors wide to the very thing which the Minister for Finance frequently warns us against, the chasing of wages after prices, of inflation and of continuous instability. The amount involved so far as the Bill is concerned is not a great deal, but what we must look to are its possible effects upon other major questions.</P>
    <P>I think it would be advisable for the Minister not to listen to the viewpoint of members of his own Party, because they are naturally inclined to take a certain line, but to listen to those who, like myself, quite frankly say that there are certain others who are more entitled to consideration.  The majority in this House should not be put in the position of having to carry responsibility&mdash;even though they carry responsibility for voting against it&mdash;of fixing their own salaries out of other people's money, while at the same time appealing to the masses of the people to be content with what they have got, to be moderate in their demands, and <Col N="358" /> in advising large groups of old age pensioners, widows and orphans that they have got to adjust their needs to the public purse.  The public purse is not going to be affected very much as a result of this Bill, but public morale will be weakened very much by the action taken by this House on it.</P>

      <P>There is an old saying that &ldquo;those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad.&rdquo; The Fianna Fáil Government is mad on spending money.  Increases are given everywhere, whether required or not.  Fianna Fáil came into office as the poor man's Government, but since then they have made many people poor and they are prepared to go out of office as the rich man's Government because they are helping the rich more than the poor.  This is going to cost the country £30,000.  Some member of the Fianna Fáil Party spoke about hypocrisy.  The real hypocrisy is in calling the money which Deputies get an allowance instead of a salary.  If it was called a salary it would be subject to income-tax.  Why was there an extra tax put on tobacco and on cigarettes this year?  Was it to meet the demands of the old age pensioners? One Fianna Fáil Deputy did not want the name of the old age pensioners mentioned.  I am not surprised.  I know he was ashamed because the old age pensioners have been let down. The &ldquo;means test&rdquo; is still held against the old age pensioners, especially those who have worked hard and honestly during their lives.  Because they were industrious during life many of them have been deprived of the old age pension when they reached the age of 70.  They will now have to pay an extra 4d. or 5d. for their piece of tobacco.  What will they think of this increase?  A number of years ago an old age pensioner was able to get two ounces of better tobacco than he can get to-day for 6d., and he had a box of matches thrown in as a present.  Will the farmers appreciate the increases that are being given?  Will the small farmers who have to live for 12 months on the little income they make in six months appreciate it?  I think not. They will have to bear their portion of the increases.  What will the labourer <Col N="359" /> or the road worker think of it?  It is only a few months ago that the road workers were offered the magnificent sum of 2d. a day increase.  Deputies are now offered an increase of £3 a week many of whom have never asked for it.  The poor people whom I have referred to have to bear the high cost of living.  In my part of the country there are hundreds of people trying to exist on a ration.  The ration for seven days would not be sufficient to maintain a working man for two days. I know that because I have been working all my life.  I was never afraid to work.  There are other classes.  There are poor unfortunate people who cannot get work, who are living on a few shillings a week dole.  There are others who are living on a few shillings a week home assistance but if they smoke tobacco or drink tea they have to pay portion of these increases that the Minister is asking for.</P>
      <P>I know from experience that the allowance or what I call the salary of £480 a year is quite sufficient for any T.D.  I work just as hard for the people who elected me as any Fianna Fáil T.D. or any T.D. of any other Party.  Deputy O'Leary claimed here last night that he is the poorest member of the Dáil.  I dispute that title with him.  I have no means of any kind.  I have not even a house of my own.  Deputy O'Leary is one of the most admirable men in the House and certainly one of the most honest and a credit to the people who elected him. He lives in a labourer's cottage.  It is his home, a cottage with roses at the door.  Deputy O'Leary is proud to live in a humble home like that and the salary of £480 did not turn his head and it is not going to turn mine either.</P>
      <P>I have to leave my home at 6 o'clock in the morning when the Dáil is sitting.  I arrive in Dublin, if I am lucky, at 6 p.m.  I am at Leinster House every morning at 9.30.  I leave it at 10.30 p.m.  I usually return to my home on Saturday and I find about 100 letters waiting for me.  When I return from Mass at 12 o'clock on Sunday I work continuously until 12 midnight. It is a whole-time job with me and still I think £480 is sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" /> The excuse has been put forward that these increases are due to the high cost of living.  If the cost of living comes down, will these increases be reconsidered with a view to a reduction? I mentioned that I have no home of my own.  I live with my son who is married.  I gave over my farm to him before he got married because I want to see people getting married young.  But, if I have not a home of my own, I have a home in the heart of the people of West Cork who elected me and that home will be there for me as long as God spares me my health. As the people know, I work hard and honestly for them, despite the activities of political adventurers who are trying to disturb me there, and I do not care if these political adventurers come from Laoighis, Offaly, the Bog of Allen or anywhere else.</P>
    <P>This is the meanest proposal that has been brought before the House since the last Government, in 1924, reduced the old age pensions by 1/-and at the same time reduced the income-tax.  They took it from the poor old people to give it to the rich. That act of theirs put them out of office some years later and so will this action of Fianna Fáil to-day contribute to their being put out of office in the course of time.  May God speed the day when that happens, as the people are sick of politicians of all kinds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess I was very disappointed with Deputy Allen's speech.  He is a Deputy who invariably makes an intelligent and often constructive contribution to the debates, but on this occasion he allowed himself to drift into a lot of side issues and irrelevancies, which really had no bearing at all on the subject matter of the debate.  He challenged the Opposition with expressing views influenced by their constituents.  After all, every Deputy is influenced to some extent&mdash;and some to a very large extent&mdash;by the attitude of their constituents. On an important issue of this nature it is inevitable that Deputies will be influenced in that way.  If constituents have taken strong views on this issue, it is almost inevitable, because they have been left completely in the dark as to the case <Col N="361" /> for the proposals enshrined in this measure.</P>
      <P>I am sure that these strong views are not confined to supporters of the Opposition Parties.  Supporters of the Government Party hold very strong views on these proposals and I do not blame them, as they have been left completely in the dark.  The feeling amongst constituents has been engendered by the present scale of taxation, which impinges on so many sections of the people.  The cost of living also has been an important factor in influencing the attitude of our constituents, as the present high cost of living has reduced very substantially the purchasing power of money and, as a result, those on the lower income scale have been reduced in some cases to actual poverty and want.  While conditions of that kind prevail amongst some sections of our people, proposals of this kind cannot be justified on the grounds of equity or morality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to approach this question objectively and personally.  I do not want to make capital out of these proposals. My main objection to the measure it that it is not approached in the proper way.  We set up a Labour Court to investigate the claims of workers, and there both employers and workers have given expert evidence in regard to conditions of employment, the present cost of living, the impact of taxation and so on, and after an impartial hearing of that evidence a decision has been given.  We set up a tribunal years ago to investigate the claims of the Civil Service. We are all familiar, with those claims, as Deputies have been circularised on many occasions about them.  Likewise, wage fixing machinery has been established to deal with employers and employees in various trades and occupations. Yet, when it comes to fixing the allowances of Deputies, the Government boldly and bluntly bring in this measure without consultation with Opposition Deputies and, so far as we know, without consultation with any Deputies.  We do not know what happened behind the scenes, whether the rank and file of the Fianna Fáil Party were consulted, but we do know <Col N="362" /> that the advice of no Opposition Deputy or leader was sought.</P>
    <P>In all seriousness, it is incumbent on us as a legislative body to arrive at right precedents and follow a proper and correct course of action especially in relation to the expenditure of public money.  We have ourselves established precedents in connection with the Labour Court and other wage-fixing tribunals.  Surely we should ourselves have followed the same precedent in proposals of this character? Deputies should be informed of the reasons for these proposals.  To what extent does the present cost of living impinge on these allowances, to what extent have these factors increased their expenditure, to what extent have hotel expenses increased, and so on? The Dáil is entitled to information on those points and the proper course would have been to give that information when introducing the Bill.  The Minister did not make any case at all and, so far as I can recall, no Deputy opposite made any case for it.  I thought Deputy Allen would endeavour to make a case, but he drifted into irrelevancies instead.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Inquiry which examined this whole question in 1938 decided unanimously that Deputies should be paid only their out-of-pocket expenses and that whatever allowance they were given should not be considered as a salary or as an aid to their livelihood.  I assume that the Minister accepts that definition, as he uses the word &ldquo;expenses&rdquo; in this measure and has adopted entirely the phraseology of the original Act.  That being so, the question arises as to what is a reasonable amount to allow a Deputy for current expenses.  We have no means of gauging that, as we have been given no data.  The data is available to the Minister in his Department but he has not consented to supply a single item of information that would help us in arriving at a just estimate of the amount required to meet Deputies' expenses in existing circumstances.  I submit it was the Minister's duty to supply that information when introducing the measure.  In the absence of such information, any Deputy inclined to be fair-minded in discussing this <Col N="363" /> measure objectively is at a grave disadvantage. The increase in the cost of living undoubtedly has affected the expenses.  There are special circumstances relating to Deputies in various parts of this country which deserve examination, but we are not in a position to understand those circumstances, as we have no criterion.  The Minister refrained&mdash;I do not suggest refused&mdash;from giving any information that would enable us to engage in a constructive discussion.</P>
    <P>Personally, I think the amount proposed is too high, even allowing for the increases that have taken place in the cost of living, in taxation, and so on.  I think we should be exceedingly conservative about fixing an extravagant figure.  Perhaps I am old fashioned, but I believe in the principle of voluntary service to this State and I think there is quite a big number of people to-day who are prepared to render service of that nature to this country without looking for extravagant rewards, financially or otherwise. It is in our own interests, if we are to survive as a democratic country, that that spirit should be preserved and that such people should be encouraged to give this type of service.  If we capitalise political service, it may attract to the Dáil some very undesirable people, who will be supported by private organisations outside, and eventually we may find that our present democratic status is disappearing and we may be confronted some fine day with the possibility of having to exist and survive under a dictatorship. These are considerations which should be examined very closely by Deputies, as it is largely on these considerations that I propose to vote against this measure.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan to-day referred to the publication on national income and expenditure issued some years ago by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  That publication showed that the majority of our people are existing on very small incomes.  There should be some relationship between the allowances given to Deputies and the income of the ordinary citizen.  But nobody, not even the Minister, dare <Col N="364" /> contest that the allowance which it is proposed to give Deputies in future has any relation to the figures given in that return on national income published in 1942 or 1943.</P>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor in 1938 made the case for the 1938 Bill, which increased the allowances from £360 to £480, that the increase would bring a better type of individual into politics. We have had two general elections since, and it is a matter for the Minister to say whether the increased allowance has raised the standard of public representation or not.  I admit that it should be our aim to attract to public life men of the highest character, honour and capacity, and I admit also that it is our duty to pay these men a reasonable allowance, but I say that the allowance which it is now proposed to fix is too high and should be regarded as being rather on the extravagant scale.  I hold, furthermore, by virtue of our past experience, that the increased allowance will not attract the men which it is the desire of the Minister and of every member of the Government and of the House to bring into public life.  What is needed more than anything else at present is an increase in the earning capacity of our people, so that they will be able to meet the very high expenditure which they have to bear.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that our constituents had very strong views and very strong opinions about these proposals, and they hold these very strong views and opinions largely because of their realisation of the very high expenditure, the huge expenditure, I may say, which they have to bear at present, and they see no hope of any lessening or lowering of the burden in the coming years.  I seriously suggest to the Minister that it is not in circumstances such as these that he should impose this additional taxation, small though it may be, and furthermore that he should defer consideration of the Bill to a later stage, until such time as the Dáil is provided with all the information and data which I asked for in the beginning and which I suggest it is the duty of the Minister to supply to the House.  When we have all that information available for <Col N="365" /> study, we will be in a position to form a definite opinion on whether there is any justification or merit in the proposal. In the absence of that information it is impossible for Deputies to arrive at any fair or just conclusion with regard to these proposals, and, as well, I should say that if information of that kind were supplied, it might conceivably allay the very strong opinions held by our constituents at present, although I still hold that the moment for the introduction of this measure was rather ill-chosen and ill-timed.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister can be justified, on either moral or ethical grounds, in imposing this amount, however small, on the people in the present circumstances, in the absence of any explanation as to the real reasons for the introduction of this measure, because there must be a reason or a motive.  The Minister must have figures on which he based this calculation with regard to the increase because the Civil Service figures and percentages which he quoted yesterday do not bear any relation to this problem.  You cannot relate salary to allowances and expenditure.  If civil servants have demonstrated that they were entitled to an increase, in one case, of 37½ per cent., and, in another case, of 40 per cent., that increase or the reasons for giving it, cannot be related to the reasons for giving this increase in allowance to Deputies.  They are two completely different things. Civil servants have to live on their salaries&mdash;their sole means of livelihood and upkeep.  With Deputies, it is a completely different matter&mdash;the allowance is intended to cover only out-of-pocket expenses.  If the Minister wants to justify this increase, he will need to find a different yardstick from that which he mentioned yesterday, and I suggest that he should adjourn this measure for a year or perhaps two years until circumstances have changed and improved, and then reintroduce it, and supply us with the information necessary to form an accurate and clear understanding of its implications and its effects on the people, and on Deputies in particular.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Since my advent to <Col N="366" /> Dáil Éireann in 1927, I have made it a practice, when major issues were under discussion, to give reasons why I voted for or against.  I regard this Bill as a major issue and I want to advance one or two reasons why I intend to vote against it.  I recall that, in 1937, a committee of the House was established, the terms of reference of which, I think, were to the effect that it should inquire into the proposal to raise the allowances of Deputies from £30 to £40 per month.  I was summoned as a witness before that committee or commission and was examined there as to the expenses incurred by me by reason of being a Dáil Deputy.  I gave as close an estimate as I possibly could of my outgoings and my income, and I discovered that, after a lapse of some years, I lost, in salary alone, something like £1,040.  These figures can be verified by reference to my employers.</P>
      <P>Relating it in the sequence in which I put it before this committee, when asked to give my reasons for objecting to any increase in the then allowance of £30 per month, I felt then, as I feel now, that the raising of the allowance would mean that it would be regarded as a salary by many people and that it would have the effect of attracting to membership of the Dáil a most undesirable class of person or candidate. I was reminded by a member of the committee&mdash;Mr. Luke Duffy, who is now a Senator&mdash;that the then allowance of £30 per month would be attractive to the kind of person I envisaged.  I think I told Senator Duffy on that occasion that I agreed with him, but I added that the additional £10 would make it still more attractive and would possibly result in a still more undesirable type of candidate contesting elections. I have no reason, and have heard no reason so far, to change my views in that respect.  I expressed on that occasion my disapproval of the increase in the allowance and I have given at least one of the reasons for my objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most members of this Dáil can easily envisage the type of person I have referred to.  That type of person is present in nearly every community. Those of us who have anything to do <Col N="367" /> with public bodies, such as municipal bodies, etc., in this country, must know that there is always the type of member who proclaims to the four winds of Erin that he is the only person who has any interest in the poor, in the infirm, in the old, whereas he has only one interest&mdash;his own material advancement. However, by proclaiming himself to be the only person who has all those interests at heart he is able to have himself elected to successive corporations or county councils.  Anybody who has had the experience I have had must recognise that that type of individual is to be found pretty frequently in this country.  I am not going to mention any person in particular, either in this House or outside, but I know that these persons are to be found on the public boards of our cities and in rural areas at the present time just as they were 40 or 50 years ago when that type was immortalised in one of our Abbey plays by the character known as &ldquo;The Eloquent Dempsey.&rdquo;  We know that type of person can command attention and a lot of votes in various constituencies. He is the type of person who will float with the tide, but who never has the courage to swim against it.  He can change his course to suit any tide.  I want to emphasise that part of my objection, because I feel that &mdash;although I do not care one jot whether it is shared by anybody else in this House or not&mdash;my view is shared by many decent people in this country. I hold the view, too, that there are many civic-minded citizens in this country who are even prepared to come into Dáil Eireann and to work for the good of the community with very little remuneration whatsoever except that which covers their bare expenses. When I say &ldquo;expenses&rdquo; I mean return railway fares and also some little extra allowance to compensate for hotel expenses, etc., in Dublin.  We all know the facts because all of us have suffered&mdash;that is all of us who come to Dublin week after week and who maintain close attendance here.  I concede readily that the personal allowance does not fully represent the expenses generally undertaken by a Deputy in <Col N="368" /> Dáil Eireann.  I am fully aware of that. At the same time I feel that there are many good and useful citizens in this country who would be honoured by membership in Dáil Eireann.  There is no use concealing it&mdash;every one of us here has some little pride in the fact that we are members of this House. We are proud of it.  We heard some outbursts here which do not at all reflect honour on Dáil Eireann as the first assembly in this country&mdash;rather does it represent the contrary.  I have felt humiliated from time to time in this House because of the conduct of some of the members, in debate and otherwise.  I believe, on the other hand, that there are men in this country who would, at the moment, be prepared to take up the work in Dáil Eireann and who would not look upon it as a livelihood, who would not regard it from the point of view of wages or salary, but from the point of view that the highest honour which it is possible to confer on any man in this State is to be elected to serve his country in Dáil Eireann.</P>
    <P>This discussion has not, in my view, shed any lustre either on members generally or on the House in particular. I consider that this has been conducted right through in a sordid manner with the exception of a few illuminating examples such as we had here to-day from some of our members&mdash;Deputy McGilligan and others&mdash;who certainly contributed to this debate in a manner befitting the high principles which most of us in Dáil Éireann have always stood for and will continue to stand for. I sincerely hope that the tone of the debate in this House will never reach the low level, I would almost say the filthy level, which it has reached in the last few days.  I deprecate as strongly as I possibly can and I object as strongly and as thoroughly as I possibly can to the debasing influence of a debate of this character.  The effects which it must have on those outside this House and the effects which it must have on many of our public and civic-minded citizens are nothing compared with the ill-effects it will have on certain bodies outside this House who do not believe at all in the constitutional methods adopted here but <Col N="369" /> who believe in introducing perhaps Eastern ideologies into this country. Their effect will be to stimulate them in their efforts in that direction.</P>
    <P>I would make a strong appeal to those members who have, in my view, so disgraced and discredited the honour of this House to think the matter over before they commit themselves again in that way.  I hope these words will be driven home to those who have offended in this connection within the past couple of days.  I have already said that there are civic-minded people in this country who are prepared to serve in Dáil Éireann, even at some financial loss.  I want to emphasise that because in doing so I have a feeling that many of those men, with that high civic sense of responsibility, would be induced to come into an Assembly with which they feel it would be an honour to be associated.</P>

      <P>This overdose of Fianna Fáil generosity with the people's money has described a pretty wide circle throughout this little island and has taken in on all sides all types of individuals, from the lowest paid worker of this State to the highest paid State official.  It seems that now that we have by Acts of this Parliament given certain increases to other people, we have decided to come along and increase our own allowances and thus put ourselves in a better financial position.  The unfortunate thing is that, in this circle of increases, the increases to the lower paid individuals have not been quite sufficient and the increases to the higher paid individuals have been too much.  In this set of circumstances we would, however, like to see a fairer if not an even distribution of the increases that have been given so as to guarantee to everybody a living wage.  As that has not been the case so far we can come to only one conclusion on this matter, namely, that the increases which Deputies will be given, if this Bill becomes law, will certainly not be welcomed by the average taxpayer in this country.  It is a fact which is well known to every public representative <Col N="370" /> in this country that increases in salaries, even to the lowest paid workers, do not find favour with the community at large.  I for one had that experience at a time when I did back up, and when I was justified in so doing, increases for lower paid road workers.  I found out then that certain individuals throughout the country who are taxpayers were inclined to turn up their noses and say: &ldquo;Well, it is all very fine to give increases but where are we who have to pay going to get our increases from?&rdquo; What will be the opinion of the taxpayers when they see Deputies who, 15 years ago, we were told were overpaid at £360 a year, and who afterwards increased their allowance to £480, now increasing it to £624? What will the people say to this Parliament or to the Government who are responsible for bringing about this increase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very good time, I must admit, for anyone to play politics. Anyone who wishes to go to the crossroads or outside the chapel gates and point out that the Government are entirely responsible for bringing about this increase and that Deputies have not asked for it, will no doubt get a very enthusiastic hearing from the taxpayers who will have to foot the bill. The Opposition Parties seem to be united in saying that this increase is unnecessary and unwanted.  I think the real test of the sincerity of any Deputy will come when he receives his first cheque for £52.  We will then see how much honesty there is in the criticism of the Opposition that there is no necessity for this extra allowance and that the fault lies with the Government for giving the increase.  In a month's time or in two months' time, when this Bill becomes an Act and the extra allowance is paid, we will see who are the Deputies who are really honest in their opposition.  It is a pity that some outside tribunal or committee was not set up to go into the question of Deputies' allowances, because we feel like the person who gave himself pardon for his own sins when we set about increasing our own salaries.  The people will not believe that even those <Col N="371" /> of us who opposed this measure are sincere.  They will believe that this increase is not coming fast enough for 19 out of every 20 Deputies.</P>
    <P>Whether the allowance of £480 is sufficient is a very doubtful question. We must all admit that the expenses of the average hard-working Deputy are very high.  The Deputy who sets about his duties in an honest hard-working manner, who does his best for the constituency he represents, who contributes as well as he can to the debates in this House, and who acts as an errand boy, because that is what he really is, going from Department to Department in connection with matters in which his constituents are interested, we must admit has very little left which he can call his own out of the £480.  In addition to that, as has been said, there are the subscriptions which have to be made for charitable purposes in his constituency. He has to meet active supporters of his on fair days and market days.  He has to meet the visitors who call to see him in the Dáil.  Then there are the letters he has to answer, each answer taking a 2½d. stamp.  Added to all these things he may have to keep a motor car on the road and pay for its overhaul.  When all these things are taken into consideration, we must admit that £480 is not too much for the average Deputy.</P>
    <P>Then we must compare the Deputy who works hard for his constituents with the Deputy who makes his appearance in this House three or four times in the year and who, we are told, really makes no contact with his constituency. The latter Deputy should have plenty of money left out of his £480.  It is a very comfortable position for any man who can so blindfold his constituents that they will elect him at election after election and allow him to carry on in such a manner.  It is therefore very hard to strike the exact figure which a Deputy should get, because one may deserve £1,000 a year and another man may not deserve £100. It is not the duty of the Government, however, to deal with that matter.  It is the duty of constituents to see that such a Deputy as I have mentioned <Col N="372" /> will not get their votes at the next election; that he will remain at home and that somebody who is willing to work will come into this House.  Candidly, I regard this allowance as a salary.  When we look at it in the way I have mentioned, we will see that Deputies are entitled to an increase.  But, when we see the number of people in this country who have not anything like £480 a year, then we must decide that, if there is to be any sacrifice made so that these people will be given a decent standard of living, the sacrifice will be made at the top.</P>
    <P>So much has been said about the old age pensioners and the widows and orphans that there is no need for me to mention them.  But, as well as being interested in the old age pensioners, I am particularly interested in the young man who is willing and anxious and eager to work and for whom this State cannot find employment; the man who would be glad to bring up his family on £3 or £4 a week and who would regard that as a comfortable wage.  That is the individual in whom I am interested mainly, because he has no guarantee that he will get a weekly wage corresponding to the increase that Deputies are to get under this Bill when it becomes law.  I say that this increase should not be given until we provide a livelihood for the people who have to leave this country or for those people who have to line up at the labour exchanges and draw 14/-, 15/-or 20/- per week as a dole.  I think we should spend this £23,000 odd in some other and perhaps more useful way.  It is not an awful lot, and it will not go very far, we may be told.  A fortnight or three weeks ago we voted other increases to the extent of £20,000 and we were told that amount was not much and would not go far, but these little amounts eventually come to quite a lot and they would fill many a gap in giving employment to people who richly deserve it.</P>
    <P>The position of the taxpayers never seems to have given a lot of worry to the Government.  The people who have to foot the bills and provide, by the sweat of their brows or the hard working of their brains, the money to increase the allowances to Deputies and Senators and State officials, never got <Col N="373" /> one thought from the Government.  No Government would be justified in giving £12 a month of an increase to a Deputy and, at the same time allow a young man of 21 years of age, a man who has a right to a livelihood here, to line up every week at the labour exchange for a few shillings dole or else migrate to England to get employment there.  There is no justification for increasing Deputies' allowances, and I will oppose it, but I am sensible enough to realise that, with the Government's over-all majority, this Bill may be taken as having gone through the House already.  We may be satisfied that we are just wasting our breaths here when we criticise it, but we have been sent here by our constituents to oppose legislation which is detrimental to the general good, and that is our intention and that is what we will do.</P>
    <P>If this Bill was submitted to a Referendum, what would be the position? If an election had to be fought on the question of whether Deputies are entitled to £480 or £624, I wonder what the people would answer? The average man, I must admit, looks upon a Deputy as being a very well paid individual.  I wonder would the average person vote in favour of the Party who would tell him that in this country, that is overloaded with taxation and underloaded with employment, Deputies and Senators are entitled to additional remuneration.  The ambition of most people in this State seems to be to get out of it.  They are quite willing to work, but they cannot get it here.</P>
    <P>I wonder do the Government realise that this measure is unpopular and is not acceptable to the people.  I am sorry to say that power seems to get to the heads of people when they are voted to Parliament in sufficient numbers and cannot be unseated from their thrones.  It has taken time and hard work in the constituency I represent to unseat the Fianna Fáil Party.  I come here representing 17,000 electors in County Mayo and those people have sent me here to oppose measures of this kind.  They say that £480 per annum is quite sufficient for a Deputy to live on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="374" /> There is a feeling in this House that, if we have not good salaries, we will not bring in the type of person who would add to the honour of this Assembly.  Any man on the register who can get people to propose and second him, who has a few assenters to his nomination paper, and who can command the respect of a sufficient number of voters, is entitled to sit here.  It makes no odds what his record has been if he can convince people sufficiently to trust him to improve their standard of living.  That man is quite entitled to come here and back up the people who sent him.  Any man can add to the honour of this House by using his intelligence to see that laws are passed here which will further the interests of the community and which will bring about a better living standard for every individual in the State.  Anyone who does not do that, no matter what his record may be and no matter from what family he comes, will not be much of an addition to the House.</P>
    <P>I have heard some Deputies talking about how valuable they are to their constituents and the immense number of letters they have to write.  I believe this is quite true, but I thoroughly agree with Deputy McGilligan when he says that this should not be a Deputy's duty at all.  I think a Deputy's duty is in this House and he should not have to run continually from one Department to another trying to get from each Department concessions which an average citizen should ordinarily get without the interference of a Deputy.  Take the case of an old age pensioner.  A pensioner is recommended by the local committee for 10/- a week and he is also recommended, perhaps, by the local investigation officer.  Both recommendations are sent to the pensions section of the Department and the recommendation is turned down and the old person may get only 6/- a week.  The person concerned then gets in touch with the local Deputy and, as a result of his representations, there is an increase of 2/-or 3/- a week.  That old age pensioner should definitely get as much attention in the Department through his own representations as he could by having <Col N="375" /> a Deputy to act as spokesman on his behalf.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the immense amount of work that has to be done by Deputies living in rural areas in regard to drains, roads, etc., and in regard to which representations have to be made to the Department of Public Works.  I maintain that when a job has to be done in a locality after four or five people have put their names to a petition and sent in a list specifying the amount of work that has to be done to the Government Department, that work should be done without calling for any interference by a Deputy.  It seems that the Departments of this State have got into such a state of chaos, such a state of official bungling that a Deputy has to be called in to try to unravel some of the threads of red tape in which the Departments have become involved until eventually, by the persistent efforts of Deputies, the work is done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to point out that the real duty of a Deputy, for which he should get an allowance, should be discharged in this House, but unfortunately I find as well as everybody else, even though I have been only 18 months in this House, that this is not a part-time job.  Sometimes seven days of the week and 22, 23 or 24 hours of the day of my time, have to be devoted to the work of travelling all over the constituency listening to complaints from many people.  Some of the complaints, I must admit, are at times groundless but still we have to put up with all this.  Despite all that, I maintain that a Deputy is well and truly paid on an allowance of £480 per year free of income-tax&mdash;a concession which is not given to other people whose salaries come from Government sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One suggestion has been made from both sides of the House which I think is worthy of consideration.  That is, that some sort of superannuation fund should be opened so that, in the event <Col N="376" /> of the death of a member of the House, his widow, orphans or relatives, could be given some small allowance.  I think nobody in this House would grudge the contribution which we would have to make every year or every month to such a useful fund.  We have been told that a fund of that character has been established in England.  I confess that I do not know how it operates but I think it is a very wise and very useful suggestion.</P>
    <P>I think there is not much more to be said on this measure because I am long enough in this House to realise that this Bill will become an Act of the Oireachtas whether the Opposition likes it or not.  When, in time, Deputies are called on to answer for their action in supporting the Bill down the country, we hope they will be honest enough to tell the people: &ldquo;We increased our own salaries when we increased the salaries of everybody else.&rdquo; I hope that they will be candid and frank enough to admit that the old cry of £1,000 a year being enough for anybody, the old tale that we were not going to model ourselves upon empires, was only used as a means of getting into power, so that they could get their hands on the money and on the power of government.  Our Party will oppose this measure and vote against it.  Perhaps the real test of the honesty of Parties may come when the Government decides to pay the first cheques of £52 a month.  Then the people will see who wants to take the extra £12 and who does not because, as I understand it, there is nothing to prevent any Deputy from returning the extra allowance to the Exchequer.  Time alone will tell who is honest and who is not in this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly I should like to say that I am opposing this Bill. I am opposing it because of the fact that the monthly payments made to Deputies are described as allowances. I do not subscribe to the views, the facts and the figures that some Deputies have given to justify even the present payment of £480 a year.  I think it would be childish for anybody to assert, and still more childish for anybody to believe, that many members of this House spend their annual <Col N="377" /> allowances as Deputies on their constituents or in making tours of their constituencies.  Personally, I must admit that I regard the payment which is described as an allowance as a salary because, if I am to do my job fully and do justice to the people I represent, I must take at least six days per week or even seven days per week to do that.  I may be prejudiced, in so far as my peculiar position as a rural Deputy demands that I should take the entire week to do the job.  I think it must be admitted that it is easier for certain people to become Deputies and to sit in Dáil Éireann than for others.  It has been pointed out very forcibly that the majority of rural Deputies must travel to Dublin on Monday and that they do not get back to their respective homes until the following Saturday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My submission is that if we enter on a Parliamentary career as Deputies there must be some compensation for the loss of the professions or trades which in the normal course of events we would pursue.  If rural Deputies have not farms, publichouses or other sources of income, it is absolutely impossible for them to exist on what is now described as an allowance. Again, I assert that to call that monthly payment an allowance is absolute fraud.  If the payments were described as salaries and that everybody received these payments as salaries, I for one would be prepared to support this measure, but so long as these payments are camouflaged under the name of allowances, I shall vote against the proposed increases.  I think, too, there should be some distinction made between the Deputy who has to travel up to Dublin to attend the Dáil and the man who is normally resident in Dublin.  If this is an allowance, I think an allowance should be made for subsistence, where necessary, because after all it is a question of keeping two homes in certain cases and the man who is fortunate enough to be elected for a Dublin constituency has the advantage of being able to go to his own home at night and in many cases of being able to take his meals in his own home during the day. There is a difference between his case and that of the rural Deputy who has <Col N="378" /> to come up from the country to Dáil Éireann, who has to pay for all his meals while he is here and who has to pay for lodgings, sometimes for four or five nights.  As I said in the first instance, if some sort of scheme could be devised whereby these payments could be referred to as salaries, I would definitely vote for the Bill, but as long as they are camouflaged and described as allowances, I shall vote against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has lasted a very long time and to a great extent it has not been very edifying.  I do not propose to speak very long.  Strange enough, one of the reasons why I am opposing it is the opposite to that advanced by Deputy Corish in his opposition. I am opposing the Bill because I fear that the raising of the allowance by £12 a month is possibly going to put Deputies into the category of receiving a salary.  I consider that my constituents did me a great honour when they selected me to represent them in the Dáil.  I do not look upon my membership of the House as a profession.  I am a farmer and can make all the living that I want out of my farm.  I do not presume, or expect, to make anything out of my Parliamentary duties.  I think that the Government are wrong in bringing forward this proposal at this particular time.  A good case could be made for it and, on the other hand, a case might be made against it.  I think that Deputy Allen put his finger on the real point when he said that some Deputies were voting for it because their constituents wished them to do so.  Is not that the essential reason why a Deputy should vote for or against any measure?  My constituents certainly desire me to vote against it, and I believe that the majority of the constituents of all Deputies desire them to vote against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Government are largely to blame themselves for that attitude because more than 15 years ago they went around to every parish in the country spouting and shouting as heedlessly and as ignorantly as some of their followers have done in this House about the salaries, as they call them, that Deputies and Ministers were <Col N="379" /> receiving in 1931 and 1932.  I listened to them do that.  They made my head ache.  They were largely responsible for educating the people into the belief that Deputies and Ministers were overpaid, and were useless members of society almost.  It is hard to expect that poor people, old age pensioners and others in receipt of meagre incomes on which to support themselves would not make a comparison between the pecuniary position of a Minister or a Deputy and themselves. Sometimes those poor people are amazed to see a Minister or a Deputy drive up in a posh car to their doors to visit them.  In that condition of affairs it is natural to expect that people would wish us to vote against this.  I well remember an old saying that was current in the days of my youth, at a time when there were no motor cars or aeroplanes.  It was not very grammatical, but it ran something like this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Them that is rich can ride in chaises,</P>
    <P>Them that is poor can walk like blazes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the feeling expressed in these words exists, to some extent in the country amongst unfortunate poor people who look on £480 a year as extravagant luxury almost.  A good case should be made before we take it on ourselves to vote for an increase in our allowances.  I think the Government should not ask the House to do it.  It bemeans us to ask us to increase our own allowances.  I deprecate calling it anything else but an allowance. Deputies should be given whatever allowance is necessary to enable them to carry out their duties as Deputies without having to encroach on their private resources.  I can truthfully say that I spend every penny of the allowance that I get.  I do not use one penny of it for my own personal purposes.  If the proposal to increase the allowance to £624 is passed, I will take it, but I can assure the House that I will not spend any of it on my personal living.  I deprecate the suggestion that it should be possible to regard it as a salary, and there is that danger if it is increased to a figure <Col N="380" /> beyond that which a Deputy requires to carry out his duties.  I am voting against the proposal because my constituents desire me to do so.  I am here to carry out their wishes, and on every possible occasion I shall always vote as they desire me to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a pretty long debate on this question of allowances to members. It is a subject that has been debated in the House on a number of occasions.  There was a very long discussion on it in 1938 when the Government brought forward proposals to fix the allowances of Deputies at £480 a year.  That is now about nine years ago.</P>
      <P>Many things have changed in the world since then.  One of the things that has not changed is the necessity there is for a democratic State to make such arrangements that the representatives of the people will be enabled to do the work which they are elected to do, that is, to make laws and to keep an eye on the Executive.  Deputies have referred here to the many calls that are made upon their time in their capacity as members of this House. Some of them have emphasised that undue calls are made upon them to perform rather petty services for the people but most of them, I think, have emphasised that, apart from the performance of rather petty services, if a Deputy is to do his main work, find out what his constituents are thinking, discover for himself the main problems affecting their lives, come to the Dáil and represent them there either by vote or speech in the House, the present allowances are not fully adequate to meet his expenses.  That was said by practically every Deputy here, even by those who declared that they were going to vote against it.  I need not quote the Deputies but I think practically every one of them made that case.  The one thing they had to say against the proposition to increase Deputies' salaries at this time by 30 per cent. was that the time was not opportune.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exactly the same type of case was made in 1938 and the leaders of the chief Opposition took up the attitude then that the change should be made <Col N="381" /> in spite of the criticisms that were offered against it.  Deputy Dr. O'Higgins at that time, speaking on the Bill on the 24th November, 1938, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Having listened with patience and attention to the speeches in opposition to the Bill to-day, I am firmly convinced that I am doing right in supporting the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Let us be honest.  It is politically attractive to oppose this Bill. There is immense political temptation to oppose a Bill of this kind, and there is a feeling at the back of the minds of many that they will make sure of the £30, rather than come to grief by supporting any more.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These two quotations are from Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, Volume 73, columns 1039 and 1040 of the Dáil Debates of the 24th November, 1938.</P>
    <P>Deputy General Mulcahy, the Leader of the Opposition, also spoke on that occasion.  He was replying to criticisms, some of which came from his own benches, of the Government proposals to fix Deputies' allowances at £480 a year, and he said:-</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I welcome the fact that the Government has faced up to this question... I think that anybody who realises the importance of Parliamentary institutions, and of democratic Parliamentary institutions, and who realises the position that a Deputy occupies as the connection between the people and their problems and the Parliament, which can do so much either for good or ill, cannot in his heart of hearts but welcome the proposal that is embodied in this Bill to increase the allowance that will be at Deputies' disposal to enable them to discharge their duties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is at column 994, Volume 73.</P>
    <P>Again, he said, at column 999:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think it is not going too far to say that the increased assistance in this Bill simply takes the Deputies as they are at present, and puts on them the responsibility, and gives them the facilities for keeping in touch with their constituents.  If we <Col N="382" /> are to preserve democratic institutions and effective Parliamentary institutions in this country, we can only do it through machinery which will give us Deputies who feel their responsibilities, and are put into that position.  I think that this Bill does that, and as I say, I welcome the fact that the Government has approached the matter in this particular way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One of the criticisms that was made about this measure was as to the manner in which it was brought forward. It was said by several Deputies &mdash;Deputy Roddy and Deputy Larkin are the last that I remember saying it &mdash;that all Opposition Parties should have been consulted about this matter. Deputy Roddy went on to say that we should have something like an inquiry into the position of Deputies now as against 1938 to determine what increase in allowances would be necessary.  He indicated that if such course had been taken he would be inclined to recommend and to support the necessary changes.  He said that Deputies had no means of gauging the increase in the expenses of a Deputy in performing his-Parliamentary duties.  Is that credible?</P>
    <P>Is there any Deputy here who will say that the expenses of a Deputy who performs his duties have not increased by 30 per cent?  Are there not many Deputies in this Dáil who would say that the cost of living generally has increased even by much more than the official cost of living index indicates? No one would say in relation to any other class in the community that the costs of their activities, social and economic, have not increased by more than 70 per cent. since 1938.  The extreme criticism to which Fine Gael often gives vent is that in fact they have increased by more than 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>For many months during last winter I had long discussions with many classes of civil servants, going into this question of the cost of living and, after prolonged discussions the Government made propositions to the civil servants which, on a referendum being taken, the majority of the civil servants approved.  Having thus secured the approval of the Civil Service to a level <Col N="383" /> of salaries which they accepted-I am not saying they would not have wished for more&mdash;the Government proceeded to apply the same standards of improvement to the salaries of all other public officials.</P>
    <P>At the same time that the negotiations were proceeding between myself and the Civil Service associations, there were proceeding before the Labour Court and in other parts of the country discussions on exactly the same question&mdash;by how much had the cost of living risen and by how much should the people living in 1946 and 1947 be compensated to meet the increased cost that occurred since the war.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court, as Deputies know, arrived at the decision that those on rather low salaries and wages should get 60 or 70 per cent. increase and that over a certain income the percentage should go down.  The Government and the Civil Service accepted the increase in their salaries over 1939 of from 25 per cent. upwards.  The 25 was the minimum increase given to civil servants and, in my recollection, that 25 was given to those whose pre-war salary and bonus combined amounted to around £1,000 a year. Below £1,000, there was a gradual increase in the percentage given, until at the figures I gave Deputies in my opening statement, on about £480 of a pre-war salary and sliding scale bonus combined, the civil servant got 37½ per cent. increase and at the other figure, £360, an increase of 41 per cent.</P>
    <P>Now, had I entered this Dáil with a Bill proposing that Deputies' allowances should be increased by 37½ per cent. and Senators' by 40 per cent., no one could say truthfully that it was out of line with what had been done for civil servants and all other classes of public officials.  Deputy Roddy said that the Deputies should give a headline, that in the fixing of their allowances they should show some little spirit of sacrifice.  The fact that it was not more than the appropriate percentage increases granted to other people, but less, had regard to the sentiments of which he spoke.  If we were attempting to compensate fully <Col N="384" /> for the increase in hotel expenses, travelling and restaurant expenses and so on, we would naturally have been compelled to go above the figure of 30 per cent. which the Government has suggested in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Is there any Deputy who will say that that 30 per cent. is more than those costs rose since 1938?  No Deputy will.  I do not think there is anyone in the country who would say that hotel, travelling and other expenses have risen by less than 30 per cent. since 1938.  It is common knowledge-we are not living away in the moon and all our activities are exposed to the eyes of our constituents-that, during and even since the war, Deputies who had to hire cars or even run their own cars, found their expenses in some cases nearer 300 per cent. than 30 percent. over pre-war.  Travelling within the constituency is an expense for which no specific allowance is made and which must be covered by the Deputies' normal Parliamentary allowance&mdash;heretofore £480 and for the future £624, if this Bill goes through. The people of the country have grown up politically in this last number of years.  They know as much about the Deputies and their lives as the Deputies know about them.  Each one of them can appreciate that, if £480 was considered to be fair and reasonable for expenses in 1938, it is not unreasonable to add 30 per cent. and bring it up to £624.</P>
    <P>The question was much discussed here as to whether, if we were going to give Deputies an increase, someone should not be given authority to say how much each Deputy should get in addition to his present allowance. Some Deputy suggested that the authority to do that would be a clerk at the Dáil gate, that account should be taken of the number of attendances made by Deputies during the time when the Dáil was in session.  It was quite properly pointed out by other Deputies, some of them in the Opposition, that that might lead to the grossest form of abuse, by Deputies attending simply to sign and then clearing off.  It was said by others that the amount a Deputy should get as an allowance for expenses should be decided by the Revenue Commissioners, <Col N="385" /> that a salary of some size should be granted to Deputies and that they should then claim from the Revenue Commissioners exemption from income-tax for that portion of their salary which they could prove to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners represented necessary expenses in the performance of their Parliamentary duties.</P>
    <P>That suggestion displays a trust in the Revenue Commissioners' judgment which is not normally voiced by Deputies.  They are going to attempt that in another country, but I doubt if that system is a workable system, a system which will work to the satisfaction of the Deputies concerned.  Every taxpayer at one time or another who has a claim for expenses before the Revenue Commissioners has a falling out with them, has disputes with the tax collector as to the amount he should properly be allowed as a necessary expense.  Are we going to open an office here in the Dáil and have T.D.s going in to prove: &ldquo;It was necessary for me to go from Ballymurphy to Ballydehob on such and such a date and you must allow me my expenses,&rdquo; and then have a wrangle with the Revenue Commissioners as to whether that was in fact a necessary portion of a Deputy's expenses in the performance of his Parliamentary duties?  Are we to have Deputies going to the Revenue Commissioners to prove that they stayed in a hotel in Dublin on the 3rd, 4th or 5th of February last in the course of their Parliamentary duties, but that on one of the nights they did not stay there in order to go to a theatre?</P>

      <P>The suggestion was made that Deputies should not be given allowances, but should be made prove to the Revenue Commissioners what were necessary expenses in the performance of their Parliamentary duties. Every person here will admit that necessary expenses are expenses involved in travelling from their constituency to Dublin, if they live outside <Col N="386" /> Dublin, and remaining in Dublin during the Dáil sitting.</P>

      <P>No one would protest more strongly than Deputy Dillon if the Revenue Commissioners dared examine him as to what his duties to his constituents are.  Nobody would object more violently than Deputy Dillon.  As a matter of fact, we have had the same type of discussion between Deputies and representatives of my Department in connection with travelling allowances.  Most Deputies have had the experience of being dissatisfied with the judgments given on some occasions.  It is the duty of the officials of my Department to ensure that every possible penny or halfpenny which can be saved in cutting down expense sheets will be saved, and their function in that regard is no different from that which the Revenue Commissioners would have to perform in adjudicating on what was a necessary expense for a Deputy.  It just would not work smoothly, in my opinion, and I should say we would come to the same conclusion in regard to that way of dealing with expenses as I came to in connection with this question of motor-car expenses.  I had brought to me on a few occasions for final adjudication disputes which had arisen between Deputies and representatives of my Department about car allowances. Was a train running on the particular date on which the Deputy used his car?  Should he have come the night before when a train was available or should he not have waited until the day after, when it was available?  Why should he have come on that day?  Was a train not reasonably available to him and should not his reasonable expenses be first-class rail fare rather than the rate of 6d. per mile for the use of his own car when trains were not available. I came to the conclusion that the right thing to do was to abolish this source of wrangling between T.D.s and civil servants, and the result is that one part of this Bill deals with the new travelling facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the dangers of a debate such as we have had&mdash;we are members of <Col N="387" /> different Parties and we take off the gloves and hit pretty hard on occasions when one side or the other thinks there is a political advantage to be gained, as is natural in Parliamentary institutions or any other type of organisation &mdash;is that there are unfortunately in the country certain sections which delight in seeing a rather bad type of debate take place here and some of whom delight particularly in misrepresenting the Government reasons for promoting various types of legislation. There were some hot things said yesterday in the debate and it was only right that, if newspapers were reporting these, they should give a fair and balanced account of what took place. Deputy Dillon adverted to the fact that Part I of this Bill, granting increased travelling facilities, was brought in by me at the request of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and he said that if he were put to it he would take full responsibility for it himself. Deputy Hughes alluded to the same section of the Bill and said it had been brought in by me at the request of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. They were the only two Deputies that referred to that matter. I have no recollection of any member of the Labour Party, or of any member of Clann na Talmhan saying so.  The amazing thing is that of all the speeches made in the last few days the two gentlemen of the Opposition who were cut out of the <i>Irish Times</i> were Deputy Dillon and Deputy Hughes.</P>

      <P>The fact of the matter is that Deputy Hughes and others are going to vote against this Bill because, they say, of the increase in allowances to Deputies but if the Bill goes through some of them who use their cars instead of trains will get more out of the increase because of allowances for cars.  That is the only point I am making. Deputy Roddy or Deputy Hughes did not say that we should not do that before we had an inquiry.  Neither did any Independent Deputy, nor any member of Clann na Talmhann, nor any member of either of the Labour Parties.  They came to me and asked that that should be brought in.  I did not mention it.  I did not raise it in this debate; I did not say anything about having been asked about it.  But there was no proposition at any time that that should be postponed until there was a public inquiry into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies have stated that this addition of 30 per cent. to Deputies' allowances is extravagant.  They did not say that an increase of 30 per cent., or £300 or £400 a year additional, for district justices with salaries from £900 to £1,100 per year is too much.  All sides of the House said that it should be more, although district justices have pensionable positions and are not subject to the same expenses as some Deputies have to undergo. Thirty per cent. in their case was thought too little, although they had already from £900 to £1,100 per year. But it is said that 30 per cent. is too much of an increase in Deputies allowances.  I do not propose to characterise these statements.  But I <Col N="391" /> want the people of the country to regard this matter in a reasonable way.  We know what the increase in the expenses of running any business is as compared with 1938.  I think they will agree with Deputy Mulcahy that the allowance of £480 was not over-generous in relation to the then existing circumstances.  I think they will agree with him that, if we want to have democratic institutions here, we have to enable the representatives of the people to perform their Parliamentary duties in a reasonable manner.  I think the ordinary person in the country will agree that the addition of 30 per cent. at this time is not only overdue but is not over-generous; that it errs, if at all, on the side of meagreness.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as making the proposal that, no matter what expenses a Deputy elects to incur in the performance of his duties, those expenses should be met.  There are some Deputies who have farms or businesses or other incomes who can afford to incur more expense than other Deputies. But I think it is only reasonable and right for the people of the country to insist that the Government should, at all times, regard it as their duty to see that the representatives of the people have such an allowance for expenses as will enable a man without means to carry out his Parliamentary functions in a reasonable manner.  No reasonable person in this country wants to have a situation in which, for the sake of a penny farthing per head of the population, Deputies will be driven <Col N="392" /> through sheer necessity to accept credit, to accept overdrafts, or to put themselves in the position of being under a compliment to particular interests. Such persons want their representatives to be free in their approach to all problems that are put forward for their consideration; free to vote and to voice their opinions without fear or favour.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that in the Committee Stage we should bring forward an amendment to make a compulsory levy of £12 per year on members of the Dáil and Seanad in order to provide a fund to look after old and infirm ex-members of the Dáil and Seanad, or widows of former members of the Dáil or Seanad.  That matter has been raised by Deputy Allen, Deputy Kennedy and others.  I have seen the British scheme in the papers, but I have not had time to examine it since the matter was raised here.  I do not think it would be possible to put such an amendment as they have in mind into this particular Bill. This Bill deals with allowances to members.  Any scheme of that kind to make a levy on the members of the Dáil or Seanad and to appoint members as trustees to administer the fund and make the awards would, I think, have to be dealt with in a special Bill. All I can say is that, if the members of the Dáil and Seanad ask the Government to promote legislation to make that levy, I would put it to the Government, but I do not think it can be done in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  As Deputies are aware, the salaries of members of the Government, of the Parliamentary Secretaries, of the Attorney-General, and of the Chairman and Deputy-Chairman of the Houses of the Oireachtas were fixed by the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1938, Part II.  The allowances for expenses paid to the Leaders of the second Party and the third Party in Dáil Eireann were fixed in Part III of the same Act.  The Government, having considered the amounts so fixed in the light of change in the value of money since 1938, and of additions granted, or proposed to be granted, to all classes of public servants, came to the conclusion that they were no longer adequate and accordingly it was decided to submit the present Bill, containing proposals for increases as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Taoiseach and the Attorney-General&mdash;present salary £2,500 to be increased by 20 per cent. to £3,000 per annum.</P>
      <P>Members of the Government and the Ceann Comhairle&mdash;present salary £1,700 to be increased by 25 per cent. to £2,125.</P>
      <P>Parliamentary Secretaries and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad&mdash;present salary £1,200 to be increased by 30 per cent. to £1,560.</P>
      <P>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle&mdash;present salary £1,000 to be increased by 30 per cent. to £1,300.</P>
      <P>Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad &mdash;present salary £750 to be increased by 30 per cent. to £975.</P>
      <P>Leader of the second Party in the Dáil&mdash;present allowance of £800 to be increased by 30 per cent. to £1,040.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> Leader of the third Party in the Dáil&mdash;present allowance of £500 to be increased by 30 per cent. to £650.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The annual cost of these increases is £8,030.  Deputies will remember that the increases provided in respect of judges and justices under the Courts of Justice Bill, 1947, are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Chief Justice&mdash;present salary £4,000 to be increased by 15 per cent. to £4,600.</P>
    <P>President of the High Court and judges of the Supreme Court-present salary £3,000 to be increased by 15 per cent to £3,450.</P>
    <P>Ordinary judges of the High Court &mdash;present salary £2,500 to be brought up by 20 per cent. to £3,000.</P>
    <P>Circuit Court judges &mdash; present salary £1,700 to be brought up by 25 per cent. to £2,125.</P>
    <P>Then we had the district justices, whose former salaries ranged from £1,000 to £1,200.  These salaries are being increased by 30 per cent. to range hereafter from £1,300 to £1,560.  Deputies are also aware that we have on the Order Paper a Bill which proposes to increase the salary of the Comptroller and Auditor-General by 25 per cent., bringing it from £1,500 up to £1,875 per annum.  The Government gave careful consideration to the increases proposed for the members of the Government, the Parliamentary Secretaries, the Attorney-General and the officers of both Houses of the Oireachtas, and they decided that the right thing in the public interest was to make the proposals to the Dáil which I have just indicated.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;the Dáil declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill until salaries for Ministers for the time being equal to those payable to judges of the High Court and a salary for the Taoiseach for the time being equal to that payable to the Chief Justice are incorporated in the measure.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the occasion of the introduction of this Bill to direct the attention <Col N="396" /> of the House and of the country, to a situation which has obtained here since the foundation of the State which, I think, is a reflection on the prudence of our people.  I have often watched, with acute distress, the people of this country being exploited by vested interests for the profit of the vested interests and to the very grave loss of the simple people.  I have noticed, in almost every such case, that the exploitation has been successfully achieved because the would-be exploiter has not hesitated to pay whatever sum of money it was requisite to pay in order to hire the most skilled negotiator or propagandist that his purpose required while the unfortunate simple people, who should have been on the look out for the most powerful advocate whom they could retain to defend their interests and to detect and expose the machinations of the exploiter, have spent their time wrangling amongst themselves as to whether they ought to give the man they hired 30/- or 35/- per week.  The result is that when the battle is joined all the high-powered advocacy and publicity of a skilful cloud of misrepresentation and fraud is promulgated by the highly-paid efficient agents of the vested interests, and some poor chap who was hired for 37/6 is fluttering around, doing the best he can, pulling the devil by the tail and ashamed to go and speak to the big man who is earning £5,000 a year from the exploiters.</P>
    <P>When the battle is over, the economical souls who hired the cheap fellow have been bled of £2,000,000 or £3,000,000, but the wise old exploiter who hired his highly paid accountant or publicity agent and paid him £15,000 or £20,000 is gone with the swag, and with the aura of holiness, sanctity and patriotism about him, staggering away under the burden of his ill-gotten gain, he is declared to be a benefactor of the people.  The enterprising soul who set the wheels of industry revolving, never having aspired to anything more elaborate than a second-hand bicycle before he became a patriot and a prop of industry, you see him disappearing in his private yacht for the Italian Riviera, and the poor economically-minded souls down the country who hired the 37/6 chap <Col N="397" /> glorifying Providence that sent them this great prop who set the wheels of industry turning, quite unconscious of the fact that the suite of rooms on the Italian Riviera is being paid for out of the sixpences and shillings that have been taken out of their individual pockets by the gentleman who began with a bicycle and ended up with a yacht.</P>
    <P>What, then, is the history of the scale of salaries that has obtained for Ministers of State in this country?  It began by Oireachtas Eireann providing £2,500 for the President of the Executive Council and £1,700 per annum for his Ministers.  For the manifest inadequacy of that figure, even in those days I think the blame rests upon Mr. William T. Cosgrave, who was the first President of the Executive Council who actually had practical experience of presiding over the Government, but when you apportion that blame it is right to remember that it is the kind of blame that any man in retrospect might be proud to bear.  I feel that the error into which he fell when he fixed the rates of remuneration for himself and his colleagues at so inadequate and poor a figure was due to the fact that he had spent the greater part of his life up to that time in the gratuitous service of his country and it was something new to him to think of a salary or reward of any kind for what was public service.  The same, I think, might be said of almost every member of the Cabinet who sat around him in those early days of this State's existence. But, being the kind of persons they were, having fallen into that initial error, they stuck to their guns, and they did with what was an exiguous and inadequate salary not supplemented by perquisites&mdash;just what the Estimates revealed and no more.</P>
    <P>Then, Sir, came the next stage.  It was determined by the Sinn Féin Party, or was it the Sinn Féin Party of 1926, which was led by the present Taoiseach that it was requisite for the cultivation of our people's morals to hold up Mr. Cosgrave and his colleagues of that day to public odium for that they were bleeding the people white by the extravagant demands they made upon them by way of salaries fixed by themselves.  I remember <Col N="398" /> the poster, each man's name, then his salary and a large exclamation mark, and the Taoiseach of to-day taking to the hustings and in the robes appropriate to one of the Fathers of the Desert, of a hermit emerging from the wilderness, saying that the fruits of 50 years' reflection had convinced him that no man was worth more than £1,000 a year.  Deputy Hughes thinks it was more, but that is not so.  The Deputy is not as good a publicist as the Taoiseach.  £1,000 is a simple number.  If you were to put a squiggle into it some of the boys might forget when out preaching the gospel.  Simplicity is a very important thing when you are called upon to lead a certain type of Party.  Where are the boys of the shadow cabinet?  There is none of them here because I would love to remind the Minister for Local Government of the passionate eloquence and indignation that he managed to impart to his denunciations of Cosgrave's blood suckers, and the reiteration of his resolution never to subscribe to their avarice or their unscrupulous exploitation of the people, and of his cheerful willingness to serve and live well upon £1,000 a year.  Whereupon they went into a huddle.  Somebody said: &ldquo;Look here, boys, we have nailed our ears to the post with this £1,000 a year and it is going to be very painful to disembarrass ourselves of this incubus of virtue.&rdquo;  But the astute financial minds of some of these latter-day Fathers of the Desert was called to the task of at least lightening the burden of virtue.</P>
    <P>I would direct Deputy Hughes' special attention to this: On the hustings the salary was just £1,000 but in the Estimates it was £1,000 free of income-tax, which was a very substantial difference.  But that is not all.  It is £1,000 free of income-tax and, though they were national heroes, though they were going up to Arbour Hill with torchlight processions to release the plain, decent boys who had striven for the republic and though the then Minister for Justice, Mr. Justice Geoghegan, and the present Solicitor for Minors, who was then a Minister, Mr. Ruttledge, went down to College Green and held a meeting with torchlights <Col N="399" /> burning to proclaim the freedom for the left wing of the old Irish republic, it was discovered that it was necessary for the safe-keeping of the Ministers that they should be afforded facilities for travel under escort.  This sorry obligation, however, carried with it the convenient addition that their salaries were now £1,000 a year free of income-tax, plus a motor car, petrol and a chauffeur.  Of course, these things were not mentioned on the hustings because they might have puzzled the poor people, worried them unduly.  It was much simpler to say that no man was worth more than £1,000.  There was a proposition that the plainest man could understand and were not they the Party of the plain people?  They stuck to their path of virtue-£1,000 free of income-tax plus the perquisites until eventually the going got too tough and the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Bill of 1938 was introduced and, would you believe it, the Father from the Desert had so far deteriorated since he emerged into this wicked world that he voted himself £2,500 a year&mdash;not a penny more than the bloodsucker of 1923 had appropriated&mdash;but it had acquired a few frills during its sojourn in the desert because now there were a whole selection of little perquisites attached to the £2,500 and they have been hanging on ever since.  But, of course, it is impolite to mention them. My gracious me, how nauseating and disgusting all that dirty kind of fraud has been.  Who would blame their few supporters for blushing where they sit?</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity of establishing the right principle in regard to those servants of our people into whose hands are committed the safe keeping and guidance of the people's vital interests.  To some it would seem strange that, with that in front of me&mdash;that Taoiseach and that Cabinet&mdash;the thought of proposing higher remuneration could conceivably occur to me.  I concede at once that if I were thinking of the Minister for Agriculture and was called upon to evaluate his services, I would falter between 3½d. and 3¾d.</P>

      <P>Yes, unless the remuneration would be accepted as a pension, in which event I would be very glad indeed to err on the side of generosity.  Much the same could be said of the gentle turtle dove who has been addressing us for the last quarter of an hour, the Minister for Finance, whose melodious cooing will decorate any topic he chooses to touch upon But I am not thinking of them.  I am trying to think of the kind of people who would be worthy of the Irish people and whom some day we will get. I am not dismayed by the peculiar selection they threw up to us on the last few occasions any more than I am dismayed by Deputy O'Leary when he gets into the more florid passages of his eloquence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I glory in the fact that in a world smothered by tyranny and where freedom is so widely trampled underfoot we have a Parliament here where the Irish people have the right to send anybody and so long as they are here, be they great or small, wise or foolish, so long as they represent our people, they are free to do whatever the dictate of their conscience requires them to do and that all other sections of the people recognise that and, however bitterly they differ from the opinions expressed or the actions done, are prepared to die in defence of the right of those who have come to Parliament by the authority of the Irish people to say and do them.  God send it may be always so.  So that, albeit the present occupants of Ministerial office in this country may be incompetent, may be all the things they should not be, they are the occupants that the Irish people put there and so long as they sit there by that authority I dare to aver that there are very few people in this country who would not cheerfully give their lives in defence of their right to continue to do so. Without, then, identifying these proposals with the present occupants of the office or those who went before, I suggest that we should fix a scale of salaries for Ministers which will conceal nothing, which will be all that they get by way of remuneration and which will have added to it no perquisites or other concealed benefits.  I believe that the remuneration should <Col N="401" /> be proportionate to the dignity of the office they hold and in some measure to the volume of work they are called on to undertake.</P>
    <P>I name no names, but there are Ministers sitting on those benches and, whether we approve of the policies they implement or the things they do, there are amongst them men who work long and arduous hours.  When I think of these men being offered £1,700 a year, subject to income-tax and realise that, if a similar offer were made with a view to getting a general manager for Clery's, Arnott's or Todd's, there would not be three applications, I begin to ask myself whether our people or the Deputies who represent them, are daft, to create such a situation.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, responsible for all the industrial life of the country, the representative of the Irish people for the protection of their interests in all industrial matters, with no security of tenure, albeit with the right to a Ministerial pension of £500 a year after serving a certain number of years as Minister, is offered a salary of £1,700, when I do not suppose in the course of his official business 1 per cent. of those who come to interview him would consider accepting any salary less than twice the maximum to which the Minister can ever aspire.</P>
    <P>I do not for a moment suggest that we can with propriety aim to compete with the most inflated salary of the richest commercial corporation in this country.  No country could do that. In the United States of America, you will find presidents of great corporations earning as much as £150,000 sterling per annum; and in Great Britain great incomes of that kind may sometimes be earned as well.  When we cast round for some criterion by which we might measure the sort of income which a man worthy to be a Minister of State in this country might have expected to reach in his maturity, had he used his talents in a profession rather than in politics, I choose the judiciary.  The criterion we must set for ourselves is that the men chosen are worthy to be Ministers.  If the Irish people choose to pick people whom they ought not to have picked. and who were never fit for Ministerial <Col N="402" /> office, that is the Irish people's business and they have a right to do it, thanks be to God.  In fixing a fair remuneration on behalf of the Irish people we, their political representatives, are entitled to assume that those who send us here will choose a suitable Government.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, believe that men who have reached the position of Minister of State, of Tánaiste or Taoiseach, should be the kind of men who, in the maturity of their professional life had they gone to the Bar, would be a judge of the High Court, President of the High Court and Chief Justice respectively. Taking that criterion, let us then equate the Taoiseach's income with that of the Chief Justice, which for the time being is £4,600; the Tánaiste's with that of the President of the High Court, which would make it £3,450, the Ministers with that of a High Court judge, making it £3,000, and Parliamentary Secretaries with that of a Circuit Court judge, making it £2,125.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is a Deputy in this House who, in his heart of hearts, does not agree with me&mdash;yet I do not believe there is a Deputy in this House who would dare to get up and second it to-night.  Is there one amongst the Deputies here who does not believe that William T. Cosgrave was worth £4,600 and a good deal more when sitting in that seat over there?  Would that pay him for the work he did?  Is there anyone who would contend with me that when Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Costello and the late Deputy O'Higgins&mdash;<i>requiescat in pace</i>&mdash;were representing this country in the Imperial Conference and were transmogrifying the British Empire, abolishing the British Empire to substitute for it the Commonwealth of Nations&mdash;to which the republicans beyond are now bursting to adhere externally&mdash;they were not worth £3,000 a year?  If Deputies believe that to be true, will they not vote to give it to them?  Do they think it is right for a man who served this country and went out of office at the end of his period of office not only poorer than when he came in but, in an absolute sense of the word, hard put to live according to the modest standard of comfort, that but for the <Col N="403" /> Ministerial pension which he now enjoys, he would be looking for a job and that because during the whole period of office he thought of nothing but the duties of his office?  Do they think that is right?  Do they think such a one is not entitled to enjoy, during the period of his employment by the country, an income which would enable him to maintain a standard of living suitable to a Minister of this country and to lay by such modest savings as a professional person in analogous circumstances would do and, in fact, has done?</P>
    <P>Every one of the Deputies here know that those who worked for this State would be getting nothing more than was fair and just were these proposals accepted.  Certainly, most of those sitting in the benches where I stand would see that more truly, in contemplation of the men who built the State and who made its name famous at the International Conferences where they were called to represent it.  I can see Deputies on the other side of the House concentrating their gaze upon their leaders, and I put the question to them: &ldquo;Do you think the scales proposed in this amendment are excessive, extravagant or unsuitable?&rdquo; I do not believe that a single Deputy thinks so, but it is not popular, it is not expedient, to say so down the country. I exonerate the occupants of the Front Bench on either side from dealing with this matter on its merits.  It may not look becoming in any man, however detached he may try to be, to seem to cry his own wares, the value of his own work, present or to come; but are there no backbenchers like myself, who have no Ministerial ambition or hope &mdash;and it is a proud hope, a hope that any man in this House might be proud to have&mdash;will those who may not entertain that hope rise and say what they think?  I invite them to do it.  Can I get one Deputy on any side who will second this amendment?  I need a seconder and I have not got one yet.</P>

      <P>As I indicated on the introduction of this measure, having had the information given to us by an announcement in the Press of what was in the Government's mind, we are opposed to this measure.  We are opposed to it because it lacks the clarity which is essential at present with regard to the emoluments of persons holding Ministerial office and because it is introduced without any previous consultation or public consideration of the question, at a time when there are very many elements in the economic and social situation which make it prudent and advisable that anything done towards increasing the incomes or emoluments of persons associated with the Government should be very carefully considered and very fully understood, so as not to add to the unrest with regard to the cost of living and the difficulties with regard to income and employment which so many people are experiencing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon's amendment would probably find a seconder, if it were not for the fact that it provides no solution of the principal difficulty I mention, that is, that substantial increases to holders of Ministerial offices <Col N="405" /> in the State are being proposed without any understanding of what these emoluments are, or any preparation of the public mind for an understanding of the difficulties which exist in regard to the cost of living and the high cost of carrying out their duties generally which Ministers are supposed to meet. The position we find ourselves in at present is one in which these proposals are put before Parliament without any preparation, without any approach by way of discussion or examination of the situation, but simply as a sequel to the attitude of the Government Party all along towards the whole question of their salaries and emoluments and arising out of the hypocrisy and make-believe of the past.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties we have in accepting this proposal is that, when the question was examined in 1937 and reported on, certain definite proposals were made which were not accepted, and, in considering the question now, we ought to go back and consider the principles upon which the recommendations of 1937 were made, when a special committee, consisting of persons drawn from outside the political life of the country and of some people who had Dáil experience, was brought together for the purpose of discussing what Ministerial salaries should be, what allowances to Deputies should be, what pensions should be paid to Ministers and what other payments should be made to Parliamentary offices.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 33, on page 16 of the report then presented, we find this recommendation:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We recommend that in future all salaries should be subject in full to assessment for taxation in accordance with the ordinary law.  We can see no grounds upon which Ministers should be put in a special position as regards the incidence of taxation, the more particularly because in effect it is their function to decide what the rates of taxation should be and consequently on grounds of public policy it seems only proper that they should, in common with other citizens, experience the full burden of any increased impositions.  It is, moreover, our view that existing law <Col N="406" /> exempting from taxation that portion of the Ministerial salary which is equivalent to the Parliamentary allowance&mdash;at present £360 a year&mdash; should be repealed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In relation to that statement, they make a recommendation, on page 17, that the salary attaching to the office of Taoiseach should be £3,000 a year, fully subject to taxation; to the office of the Tánaiste, £2,500; and to Ministers, £2,250.  They make proposals with regard to transport and suggest that a pool of transport should be arranged somewhat as is arranged at present for the use of Ministers in carrying out their general public business, but the fact is that these recommendations were not accepted at that time.</P>
    <P>What the explanation of that is I do not know, and there is no purpose in going into it, but I suggested, when speaking on the introduction of this Bill, that Ministers, as well as being in receipt of a salary of £1,700 per year, have transport facilities which cover not only their Ministerial and official duties but their whole possible requirements of transport for family and friends and for Party or political purposes and that these transport facilities are of a value not less than £1,000 a year.</P>
    <P>I submit that the provision for their service, day and night, of a high-powered car, fully provided with petrol and covered in every way with insurance, with drivers and any other service required, surely represents a sum not less than £1,000 a year, so that, in fact, for private and Party purposes, outside official purposes altogether, I suggest that Ministers have enjoyed emoluments greater than were recommended in that 1937 Report.  There may be a case for that but it ought to be looked up to and faced up to and we should not be in the position that we do not know the extent of a Minister's emoluments.  We ought not have a position in which, at their own private service and at the service of their Party, there should be a substantial fleet of motor-cars fully provided with drivers, fully insured and fully serviced over and above what ought normally be going to them to enable them to perform their official duties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="407" /> The Minister has indicated that Ministers' salaries should be brought up to £2,125.  I submit that there is, added to that, a transport service outside what is required for their official duties which is at the service of themselves privately and of the Party and that is used very fully and elaborately. I think that is wrong.  I think that when the Dáil is asked to face up to the fixing of adequate salaries for Ministers it ought to fix salaries in such a way that we can know the measure of them and that we can be in a position to fully approve on the facts of the case.  Nobody wants in any way to minimise the laborious duties a Minister has to perform.  Nobody wants to deny in any way that the minds of Ministers should be completely free of anxieties or worries arising during their period of office out of their financial position.</P>
    <P>If we have Ministers whose minds are clouded or disturbed by worries of a financial kind we cannot get from them the service for the protection of the country generally or the developments of the country that we ought to get. When we speak here in criticism of this particular measure we speak in a constructive spirit rather than a destructive spirit and we express regret that the problem that Ministers find themselves up against has not been approached in a more constructive way.  The Minister says the Government went fully and exhaustively into this particular matter.  No reason has been given why the Leaders of the other Parties were not consulted, why there was no discussion with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or with any Parliamentary body that could assist the members of the Government to face up to this problem. No Party and no Deputy in this House wants to shirk responsibility in respect of any matter that refers either to the effectiveness or prestige of this House or the effectiveness of the services that the Government and the Executive have to provide for the country.  We are all prepared to take our responsibility and take our share in dealing with any problems that may have to be discussed.  It is almost impossible to understand why the Government <Col N="408" /> has chosen the manner of presentation they have chosen in this case.  This Bill which we are discussing now as well as providing for the Taoiseach, Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, provides certain allowances for Leaders of various Parties here.  The allowances that are made to two Leaders of Parties here are dealt with in the 1937 report.  On page 36 of the report, paragraph 91, we read that the committee is in agreement with certain views expressed before it and carried over from a joint committee which had sat in 1929 to deal with the work that had to be done in the House by the Leader of the Opposition.  Paragraph 91 says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are in agreement with the views expressed above, but we consider that the experience gained in the meantime has proved conclusively that some provision should be made for the Leader of the Opposition. One of the witnesses who appeared before us suggested that members of the Parliamentary staff should be made available to assist the Leader of the Opposition.  We consider, however, that such an arrangement would not be feasible as that staff is composed of civil servants and, by reason of their position, it is unlikely that they would be able to afford assistance, in the fullest sense, to the Leader of the Opposition who is, perforce, opposed to the Government of the day.  Moreover, such staff might have to be provided for the Leader of more than one Party in Dáil Éireann, and these Parties might be as much in opposition to one another as to the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph 92 goes on to say that the provision made from public funds for the Leader of a Party in opposition to the Government should not be in the nature of a salary but would be an allowance of a sufficient amount to enable such a person to defray secretarial and other expenses.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The allowances which we have recommended, i.e., £800 for the Leader of the largest Opposition Party and £500 for the Leader of the second largest Opposition Party, being in the nature of a recoupment of expenses, should be exempt from taxation.... <Col N="409" /> It is also suggested that arrangements should be made to provide accommodation in the Oireachtas buildings for secretarial staff which the Leaders of Opposition will be enabled to employ if the allowances recommended above are made available.  It must be clearly understood that in recommending the payment of allowances to Leaders of the Opposition, we do not intend that these allowances should be regarded or utilised as in any sense personal remuneration or solely as a grant towards the personal expenses of the Leaders, but that they should be used by those Leaders for the purpose of providing effective secretarial and other assistance not only for themselves but for the general conduct of the Opposition in Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Certain members of the committee disagreed with the idea of these allowances. At any rate they were provided. There has been no consultation, and no inquiry has been made, as far as I know, from any of the Leaders of the Parties receiving these allowances for secretarial and other assistance that would warrant the Government saying that they had considered the matter.  I see no reason why the allowance should be increased.  Parties before the granting of this allowance were able to get along and do their own work on their own funds.  This allowance gives a kind of a statutory position to the Leaders of the Opposition and enables them to get a small special civil service for themselves as it were.  But there is no reason in the present circumstances why the various Parties would not be able to carry on their own work without falling back on the taxpayer to assist them in the carrying on of their work.  I would like to ask the Minister why, before they made up their minds to propose increases of this particular kind, they were put into the Bill without consultation with those people who are directly concerned with them.  Even if it was necessary at the present time to employ more assistance in order to keep the work of the Opposition going on, we would not be prepared to put the expense of that on the country.  So that, in making a proposal of this particular <Col N="410" /> kind as well as in making proposals for the increases of salaries, the Minister is taking an action which outrages the Opposition at the present time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey referred to one particular case of an old age pensioner. I want to take one particular class. One of the weekly newspapers in Tipperary, <i>The Nationalist,</i> a paper not revolutionary in any way, looking soberly at the facts of Irish life, closely in touch with the facts of agricultural and industrial life, the life of the country and the life of the town, looking at everything objectively, never writing a hasty word, on 4th June had a leading article headed: &ldquo;This Bureaucratic Tyranny&rdquo; which began: &ldquo;Are the poor and the lowly never `to get a break' from the bureaucrats in this country?  That question is prompted by the decision of the Local Government Minister concerning South Tipperary road workers' wages.&rdquo;  I do not want to go into the discussion we had here last year with regard to the road workers' wages.  But a system of systematic repression was carried on by the Minister for Local Government against the express wishes of the South Tipperary County Council over a period of two years to prevent road workers from getting anything but the most meagre wages to maintain their wives and families.  On 1st April, 1939, their wages were 35/- per week.  Later on they got an additional 3/-.  On 1st April, 1945, after a long fight, they were given 40/-.  Further representations were recently made on their behalf by the county council.  They have been partially turned down by the Department of Local Government and the road workers' wages have been fixed at 50/- a week.</P>
    <P>That reflects part of the problem we have here in arranging any increase to meet the expenses of anybody connected with Parliament.  Where you have a widespread situation like this in the country, where you have stable-minded and responsible leaders of public opinion and journalists departing from their normal even tenor and describing the administration here in the words I have quoted, &ldquo;This bureaucratic tyranny&rdquo;, we have a responsibility <Col N="411" /> here from whatever side of the House we speak to realise that a problem exists arising out of the cost of living, low wages, and the difficulty of increasing them, on the one hand, and the fact that a very serious repression has been carried out systematically by the Government, particularly where they were able to control things.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> for June, 1946, on page 62, gives particulars of the average weekly earnings in every group of industries in this country.  The figures are for the year 1944.  Increases have been given practically over the whole gamut of industry and employment since.  But the figures for 1944 are the latest figures available and they show the earnings in the various occupations: grain milling, bread, creameries, bacon curing, sugar, malting, brewing, etc.  We find that the lowest average earnings of males of 18 years of age and over are those paid by local authorities and Government Departments. They are 45/5 per week, as against 101/10 in the tobacco industry, 94/10 in electricity, 89/10 in printing, and 89/8 in brewing.  The average earnings by persons employed by local authorities and Government Departments are only two-thirds of the average earnings over the whole gamut of employment in industry, namely, 67/10 per week.  These figures simply make a comparison and they refer to 1944.  But the outburst of <i>The Nationalist</i> with regard to the recent action of the Minister for Local Government pointed to the problem which is there.  Unless that is understood when approaching any increases that have to be made in the salaries of Ministers or the expenses of anybody connected with Parliament, you will only inflame a very dangerous and difficult situation for the people who ultimately maintain this country, namely, the workers.</P>
    <P>We oppose this measure because it still conceals the position with regard to the emoluments of Ministers.  They ought to be adequate, but they ought to be made clear.  In making any change in them, it is particularly necessary that the amount of these emoluments should be made clear.  We oppose the treatment of the matter in this Bill <Col N="412" /> and I hope the Minister will realise that our opposition is made constructively and that he will approach the matter in a different way.</P>

      <P>Before this debate proceeds any farther I shall give way to the Minister for Finance for a few moments if he can give the House an idea of the average transport costs of each Minister because, unless we have an idea of what exactly a Ministerial office costs, we cannot approach this matter from the right angle.  I therefore ask the Minister, if he has the information at his disposal, to give it; otherwise a wrong impression may be given.  Like the last speaker, I should like to approach this matter from a constructive rather than a destructive point of view.  I ask the Minister, therefore, if he has the information, or if he is desirous of giving the information to the House.  If not, I shall proceed in my own way, because I take it that he does not intend to give it or does not wish to give it.  The Department of Finance ought to have this information and, if not, it must be obtainable from the Department of Justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason in asking for the information was that an increase in Ministers' salaries is proposed under this Bill of approximately £425 a year.  Ministers at present are getting a salary of £1,700, of which £480 is free of income-tax.  But there are other costs in connection with ministerial positions with which, to my knowledge, the House has never been furnished.  When the Minister brings in a Bill to increase Ministers' salaries, the very least that might be expected is that the House should have all the information at its disposal before it proceeds to discuss the matter.  In my opinion, a great deal of it is being cloaked or kept in the dark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Minister must travel about a good deal&mdash;his duties are very heavy&mdash;if he <Col N="413" /> is to maintain his position properly and give his best service as Minister to the country.  I understand that the Taoiseach, each Minister and each Parliamentary Secretary has a car at his disposal, with two drivers if the need arises.  The maintenance of that car and any depreciation are borne under the Garda Vote.  The very least we can put down for depreciation is £300 a year.  If two drivers are employed&mdash;and in nearly all cases they are members of the Civic Guard&mdash; each costs the State £500&mdash;that is, £1,000 for drivers.  Maintenance, petrol and repairs must run to £1,000. If I am right in these figures, the total cost is in the neighbourhood of £4,000, including £1,700 salary and transport expenses.  Deputy Dillon referred to &ldquo;the other trimmings&rdquo;, which he would not bring in.  I do not see why there should be any cloaking in this matter.</P>
    <P>We had a Bill before the House last night and to-day proposing an increase in the allowances to Deputies.  Each Deputy knows his own business and what attitude he prefers to take up, but in dealing with this measure we have been given no information.  We do not know what it costs the State to provide one Minister.  We do not know what the Taoiseach, his Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries are costing, and that is not as it should be.  It would be far better to pay a fixed salary that would cover all expenses and let the people know what the Government are costing, instead of having a nominal salary of £1,700 and asking for an increase of £425, to bring the full amount to £2,125.  I have arrived at those figures more or less by guess-work, but I think I am not far wrong.  If each Minister is costing £4,000, the country should know that.</P>
    <P>We are opposing this increase, because we hold that the country is not able to meet this burden.  I suppose the Government think that everything is all right so long as they have given an extra 1½d. an hour to the road workers and farm workers and 2/6 extra to the old age pensioners&mdash;most of which they have taken back in the tobacco tax.  They think the time is <Col N="414" /> ripe to help themselves after they have done all these fine things.  That is not so.  From time to time we have asked, by way of motion, to have certain changes made, and invariably we have been met with the cry from the Minister for Finance: &ldquo;Where is the money to come from?&rdquo; He suggests that we are prepared to spend it in various ways, but that we never give a thought from where it is to come.  When we asked for an increase in old age pensions he directed a very pointed question at these benches.  He asked did we propose to increase the tax on the tobacco, tea and sugar of the poor people.  He has done that, and very little of that tax is going back in any form to the unfortunate people from whom it is being taken.</P>
    <P>Deputies are prevented from speaking as they ought to on this Bill.  Perhaps they would adopt a different attitude if the information I sought was given by the Minister.  He merely announced the Bill and did not tell us why it was introduced.  He does not mention that any request was made by the Leaders of the second or third Parties for increased allowances.  He proposes to increase the allowance to the third Party from £500 to £650. There is no need for that, and there was no request for it.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Government are so generous.  They are flinging money at everybody.  The Minister said that the salaries of the Supreme-Court, High Court and Circuit Court judges, and district justices, were increased, but I do not think there is any analogy there.  All the judges, from the President of the Supreme-Court down to the district justices, are paid a fixed salary and they can live inside or outside that.  We do not know how much Ministers are costing the country, though we know how much Deputies are costing.  We have the Minister throwing money about in this particular way at a time when the country is not fit to bear it.  This is being done at a time when there is grave discontent and when evidence of that discontent can be seen at Dun-laoghaire, from which our youngsters are every day leaving the country. This is not the time to squander money.  The Government should use <Col N="415" /> the axe on the higher salaries and see that there is a more equitable distribution among the lower-paid workers.</P>

      <P>On many occasions, inside and outside the House, the Taoiseach has appealed to Opposition Parties for co-operation in carrying out the work which a good Government is always anxious to carry out.  Is the Ministerial attitude in this matter the kind of co-operation which the Government are anxious to have?  Co-operation is not a one-sided thing; it is something which should be subscribed to by two or more sides.  So far as I can see, co-operation is being treated by the Taoiseach and his Government as an arrangement under which Opposition groups must obey the Government crack of the whip.  Surely if there was ever a case where co-operation should have been secured, it was in consultation with the leaders of Opposition Parties as to whether there is a case for increasing the allowances provided for leaders of the Opposition Parties in carrying on their secretarial work.</P>
      <P>On this matter of the provision of allowances for leaders of Opposition Parties, I listened on more than one occasion to statements made by Deputies of the Government Party endeavouring to create the impression that the allowances were personal allowances for the individual leaders concerned.  That is not the case.  As far as I know&mdash;and I cannot speak for anybody else except the leader of this Party on this matter&mdash;these amounts have been used exclusively and solely for the purpose of getting secretarial assistance in the shape of a Parliamentary officer to assist the Deputies concerned in dissecting Bills and, where necessary, preparing amendments to these Bills and to assist the leaders of the Parties in the carrying out of their Parliamentary activities.  I hope we shall hear no more about that in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attitude of this small group in this particular matter must be related to the policy of the Government and, particularly, to the policy of certain members of the Government. As a Government team&mdash;<Col N="416" /> and I speak with a long experience of the two Governments that have been in existence in this country during a period of 25 years&mdash;the Cosgrave team, as a team of able men, were miles ahead of the men in the present Government. Nobody knows better than the members of the present Government that the members of the former Government were blackguarded and slandered all over the country&mdash;and certain portions of my constituency still bear the whitewash blackguarding these people&mdash;for accepting a salary of £1,700 a year.  I have no hesitation in stating that the Cosgrave team were driven out of office, partly on account of that type of black-guardism&mdash;of course, they deserved to be driven out in any event&mdash;and partly, and correctly, because of their action in reducing the pensions of the blind and the aged.  That played a big part but as a team of men, fit to administer the affairs of the Government of this country, they were streets and miles ahead of the present Ministerial team.</P>

      <P>I said that our decision to oppose this Bill is related to the policy of the Ministry.  We have the Minister for Local Government who has persistently refused, over a long period, to recognise the recommendations of the county councils, freely elected by the ratepayers of this country, in regard to the rights of road workers and the employees of local authorities.  He admits&mdash;he cannot deny it because his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, has said it&mdash;that the purchasing power of the pre-war £ is now only 10/- or less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister for Finance admit, for the purposes of his own argument, that the real cost of living is much more than the index figure discloses.  Of course, the Minister's wife has told him that because she knows that, when she goes into a shop to purchase essential commodities, she cannot get them at a price which is 77½ per cent. over the pre-war price. <Col N="418" /> Everybody knows that the price of clothing, for instance, is more than 77½ per cent. over the pre-war price, but this pig-headed Minister for Local Government, the propaganda Minister of the present Government, refuses point blank to accept the recommendations, the unanimous recommendations, of county councils throughout the country and in some cases the recommendations of his own county managers in regard to the rights of road workers to an increase in their pre-war wages to fit in with the increased cost of living.  He is coming along now, through the agency of the Minister for Finance, proposing to give himself, because they are doing this collectively, a fairly substantial increase although he has a fairly princely salary, judged especially by normal circumstances.  We have the Minister for Agriculture who is responsible for the dictatorial policy of the chairman of the Agricultural Wages Board&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had anything to say to the salaries of Ministers, I certainly would put the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the top of the list. He works hard in carrying out Ministerial policy and in putting his proposals before this House from time to time.  He is certainly a hardworking Minister and I take off my hat to him. He has given a lead on matters affecting the wages and the working conditions of the average worker to his Ministerial colleagues.  If his colleagues were in line with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I would not have so much to say about the increases proposed in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in the brief statement he made on this Bill, said that the salaries of Ministers, including the Taoiseach, were no longer adequate, but he did not give any evidence in support of that.  I would certainly ask him to give the House the appropriate figure of the cost to the taxpayers of the high-powered cars used by Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries.  It was quite correct for Deputy Mulcahy to say that these cars, which were originally intended for the personal use of Ministers, are now being used for family purposes.  I do not think that some of my colleagues in my constituency will deny that they are also used on certain occasions to pick up Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party to bring them around their constituencies. In that way, the Fianna Fáil Deputy has a great advantage over every Opposition Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the cars being used for that purpose during an election in my constituency.  I do not think my colleagues will deny that. That is costing the taxpayer more money.  I have heard of the number of gallons of petrol handed out to a Parliamentary Secretary on a certain occasion during the course of a general election.  It was a frightful figure.  I am not going to give it because I could not prove it.  If I did proceed to prove it, I would probably have to give the source of my information.  That might <Col N="420" /> be detrimental to the person who supplied me with the information.  He probably would not be promoted in the position that he holds.  At any rate, the depreciation of these cars, the cost of petrol, the wage or salary paid to two drivers, cannot be less than £1,000 a year per car.  That is a thing that must be taken into consideration when you are aiming at a reasonable figure in connection with a Bill of this kind. In any case, the Minister said that the salary and emolument of a free car is no longer adequate.  He said, further, that the Bill was being brought in in the public interest.  I am not quite sure what he meant by that.</P>
      <P>Minister have probably much greater obligations than the average Deputy in connection with their social activities&mdash;in the subscriptions which they are supposed or expected to give for charitable purposes.  Every member of the House, and you, Sir, know very well that one of the oldest members of the Oireachtas&mdash;he was a member of both Houses&mdash; died and left a large family in fairly bad circumstances. An S.O.S. was sent out to members of the Oireachtas inviting them to send subscriptions for the purpose of giving some help to his widow and her young family.  I was a subscriber to the fund and I was supplied with a list of the subscribers. There are members sitting on the Opposition Benches who, although the deceased was not a member of their Party, subscribed five times more than that subscribed by Ministers.</P>

      <P>The main case that I am making on behalf of my colleagues against the proposals contained in this measure is that there should have been previous consultation, particularly in reference to the proposed increases for the leaders of the Opposition Parties. The Ministers themselves have decided the amount of the increase which they are entitled to receive without giving the House all the information which it is entitled to have in connection with a matter of this kind.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, when replying on the previous Bill, did so in a good humoured, cool and calm manner.  He said that he was giving all the information.  He did not give it all because I suppose he has more information than any Deputy. He said he was giving all this information to convince the country that they were right in submitting these proposals for increases for Senators and Deputies.  Let him, at least, give us the information that we are entitled to have, that is, what the total all-in cost will be under the terms of this Bill for the Taoiseach, the Ministers, the Parliamentary Secretaries and any other person who is to get the increase.  That all-in cost means the average cost of running the cars that are provided at the expense of the taxpayers for Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries.</P>

      <P>In connection with this Bill, it is difficult for the ordinary Deputy to know exactly whether the claim for the increase in salaries is justified or not.  It is certainly not easy for the ordinary Deputy who has had no experience of Ministerial office to know exactly what are the costs and the commitments involved in the case <Col N="422" /> of such an office.  I think, however, that many of the arguments which were advanced against the proposal to increase Deputies' salaries are also valid on this Bill.  This is a proposal to increase the salaries of Ministers who are the servants of the people. The people, therefore, should have some say on this particular question. No servant should have the right to increase his own salary without reference to his employer.  I want, again, to put up the proposition that the operation of this Bill should be suspended until such time as the people have been given the opportunity of voting on it.</P>
      <P>In connection with this whole matter of the high cost of living, we can never lose sight of the fact that this is a poor country and that the average income of our people is very small, and that the real income of our people has not been in any way increased since the establishment of this State.  That is a grave reflection upon our native Governments.  I think that, in face of that reflection, Ministers should be slow to seek an improvement in their salaries.  One of the things which, I think, makes for the apparent difficulty which Ministers find in existing upon their present salaries is the fact that Dublin has become probably the most expensive city in the world in which to live.  The cost of housing accommodation, the cost of all necessaries of life and the cost of luxuries and amenities which a Minister and his family might feel they were entitled to are out of all proportion to what is just and reasonable.  I have one proposition to make to our Ministers as an alternative to this proposal to increase salaries, that is, that the whole Government machine should be moved out of the City of Dublin.  Our Ministers and Ministries should move out into some country town or village where the cost of living is not as high as it is in the city.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy, and I think it was Deputy Davin, complained that there was no consultation before the introduction of this particular measure.  That is true.  The Government, as I said earlier this evening, having concluded the negotiations which led to the settlement of the salaries of various public officials, came to the conclusion that those other officers of the State that had not yet been dealt with should receive increases in salary in proportion to those that had been granted to judges, civil servants, and so on.  Deputies will have noticed that the increase proposed in this Bill for the Taoiseach and the Attorney-General&mdash;20 per cent.&mdash; corresponds to the increase proposed for judges of the High Court who had equivalent salaries.  Parliamentary Secretaries and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, who had £1,200, were increased by 30 per cent.&mdash;the same percentage increase as that granted to district justices who were around that figure.  The same for the Leas-Cathaoirleach of the Seanad would mean that his salary was increased by an amount equivalent to a comparable salary.  For the Leader of the Second Party, as it is described in the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Bill, and the Leader of the Third Party it was decided that 30 per cent. should be added to the allowance that was made to them for expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was felt that the proper thing for the Government to do on an occasion such as this was to make these proposals and to discuss them in full view of the public, trusting that the people of the country would see that they are reasonable, having regard to the increase in expenses generally and having <Col N="424" /> regard to what was done for other officers of the State.  If Deputy Blowick and Deputy Commons would either leave the House or listen it would be easier for me to explain and to reply to the points that were made.</P>

      <P>The question that was put by Deputy Mulcahy was, what was the reason for the introduction of this particular Bill and for the proposals contained in it?  In 1938 the matter was discussed here in the Dáil following an examination of the salaries and allowances of Ministers and other officers of the State by what is known as the Shanley Committee.  The Shanley Committee recommended that the Taoiseach should have £3,000 a year, the Tánaiste, £2,500, other Ministers of State, £2,250, and so on.  The proposals that were made by the Government were passed through the Dáil. On the Second Reading there were only five members of the Dáil who objected and voted against the level of allowances and salaries proposed. The members of the principal Opposition Parties warmly supported the Bill and they gave their reasons. Deputy O'Higgins said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This measure exudes the real <Col N="425" /> spirit of giving expression to what democracy should mean&mdash;that the seats of Government are open to the poor and are not the monopoly of the rich.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was on the 23rd November, 1938, as reported in volume 73, column 905. Deputy Dillon, who was then the deputy leader of the main Opposition Party, as far as I remember, said, as reported in column 927 of the same volume:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am going to vote for this Bill because I approve of the principles enshrined in it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again he said, as given in column 932:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are now getting down to the pedestrian business of administering the affairs of State.  We have got to protect ourselves against allowing this immensely important work to fall into the hands of mediocre men.... Unless we can reassure men, in the rising generations of Ireland, that Ministerial office in the service of the State is going to give them a standard of living as high as they could get in commercial careers, without its luxuries, we are not going to get the right men into politics at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The matter was fully debated in the Dáil and it passed the Second Reading, only five members of the Dáil voting against it.  It was considered then that this level of salary was the correct one for the Ministers, the Taoiseach, the officers of the Dáil and Seanad and the leaders of the two principal Opposition Parties.  Is there anyone will say that, if these sums were fixed as a proper standard in 1938, their value has not decreased to the recipients by 25 per cent. or 20 per cent. in some cases since 1938?  I do not think any Deputy will, and I think the people of the country will see that, although a gesture of opposition to these proposals may be made by members of the House, they are reasonable allowances for the increases in costs since 1938.  They will see that, if the Dáil by a huge majority passed these allowances and salaries in 1938, we cannot in reason say that the compensation of 20 to 30 per cent. is more than sufficient to meet the increased cost since them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick and, I think, Deputy <Col N="426" /> Davin asked about the costs of the transport made available for Ministers. A number of Parliamentary Questions on that were put to the Minister for Justice and the information was given as far as it was available to the Minister who is responsible for the Garda providing this transport. The Gardaí will be delighted to hear that they have £500 a year and I am sure they are only sorry it was Deputy Blowick who made that mistake and not the paymaster of the Garda.  Regarding transport for Ministers, the Shanley Committee pointed out that there was an element of protection in the use of official cars and the provision of official Garda drivers.  At some periods, not only was one car provided but there was a second car with an armed escort, as well as the armed driver with the Minister.  There is in that transport an element of protection. As far as the normal Minister is concerned, the official cars are a damn nuisance and any of them would be delighted, if the circumstances were such, in the opinion of the Gardaí, that they could simply get a few hundred pounds a year to provide their own cars for themselves.</P>
    <P>The Shanley Committee recommended that the system of transport for Ministers that was in operation prior to 1932&mdash;and prior to 1937, when they examined this business&mdash;should continue.  The Dáil accepted that proposition in 1938 and there is no change proposed in this Bill.  What is being proposed in the Bill is that the Taoiseach, in regard to his salary, should get an additional 20 per cent., that Ministers and the Ceann Comhairle should get 25 per cent. and other officials of the Dáil and Seanad and Parliamentary Secretaries increases ranging up to 30 per cent. on their salaries.  I believe that the people of the country will recognise that these are reasonable proposals.</P>
    <P>I think they will recognise, too, that in regard to the allowances made to the leaders of the principal Opposition Parties the increases of 30 per cent. will not compensate for the increase in costs if they are doing the same amount of work and employing the same staff to do that work as they <Col N="427" /> were in 1938.  I know that, as far as Government offices are concerned, typists and clerical staffs have got increases of 30, 40, 50 and some of them 60 per cent.  If this business of making an allowance for expenses to the leaders of the principal Opposition groups is not to be a mere gesture, it is necessary that these sums should be given to these two leaders for the purpose of carrying on their work.  It was recognised by the Shanley Committee, it was recognised by the Dáil here the last time, that the Opposition Parties had an important job of work to do in a democratic State, that is, to criticise as effectively as they can the work of the administration.  I do not think that 30 per cent. addition there is over-generous.  It was not necessary to have the consultation and the approaches which Deputy Mulcahy says should have occurred.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="428" /> When the whole matter is boiled down, it comes to this: the Government is here elected by the Dáil from among the representatives of the people to do a certain job of work and it is the Government's responsibility to make propositions towards the proper government of the State.  The Government felt it was its duty to propose increases for all sorts of officials of the State and it felt it was its duty to make the provision proposed here for the remaining officers of the State &mdash;the Taoiseach, Ministers and officers of the Dáil and Seanad.  I believe the people are wise enough to see that these are necessary increases and that they will not regard them as being over-generous, if they agree at all to the salaries and allowances fixed in 1938.</P>

      <P>That it is expedient to authorise such charges on and payments out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof as are necessary to give effect to any Act of the present Session to increase with retrospective effect the salary of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, this Bill deals with the salary of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  His salary is governed by the Comptroller and Auditor-General Act, 1923, sub-section (1) of Section 2, providing for the payment to him of a salary of £1,500 inclusive per annum.  The purpose of the present Bill is to provide for an increase of 25 per cent. in that salary with effect as from the 1st April last. The increase proposed, which will bring the salary of the Comptroller and Auditor-General up to £1,875 is in keeping with the increases granted generally to public servants with comparable salaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil approves of the International Agreement on North Atlantic Ocean Weather Observation Stations, signed at London on the 25th September, 1946, a copy of which was laid on the Table of the Dáil on the 3rd June, 1947.</P>
      <P>The agreement to which the motion relates was made at a conference held in London last year under the auspices of the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organisation.  Previously, the North Atlantic Regional Conference held in Dublin had recommended that 13 ocean weather ships should be maintained at certain points in the North Atlantic and the later London conference confirmed that recommendation and drew up the agreement settling the location of the stations, the method of financing and operating them, and so forth.  The agreement was signed by nine States having direct interest in aviation in the North Atlantic region.  The estimated cost of operating these weather stations will be in the order of £2,000,000 per year. The division of the cost between the participating States was based broadly on the anticipated use of the stations, as measured by the probable number of transatlantic flights to be made by the operating companies of each State in the year commencing 1st July next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that basis our share would be about 1 per cent, or £20,000.  There was, however, acceptance by the conference of the idea that the countries already making exceptional contributions to the provision of navigational facilities should receive credit for their contributions when considering the question of the stationary weather-ships. We offered to contribute £5,000 per annum and that offer was agreed to.  A contribution at that rate from this country is provided for in that <Col N="431" /> agreement.  The plan in the agreement provides for the operating and financing of the stations by named States as set out under Article 3 of the Agreement. Our contribution will be made as a general contribution to the cost of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Aviation and meteorological experts agree that the setting up of these weather stations will be a noteworthy development in the history of civil aviation in the North Atlantic region. The data they will provide will make for greater safety, for a considerable improvement in the regularity of services and for substantial economies in their operation.  The stations should also result in better weather forecasts over all the Western European area and will, therefore, be of help, not merely to aviation but also to the shipping and fishing industries, to agriculture and other interests needing reliable weather forecasts.  The conclusion of an agreement between the States concerned to provide these ocean weather stations is a useful example of international co-operation in the field of air transport.  It is fully in accord with our national policy that we should play our part in such co-operation.  I, therefore, recommend to the Dáil to adopt this agreement.</P>

      <P>I do not think we could do that unless we were prepared to undertake the financing of a station.

      <P>When we are a party to it, would it not be better if we had some return from it in the way of getting some training for scientific <Col N="433" /> personnel in this country who may be required in the future?  I notice that these other countries who are parties to the agreement will have personnel trained at these various stations.  What struck me as peculiar in the agreement was that we have no representation or no opportunity of having any of our nationals trained there.  That would leave this country without any trained or skilled staff of any kind for any purpose of our own for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the position. The trained staff will be meteorological experts.  Because of our western position in Europe, we have a rather special function in the whole meteorological organisation of Europe.  In fact, we maintain a meteorological service used primarily in connection with aviation which is of very great value, not merely to ourselves, but to everybody concerned with aviation in the North Atlantic area or with weather forecasts in Europe.  We are training a staff and have taken very special measures to secure a trained staff for that service.  It would, I think, be asking this country to make an undue contribution to the meteorological information required in the North Atlantic area or Western Europe if we were to do more than provide for the costs of the ground stations on our soil.</P>

      <P>No, it is the same thing. The purpose of these stations will be to broadcast hourly or half hourly, as may be arranged, information as to the weather conditions on the spot where they are.  That is the raw material of the forecast used either for preparing a flight schedule for an aircraft captain or a more general forecast of weather conditions over a longer period.</P>

      <P>When the Minister talks about a service for agriculture, is it the intention to develop a meteorological service here similar to that in Sweden?  That service does not give general information but more localised information, because localised information is very important at certain times of the year to the agricultural community. It is not a fortnight's forecast you want at a period like this for hay-making; you want to know what will happen to-morrow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Trade Union Act of 1941 made it unlawful for any body of persons, with certain specified exceptions, to carry on negotiations for the fixing of wages or other conditions of employment without a negotiating licence issued under that Act.  As a condition for the grant of a negotiating licence, trade unions were required to make and maintain deposits with the High Court, the amount of the deposit depending on the numerical strength of the trade union concerned. A scale of deposits was laid down in the Schedule to the Act and ran from £1,000 up to a maximum of £10,000 for the largest organisations.</P>
      <P>In 1941 it was foreseen that, on account of the prevailing abnormal conditions, some of the Irish trade unions would have a temporary difficulty in making the full deposit specified in the Schedule to the Act.  It was, therefore, deemed necessary to make provision for a variation of the requirements in such cases.  Accordingly, Section 8 of the Act conferred power to grant temporary relief to a trade union registered in this State, where it was established in any particular case that, on account of abnormal conditions referable to the war, undue hardship would ensue if the trade union was compelled to make and to keep with the High Court a full deposit.  The relief extended to a maximum of 75 per cent. of the sum mentioned in the Schedule, but the power to grant that relief was exerciseable only while the Emergency Powers Act was in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of trade unions required relief and applied for it, and reduction Orders were made under the section in a substantial number of cases. These Orders will, however, expire on 2nd September next and the trade unions concerned will then be required by the Act to raise their deposits to the appropriate sum mentioned in the Schedule.  Moreover, since the repeal of the Emergency Powers Act, a trade union applying for a negotiating licence would be required to make and maintain the full deposit, whatever its <Col N="437" /> circumstances might be.  That position has been under review and has recently been the subject of discussions with representatives of trade union organisations.  It has been represented to me that the circumstances which necessitated the relevant provisions of the Act of 1941 have not yet materially changed and that the withdrawal of the Orders in the near future would cause difficulty and, in some cases, might have the effect of disqualifying trade unions from holding the negotiating licences already granted to them.  The purpose of this Bill, therefore, is to continue, for a further period of one year after 2nd September next, the existing reduction Orders made under Section 8 of the Act and also to provide power to make new Orders for a limited period.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that the present position of trade union legislation is not very satisfactory and I have had discussions with the trade union congresses on the matter of new and comprehensive legislation to protect the status and rights of trade unions and define their obligations to their members.  I have expressed the view that, generally speaking, there is no necessary conflict between the principles which the Government would wish to have enshrined in such legislation and those which trade unionists would themselves consider desirable. On that basis, I have, in effect, invited them to frame the heads of new legislative proposals themselves.  The matter is being considered by those bodies and later on there will be further consultations and discussions.  I hope that as a result there will be a Bill for the consideration of the Dáil before the expiration of the period of 12 months contemplated by this Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill, therefore, is a temporary measure.  Circumstances might have made it possible to have had the discussions leading to the framing of new legislation earlier, and the introduction of a Bill in this session.  Various causes of delay arose, mainly on my part, and, consequently, the discussions could not be completed.  In these circumstances, I agreed to ask the Dáil to pass this Bill.  It is a minor Bill, but it does prevent, for the period when discussions <Col N="438" /> are proceeding and while new legislation is being prepared, the possibility of difficulty arising for some trade unions which have benefited by the power to grant a reduction of the deposits required from them when they obtained their negotiating licence.  I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that on 2nd September next he is reducing the deposits.  First it was £1,000 to £10,000, according to membership.  Now you are reducing that on 2nd September next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy apparently misunderstands.  A number of trade unions which had temporary difficulties during the war were allowed to take out negotiating licences on the payment of a reduced deposit.  The actual deposit required was determined by membership, but unions were allowed licences on a deposit of only 25 per cent. of the amount prescribed in the schedule.  They are still in that position and are now holding negotiating licences on the strength of the making of reduced deposits.  That position would end on 2nd September and on that date they would have to make the full deposits or else surrender the negotiating licences.  The purpose of the Bill is to extend the period for another 12 months, it being contemplated that there will be new and comprehensive legislation dealing with trade unions submitted to the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has made a very sensible approach to this problem of continuing what was, for the smaller Irish unions, a very useful provision during the emergency, inasmuch as they had not to make the full deposits required under the notorious 1941 Act.  As it was, they were enabled to secure the negotiating licence by the payment of 25 per cent. of the normal deposits.  It helped many small craft organisations which suffered through the emergency by reason of emigration on the part of their members and the continuance of that provision will be useful and helpful to those organisations.  I am glad that the Minister has not merely continued it, but has taken power to recognise the special position of other unions that may be affected.  To that extent, the Bill is not merely continuing a useful provision, but is extending it.</P>
      <P>I say this to the Minister in no acrimonious way, that this test of one's title deeds to be a trade union, based on his cheque book or his bank balance, is an odious and reprehensible one. The test of a trade union ought not to be its cheque book.  There should be some other method of defining what is or is not a <i>bona fide</i> trade union.  This type of test under the 1941 Act is one of the most serious blemishes in an Act that is bristling with blemishes.  I do not accuse the present Minister for that odious kind of provision.  I think that the people who were charged with preparing that legislation, through their natural sagacity, should have dropped a provision of that kind, knowing the difficulties of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope from the discussions between the Minister and the two Trade Union Congresses, that some type of machinery will be evolved, some tribunal established to which it will be possible to go in order to get a certificate that an organisation is, in fact, a trade union, when it has the well-known attributes and possesses the characteristics of a trade union, and that that <Col N="440" /> will be its title deed to function as a union rather than have the test imposed by the 1941 Act and continued, though in a less aggravated form, by the present Bill.</P>
    <P>I think there is everything to be said for the registration of trade unions, as identifiable trade union structures, but I think the test should be that the union conforms to certain well-established and clearly-defined practices rather than that the mere deposit of a cheque should be its title deeds to function as a trade union.  I know the Minister in this matter has a very difficult job to bring up to date our trade union legislation and to fashion it in accordance with modern needs and requirements.  It is not an easy job.  I am glad to hear him say that he hopes that at the expiry of this Bill, the Dáil will be presented with legislation bringing the position up to date.  In his efforts in that connection, the Minister will have the goodwill of all who want to see the trade union movement fulfil a useful and responsible position in the public and economic life of this country. It is by no means an easy task to fashion the necessary legislation, nor is it easy to induce people to abandon old practices which grew up in a set of circumstances not now wholly present with us.  As I say, the Minister will have our good wishes if he approaches that in the realistic way in which he approached the Industrial Relations Act which gave us, notwithstanding some imperfections, a very useful piece of legislation and which, in a very difficult time, contributed in a substantial way to the avoidance of a good deal of industrial strife.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not as prominently identified with the work of trade unions at the moment as Deputy Norton or Deputy O'Leary but nevertheless, I can claim to have a long association with the trade union movement.  When the original Bill was being put through the House, not by the present Minister, but I think, by the Minister for Local Government, I warned him that he was adopting a very dangerous attitude in regard to some trade unions comprised of common-sense men, who understood the difficulties of the country and who could be trusted to <Col N="441" /> make their presence felt if any disputes arose.  I pointed out that it would be impossible for many unions of that type, which existed in the early days, to pay the necessary deposits. In fact, £1,000 was mentioned at that time and I anticipated that there would be trouble in regard to this question of making a deposit.  I think it was wise, as time went on, and as experience was gained, to make a little concession to these unions who, because of their financial position, could not comply with the requirements of the provisions of the original Act in regard to the deposit.  I am glad that those arrangements were made, and now that the emergency powers are being dispensed with&mdash;of course, those concessions were granted under emergency powers&mdash;the object of this Bill is to prolong for another year the concessions that had been made to those trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the period that must necessarily elapse, the Minister hopes that some agreement will be come to in regard to the shape of the Bill which he hopes ultimately to introduce.  I join with Deputy Norton in expressing the hope that, with goodwill and co-operation with the working classes, an arrangement will be come to which will spare this country many of the undesirable developments that have occurred in the last few years in the labour world.  I, for one, do not want to see disunity <Col N="442" /> amongst the labour classes.  I should like to see all unions working for the interests of the country which we all desire to serve.  I join with Deputy Norton in hoping that the unions, the working classes and all concerned, will see to it that whatever legislation is introduced will bring about a proper spirit of goodwill and co-operation that will react, not only to the interests of the unions themselves, but to the interests of the people in general.</P>

      <P>I should like to say, in connection with the point made by Deputy Norton, that while I think it desirable that there should be some method of testing the <i>bona fides</i> of a body claiming recognition as a trade union, and some discouragement of the formation of splinter unions or the unnecessary duplication of unions, I would not regard it as essential that the test should take the form of capacity to make a financial deposit, if a more satisfactory test could be devised.</P>
