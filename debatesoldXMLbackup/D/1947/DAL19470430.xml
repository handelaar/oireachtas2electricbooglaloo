    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if the affairs of the League of Nations have been wound up; whether the assets of that organisation have been disposed of; whether, in the winding up of the organisation, any sums appear to be (i) due by this country, or (ii) due to this country; and if so, what action has been taken in regard to such moneys.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the dissolution of the League of Nations on the 18th April, 1946, the winding up of its affairs has been in the hands of a board of liquidation appointed by the League. The board has not yet completed the work.  Some of the assets, including the legal title to buildings at Geneva, furniture, office equipment and other similar property, and certain special funds, have already been transferred to the United Nations, the International Labour Office or other international organisations.  But the greater part of the assets, including the whole of the ordinary funds of the League, has not yet been disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No sums are due by this country to the League, but, under the scheme of distribution of its assets adopted by the League at its final session, this country is entitled to a share of all the material and liquid assets remaining at the time of the League's dissolution.  This share is determined on the basis of the proportion borne by our total contributions to the League during its existence <Col N="1690" /> to the total contributions paid by all members of the League down to and including those for the year 1946.  Our share of the assets so determined works out at 1.55 per cent. of the total.  On this basis, our share of the material assets is valued at about 735,000 Swiss francs.  Our share of the liquid assets cannot be exactly determined, however, until the net total available for distribution is finally ascertained.</P>
    <P>The scheme of distribution adopted by the League provides that the liquid assets should be distributed in cash and that members' shares in the material assets should be credited against the contributions payable by them as members of the United Nations.  This country is, of course, not a member of the United Nations, but an assurance has been sought and received from the board of liquidation that, if necessary, our share of the material as well as of the liquid assets will be paid in cash when the board presents its final audited accounts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the serious shortage of domestic help in this country owing to the increasing reluctance of Irish girls to engage in domestic work; and if, seeing that there are available in Austria and such other devastated continental countries many homeless and efficient girls, anxious to take up housework, he will arrange, through the agency of the Red Cross Society, for the placing of such girls in employment here where a good home and good wages would be available to them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he will arrange for the admission of aliens, seeking employment as domestic servants in Ireland, in view of the acute shortage of Irish citizens willing to enter this branch of employment and the hardship thereby occasioned to housewives unable to secure domestic help.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1691" /> The desirability of issuing employment permits under the Aliens Order, 1946, to employers wishing to employ female aliens as domestic servants is under consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it from that reply that housewives who are in a position to contact suitable girls or women for this type of employment should file their application with the Minister forthwith for the necessary permits?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to tell us the approximate date on which his decision on that matter will be made known?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Before that decision is taken, will the Minister see that the conditions of employment in this type of service are improved, and there may be no necessity to bring in volunteers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider, in this connection, the desirability of appointing some lady officer of his Department to whom girls coming in under a scheme of permits of this kind might refer any grievance they would have, so that no question of victimisation of a girl separated from her parents and relatives would properly arise?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Risteárd Ua Maolchatha</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he will cause to be prepared and issued a special report on present agricultural output similar to that issued for the year 1926-1927.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1692" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not intended at present to depart from the current practice of publishing annually in the <i>Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin</i> an article on the agricultural output for the preceding year.  The report for 1945 appeared in the June, 1946, issue and the output for 1946 will be dealt with in the September, 1947, issue.</P>
      <P>Notes on the principles and methods adopted for the estimation of agricultural output appeared in the September, 1931, issue of the journal and a detailed review, covering the period from 1926-27 to 1942-43, was published in the issues for March and June, 1944.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say that notes were published in the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> for September, 1931?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Notes on the principles and methods adopted for compilation of the output were then published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that those interested in the matter would like to have a review of those principles, now that we are in 1947, and that they find it difficult to regard as satisfactory an outline of principles established in 1931? A great many things have happened since. There has been a considerable change in the type of agricultural output. Quite a large number of people are interested in having a review of the situation.  They would like to have the principles reset or, if the old principles are being accepted, they would like to have them reiterated in an up-to-date statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite the contrary.  I think the value of these statistics depends largely upon their uniformity. Their compilation on the basis of the same principles year by year is an essential contribution to their value.</P>

It is hoped to have the work completed within a few months, but in view of current difficulties in the printing trade it is not possible at this stage to indicate the probable date of completion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that Córas Iompair Éireann contemplate the building of a luxury hotel in the South; and if so, whether he will make representations to the company that, in the public interest, capital for ventures of this kind would be better employed in: (i) speeding up the conversion of coal-consuming locomotives to oil-burning, thus providing the ordinary and holiday trains desired by the public; and (ii) augmenting and improving all classes of railway rolling stock and equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that Córas Iompair Éireann have postponed their plans for a new hotel in the South for the present.</P>
      <P>Delays in implementing the company's programme have not been occasioned by the lack of the necessary capital.  The conversion of coal-consuming locomotives to oil-burning was held up by the strike of fitters and turners.  The principal limiting factor at present is the lack of storage facilities for fuel oil.  The programme for new and improved railway rolling stock and equipment is delayed by the difficulty in procuring essential supplies.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that while a ferry service is provided at Youghal Bridge, by Córas Iompair Éireann, for the crews of buses plying on the Waterford to Cork route, no such service is available for passengers, who must cross the bridge <Col N="1694" /> on foot; and if he will direct Córas Iompair Éireann to provide this facility for passengers using the service in question.</P>

      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>Córas Iompair Éireann provide a hackney service to convey bus passengers across Youghal Bridge.  The company have contracted with the owner of the hackney to make sufficient runs to transport all passengers.  Passengers can remain in the bus while waiting to be conveyed in the hackney car.  I see no reason to ask the company to provide shelters at the bridge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware that the Dublin Board of Assistance have reduced outdoor relief allowances to persons who are in receipt of increased benefits from the National Health Insurance Society under the provisions of the Social Welfare Schemes (Cash Supplements) Order, 1947; whether it was intended that the granting of these cash supplements should operate to reduce outdoor relief <Col N="1695" /> payments; and if not, if he will make it clear to public assistance authorities that it was not intended that cash supplements to national health insurance beneficiaries were to be considered as income which would reduce other assistance allowances to which beneficiaries would be entitled, in the ordinary course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not the intention that the grant of cash supplements under the provisions of the Social Welfare Schemes (Cash Supplements) Order, 1947, should have an adverse effect on the financial position of any recipient of a supplement.  The Deputy must be aware that the grant of home assistance is a matter entirely within the discretion of the public assistance authorities.  Applications for home assistance are judged solely on the merits of each case, in the light of the general circumstances of the applicant and his household, the number of dependents, etc., and assistance is not provided in accordance with any fixed scale.  Section 5 (2) of the Public Assistance Act, 1939, expressly precludes the Minister from directing the giving of public assistance to any individual person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any knowledge of the fact that, because of the few shillings increase his Department gave to the people on national health benefits, they have lost in some cases an average of 1/3? He gave 3/9 and the board of assistance took off 5/-.  Surely the Minister can say that it was not intended that that money, given to meet the increased cost of living, should be taken off the home assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Minister must not be getting the letters I sent to his Department, directing attention to several victimised people in the city. I ask him to make further inquiries and make another recommendation.  I know it was not the Minister's intention that it should happen, but it is being done by another authority.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that small remittances from the United States of America to poor persons in this country have, in several instances, been declared forfeit as they were forwarded in English currency instead of in American dollars; that this was due to ignorance on the part of the senders as to our currency import regulations and the forfeitures have caused much hardship to the consignees; and if he will consider the possibility of arranging to disseminate amongst our people in the United States some knowledge of our regulations to obviate the hardships complained of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first part of the question, I am aware that remittances in the form of British bank notes sent through the post from the United States of America have been seized in accordance with the law which prohibits their importation from anywhere except Great Britain, Six Counties and Channel Islands.  The disposal of the notes so seized is a matter for direction by me pursuant to Emergency Powers (Finance) (No. 6) Order, 1940.</P>
      <P>In reply to the second part of the question, I cannot accept the statement that the senders were ignorant and it would be impossible without great expense to investigate all the claims of hardship which might be put forward.  It is my intention to enforce the law without discrimination.  None of the notes will be allowed to proceed to the consignees, but any balances not forfeited will be returned to the consignors.</P>
      <P>In reply to the third part of the question, I am satisfied that the prohibition against the sending of these notes to Ireland is generally known by those concerned in the United States and that the seizures which have taken place will emphasise that the prohibition is being strictly enforced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the great hardship and loss that growers of seed potatoes suffered this year because of the lateness in fixing the price? Potatoes that should have been going away at Christmas are only going away now.  Tillage operations have been seriously interfered with.

      <P>Two factors outlined have entered into the delay to which the Deputy referred.  One is that we were not satisfied with the price that was being offered to us, and, secondly, when the price was agreed on the weather conditions were such that it was not easy to get the potatoes out.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether, at a conference on food production held in Sligo, he stated that the price of eggs would reach 27/6 per great hundred; and if, as the present price is 22/6 per great hundred is insufficient to cover the cost of production, he will increase the fixed price to 27/6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is under a misconception as to my statement at the conference in question.  I stated that, to encourage producers to market more eggs, it was intended to increase the average price of eggs this year by 3d. per dozen, or by 2/6 per great hundred, over the average price last year. At the time I made this announcement, the price to producers was 25/- per hundred, or 2/6 per dozen.  That price was maintained until the 26th March last in view of the abnormal weather conditions, when it was reduced to the present level of 2/3 per dozen, i.e., 22/6 per hundred, in accordance with the usual seasonal variation.  The present price is 3d. per dozen higher than in the corresponding period of last year. The prices paid for eggs for export are based on the assumption that exports will attain a volume which will secure the highest price available on the export market.  In the circumstances, it is not possible to increase the average price.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, at ten minutes to 3 o'clock to-day I got handed to me a copy of an amendment to the motion standing in <Col N="1704" /> my name.  Am I to understand that the amendment has been accepted for discussion because, if so, I wish to argue that it is out of order on a certain number of points.  The amendment says in the first paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil is of opinion that it is desirable that the obligations and privileges of members should be more adequately defined, and that appropriate action to that end should be taken without delay.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I submit that is out of order, and that a decision has already, within the past few weeks, been taken on that matter. The second paragraph refers to the prior ruling of the Ceann Comhairle on the 29th instant.  It says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That in view of the fact that, prior to the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle on 29th instant, there has been no rule or resolution of the House or ruling of the Ceann Comhairle which declared it to be a breach of privilege for a member to criticise, outside the House, the conduct of the Chair, the Dáil does not agree that the speech of the Minister for Local Government can, in the circumstances, be held to constitute such a breach.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I submit that that part of the amendment is out of order for vagueness.  We have no terms of any ruling supposed to have been given by the Ceann Comhairle on the 29th instant. Finally, it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil accepts the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle, above referred to, and decides that, henceforth, adverse criticism of the conduct of the Chair, made outside the House, shall be a breach of privilege.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I submit, if the Ceann Comhairle has made a ruling, that the ruling stands, and that it can only be discussed here by positive motion, either setting aside the ruling or criticising the ruling in some particular kind of way&mdash;that, generally, it appears to put some body in between the Ceann Comhairle and the ruling.  I submit that the Ceann Comhairle's ruling is a matter entirely for himself.  It cannot be changed or interfered with or affected in any particular kind of way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1705" /> Again, the amendment refers to a thing, and I do not know what it is. It refers to a breach of privilege.  The people in Great Britain may know what a breach of privilege is, but here I do not.  I do not think that anyone in the House does.  At any rate there is no definition of it and there is no knowledge here of what it is.  The motion down in my name deals in no way with a breach of privilege.  It deals with a matter which is a matter of concern for this House &mdash; that having appointed a Ceann Comhairle, a position of vital importance to it in carrying on its deliberations and in the taking of its decisions &mdash; by asking that we should protect the Ceann Comhairle from insults outside this House.  It is an appeal to the common decency and to the common sense of the House which has been in operation since the House was established.  On all these grounds I submit that this amendment is an irrelevant motion, and that by its very terms it is out of order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered this motion carefully and decided that it was in order.  In the first place, the opening paragraph &mdash; the preamble, if you like &mdash; is relevant to what follows. As regards the ruling, some maintain that there was no law or precedent to decide that criticism of the Ceann Comhairle by a Deputy outside the House was a breach of privilege.  In accepting the question from the leader of the Opposition yesterday, and the motion, I implicitly decided that there was a breach.  That is where the question of ruling comes in and I consider that this amendment is quite in order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  I beg to move the motion standing in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Minister for Local Government be suspended from the service of the Dáil until such time as he shall have made suitable apology to the Dáil for the adverse criticism of the conduct of the Chair made publicly by him in his speech at the Engineers' Hall, Dublin, and reported in the daily Press on Monday, 28th April, 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1706" /> The motion concerns one net point, that is, in what circumstances and in what fashion the conduct of the Chair here can be criticised by a member of the House? From our point of view there are two principles involved. First, a decision of the Chair must be obeyed.  Secondly, a decision of the Chair can only be questioned in the most formal manner here by a motion put down and discussed in this House. Over the last 25 years, since the establishment of this Dáil, we have carried on here through difficult times with remarkable order and with remarkable achievement in that matter, and we have been able to do so because during those 25 years these two principles have been accepted that, whether we like the Ceann Comhairle or not, or whether we like his rulings or not, or whether his rulings are right or wrong, when the Ceann Comhairle rules, we accept his ruling and that, where any objection is taken to his rulings, the only way in which objection can be expressed and the only way in which the opinion of the Dáil can be taken on his rulings or his conduct is by the moving of a motion here.  Now, the attitude of the Government seems to challenge these two principles.  I think it must be unprecedented in any kind of democratic kind of Parliament and, as far as I can see, if it is so and if the Government do reject these two principles, then the results for this House and for the individual members of this House and for the country's business which depends upon the orderly and effective carrying out of this House, are really unforeseeable.</P>
    <P>This Assembly is one for discussion and deliberation leading up to decision in matters that in a sovereign and supreme way affect not only the actual details of the lives of our people in many ways but affect the atmosphere in which they work.  The Constitution establishes the Legislature.  When issuing their new version of the Constitution the Government put in a Preamble in order to lift to a high and lofty plane our whole approach to our public and political work.  The Preamble says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the name of the Most Holy Trinity, from Whom is all authority <Col N="1707" /> and to Whom, as our final end, all actions both of men and States must be referred,</P>
    <P>We, the people of Éire,</P>
    <P>Humbly acknowledging all our obligations to our Divine Lord, Jesus Christ, Who sustained our fathers through centuries of trial,</P>
    <P>Gratefully remembering their heroic and unremitting struggle to regain the rightful independence of our Nation,</P>
    <P>And seeking to promote the common good, with due observance of Prudence, Justice and Charity, so that the dignity and freedom of the individual may be assured, true social order attained, the unity of our country restored, and concord established with other nations,</P>
    <P>Do hereby adopt, enact, and give to ourselves this Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Legislature here is based upon the will expressed by vote of every citizen of 21 years of age and upwards and the electoral scheme provides for proportional representation so that even small sections of our people may be adequately represented here and may have their voice heard.  So that many voices blend here to express our national feelings, our national desires, our national will with regard to the ordering of our people's lives politically, socially and economically.  When establishing the position of Ceann Comhairle, the Office of the Chair, to preside over the discussions, deliberations and the formal taking of decisions here, one Deputy of the House is selected and asked to undertake that vital function and those onerous duties.  From the very beginning it has been accepted here that his ruling went unchallenged until such time as by formal action here, by formal motion, he could be criticised. Now we are apparently asked to believe that because no written rule of some kind or another can be found anywhere to show that there may not be done outside the House what may not be done inside the House, there is no need for a Deputy who has vehemently and critically attacked the conduct of the Chair to come in here to the House and to say that he is sorry for it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1708" /> I am not appealing here to privilege. I am not appealing here even to precedent. I am appealing to our sense of our responsibilities here, to our sense of how business should be carried on here, to our sense of the responsibilities that are borne by the Chair. I am asking, how can we with any sense of our own personal dignity and responsibility or of the dignity of this sovereign and supreme institution in the minds of our people, preserve ourselves and our sense of responsibility and do our work if not only an individual Deputy but a Minister of State can go outside and before public audience in a most studied way challenge and criticise the conduct of the Chair here?</P>
    <P>In the earliest days of this House, when on the 29th February, 1924, a Minister refused, inside the House, to obey the orders of the Chair, Mr. Cosgrave, as then President, spoke these words &mdash; column 1605 Official Report, 29th February, 1924:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Ceann Comhairle respects and protects the liberty of every member of this House, and this House must be the guardian and the protector of the rights of the Ceann Comhairle, and this House must interpret, and ought to interpret, whether or not a matter which a member, be he Minister or otherwise, makes use of in this House, reflects or not upon the Ceann Comhairle. We ought not to put him in the position that he must, of himself, defend his office.  His office is a high and an important office in this State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the very threshold of the beginning of our work here when inside the House the Minister was refusing to accept the ruling of the Chair Mr. Cosgrave spoke these words and, in order to make it clear what he meant by them and what he stood for, he adjourned the House for an hour so that everybody, including the Minister in question, might be able to consider what it meant to the House to have the House respected here, to have the Chair protected here. I am asking now that the implications of what are said outside the House be taken into consideration here by every member of this House and that we face our responsibility in protecting the Chair here because, in protecting the <Col N="1709" /> Chair here, we are protecting ourselves and our own individual right in the fullness of discussion&mdash;discussion which is a contribution to deliberation and to subsequent decisions.  We may have all the freedom that we require restricted only by the opinion of the Chair as to whether we are exceeding the freedom necessary to have proper and full deliberation and true and effective decisions. We are not going to defend that by a rule if we cannot defend it now by our own decision here.  We are not going to defend it next week if we have no opinion as to whether it was right last week to attack the Chair in the degrading way in which the Chair was attacked.  Speaking at the Engineers' Hall the Minister for Local Government attacked the Chair on three occasions during his speech.  As I said yesterday, I am concerned here only with the Minister's criticism of the Chair.  First he said &mdash; I am reading from the <i>Irish Press</i> of Monday last, 28th April, 1947:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As it is, the Assembly is becoming a place where Parliamentary immunity is availed of to license slander and where the coarse tongue of a corner-boy can precipitate a brawl, with but the weakest of intervention from the Chair.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&ldquo;with but the weakest of intervention from the Chair&rdquo;! Later on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I cannot help reflecting how regrettable it is that those responsible for controlling the proceedings of Dáil Éireann should have permitted him and his friends to cover their contempt for the courts with the privileges that attach to proceedings of that Assembly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And finally:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Unfortunately, those responsible had been allowed too much licence by those sitting in the Chair.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Yesterday morning, towards 11 o'clock, I gave notice through the Government Whip to the Taoiseach and the Minister that I proposed to raise this matter at Question Time yesterday.  I really did feel that it was only necessary to mention the matter to have an apology forthcoming.  I did not know yesterday where we were likely to be led and I do not know now where we are likely to go when the Minister by <Col N="1710" /> his attitude and the Government by their support of him have led us to the position that this matter has to be discussed by motion.  The Ceann Comhairle is the sole custodian of order in the House.  His rulings must be obeyed.  We can only criticise or challenge the Chair by a motion formally put down here.  There is no more vital function served by any official or by any person or by any officer of State in this State than the function served here by the man who sits in the Chair. He is the whole linchpin of order here and, being so, he is the whole linchpin of anything like independent discussion.</P>
    <P>Many voices, as I have said, are sent here to represent the many aspects of our national life, to represent every single citizen of this nation and to see that their natural rights and every possible freedom that can be guaranteed for them for their own development and the development of this nation are safeguarded.  They can only be safeguarded here by discussion and by deliberation.  Because of the many channels into which discussion can run, and because of the many side issues that may arise, we require one experienced and responsible mind to say from time to time what is in order in discussion and what is not.  If that mind can be either ruled against by the majority of this House or controlled by a committee whether either directly or by orders laid down, then this House can have no life and we cannot make use to the best of our ability of the intelligence and the various outlooks and experience that we all bring here to pool together in discussion and deliberation for the general good of the country.  The motion which stands in my name is an appeal to decency.  It is an appeal to intelligence.  We cannot carry on our business here, we cannot do our business here to the full extent of our powers and to the most ultimate clearness of our minds unless we realise what the position of the Ceann Comhairle is.  If, yesterday as well as to-morrow, the man who occupies the Chair and fulfils the vital functions the Chair does for us can be insulted in a deliberate, systematic and sustained way in the way in which the Chair has <Col N="1711" /> been insulted by the Minister for Local Government in his speech on Saturday night last, then we are not a Parliament at all, and all we can say about order, all we can say about the dignity of the individual, all that we ought to express here in a Catholic country in our institution is mere hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>I hesitate even yet to think that the Minister, if he calmly and impartially and humbly considers the matter, will decline to apologise for his action on Saturday night last.  I think that, in spite of the difficulties that for him, as for us, have arisen by the delay there has been since the matter was mentioned&mdash;and I realise that grave difficulties have been created for him&mdash;it would be a great achievement for the nation and no one would think a scrap less of him; on the contrary, they would feel that the Minister was capable of realising even at a late hour the importance of certain fundamental things.  If, even now, he would say that he appreciates what the Government appreciates in the last part of the amendment to my motion, if he would end this matter by offering an apology for the critical words spoken, in the way in which they were spoken and published in the Press in the way in which they were published, in the Engineers' Hall on Saturday night last, I feel it would be proof that there was something in the Irish people and something in this Assembly that could rise above our present difficulties, that could face, in a Parliament where order was understood and appreciated, any difficulties, whether nationally or internationally, we may be facing in these difficult days and in the difficult years that seem to be in front of the world.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;the Dáil is of opinion that it is desirable that the obligations and privileges of members should be more adequately defined, and that <Col N="1712" /> appropriate action to that end should be taken without delay;</P>
    <P>that in view of the fact that, prior to the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle on 29th instant, there has been no rule or resolution of the House or ruling of the Ceann Comhairle which declared it to be a breach of privilege for a member to criticise, outside the House, the conduct of the Chair, the Dáil does not agree that the speech of the Minister for Local Government can, in the circumstances, be held to constitute such a breach;</P>
    <P>that the Dáil accepts the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle, above referred to, and decides that, henceforth, adverse criticism of the conduct of the Chair, made outside the House, shall be a breach of privilege.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Deputy who has moved the motion gave expression to very admirable sentiments.  My only regret is that they did not cover a wider field than the institution here.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that, recognising the direction in which we were tending, I brought in here a motion for the express purpose of trying to have clarified, in so far as it could be clarified, what are the liberties and what are the obligations of members of this House.  I wanted to have it set down in rules, in so far as it could be set down, what are the things that Deputies are not permitted to do.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested by Deputy Mulcahy that we have left everything to the discretion of the Chair.  I presume to say that that is not a fact. We have here Standing Orders passed by the House, and the Chair, in carrying out these Orders, is acting as a judge interpreting them.  Why have we done that? Why not have all our Standing Orders reduced to this, that the Ceann Comhairle can decide as he wishes on every matter that arises? Simply because we would have interminable questions addressed to the Ceann Comhairle.  We would ask him many questions, we would dispute with him, asking him shall we do this or that, or suggest-ing that it would be better to do this or better to do that.  We have these Standing Orders as a guide for everybody.  When this House was younger, new members coming in here studied these Standing Orders and it was not an unusual thing for the Standing Orders to be brought up in debate and quoted and the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle in reference to them asked for.</P>
      <P>We want to have the members of the House in a position to know exactly what their rights are and what their obligations are.  I know you cannot define it down to the smallest detail, and that is why you have it, as a sort of omnibus covering everything that has not so far been met, that the Ceann Comhairle shall, where there are any questions arising out of the Standing Orders which he has to interpret, generally be in charge of order.  I hold it is an advantage that we should have, in so far as it can be done, written rules, so that nobody can plead that he is ignorant of them.</P>

Consequently, I ask that we should have these rules here, in so far as they can be reduced to rules in black and white. We have had the regulations and the privileges of this House developed to a large extent by analogy with the rules and regulations which have been accepted elsewhere.  I do not think there is anything wrong about that.  I think it was very wise for us when we were beginning here that we took cognisance of what experience elsewhere had led to, but I think the time has passed when we ought to be content with that and, when we want to deal with any matter, we can merely say, &ldquo;Oh, that is what they do in another place&rdquo;.  I think the time has come when we can see what principles are being acted upon in another place&mdash;in the British House of Commons, for example, or in Congress in the United States, in so far as proceedings in Congress could be regarded as analogous to our proceedings here&mdash;and have these reduced to a few simple rules.</P>

      <P>I say, therefore, in support of this amendment, that it is desirable that the obligations and privileges of members should be more adequately defined and that appropriate action to that effect should be taken without delay.  The appropriate action can follow if we get co-operation from other Deputies, Deputies in the Opposition Benches, in regard to setting up the committee which the Dáil decided should be set up.</P>
      <P>I now come to the second paragraph which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;that in view of the fact that, prior to the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle on the 29th instant, there has been no rule or resolution of the House or ruling of the Ceann Comhairle which declared it to be a breach of privilege for a member to criticise, outside the House, the conduct of the Chair, the Dáil does not agree that the speech of the Minister for Local Government can, in the circumstances, be held to constitute such a breach.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were talking for some days past about the things that this House can do and the things it cannot do.  There is one thing that this House cannot do and that is to declare an act to be an offence when it was not so at the time of its commission.  Here we have a Minister arraigned because he has done something which Deputies on the opposite benches claim is wrong.  It has become definitely wrong from the time that the Ceann Comhairle has ruled and when that ruling is not by resolution of this House upset.  The latter part of this amendment is that, the Ceann Comhairle having declared yesterday by implication, as the Chair suggested to-day, that this reference to, or adverse criticism of, conduct of the Chair was a breach of privilege&mdash; because, I take it, that is the usual form in which it is stated &mdash; this House now affirms it to be so and that henceforth, the law having been declared, it will be a breach of privilege adversely to criticise the Chair outside.  As to the merits of that, I have no difficulty in my own mind at all.  I think we ought to accept both here and outside the rulings of the Chair but I do think that we would not be justified &mdash; particularly in all the circumstances which <Col N="1719" /> I cannot go into here&mdash;that we would be wrong, that we would be unfair, if we were to say that the Minister was guilty of a breach of privilege in all the circumstances.  I thought I might be able to discharge a duty that I felt incumbent upon me here in reference to another institution.  I see I cannot. I hope the public will understand also why I cannot.  It may be necessary as a public duty to do it otherwise.  I cannot within the terms of order, as declared, do it now.  I regret that fact because I do believe that all the institutions of the State should be respected.</P>

      <P>The Ceann Comhairle holds in this House all the rights and privileges that the Speaker holds in the House of Commons and the Parliamentary procedure of this House derives, and is founded upon, the customs and practice of the House of Commons just as the privileges and practices of the Congress of the United States of America founded themselves upon the same tradition.  Habitually, the Committee of Procedure and Privileges of this House refers to Erskine May whose authoritative work on Privilege in the House of Commons, in the absence of an authoritative contradiction, applies to the rules of this House.  I refer to the volume of Erskine May which comes from the Library of Dáil Eireann, the edition of 1924, page 90:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On the 4th April, 1887, an accusation of partiality in the administration of the closure, directed against the Speaker by a member at a public meeting, was informally brought before the house by a question addressed to the Chair.  The Speaker, in his reply, explained the nature of the offence which had thus been committed against the house by the member's conduct towards the Speaker; and the member made, in consequence, an apology in terms that averted the consequences of the offence.  In the following year the same member published in a newspaper a letter which contained a repetition of the same offence against the Speaker.  The house thereupon, having heard the member in his place, resolved that the letter was a gross libel upon the Speaker, deserving the severest condemnation of the house, and that the member be suspended from the service of the house for the remainder of the session, or for one calender month, whichever should first terminate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has the barefaced impertinence to get up in this House and declare that it has never been determined, until yesterday, whether it was a breach of the privileges of the House to criticise the Chair outside Parliament. Do I misquote him?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I now allege that these facts were known to the Taoiseach before he came to this House with the amendment he has propounded.  The Taoiseach is sustained by a highly competent staff of men who are familiar with every precedent in Erskine May.  The Taoiseach himself knows that reference to that classical source of authority for the definition of privileges of Houses of Parliament is habitually made by those servants of this House whose concern is advising on matters of order and privilege.  The Taoiseach himself knows that every Parliament in the world takes Erskine May as the foundation of its rules of procedure and accepts the precepts therein laid down, except in so far as, by resolution, <Col N="1722" /> the individual Parliament may have altered them to suit its own particular procedure.  The Taoiseach also knows that by a shameless and indecent appeal to ignorant prejudice, he will be able to persuade a sufficient number of simple people in this country that he is striking a blow for Irish independence when he repudiates the authority of Erskine May in Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>We are concerned in this House with nothing but this, to secure that this Parliament shall remain independent and free and that every Deputy in it, great or small, shall be secure in his privilege and in his sacrosanct rights.  There is no person in the House capable of ensuring that but the occupant of the Chair.  Let no one doubt that the Taoiseach for the time being is the Leader of this House and in a very special sense the custodian of its honour, a position habitually marked by the fact that, when it becomes the duty of the Ceann Comhairle to name a Deputy, it then becomes the duty of the Leader of the House to move that Deputy's suspension, and, though that Deputy belong to this side of the House, if a division be challenged, every member will follow the Leader of the House into the Lobby where he goes, and if we find the day approaching when individual <Col N="1723" /> Deputies, because they belong to the Government presided over by the Leader of the House, may with impunity insult the occupant of the Chair, threaten him from outside, and then find that, instead of his suspension being moved by the Leader of the House, a shameless amendment of this character is produced to cloak over the thing he has done, do you imagine that those of us who love liberty, those of us who are proud to think this country free will share in the Taoiseach's pretence that a free Parliament functions in this country, when it is the manifest intention of the Executive to turn the occupant of the Chair into their willing slave and tool?</P>

      <P>Let me sound this note of warning.  We are invited to exchange this monument of long tradition contained between the covers of Erskine May, but now no longer the property of one Parliament, now the foundation of the freedom of Parliaments all over the democratic world, for what the Taoiseach chooses to describe as a few simple rules that will define the privileges of this House.  Where, in civilised society, is there a free system of government comprised in a few simple rules? The Decalogue was given to Moses upon a tablet and there is an infallible authority to interpret it and apply it as circumstances change.  Are we to have provided for the convenience of this House a Decalogue in the Taoiseach's writing which he will interpret and apply? Here, again, an attempt is made to turn aside from the fundamental that is involved.  The fundamental here involved is that the Ceann Comhairle was, in the technical sense, libelled by a Deputy of this House at a public meeting.  That was a gross breach of privilege at the time the speech was made.  There need have been no debate in this House, there need have been no motion and no amendment if the Minister for Local Government had been a man and not a vain and silly person for, when he realised the nature of what he had said and done, he would have risen in his place and expressed his regret, possibly not to Deputy Frank Fahy, if he did not want to apologise to him, but to the Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>I am talking of procedure and privilege.  That is to the Standing Orders what the common law is to statute law.  Procedure and privilege have grown up in this House as common law has grown up in the realm.  Standing <Col N="1727" /> Orders have been written down, as the Statute Book has been compiled, by this sovereign Parliament to which we all belong.  In no tribunal has it ever been held that the sanctity of one is greater than the sanctity of the other, though it is universally admitted that, where the statute law specifically overrules the common law, the statute prevails. Where the Standing Orders specifically reject Erskine May and the long tradition of Parliament, the Standing Orders prevail, but there never has been a Standing Order which stated that a member of this House can go down to a céilidhe of a Fianna Fáil club and there declare that the occupant of the Chair, put in by the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; and by all Parties on the last occasion on which he was elected to the office &mdash; was a partial person, incapable of maintaining, or unwilling to maintain, order and decency in the proceedings of this House.</P>
      <P>I shall oppose the third paragraph of the amendment because the third paragraph envisages a new ruling made by the Ceann Comhairle on the 29th April. No such new ruling was made.  On yesterday, the Ceann Comhairle, by implication, ruled that a breach of privilege had been committed.  That was not a new ruling.  It was a reference by the Ceann Comhairle to the paragraph which I have read out from Erskine May.  It is a well-established practice and privilege of this and every other Parliament that members, no matter on which side of the House they sit, shall not libel or slander the Ceann Comhairle, the Speaker or the President of the House of Representatives, or whatever the presiding officer may be called in the legislature over which he presides.</P>

If Parliament ceases to command the confidence of our people, individual liberty in this country will perish for us all.</P>
      <P>I want to sound this note of warning. Do not imagine for a moment that the Party opposite can emasculate Parliament and, having destroyed its real independence, continue to have it function and deceive the people into the belief that they are living under free institutions, when they are not. Most Deputies on this side of the House will play their part in the majority or the minority, wherever the people may place them in a free Parliament, but I for one&mdash;and I believe there are others&mdash;will refuse to take any part in a Parliament which has been reduced to the position of a mere tool of the Executive.  We won liberty and independence in this country and I think our people mean to hold it. Do not ever create a situation in which those who grudged us that estimable gift, and prophesied our undoing when it was ours to use it, should be justified. They ought not to be.  We can operate Parliamentary institutions as well and better than any country in the world. Do not create a situation in which, before the world, they break down.  We have passed through stormy, difficult times, far more difficult than those through which we are passing now. There have been men in the Government Benches of this Parliament whose patience has been more bitterly tried than that of any occupants of those benches now, but they carried on Parliament. They carried on Parliament in the face of wicked slander and abuse and carried on Parliament when they were charged with selling their country and promoting a body&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Very well, Sir.  I am asking the House to carry on Parliament, and the only basis on which it can be carried on is that the occupant of the Chair shall be independent and delivered from the threat of intimidation by any Deputy.  The only means <Col N="1730" /> by which that immunity can be maintained and guaranteed is that the Leader of this House will at all times show himself ready, no matter whence the contempt arises, to do his part in moving the suspension or punishment of the Deputy, once he has been named by the Chair.  Given that he will do that, I think every Deputy will do his part.  It is his to make or mar.  If he will do his part, the rest of us will do ours, but if he betrays the authority of the Ceann Comhairle, then he does so in the knowledge that he is betraying Parliament, and the man who destroys Parliamentary government in this country will yet be known as the man whose name is more cursed in the hearts of our people than that of Oliver Cromwell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have witnessed so many exhibitions of what I can only describe as oratorical craziness by the Minister for Local Government that almost anything the Minister said would not surprise me.  I have noticed that I have occupied a rather prominent place in these campaigns of vilification and abuse with which the Minister regales himself from time to time, but I confess that, on reading the Press on Monday morning, I was rather astonished that the Minister's rantings went further than usual and that he saw fit at a céililhe or supper on Saturday night somewhere in the City of Dublin to cast a grave reflection on the competence and the dignity of the Chair. That, even from the Minister for Local Government, seemed to be striking a new low-water mark in political abuse.</P>
      <P>It seems to me, Sir, nothing short of scandal that a Minister of the State should be so lacking in courtesy and decorum as to make such an unwarranted attack on the competence and impartiality of the Chair, which is appreciated in all parts of this House. But it is worse when the Minister associates that attack on the Chair with the coarse and Billingsgate type of language of which the Minister is such a discreditable exponent, both inside and outside this House.</P>

One knows that is a kind of political disease from which the Minister suffers and, apparently, a type of burlesque of which he cannot be cured; and I am satisfied to pass over that.  But I am concerned about your position, not as an individual but as an officer of this House.  The present occupant of the Chair occupies the highest office which the House can bestow upon him.  In this House he is the custodian of the rights and dignities of the House and of each and every member of the House and it seems to me that the maintenance of that dignity and those liberties which the members of the House possess demands that the Minister for Local Government should be compelled, in all honour and decency, to apologise for the coarse and disorderly references which he made to the Chair when he was making whoopee last Saturday night.</P>

      <P>My complaint about this motion is that it does not go nearly far enough.  I think the Minister's references to the Chair raise other issues of very vital importance to the House.  The Minister has been the centre on many occasions of most disedifying scenes arising out of an uncontrollable desire on his part to get into states of hysteria which take the form of blind and reckless abuse of everyone who attempts to doubt the wisdom or accuracy of what the Minister says. I say quite frankly that the Minister's offence in this matter is not at all met either by the motion in the terms moved by Deputy Mulcahy or in the amendment proposed by the Taoiseach. I think that something more drastic is called for, and that the Taoiseach ought in all wisdom, and in the interests of public decency, try to get rid of the Minister for Local Government from <Col N="1732" /> the present Cabinet.  The Cabinet will be richer if he leaves, the House will be quieter if he leaves, and public life in this country will be all the cleaner if the Minister leaves.  Recently, we had the example of his Parliamentary Secretary being sent into the political wilderness festooned with cheques&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>You were not thinking about order last Saturday.  I think if the nation can stand that racket it can steel itself into sending the Minister into the same political wilderness with some stipend to maintain him and to assist him in getting tuition in good manners if, in fact, anybody will undertake the task of imparting good manners to him.  I have sympathy in this matter that a gentleman of the feelings of the occupant of the Chair should be selected for the coarse strictures which have been passed on him by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
      <P>I approach this whole problem, however, from a different aspect to the approach made by Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Dillon.  I think that there are some problems in this world that are not capable of solution, and I think that the problem confronting this House to-day is one that is not capable of solution so long as the present Minister for Local Government is a member of the House.  I do not think votes of censure on the present Minister for Local Government will change his attitude in the slightest or affect the slightest improvement in his manners or his respect for order, his respect for dignity or his respect for the decorum of the House.  I do not think rebukes by the Taoiseach have the slightest effect on the Minister for Local Government.  I do not think the fact that he is known as an abusive public representative throughout the country makes the slightest impression on the Minister for Local Government. He will run, I think, his rough rude course to the end of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For myself, as I have said, I have often been the subject of abuse and vilification by the present Minister for Local Government, and I probably <Col N="1733" /> will occupy a prominent place in his next litany of abuse whenever he cares to go to a céilidhe and make whoopee on a Saturday night.  I do not mind that in the slightest.  I regard that particular kind of criticism by the Minister for Local Government, from one with his tortuous mind, as a recommendation of a reasonable standard of rectitude.  So far as I am concerned, I do not mind in the slightest what the Minister for Local Government says about me.  It does not mean a thraneen to me because my views of that gentleman, the Minister for Local Government, are well known.</P>

I am not worried in the least about the remarks he made about me last Saturday night.

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy rather unexpectedly began this debate on a high level of righteousness but inevitably it did not take long to get it down to the low level of vituperation to which Deputy Norton has brought it. I am beginning to doubt if it is possible to have any matter of public interest discussed here in an impersonal way. There are certain Deputies on the benches opposite who seem to regard it as politically cute to turn every issue into one of personal criticism or personal abuse of the kind which we have just heard from Deputy Norton.</P>

      <P>We have had, however, raised in this discussion matters of importance which it is necessary to settle.  Of the many foolish propositions which have come, from time to time, from Deputy Dillon, I do not think that we have ever had any one that was so completely ridiculous as his suggestion that the obligations and privileges of members in this House are to be found defined in some privately produced work of reference and not in the rules of the House, adopted by resolution.  Let me say, for my part, that I do not regard myself as bound by any rules in regard to my conduct in the Dáil or outside it, except those made by this House as interpreted and applied by the Chair.  I do not think there is any other member of the House bound by any other rules than those.  I cannot understand the mentality of a Deputy elected to this House who considers that these rules are to be applied subject to some principles defined by a student of the rules and Standing Orders of other Parliaments.</P>
      <P>This is a sovereign Assembly, in charge of its own business, with ample power to define its procedure and protect its members.  I think that Deputy Mulcahy's contention was equally foolish, because I interpreted his observations as meaning that the rules made by the House are themselves of little consequence, that it is the interpretation of the rules by the Chair that matters.  The Chair is not, and so far as I know has never claimed to be, the sole authority on the privileges and conduct of members.  If the Chair at any time makes a ruling or interprets an existing Standing Order of the House in a manner of which the House does not approve, we are entitled to change the Standing Order, or to make a new Order governing that matter if we think it desirable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision in the Standing Orders which makes the Chair the sole judge of order in the House.  Whenever a matter of procedure arises which is not covered by an existing Standing Order, the ruling of the Chair upon that point is accepted unless and until a new Order is made governing that matter.  It is a fact, whether Deputies like it or not, that there has been no rule of this House, no resolution of the House, no ruling of the Chair, on the subject of criticism outside this House of the conduct of the Chair by a member or by any other person.  I think there should be such a rule.  The fact is, however, that there was no such rule and consequently there can be no question here of a breach of the rule.  We will define for ourselves what our rules are to be, what our procedure is to be, what the privileges and rights and obligations of our members are to be.  We think that the time has come when all that question of privileges and obligations should be considered anew.  We brought a proposition to that effect here and we got from the Deputies opposite, not merely a debate which touched a new low level in personal abuse, but a refusal on their part to co-operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy Mulcahy knows quite well that his motion is groundless, that there is no rule of the House or ruling of the Chair which has been broken, because he made it quite clear that he was not appealing to rules.  He was appealing, he said, to our self-respect, to our sense of decency and fair play. I am very glad to have Deputies opposite appealing to our self-respect and to our sense of decency and fair play.  It is a welcome reformation on the part of Deputy Mulcahy.  I hope that his appeal to us to conduct ourselves here with a sense of decency and fair play, and the endorsement of that appeal by Deputy Dillon, indicate an intention on their part so to behave themselves in future.  But it is not so <Col N="1736" /> long since we had an illustration of Deputy Mulcahy's conception of decency and fair play.</P>

      <P>I am quoting Deputy Mulcahy&mdash;column 1339 of the Debates for last Thursday:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any Chief Justice, even if he had little respect for his office when it was a question of being ordered by his Party to submit to their wishes in the matter, would realise that here was a case which, with the enormity of the work that had to be done to meet it, showed that it was a case that should be left and should be decided by the courts.  In this matter the Chief Justice&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(In parentheses, may I say he is our chief judicial officer and a most important institution of the State).</P>
      <P>&mdash;&ldquo;is simply submitting himself as a tool to the ruling Party that put him into power.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I think I am entitled to claim the right to speak to the amendment. So far as Deputy Mulcahy's motion is concerned, I do not know whether it was some conception of political advantage or just sheer audacity which prompted the members of the Party opposite to submit a motion behind which they could pretend to stand as the defenders of the authority of the Chair.  If the authority of the Chair has been reduced in this Dáil, they and their would-be associate, Deputy Dillon, have done more to that end than any other group in this House.  Everybody in the House knows that to be true.  They can only hope to deceive people outside the House who have little knowledge of what takes place here.  In so far as there was criticism of the conduct of the Chair outside the House by the Minister for Local Government, there was no rule against it and it is, consequently, impossible for the Dáil to decide that in voicing that criticism a rule was broken.  There never was until yesterday a ruling of the Chair on that matter, or any indication to members of the Dáil as to what their conduct should be in that relation.</P>
      <P>An indication has been given by the Chair now and we are not merely willing but very anxious that that indication should be accepted by the Dáil in a formal and definite manner and that is why the amendment to this motion which the Taoiseach has moved concludes by an indication of the willingness of the Dáil to accept the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle and to decide that henceforth adverse criticism of the conduct of the Chair made outside this House should be a breach of privilege. We know that criticism of the conduct of the Chair within the House is a breach of privilege.  We do not get criticism expressed in so many words, but we see it in the attitude of Deputy Morrissey, Deputy Dillon, and a few other members opposite.  I think this debate will serve one good purpose if these Deputies will make a mental resolve to conduct themselves in future in this House with a sense of decency and fair play and with respect for the rulings of the Chair. It will be a very welcome change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1748" /> I think there are other matters in respect to which the existing rules and precedents of the House are inadequately defined.  Might I remind Deputies opposite that their co-operation is desirable, if not necessary, if we are to make good that deficiency? Might I remind them, however, that they refused to co-operate in making good that deficiency, refused to associate themselves with other Parties in the House in an attempt to define in a precise and clear way what the obligations and privileges are? Why? Because they know that any definition of the obligations of members of the House would limit their power to slander individuals in the House under the cover of existing privileges. It is a fact that the privilege of members of the Dáil has been abused by these Deputies, particularly by the two Deputies I have mentioned, to attack individuals who are not here to answer for themselves and who could not reply in a corresponding manner outside this House without taking risks which these Deputies do not take, risks against which they are protected by the absolute privilege accorded to them.  I say that these Deputies have abused the privileges of the House and that that persistent abuse of the privileges of the House, together with our experience of the inadequacy of the existing rules, makes it very desirable, as the amendment asks, that those obligations and those principles should be more adequately defined and that appropriate action should be taken to that end without delay.</P>
    <P>Do Deputies opposite agree to that? Of course they do not.  They do not want the obligations and privileges of members more adequately defined. The vaguer they are the freer they are. They have no sense of responsibility in this matter.  They are moving the motion solely for the purpose of getting some little political advantage out of this incident.  I may state, from my knowledge of public opinion in this country, that it never was more grossly outraged and annoyed than it was last week by the slanderous and scandalous attacks which they made here upon a high officer of this State who could not reply to them.  I do not mind any man <Col N="1749" /> being attacked to his face when he can reply with equal freedom if he wants to do so, but to attack, under cover of privilege of this House, men who could not reply here is not my conception of decency and fair play.  I think that those who did it have exceeded the limits of audacity, even in referring to decency and fair play here this evening.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the amendment which the Taoiseach has moved is complete and logical.  We think there should be adequate definition of the obligations and privileges of members and that that definition of the obligations and privileges of members should be undertaken without delay, and, if possible, by agreement with all Parties.  We put as a fact before the House that there has been no rule and no ruling concerning criticism of the Chair outside the House, and because there was no rule and no ruling, there could have been no breach, and we ask the House to accept on that issue the ruling of the Chair made yesterday and to make it binding henceforth so that members can have no doubt as to what their obligations are in that regard.</P>
    <P>That is a constructive approach to the issue that this House is deciding. But Deputies opposite do not want a constructive approach.  They are concerned only with making a personal attack on an individual.  That has been their political form at all times.  They have seen their Party shrink to its present dimensions, and they have not realised even yet that it is this campaign of personal abuse, which seems to be their only political stock in trade, that is the cause of all their political misfortunes, and that they will never recover from their present insignificant position in Irish political life until they discard that type of campaign and until they learn some elementary principles of decency upon which to base their political activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think every Deputy in the House deplores the speech that the Minister for Local Government made last Saturday night.  He made a premeditated and deliberate attack on the Chair.  A man who has been in public life as long as the Minister for Local Government can scarcely be <Col N="1750" /> excused on the ground that that statement was a slip of the tongue.  If it were a newly-elected Deputy or a young man thrown suddenly into public life, it is quite understandable that he would easily make a slip or would not understand the rules of debate.  But in the case of the Minister for Local Government, he could not be excused on such grounds.  As a matter of fact, it is notable that no new Deputy has made such a blunder; no inexperienced Deputy has made such a grievous blunder as the Minister for Local Government made.  He deliberately undermined this House when he attacked the Chair in the manner in which he has attacked it.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste's argument, so far as I can gather, is that simply because members of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Mulcahy and some other members and Deputy Dillon, made certain attacks on the Chief Justice, the Minister for Local Government was perfectly justified in knocking the legs, so to speak, from under the dignity of the Chair.  Was not that the Tánaiste's argument?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>You admit they have made the attacks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared now to deal with that aspect of the matter. The Tánaiste says they have attacked the Chief Justice, and because they have done so, the Minister for Local Government was perfectly justified in attacking the Chair.  That is the Tánaiste's viewpoint in a nutshell.  The Taoiseach is going to throw a protective mantle over the blackguardly attack made on the Chair by the Minister and the Tánaiste has appealed to this side of the House for decency. Put things right in your own house first.  We expect a lead in the matter of decency from that side of the House. You are the Government.  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste occupy responsible positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think when Deputy Mulcahy raised this matter yesterday, and even before he had time to raise it&mdash;when the Minister for Local Government had read the report of his own speech and realised the blunder he had committed &mdash;it was then his duty to stand up and <Col N="1751" /> act a gentleman's&mdash;or at least a man's &mdash;part and apologise to the Chair.  He should have done so before any member of the Opposition or any member of the Government Party could have a chance of bringing the matter to the notice of the House, and demanded an apology from him.</P>
    <P>The argument submitted by the Taoiseach is that because no rule has been established, no breach has been committed.  I will give my view of the matter.  Any breach of discipline in this House pales into insignificance when compared with the breach that the Minister has committed for this reason, that any breach committed will be committed when the House is in session and when there is an occupant in the Chair who will get the full backing of the House to enforce his authority.  When the Minister for Local Government was in the Engineers' Hall and when he made this shocking statement, he knew he was quite safe, that nobody could call him to order; he knew he was in the bosom of his Fianna Fáil friends and that he had perfect immunity in making that statement.  It is only right and proper, no matter how bitter the pill may be for the Government, that the Minister should be brought to the bar of justice in this House for the breach he has committed.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach comes along with an amendment which simply means that we must overlook what the Minister for Local Government said because there was no previous rule.  If the Minister had any glimmer of decency in him he would not have made that attack on the Chair.  One of the first things any decent person recognises is that a man must not be attacked when he is not present to defend himself.  That is an elementary rule of decency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach demands in his amendment that rules should be set down governing the conduct of members inside and outside the House.  I think if the Chair had demanded an apology yesterday, when this matter was brought to the attention <Col N="1752" /> of the House, and if that apology were given by the Minister for Local Government, the precedent thus established would be better than any rule or any agreement laid down by the House.  That is all that was demanded. On one occasion, a little over 12 months ago, I made, in the course of a heated argument, a certain slip of the tongue.  I did not realise at the time the full implications of my words. It was a statement against the Minister for Local Government.  When the Ceann Comhairle brought it to my attention, I had the courage of my convictions, and I offered my apology to the Minister, through the Chair, for what I had said.  I would do the same thing again if I committed a breach, deliberately or otherwise, or even if it was a slip of the tongue in a heated debate.  It is a man's duty to apologise; it is only a coward who does not.  I hold that the Minister, in not having the manliness to stand up and apologise for his blunder, is guilty&mdash; and I accuse him deliberately of it&mdash;of cowardice in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get away from all this frothy abuse to which we were treated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That line was taken deliberately by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is the line which the Taoiseach sought to take when introducing the amendment.  It is not a new line.  Those of us who have been in this House for years are quite conversant with the technique over there.  When they are embarrassed, when they are in the wrong, or in a hole, they will talk about anything except the net point before the House.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce was responsible for the remarkable performance of speaking for 25 minutes without once referring to the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are we supposed to be discussing? We are supposed to be discussing a dirty attack made on the Chair by a Minister of this House, and all the excuses which are sought to be made about rules and privileges and so on, either by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Industry and Commerce or anybody else, cannot get away from <Col N="1753" /> that.  I want Deputies to apply this test.  I want them to answer this at least honestly.  If the three references made by the Minister for Local Government on last Saturday night to the Chair had been made by myself, by Deputy Dillon, by Deputy Commons, by Deputy Cafferky or Deputy Flanagan, does anybody doubt for one moment that before Questions were taken yesterday, there would be a motion by the Taoiseach himself demanding the suspension of myself or any other Deputy who might be guilty of the conduct of which the Minister was guilty, until such time as that Deputy made a suitable apology? Is there one member of this House on the Fianna Fáil side or on any other side of the House, or one person in the country who believes that that would not have happened? Of course, it would have happened and the Taoiseach would be acting properly and rightly.</P>
    <P>No rules! Look, there is one even though it is not reduced to writing. The Minister for Industry and Commerce talked a lot about decency and fair play and claimed there was a complete absence of it on this side and a monopoly of it on the other side.  This matter would never have arisen if the man who made this contemptible attack on the Chair on Saturday night was guided by any rules, written or unwritten, by any sense of decency or fair play.  The statement would not have been written, much less uttered.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce waxes eloquent here about attacks that are made on people who are not in a position to reply.  The Minister for Local Government took great care that he attacked a person or an institution which was not in a position to reply in a place where it could not be dealt with immediately.  Fair play and decency! The Minister for Industry and Commerce has been talking for 25 minutes about members of Opposition Parties and particularly of the main Opposition Party, about their want of decency, and he made the allegation that their contributions to this House for years have consisted of nothing but personal abuse.  I wish he had given as much of his own speech <Col N="1754" /> to the motion as he gave to personal abuse.  He talked about the Chair and the disregard of the rulings of the Chair by people on this side of the House but was, in effect, doing what the Taoiseach was prevented from doing and making under cover of that a veiled attack on the Chair, adding to the charge spoken and written by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have been sitting in this House for some years past, know that last Saturday night was not the beginning of this.  Have we not watched the Minister for Local Government day after day trying to intimidate the Chair in this House? Have not every one of you seen it? Have you not heard him growling there, whispering criticism at the Chair? Last Saturday night was merely the cowardly culmination of it.  He said at a Fianna Fáil cumann what he had not the courage to get up and say here where he knew it could be dealt with. Why was the attack made on the Chair and why is it supported by the Government? Because the Chair has refused to be the willing tool for the Party in office and because the occupants of the Chair have refused to answer the whistle, the beck and call of the Minister for Local Government or any other Minister.  That is the reason they are attacked.</P>

Whether he says it is true or untrue, it is true and the mere fact of the Taoiseach saying that it is not true does not take away from the truth of it.  I have here watched the Minister for Local Government, times beyond number, trying to intimidate the Chair into muzzling the people on this side of the House and into holding with him on every point of view.  We saw to-day an exhibition of respect for the Chair by the man who was talking about respect for the Chair&mdash;the Minister for Industry and Commerce. How did he show his respect? By insisting on delivering a speech along lines which the Ceann Comhairle had prevented the Taoiseach from following and deliberately flaunting a ruling to which he had listened, as he was sitting in his place when the Ceann Comhairle gave it.</P>

      <P>I shall call the Deputy a courageous man who has never done violence to his conscience, either inside or outside Dáil Éireann. I want to get back to the real issue. The issue before this House is a vote of censure on the Minister for Local Government and on no other member of this House.  To the extent that the <Col N="1756" /> Government or the majority of this House refuse to consent to that motion, they are turning the motion into a vote of censure on occupants of the Chair. The only difference is that, like the Minister for Local Government, they have not the courage to come in and do it openly and straightforwardly with a motion into which we can get our teeth.  The Taoiseach has put down an amendment&mdash;what is called an amendment by that price of Parliamentary practice and procedure, the Taoiseach, who scorns May when quoted by Deputy Dillon but looks upon him with the same reverence as that with which he looks on the Bible when quoted by himself.  We are trounced by the Taoiseach and by the Minister for Industry and Commerce because we do not agree to what? To this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Dáil is of opinion that it is desirable that the obligations and privileges of members should be more adequately defined, and that appropriate action to that end should be taken without delay.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The House, of course, has already agreed to that, but the Minister for Local Government was much more open-mouthed on Saturday night.  He told us it was a motion to limit members of this House, and to limit us in what? To limit us in exposing the rackets which are going on and which are notorious by a motion which was introduced by the Taoiseach only when some of the rackets and the racketeers were exposed.  Is that not true?</P>

      <P>I will not be allowed to finish even a sentence.

Surely that is a legitimate point to make? I know, of course, that it is hurting them and I know the reason they squeal.  You can always know when you are getting home on the people over there.  It is like pressing a rubber doll&mdash;when you press it, you hear a squeak.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce had the audacity&mdash;like the Minister for Local Government his neck is not the weakest part of him&mdash;to talk about what was said here to and about the Chair and to talk about decency. I am not going to weary the House with examples&mdash;I suppose it would not serve any useful purpose&mdash;but there are Ministers now sitting opposite who stood and sat in these benches, and the only thing I can say about them is that I am sure that now they are ashamed of some of the things they said about the Chair and the occupants of the Chair in 1927.  I am not going to quote them, but I invite anybody interested to read them in the Library.</P>

    <P>Let me again remind the House that the matter before it is not a question of what Deputy Mulcahy said yesterday or yesterday week, what Deputy Dillon said the week before or what anybody else said.  What is before the House is the net point that the Minister <Col N="1759" /> for Local Government on Saturday night made a dirty attack on the Chair, and the net point we have to decide is whether the Minister is going to be censured for that, or whether we are going to have a vote of censure on the Chair itself.  You are not going to get away from it by saying the rule was not there.  There are certain rules which were always there and, I hope, always will be there.</P>

      <P>A good deal of heat has been engendered in this discussion, but I consider the occasion of sufficient importance to call for a very calm and dispassionate examination of the issues involved.  We are faced with a motion in the name of Deputy Mulcahy which has its origin in an incident of last Saturday night, when the Minister for Local Government cast certain aspersions on the control of the House by the Chair.  Deputy Mulcahy, acting in the interests of Deputies, has tabled a motion calling for the censure of the House upon the Minister for his strictures, in the absence of the necessary suitable apology to the Chair.  To that, we have an amendment tabled by the Taoiseach, which, to my mind, is more to be regretted than the attack by the Minister, because one would have thought, having read the exhaustive report in the Press of the Minister's attack, that it was the result of the heat of the moment and that, on calmer reflection and in consultation with his Ministerial colleagues, respect for the House and its institutions would override any personal feelings between Minister and Minister, and that if he did not feel like making the apology himself, he would have been advised by his colleagues that to do the big thing was the right thing, that the preservation of the democratic institutions of the House would be superior to the interests of the Minister and that the obvious course to adopt would be to tender an unqualified apology for the slip made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The presentation of the amendment, however, aggravates the offence very considerably because it substitutes a buffer, and not even an astute buffer, in an effort to save the Minister from the effects of his own action, pledges <Col N="1760" /> the Government and its members to support of that action and makes it a matter of the considered opinion of the Government and its Party that they must defend the Minister's statement. The only justification for the amendment is that, up to that night, there was no known rule which prevented such attacks being made on the Chair, so long as they were made outside the precincts of the House.  Ministers can hold Cabinet office and be so innocent of their responsibilities to the Chair in this House that they make wild and indiscriminate attacks because of the absence of Standing Orders or rules, when we know, as has been said by Deputy Morrissey, that if the youngest member of the House, whether in the Fianna Fáil or any other Party, had been guilty of the same breach or slip, he would get scant mercy and would be dealt with and punished summarily. Personally, I regard the amendment as more serious, from the point of view of the preservation of democratic institutions, than was the Ministerial speech on Saturday night. Anybody who knows the Minister would have said that that was a characteristic statement. We are used to these ebullitions by the Minister from time to time&mdash; sometimes in the heat of the moment and sometimes dispassionately.  I do not know what the circumstances of his statement on Saturday night were&mdash; whether the speech was a prepared one or whether it was made without preparation in celebration of the coming-of-age of the organisation.  Coming-of-age did not mean coming to the use of reason, so far as the Minister was concerned. He availed of that opportunity to strike a fell blow at what I consider the keystone of the democratic institutions of the country.</P>
    <P>We have seen the characteristics of democracy, as laid down in the Constitution, slipping from us from day to day with the connivance of the Government. The discussions of last week were utilised to strike a fell blow at the keystone of those institutions by accusing the Chair of partiality.  The Chair is entitled to respect from every Deputy, irrespective of Party.  If the Minister is to be supported in that attitude and in the making of that <Col N="1761" /> statement, it means that respect for the Chair has gone by the board.  It will not be saved, in my opinion, by the qualifying clause so innocently put in by the Taoiseach&mdash;that up to the 29th April there was no rule to guide us. There was no offence before the 29th April, but there will be an offence after the 29th April.  It was perfectly permissible to attack the Chair of Dáil Éireann on any day since the Dáil was established up to the 29th April but it is an offence to do so since then. Therein lies another very serious question.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, it is not the function of the Chair to defend itself.  That should be the function of this House. Dáil Éireann is the Supreme Assembly and it is for Dáil Éireann to protect its Chair.  I do not think that it is right that the Chair should be asked to make a pronouncement in defence of itself.  According to the ordinary procedure&mdash;this has happened many times during my term here&mdash;if a Deputy offends against the Chair, it is the duty of the Leader of the House to move the suspension of that Deputy. If a reflection be made upon the impartiality of the Chair, it is left to be dealt with by the House.  Now we are told that, when a Minister or a Deputy makes an attack upon the Chair, the Chair must make a pronouncement in its own defence and that pronouncement will be accepted as the rule henceforth.  That raises a definite problem.  There is nothing to prevent the Chair making more and more rulings.  What I argue is that an offence offered to the Chair should be dealt with by this House and should not be altered, mitigated or governed by a subsequent decision by the Chair.</P>
    <P>Any Deputy coming into the House is supposed to make himself conversant with Standing Orders and rules of procedure so that he may comport himself correctly.  A Deputy should know that his responsibility is not confined to the House&mdash;that he must comply with certain rules outside the walls of the House as well.  The speech that was made had serious repercussions, because it undermined respect for the Chair.  If the Minister was entitled to get away with that reflection on the Chair, it would be <Col N="1762" /> difficult to restore confidence, and other Ministers and other Deputies might be so short-sighted on future occasions as to show equal disrespect for the rulings of the Chair.</P>
    <P>A case was mentioned by Deputy Mulcahy of a Minister who made an accusation against the Chair.  I am old enough to remember the incident.  That Minister was big enough to come back and apologise.  He lost nothing in status or prestige by doing so.  He saw that he had made a mistake; he made amends and showed his respect for the institutions of the country.  If Deputy MacEntee would get up and say that he was carried away on the occasion and make the necessary apology, it would meet the position. He was entitled to criticise the Leaders of the chief Opposition and other Opposition Parties.  I have no objection to his criticising Deputy Mulcahy or Deputy Donnellan or Deputy Cogan.  He was perfectly entitled to do that, but he should have had sufficient common sense and sufficient responsibility to draw the line there and not attack the Chair, which is not a person in the accepted sense.  The occupant of the Chair is entitled to respect.  At election times he has not to contest his seat.  The occupant of the Chair enjoys certain immunities. When a Minister attacks the Chair, there is only one way to make good the damage.  I say this not in the interest of any Party but in the interest of this House as a State institution.  The only way to repair the damage is for the Minister to get up, withdraw what he said and express regret for having said it.</P>
    <P>The amendment put forward by the Taoiseach is not a cure.  It is going to lay the foundations of a greater evil than the incident of last Saturday night.  It is not going to remedy the matter in any shape or form.  Certain reactions may flow from it which I do not like to think about.  If the Government puts its weight against the motion, it will place the Chair in an ambiguous position.  The Taoiseach's amendment does not solve the problem. There is only one way back&mdash;the way of any decent man, or any gentleman. I appeal to the Minister for <Col N="1763" /> Local Government to say that he made a mistake, that what he said does not represent his conviction or studied thought, that he does not agree with it, that he considers that this House, as an institution, has been conducted fairly, and that the proceedings have been carried on impartially.  He can undo the damage that was done in a moment and he alone can undo it.  The Taoiseach cannot help.  I ask the Minister for Local Government to make the necessary reparation by standing up and expressing in a few words regret for what he stated and thus restore the confidence of every member in this institution.</P>

      <P>I have found it a matter of extreme difficulty to restrain both my feelings and my language at the utterance which I was obliged to listen to this afternoon by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He made an attack upon certain of the leading members of the Party to which I have the privilege to belong and he coupled with their names the name of Deputy Dillon.  Throughout the whole course of his speech, he never on one occasion that I can recollect made one single reference to the subject matter of the motion or the amendment.  He attacked members of this Party and Deputy Dillon.  That was an obvious political manoeuvre, just as obvious as the fact that the amendment was put down here by the Taoiseach as a piece of Parliamentary tactics and another political manouvre to try to hide from the country the real issue involved in this discussion.  An effort was made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make it clear that certain members of the Fine Gael Party, if not each and every member of that Party, were engaged in some sort of planned attack upon the institutions of this State.  One of the fundamental institutions of the State is the position of Ceann Comhairle.  That institution was created, fashioned and moulded by the first Government and the first Parliament of this State.  The men who sit beside me here on these benches are merely the survivors of those who fell murdered and killed and who died to <Col N="1764" /> create, fashion and mould these institutions and this State and create public respect for them.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to mention it and I have no intention of continuing to do so, but when the Minister for Industry and Commerce makes an attack on my colleagues I am entitled on their behalf to reply. When we are told that and a deliberate effort is made to make it appear throughout the country that this Party and the men who make up this Party are endeavouring to undermine the institutions of the State, then I throw that back in the teeth of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who refers to the fondness of some people on this side of the House for a dirty debate, as being an ebullition on his part and the initiation of a dirty debate in this House.  It is for that reason that I said, when I started the observations I had to make, that I found the greatest difficulty in retaining my self-control during this speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and that I find it even now almost impossible to refrain from saying what I would like to say.  I must emphasise and reiterate and cast back in the teeth of that Minister the foul charge he has endeavoured to make, in order to divert public attention from the real issues, that the men here on these benches are endeavouring to undermine the institutions of this State&mdash;which they have created and built up from the very foundation.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is not going to be let away with that.  He is not going to be let have that brought forward in an effort to divert the attention of the people from the real, vital issues involved in this particular debate and any other problems that confront this Parliament and the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate was brought about by reason of a criticism by a Minister of one of the institutions of the State. What is the reply to that by the Government? Is it a reasoned amendment, calling upon Deputies to recognise the dignity and authority of <Col N="1765" /> the Chair and pledging this Parliament and future Parliaments to uphold the rulings and the authority of the Chair? Is it a censure upon a person in a position of responsibility for something he had said outside this House? In effect, it is; but neither the Prime Minister nor any member of the Government nor of his Party has the courage or the decency to say what is implicit in this amendment.  The amendment really is a vote of censure upon one of their own colleagues, although they have not got the decency or the courage to say so.  That is the real interpretation of the amendment. It was conceived and devised as an effort, a piece of Parliamentary tactics, to get the Government out of a difficulty created by a speech outside the House by one of their own Ministers, but what it really does is to censure that Minister implicitly, though they have not the courage to do so explicitly.</P>
    <P>This amendment says that there is no ruling of the Chair, no precedent laying it down as the rule of the House, that a Deputy is doing something which is called in this amendment &ldquo;a breach of privilege&rdquo; when he criticises a central institution of Dáil Éireann outside the House, and because there is no such ruling we ought to have a ruling, or that we got one yesterday, and having got one yesterday, henceforth anyone who does that is to be guilty of contempt, guilty of a breach of the privilege of the House.  The end of the second paragraph of this amendment says that there has been no rule or resolution of the House prior to yesterday, or ruling of the Ceann Comhairle which declared it to be &ldquo;a breach of privilege for a member to criticise, outside the House, the conduct of the Chair.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Look at the way the phrase following is devised.  For that reason, because there is no ruling of the Chair,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the Dáil does not agree that the speech of the Minister for Local Government can, in the circumstances, be held to constitute such a breach.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Because the speech of the Minister was made at a time when there was no ruling of the Chair that a Deputy could <Col N="1766" /> not criticise the Chair outside the House, in those circumstances, and only in those circumstances, can it not be held to be a breach of the privilege of the House.  Implicit in the very argument contained in that paragraph of the amendment is the suggestion that the Minister's action, if the ruling that the Chair gave yesterday had been given, say, a fortnight ago, would have been a breach of privilege.  The last paragraph goes on then to make it perfectly clear that implicit in the very amendment is a criticism of the Minister's speech, as it says that the Dáil accepts that ruling and decides that, henceforth,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;adverse criticism of the conduct of the Chair, made outside the House, shall be a breach of privilege.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Only for the fact that it was yesterday the precedent was created, the amendment says the Minister's speech was a breach of privilege.  All that saves the Minister from the consequences of the speech he made was the fact that there was no explicit ruling from the Chair.  What he did last Saturday in the Engineers' Hall would to-day be held to be a breach of privilege. That is what the amendment itself says and anybody who does it in the future&mdash;the Minister for Local Government is to get away with it but no one else may get away with it&mdash;will be guilty.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the attention of the House to the fact that there is not a single word in the motion put down in the name of the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy General Mulcahy, about privilege.  The conduct of Deputies is only referred to for its propriety or otherwise as &ldquo;privilege&rdquo;, merely as one particular method of measuring its propriety or impropriety. Privilege is not the sole method by which the propriety or impropriety of a Deputy can be measured.  There is a standard of decency, a standard of conduct, that should be expected from every Deputy, irrespective of precedent or of rulings or of explicit statements of privilege. This motion says that the conduct expected from a Deputy has been departed from in a very serious and very explicit way by a Minister of <Col N="1767" /> the Government and a responsible Minister of this House.  It is not a question of privilege, but a question of a breach of decent conduct such as would be expected from an ordinary back-bencher and even more so from a Minister.  This motion condemns the Minister for Local Government for an action which is not to be measured by whether it is an express breach of privilege or against an express ruling of the Ceann Comhairle or not, but to be measured by the standard of conduct that no Deputy, whether on the Front Bench or on a back bench, on the Government side or on the Opposition side, should be guilty of.</P>
    <P>I say that is the way the House should approach the consideration of this proposal and the amendment.  The amendment will, presumably, be passed by the Government and its supporters, and will, in effect, do what was intended to be done by Deputy Mulcahy's motion&mdash;criticise and censure the Minister for Local Government. At least the people will take it that way when they properly understand the political tactics embodied in the amendment.  The only reasonable and proper interpretation of the amendment is that the Minister for Local Government did on last Saturday what no back-bencher of the House can do to-morrow.  If he did he would be guilty of a breach of the privileges of the House and would be censured for it.  The Minister escapes censure merely because of a technicality. Listening to the speeches which have been made here to-day we now find ourselves in a position that is becoming increasingly constant in this House&mdash; that every single Party, and Independent Deputy, are lining up against the Government, whatever the differences between themselves may be.</P>

      <P>I find it difficult to restrain myself when talking about my colleagues.  The Minister for Local Government has been saved by a technicality. The Government, with all their trained officials, were unable to extract the Minister for Local Government from the position in which he found himself except by saying that by a technicality, a ruling of the Ceann Comhairle yesterday, &ldquo;we are saved; we cannot criticise and cannot censure the Minister for Local Government because there was no ruling&rdquo;.  Nobody can say there was a ruling, and nobody can say that decency is something that you can find in a book, or that proper conduct can be found written up in the precedents in the office of the Ceann Comhairle.  Therefore, the Minister can get away here.</P>
      <P>The Minister made three statements which, I think, were read by the Leader of the Opposition.  The Minister for Local Government said that the assembly of the people, Dáil Éireann:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;was becoming a place where Parliamentary immunity was availed of to license slander and where the coarse tongue of a corner boy could precipitate a brawl with but the weakest of intervention from the Chair.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1769" /> Could there be a more explicit insult to one of the greatest institutions of this country than that made by the Minister? The others were on an equally low level.  I would have regarded the <i>bona fides</i> of the Government with a greater degree of respect if this amendment and the proposals that are contained in it were prefaced by an apology from the Prime Minister on behalf of the Government, and if the censure&mdash;explicit instead of being implicit in the amendment&mdash;were moved on that Minister by the Prime Minister of this Government which is at the moment governing the affairs of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This particularly unfortunate situation arises because of a particularly unfortunate speech made by a member of the Government. Speeches are often made thoughtlessly, recklessly and in heat&mdash;on a tide of emotion.  There is no member of the House of any experience who will not agree on that, but the speech that gave rise to the motion we are discussing had all the appearance of being a carefully prepared document, delivered at a fixture prearranged by day and hour, where the speaker would be unlikely to be interrupted, heckled or roused to heat.  I think it was one of the most discreditable speeches that was ever delivered or printed in the long political history of this country.  Many years ago, at times of high controversy, acute bitterness and great tensity of political strife, the politics of this country was associated with that kind of improper, hysterical pot-boiling type of speech that appeared in the newspapers on a Monday morning.  Throughout the civilised world, during those particular periods, such speeches got the people of the country a bad name and a doubtful reputation with regard of how a neighbour should deal with a neighbour.  We got the reputation of being foul, abusive and slanderous on our platforms, of not knowing how to conduct ourselves with decency in public life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The speeches made during those periods of controversy and tension can be explained by the circumstances of the time, by, perhaps, rowdyism at a <Col N="1770" /> meeting, by the clash of forces and by heckling and interruptions, but the particular speech under discussion was coldly and calmly and deliberately uttered behind closed doors, every precaution being taken to see that there could not be, and would not be, any interruption.  It was a cold-blooded, foul, political attempt by a Minister of State to saw the legs from under the Chair of Dáil Éireann, leaving aside the scandalous, false and slanderous references to other political Parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

On a par with the deliberate foulness that was applied to others are the cold-blooded, untrue and malicious references to the Chair of this Assembly.  And that was the action of a Minister of State, one of the high officers of this Assembly.</P>
      <P>The reputation of a people, nationally and internationally, and the respect due to a people is measured by the amount of respect they attract to themselves, by the amount of respect they themselves pay to their own State, to the institutions of their own State.</P>

      <P>But, whether we include the Chief Justice or not, certainly we cannot exclude the Parliament of the people.  The Ministerial grin is the same grin that propelled the insult on the Chair of our Irish Parliament on Saturday night&mdash;that inane grin and that volcano of abusive gibberish that was hurled at the Chair.  One of the greatest institutions of every country is <Col N="1771" /> its Parliament.  Parliament in every country, through its members, is the delegated assembly of the people.  It is, in fact, in tabloid form the people, the nation, and the respect that is due to any Parliament is the respect that is paid to its officers.  The officers in Parliament in order of precedence are the Chairman, the Leader of the House, the members of the Government, the Leaders, in order, of the various Opposition Parties.</P>
      <P>How do we subscribe to respecting that Parliament of ours? How do we subscribe to inducing others to respect that Parliament of ours? What example do we set the world? What example do we set the vile little slanderers that crawl around this country trying to undermine and sabotage every one of the great institutions of the State? How do even the officers of this Parliament pay service and tribute to the greatness of the institution? A Minister so far forgets himself, so far degrades himself and so far forgets the high office he holds that, when shaking a leg at a Fianna Fáil céilidhe, he utters a vile speech of that nature, a vile speech in which he tells the world that rapidly this Parliament is becoming a Parliament of guttersnipes. A Minister of this Parliament, a Minister of State, stands up on a platform at a Fianna Fáil céilidhe and with all the publicity he can command as a Minister, and a senior Minister, of the Irish Government and as an officer, and a senior officer, of an Irish Parliament, with 22 years of Parliamentary experience behind him, he tells us that this Assembly is becoming a Parliament of guttersnipes and he tells our brothers and our cousins and our sons and daughters away in America, with all that experience behind him, that this Parliament is becoming a Parliament of guttersnipes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">

      <P>That certain gentlemen wanted to make this Parliament a <Col N="1772" /> Parliament of guttersnipes and that they were aided by the weakness and supineness of the Chair.  That is the message an Irish Minister has for the Irish abroad.  That is the message an Irish Minister has for our friends abroad, and that is the weapon he puts into the hands of our enemies abroad &mdash;that foul-mouthed phrases are allowed here, foul-mouthed phrases resulting in fisticuffs between certain Deputies aiming or aspiring to make this a Parliament of guttersnipes, aided and abetted by the Chair&mdash;foulmouthed expressions resulting in scenes degrading to any Parliament&mdash;and that all that is taking place through the weakness or with the connivance of the Chair.  That is the statement of the Minister opposite and that is the statement for which he refuses to apologise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know the amount of respect with which to treat the utterances of the Minister for Local Government. We know that when he stands on his feet he loses his head.  We know that he is not to be measured by ordinary standards when we are talking about responsible utterances.  But the people outside this House do not know it. The references to the Chair may have been serious, they may have been despicable, contemptible, unworthy and un-Irish but, having made those references, 24 hours later, when the scandal of those references must have hit him in the eye when he looked between eggs at breakfast at the paper, when he had ample time for considering the effect of his utterances and the damage done by this statement, without any challenge, he was given an opportunity to apologise.  A man that had given offence to another, unprovoked and without cause, on any occasion, with or without rules, inside or outside Parliament, if there were any decent instincts in the make-up of the individual, having given the offence recklessly or thoughtlessly, would at least be stimulated to apologise.  The Minister was asked to apologise and that would have been the end of it.  But the Minister would not apologise.  He would not apologise for the wrong done to Parliament, for the insults and offence offered to the Chair.  Then the responsibility fell on the shoulders of <Col N="1773" /> the Taoiseach, the Leader of the House, the person who, next to the Ceann Comhairle, is the responsible guardian and custodian of the good name of this Parliament.  What does the Taoiseach do when, apparently, he finds himself powerless to compel or induce his Minister to do the decent thing, the proper thing, the gentlemanly thing, the honourable thing? He shares in the guilt.  He shares in that guilt with the knowledge that he is participating in something unclean and he brings in this amendment that, on the face of it, carries evidence that the Taoiseach was convinced that the utterances made should never have been made.  What in fact does the amendment state? Standing in the name of the Taoiseach, in the name of the Minister's Leader&mdash;what does it state? It states that if any inexperienced back-bencher from this day onwards follows the example of his Minister and so misconducts himself as to attack and criticise the Chair from outside of this House that that inexperienced Deputy will be suspended from the service of the House until he apologises.  That is the Taoiseach's opinion &mdash; that if any Deputy of Dáil Éireann follows the example set the other night by the Minister for Local Government that that Deputy will be punished by the rule that we are called on to make as a result of the Minister's misconduct. Is not that a clear statement to the effect that the Minister's statement should never have been made&mdash;that it was unworthy and unfair? If that statement was unworthy and unfair surely the gentlemanly thing would be to tender an apology.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to an episode which occurred in this House in 1926, before the Minister would condescend to recognise this House as an Irish Parliament, when a Minister of the then Government, which, like the present Government, had an over-all majority, so far forgot himself as to misconduct himself in reference to the Chair.  Was the Parliamentary majority of that time used by the Government to cast the cloak of a Parliamentary majority over the erring Minister? Was the Leader of the Government at that time so weak as <Col N="1774" /> to share in the guilt of his Minister at the expense of the Chair and at the expense of the good name of Parliament? Was that what happened then? What happened was: the Dáil was adjourned by the Leader of the House to give the erring Minister an opportunity to consider the gravity of his error and to come back here into Dáil Éireann and apologise to the Chair. Those were the standards set.  That was the trail that was blazed and made easy and smooth for the successors to follow.  We have new standards being raised now, new standards wherein a Minister can go outside to a céilidhe, make a foul and unworthy attack on the Chair, and then come back and say, and have his Leader say: &ldquo;Because there was no rule against that type of misconduct my Minister was free to misconduct himself&rdquo;.  Is the new headline that is set for Parliament and people that we have only got to conduct ourselves when there is a rule laying it down that we must, that we are free to misconduct ourselves, even to the gravest extent, if there are not written rules defining what our conduct should be and what constitutes misconduct? Is that the new headline that this Parliament is proposing to set, 25 years after it came into being? Are there to be no unwritten rules of decency? Are there to be no unwritten rules of good conduct generally respected?</P>
    <P>Now the predicament that this House is faced with is this: An insult has been offered to the Chair.  There was no rule previously governing the conduct of Deputies when outside this House in relation to the Chair.  No sane person would ever think it would ever be necessary to have such a rule. If I had a rule-making authority sitting here for a year it would never strike that rule-making authority that it would be necessary to have a written rule governing the conduct of Deputies outside this House in relation to the Chair.  It would never strike any Deputy or any group of Deputies that any member of this House would go outside the House, address a public meeting, heap insult and offence on the Chair of Ireland's Parliament and then come frisking back to that Parliament to take his seat as one of the highest <Col N="1775" /> officers in that Parliament and, trotting behind his Leader's heels come in and say: &ldquo;You cannot make me apologise, I will not apologise.  You cannot make me apologise because there is no written rule to that effect, but, nevertheless, we will put down an amendment that will express so clearly our disgust for such behaviour that if any Deputy presumes ever again to follow my example there will be a rule staring him in the face and, by Jove, he will be very well punished.&rdquo;  There is the position&mdash;political malevolence, and a political team spirit that puts politics above State, partisanship above Parliament. There is the position that confronts this Assembly to-night.</P>
    <P>At some point the bells will ring and at the same point the boys will march. Look at the filthy standard they have erected under which to march to-night. Is there anything that is not foul and discreditable in it? The speech was bad; the aftermath of that speech is worse.  What was the alternative? Merely that a Minister or an individual who behaved in a foul manner to a high officer should apologise.  The whole thing arises because an apology has been refused and the Minister is to slink away through a rat hole, because there was no written rule governing such a scandalous type of misconduct. We know there was no written rule, because it was inconceivable to ordinary minds that it would ever be necessary to have a rule to prohibit such misconduct.</P>
    <P>The Minister's action the other night was scandalous; the Minister's action yesterday in refusing to apologise was probably unequalled in the history of Parliaments in its continued disrespect. The Minister has not only attempted to degrade the Chair, but he has degraded by his refusal to apologise, not only the Irish Government of which he is a member, but the Irish people and the Irish race.  An illiterate Somali who misconducted himself with reference to another who deserved better would have enough decency to apologise to the individual who was wronged.  We here, the occupants of an island that used to claim to be an island of saints and scholars, <Col N="1776" /> have much to learn from the aborigines and from the illiterate Somalis with regard to decency of conduct.  But the really degrading thing is that, when an individual misbehaves in that manner, the head of the Government and the Leader of Parliament should subscribe to that shameless piece of truculence, should subscribe to and share in the crime by trying to cover up and to cloak the wrong done and the damage inflicted.</P>
    <P>It is 15 years ago since the present Government took office.  It is 15 years ago since the present Ceann Comhairle was elected to that office by the votes of the Party opposite in opposition to the votes of this Party here.  Those 15 years have been hard, long and trying Parliamentary years.  During those 15 years one House of the Oireachtas was completely destroyed and later resurrected.  A Constitution was torn up and another hammered out.  There were periods of heat and controversy and the most difficult office in any Parliament is the office of Chairman.  During all those years, in face of all those difficulties, the nominee of the Party opposite carried out his duty as Chairman, and the assistant with him, in a way that was gradually but surely and steadily making this little Parliament of ours a bright example to the whole world.  It was attracting the attention and the praise of visitors from all the countries in the world.</P>
    <P>At the end of those 15 years, we have a Minister of an Irish Government saying that Deputies here are endeavouring to make this Parliament an assembly of guttersnipes and that in attempting to do that they were being aided and abetted by the distinguished Deputy and his assistant who occupy the high positions of Ceann Comhairle and Deputy Ceann Comhairle.  In the absence of any word of regret, either from the culprit in question or the culprit's Leader, let it at least be said that members of every other Party in Dáil Éireann express their apology to the Chair that any Deputy should so far forget himself outside the precincts of the House as to hurl the insults at the Chair that were hurled at it by the Minister for Local Government the other night.</P>

The Deputy Dillon of Thursday and Friday and a few other Deputies when the Chair calls them to order try to side-track the Chair and get in by some other door.

      <P>I am very sorry that I am not able to develop that, but I will accept your ruling.  We have been told here time and again that we should accept some standard of decency.  I say that we should at least have a decent standard in this House.  Personal attacks should not be made on people. I heard to-day a Deputy who was defending a certain policy starting off by making a personal attack on the Minister for Local Government.  This Parliament is 25 years in existence and surely we should have got away from all these personalities.  Certain Deputies, when they get an opportunity to indulge in personalities, never fail to do so.  I have heard the pious ejaculations of Deputy Dillon.  He was so pious that I really thought he had gone over to the Church altogether.  We were treated to the usual dramatic art of his.  Deputy Mulcahy, when the Tánaiste started to read quotations from the Deputy's speeches, raised points of order because he was ashamed of some of the language that he used on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to give the Chair any co-operation at all, we should adopt certain standards of decency.  We should not put the Chair in an awkward or invidious position.  That is what has been done here on a number of occasions.  It is up to us to co-operate with the Chair.  These people who condemn the action of the Minister for Local Government are responsible <Col N="1778" /> for that action themselves; they are the originators of it.  Surely, in any Parliament in the world, the conduct that has been carried on by these people could not be accepted as in accordance with ordinary standards of decency.  We have been told that there are certain Standing Orders and Rules governing our procedure.  Erskine May's book was brought in to-day&mdash; his book dealing with Parliamentary procedure in other countries.  Erskine May's book was not brought in last Thursday or Friday; it was forgotten then.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;To delete all words after the word `That' and substitute the following&mdash;</P>
      <P>`the Dáil is of opinion that it is desirable that the obligations and privileges of members should be more adequately defined, and that appropriate action to that end should be taken without delay;' &rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is very necessary, in view of the history of this House, especially during the past week or fortnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo; `that in view of the fact that, prior to the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle on 29th instant, there has been no rule or resolution of the House or ruling of the Ceann Comhairle which declared it to be a breach of privilege for a member to criticise, outside the House, the conduct of the Chair, the <Col N="1779" /> Dáil does not agree that the speech of the Minister for Local Government can, in the circumstances, be held to constitute such a breach;' &rdquo;</P>

      <P>Judging by the speeches delivered, it would seem that on all sides of the House Deputies are anxious to retain the dignity of the Chair and the House.  I expected that some members on the Government Benches would offer an explanation or give some expression of regret because of the necessity for this motion.  I suggest the Dáil will cease to hold the respect of the people of Ireland and will only be respected in accordance with the amount of respect that Deputies themselves show to the House.  The words the Minister for Local Government is reported to have <Col N="1780" /> said, when he accused the occupant of the Chair of weakness, are actually proof that the Chair has acted impartially towards all Parties in the House and has given consideration and fair play to each Deputy..</P>
      <P>It was very unfair of him to make such a charge against the Chair.  He charged the occupant of the Chair with weakness.  That remark would not be permitted under the rules of the House and, if it is not permitted inside the House, it should not be permitted outside.  We would not be allowed here to charge the occupant of the Chair with weakness and without acting in a strictly impartial way.  If we cannot do that here, in order to retain the dignity of the House we should not be allowed to express it outside.</P>
      <P>I can well appreciate the feelings of men on the opposite side when statements are made against them.  Sometimes I regret the speeches that are made by Deputies; in my opinion, uncharitable remarks have been made against individuals and that is to be deplored. But I would expect from members of the Government an example, not alone in the House but outside it.  If men have mistaken views and make charges that may not be quite true, Ministers should endeavour to educate them so as to make them realise that they had the wrong viewpoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During my period as a Deputy for almost 25 years&mdash;and in all that time I did not take up much of the time of the House&mdash;I have had no reason to complain of the occupant of the Chair.  I have been under the present Chairman for the past 15 years and I think I can speak for other members of the Dáil when I say that we received nothing but fair play and strict impartiality from him.  I think other members of the Dáil will agree that the present Ceann Comhairle, since he was first elected, has displayed great dignity in the Chair, has used common sense in his decisions, and has given every consideration to members of the House who have sought his protection. That is what is required of the Chair, and I think the present occupant is deserving of the highest praise from all sides of the House for <Col N="1781" /> the manner in which he has conducted our proceedings.</P>
    <P>I would have expected the Minister for Local Government, knowing that, to tell us that he regrets as much as we do the statements that were made, that he deplores those statements and that probably the meaning that is taken from them was not intended.  I would have expected that when attention was drawn to it, he would have been the first to get up to express regret for the statements and so avoid obliging members of the House to take action which they believe is necessary in the interests of the House.  I think it is not too late yet to get some expression of regret from the Government side.  We could then get together to help to maintain the institutions of this State, recognising that outside this House there are certain foreign influences working to try to get people's minds away from constitutional means.  If we give them the slightest excuse, by attacking this House or the individuals who constitute it, I think we are doing work for which we were not elected.  We were elected by our constituents to serve their interests in a constitutional way.  I do not think any Deputy was elected to pour personal abuse or slander, under the protection of the licence afforded by this House, on any individual.</P>
    <P>For the 25 years which I have been a member of this House, although I do not address the House very often, I tried to refrain from doing things which I would not be allowed to do on any of the public bodies with which I have been associated.  I say all credit to these public bodies.  I have been a member of them since 1917, since my young days when Sinn Féin and Labour were first organised in strength.  The instructions we received at that time were to instil respect in the people for the public representatives they had elected.  I have tried to carry out these instructions always, and I am often surprised at some of the speeches made in this House, even though the Ceann Comhairle does try to maintain order.  These speeches could not be made at public bodies.  As I say, I regret the speech which the Minister has made, and I see in the <Col N="1782" /> amendment no excuse at all for his conduct.  The kernel of the amendment is contained in the last few lines. If it was not correct to make that speech to-day, it was not correct last week.  I suggest that, before further attempts are made at propaganda outside arising out of the attack on the Chair, Deputies should not try to justify the action of the Minister for Local Government.  No matter what attacks may have been made on other institutions, they did not give the Minister any justification for criticising the Chair at a political meeting.  I appeal to the Minister to be generous and to express his regret, not alone to this House but to the Chair, the occupant of which, we recognise, has acted in a most fair and impartial manner towards all sections of the House on all occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It came as a surprise to me here to-night to hear it laid down by Deputy Dillon that our Rules of Procedure incorporated the Rules of Procedure of the British House of Commons. I wonder if we follow that line of thought, where we are going to end? If the grand vizier of the King of Siam prohibits any reference to the king's dress, are we to be prohibited here from referring to the colour of the gown of the Ceann Comhairle? It came as a complete surprise to me, to hear that we had embodied the Rules of the British House of Commons in the Rules of this House.  I think that possibly the Shakespearean theatre has lost a great actor in Deputy Dillon, a great Othello, but his jealousy on this occasion was not so much for the alleged disrespect to the Chair of this House but seemed to be based on the fact that he discovered that we here were not prepared to accept his contention that we had incorporated in the Rules of this House, the procedure, lock, stock and barrel, of the British House of Parliament.  Deputy Dillon argued at length that there was a definite rule laid down in the British House of Commons that there should be no criticism of the Chair outside the boundaries of that House, and because it was laid down there, Deputy <Col N="1783" /> Dillon, with his usual mentality, proceeded to put the proposition that naturally we had to accept it here.  His chief worry seemed to be that it was even questioned in this House that any Rule of the British Parliament was not automatically taken over here.</P>
      <P>It is true that we are a young Parliament, but even though we are a young Parliament, we have gone our own way in several different aspects of procedure and of privilege.  Why it should be contended by any member elected by the people of this country that we should swallow, lock, stock and barrel, the procedure of an outside Parliament, is completely beyond me.  Once we accept that principle, there is no reason why another Deputy should not find himself to-morrow morning guilty perhaps of having offended against some Rule of the French Parliament, the Spanish Parliament, or the Parliament of the United States, without ever knowing that he was infringing a Rule of this House.</P>
      <P>It is quite logical and obvious to state that, in order to break a rule, the rule must be there.  I have had my differences with the Ceann Comhairle in this House, and I understood I was free to criticise the Ceann Comhairle in this House or outside it.  I did not know there was any rule against that. It has now transpired, and is evidently admitted by every Party, that there was no rule prohibiting any Deputy from expressing his opinion of the ruling of the Chair outside the House. The Ceann Comhairle, in his judgment and in his discretion, has now decided that cannot be done, but at the time the speech was made by the Minister for Local Government, there was no such rule incorporated in the Rules of the House.  There was no such judgment from the Chair or from the predecessors of the present Ceann Comhairle.  Presumably, the Minister thought, as many more people thought, that he was free to voice his opinion of the Chair outside the House.  Possibly an easier method could be got of dealing with this matter, but it was thought well by the leader of the Opposition to put down this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept the motion as honest, <Col N="1784" /> and I do not accept all the speeches I have heard here to-day in reference to the protection of the rights of Deputies by the Chair, as being genuine, or that this motion was tabled with the idea of furtherance of the protection of Deputies or the dignity of the House. For instance, some of the Deputies who spoke on this matter have been very conspicuous by their disrespect to the rulings of the Chair and their disregard for them.  I was listening to Deputy Blowick here this evening when he attacked the Minister for Local Government and shed many crocodile tears about the reduction in the status of this House and of the Chair by the Minister's speech of a few nights ago. No Party in this House has done more to disregard the rulings of the Chair than the Party led by the Deputy.  I think it is the only Party in this House who consistently and continually refuse to obey the rulings of the Chair, so much so that three members of the Party have had to be forcibly removed from the House.</P>

If we are to have order and if we are to abide by the Rules of Procedure as laid down by the House, co-operation by every element and every Deputy in the House is necessary, <Col N="1787" /> and certainly some definite rule should be laid down to prevent people being attacked in the House and to prevent members of the House from sheltering under the cloak of absolute privilege which they enjoy while speaking here while attacking people outside.</P>

      <P>Before <Col N="1788" /> Deputy Mulcahy raised the point of order, I was about to inform Deputy Moran that he must take this amendment as a whole.  He cannot discuss the first paragraph which is merely a preamble leading up to the point dealing with the criticism outside this House of the conduct of the Chair. That is the vital point in the amendment, as it is in the motion.  The Deputy is confined to that.  It is not a matter of general rules of conduct for members inside the House, except in so far as it bears on the particular criticism outside of the Chair.</P>

      <P>I listened to Deputy Dillon giving separate reasons in respect of each of these three matters as to why he proposed to vote against them.  That was allowed by the Ceann Comhairle, and I therefore understood that I was entitled to take the three sections of the amendment in turn and give my reasons for their acceptance by the House.  If the Chair rules against me on that point, I can go no further, but I submit that the House is entitled to hear the reasons why certain obligations should be imposed on members of the House, and I do not see how I or any other Deputy can otherwise urge the reasons why that portion of the amendment should be accepted.  When it has already been allowed, I submit that I am entitled to state my reasons why these obligations should be imposed and to give the facts in respect of some of these attacks by members of the House on people outside.  May I take it that I am entitled to go into that?</P>

      <P>I am ruling that you are not.  We are dealing specifically with a certain matter which has given rise to this whole controversy, that is, a criticism of the Chair by a Minister of the Government outside the House, and both the motion and the amendment must be taken as relating to that particular circumstance.</P>

      <P>In accepting your ruling, I want to say, in conclusion, that I urge the acceptance of the first part of the amendment for the reasons I have given.  With regard to the second part, now that it has been decided and laid <Col N="1789" /> down that the Chair cannot be discussed outside the House, I therefore urge on Deputies that we accept that position and we will all know where we are so far as that is concerned in the future.</P>
      <P>I only regret that we could not also impose some bridle on the tongues of some of the Deputies outside and inside the House and prevent them from using some of the language they use on occasions outside the House dealing with Deputies of this House and with Ministers of State who serve this House.  I do not see any reason why we should accept any precedent from any outside Parliament in connection with this matter.  We are quite capable of dealing with our own business and, if it is now found expedient by the House to apply this rule, we shall do so without delay and further debates of this kind will not be necessary.</P>

      <P>I should like to state very briefly my view on this motion and on the amendment.  To me, at 3 o'clock yesterday, the issue at stake was very simple indeed.  After a four or five hours' debate, it has become very confusing and I think we have lost sight of the motion; I have no particular interest in the amendment.  Yesterday, it was a question as to whether the Minister for Local Government was, or was not, insulting to the Chair in this Assembly.  The issue was very simple, indeed, because, to my mind, the Minister for Local Government had insulted the Irish people by insulting the Ceann Comhairle who presides over this Assembly, which is representative of all sections of the Irish people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce created confusion by bringing in matters that had no <Col N="1790" /> bearing on the motion or the amendment. These are the usual tactics on the Government Benches when they are accused in matters of this kind. Their defence is to make accusations against the Opposition Party concerned, no matter which Party that may be.  They cloak up the attack made on the Government or on a particular member of the Government by making the main issue an attack on the Opposition Parties.  The amendment suggests that there should be some written rules regarding the privileges, obligations and general conduct of Deputies in this House.  You cannot write down with pen and ink any such code because the code involved in this case is a code of decency and honour. The Minister for Local Government was insulting to the Irish people.  This is a democratic Assembly, presided over by the Ceann Comhairle or Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and to my mind, at least, the Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle are the true symbols of Irish democracy.  Did the Minister insult the Chair or did he not? That is the issue.  If he did and if he were a man, he would apologise to the Chair and we would now be engaged in the discussion of Estimates or legislation instead of wasting time and money by trying to get out of the Minister for Local Government a simple apology.  I am sure that the Minister knows he did wrong and that the Taoiseach knows he did wrong. They knew that without any written rule or regulation as to what was right and what was wrong.  If the amendment is accepted and we sit down and try to write a code by which Deputies' behaviour inside and outside this House will be governed, we shall not be able to include everything and we shall have incidents of this kind coming up, with suggestions from the Taoiseach or somebody else that we make further provision to deal with them.  If we are to lay down rules and regulations, can they embrace everything? Should it be necessary to have rules or regulations to govern behaviour of this kind? Let the Taoiseach be honest and straight about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government has neither admitted nor denied that <Col N="1791" /> he made these statements.  Since he does not deny making them, we may assume that he did make them.  From what I understand, his was a deliberate insult to the Chair.  His speech was not spontaneous.  It was not made on the spur of the moment.  I think I am right in saying that the speech was supplied to the newspapers.  I am beginning to think that this statement by the Minister for Local Government was engineered so that the Government could get a crack at the Opposition regarding their remarks about the judiciary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has gone on for a long time.  If there had been any spark of public decency in the mind or character of the Minister for Local Government, there would have been no debate upon this matter, because the Minister would have come into this House yesterday and publicly apologised for the statement he made.  The burden of the story told to this House on behalf of the Minister by members of his Party has been that there was no written rule prohibiting members of this House from criticising or condemning the Chair.  Was it really necessary to have a written rule on so simple a matter? Surely, our ordinary sense of justice and fair play should dictate to us that we have no right to attack the administration of an office which is, by its very nature, impartial and the occupant of which cannot defend himself in public debate.  Criticism of the Chair and of the rulings of the Chair may be put in the same category as the grumblings and complainings of the bad loser in a football game &mdash;the man who cannot either attack or defend on the field and afterwards puts all the blame for his failure on the referee.  The Ceann Comhairle and the other occupant of the Chair here are in the position of referees.  It is the duty of the occupant of the Chair to see that there is justice and fair play between the various Parties which represent the people in this democratic Assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the judgment and sense of fair play of the occupant of the Chair depends whether we are to have fair and impartial discussion here and fair and <Col N="1792" /> just decisions.  If the Government build their defence on the ground that there is no written rule prohibiting attacks on the Chair by members of this House when speaking outside the House, is it not strange that, until the Minister for Local Government ran amuck at a Fianna Fáil dance, no attack had been made on the Chair during the past 25 years? I have, certainly, not heard of the occupant of the Chair or his administration being criticised outside the House by a Deputy during the past 15 years.  That is as it should be. Deputies have a sense of justice and fair play.  We may make mistakes in the House, and some Deputies may have to be ordered out occasionally, or some Deputies may try the patience of the occupant of the Chair from time to time, but no Deputy ever went outside to attack the administration of the Chair, until that happy and desirable record was broken by one member of the Government Party.</P>
    <P>One would have thought that, reading his remarks in the <i>Irish Press</i> the next day, the Minister would have repented and realised the mistake he had made, the serious wrong he had committed to this Parliamentary institution, to the occupants of the Chair and to democratic principles generally, and that, before any move was made by any member of the Opposition, he would have come into this House and publicly apologised.  Even assuming that he was not big enough to do that, one would have thought that the Taoiseach or the members of the Government would have beaten some sense into his head, that they would have told him he was acting altogether against all principles of democratic government and in defiance of all rules governing Parliamentary institutions.</P>
    <P>Instead of that, we have had an attempt by the Government to cloak the Minister's offence and lead this House to believe that all this occurred because there were no definite rules and regulations, because the bad, wild, irresponsible Opposition Parties had refused to sit down with Fianna Fáil and draft rules and regulations governing the conduct of members of the House.  There was no rule or regulation during the past 25 years to compel Deputies to realise that they should <Col N="1793" /> not attack the administration of the Chair.  The speeches made here to-day would rather confirm the opinion of the Opposition Parties that what Fianna Fáil wanted, when they talked about drafting rules and regulations governing procedure here, were rules that would curb the liberty of ordinary Deputies.  An attempt was to be made to muzzle the various Opposition Parties, through a series of rules dictated by the Government Party, which has a majority over all Parties.  That is not a situation into which Opposition Parties would be easily led.  It is essential that each member of this House should have the widest possible liberty to express his views on all matters of national importance without restriction, provided that he keeps within the ordinary rules of decency and the Standing Orders of the House. Deputies accept that without reservation or qualification, but they will never accept the view that the officer who presides over our deliberations here should be exposed to criticism, ridicule and contempt by Deputies when speaking outside.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we should be called upon to devote a very considerable amount of Parliamentary time to this discussion.  It is not a matter which required any discussion.  It is a matter in which the ordinary common sense of the people would have guided us, if that ordinary common sense had been allowed to operate.  However, Party feeling, the narrow Party prejudice so frequently displayed by the Government Party, has shown itself and the Minister has neither been asked nor compelled to climb down.</P>
    <P>The Government Party, with their overwhelming majority, are standing behind him, determined to defy the laws of decency, the laws of justice and the laws of fair play.  We have had some strange speeches delivered to-day from the Government side.  We had the Minister for Industry and Commerce, followed by Deputy Moran, glorying in the fact that this House is not guided by the precedents or traditions established by other Houses. That will deceive nobody.  It is intended to be an appeal to the narrow patriotism of the more ignorant section <Col N="1794" /> of the community.  We all know that the human race has progressed down the ages, that democracy has progressed in every country down the years, and that the people in this country, in Great Britain, in the United States and in other countries, have contributed to the progress of democracy and to the establishment of precedents governing the liberty of the people and their elected representatives. With these facts before us, we can only deplore that a Minister of an Irish Government has so forgotten the dignity of his position and of this House as to imitate the conduct of the bad loser on the football field who blames the referee.  I had the honour to be classed with the occupant of the Chair in the Minister's attack last Saturday night.</P>
    <P>I regard that as a lasting honour. It is an honour for any Deputy to be attacked in a personal way by the Minister for Local Government, and it will be an honour to this House if we repudiate the assertion of the Minister for Local Government that he has the right to condemn and criticise the Chairman of this House.  It will be an honour to this House if the ordinary members of the Fianna Fáil Party refuse to allow themselves to be marshalled into the Division Lobby to support this infamous amendment.  It will be an honour to those members of the Fianna Fáil Party if they resurrect their consciences, which they have referred to on frequent occasions here and act upon them, instead of being driven like dumb cattle by a Government Party Whip.</P>
    <P>This is a bigger matter than an issue between the Minister for Local Government and the occupant of the Chair. It is a matter which concerns the future development of democratic government in this country.  If a majority in this House, no matter how it is constituted, considers that it has a right to dictate to the Chair how he is to conduct the business of the House, then we shall have an end to democratic government here for all time.</P>
    <P>It is possible that the Minister for Local Government, when he spoke at this Party celebration of Fianna Fáil, was intoxicated by the exuberance of his own verbosity, as he frequently is, <Col N="1795" /> but surely since he spoke and since his words were recorded in the columns of the <i>Irish Press</i> he has had plenty of time to examine his conscience, and the members of his Party will have plenty of time to examine their consciences. There is an easy way to end this debate once and for all, and that is for the Minister for Local Government to come into this House and admit that he made a mistake and apologise to the Chair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a tradition attaching to the Chair in most Parliaments, one that is founded upon long practice in Parliamentary procedure. That tradition is that the Chair in the exercise of its authority is independent of Party control of any kind whatever: that the Chair, in the exercise of its functions, is doing so not on behalf of the Government in power for the time being, but on behalf of the House as a whole, and irrespective of the political constitution of the House itself.  That tradition in the nearest country to us, Great Britain, was so enshrined in the British Constitution that the Speaker of the British House of Commons was not only regarded as being above Party in the exercise of his functions, but the tradition grew up there that Speakers, irrespective of their Party affiliations, were continued in that office by successive Governments which in Party politics differed from the politics of the Speaker.  You had over the years the tradition there whereby a Conservative Government continued in office a Liberal Speaker or <i>vice versa</i>, a Liberal Government continued in office a Conservative Speaker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But unhappily here, 15 years ago, that grand tradition was broken when a political nominee for the office was installed by a majority of this House. However, I am not going to dwell any further on that beyond saying that I think it was a mistake that the office of Speaker could not have been an office which, at all times, would be over and above politics.  During the past 15 years a member of the Government Party has held that high office in this House, and over the 15 years he has discharged his functions impartially and with due respect to the feelings of <Col N="1796" /> all Parties in the House.  He has built up a tradition for himself in the House, and even if he is a member of a political Party we can say of him at least that he was an honest partisan, and that never did he allow Party considerations to influence him in the exercise of his office.  It is regrettable, therefore, that the first aspersion to be cast upon the Chair should have come from a Minister of the Government and a Deputy of his own Party.  It is regrettable in the extreme that when that animadversion was cast on the Chair the Minister did not take the obvious course of tendering his apologies to the Chair and of withdrawing whatever he had said outside the House.</P>
    <P>Whenever the Minister for Local Government makes a speech he reminds me of Dan O'Connell and of the time he went to hold his argument with Biddy Moriarity.  He sets out in the same spirit that O'Connell sets out in the to twit and thwart Biddy Moriarity.  We all know that, when Dan O'Connell engaged in these famous altercations with the famous Biddy whose tongue was so well known in every street and lane of the Dublin of the time, he did so in a spirit of fun, merely for the purpose of seeing whether he could by twitting Biddy loosen her tongue to such an extent as to get her to lose her temper.  I often wonder whether, when the Minister for Local Government gets on a public platform, he sort of feels that he is twitting some mythical Biddy Moriarity, because off a public platform he is credited with being a decent sort of man.  In social life he moves in the highest circles&mdash; the darling of the drawing-room, the <i>bon vivant</i> if ever there was one.  He plays the drawing-room game according to the rules, but when he gets on a public platform he is a different personality&mdash;a Jekyll and Hyde.  I do not know whether he adopts a dual personality for political purposes.  I do not know whether he is put up by the Party he represents in the House as the mud-slinger of that Party.</P>

I believe that he is the political mud-slinger of Fianna Fáil and that he is put up deliberately by Fianna Fáil to do the mud-slinging for Fianna Fáil.  For that reason it is quite clear to me that that is the reason why we have this amendment introduced&mdash;the official mud-slinger cannot be deserted or let down.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke stood up to defend the Minister.  He made a speech which, from beginning to end, I failed to follow. Apparently, he was put up to echo the ejaculations previously made by the Minister for Finance&mdash;&ldquo;Chief Justice&rdquo;, &ldquo;Chief Justice&rdquo;, &ldquo;Chief Justice&rdquo;&mdash;like a repeating gramophone record.  When the chair put him off that particular line he had nothing further to say.  The only thing I can conclude is that, being a servant of the Minister for Local Government, he felt that it would be a good thing for him to go into the ring and show, at least, that Paddy Burke was behind him.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was followed almost immediately by Deputy Moran, who proceeded to side-track the issue but who let the cat out of the bag very effectively when he said that he supported paragraph 1 of the amendment and, not only did he support that amendment in full, but he wanted to go further and he hoped the Government would go further with the matter and that not only would they take steps to gag Deputies inside the House but that they would take steps to gag them outside the House. Coming from Deputy Moran, it is a strange pronouncement.  Coming from a member of the legal profession, it is a still stranger pronouncement.  May I remind Deputy Moran that as long as there is a breath in any of us here, either inside or outside the House, we shall fight to the death any effort made from the opposite side of the House to gag Deputies either inside or outside the House? We stand firmly on the absolute privilege which attaches to Parliament and to pronouncements and speeches made in Parliament, and we are not going to surrender that right of absolute privilege for things said in this House because at the present time they happen to hurt Fianna Fáil in their sorest point.</P>

      <P>Various efforts have been made by various speakers on the opposite side to side-track the issue involved in this very simple matter and, of course, the supreme effort was made by the Taoiseach in putting down this amendment to the motion.  First, let me say that in accepting the motion, the Ceann Comhairle has ruled implicitly, as he said himself to-day, that the Minister for Local Government stands censured by the Chair for what he said on Saturday night last at a céilidhe in the Engineers' Hall and whether or not this amendment to the motion is passed &mdash;I have no doubt it will be passed by the machine majority on the other side &mdash;it is immaterial to that very simple issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is a deliberate attempt to burke and evade the motion in the name of Deputy Mulcahy, a very simple motion which asks that until the Minister for Local Government apologises for what he said he should be suspended from the service of the House.  In order to side-track that issue still further, we have dragged into this debate the question of privilege and the duties and responsibilities of Deputies and Parliamentary procedure and practice elsewhere.  There is no matter of privilege&mdash;there is certainly no technical matter of privilege&mdash;involved in this whole business.  The <Col N="1800" /> Minister for Local Government did not commit a breach of privilege on Saturday night last.</P>

      <P>Ordinary standards of decency should have dictated to the Minister for Local Government a very obvious course which anybody in his peculiar circumstance would have taken, to tender on the first possible occasion his apology to the Chair and let the matter end there.  Instead of that, we are forced to debate this matter for a whole day of public time when we might be devoting our attention to the serious problems confronting the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment seeks, in the first paragraph, to introduce in substance a matter which has already been decided by the House, a matter which we opposed <Col N="1801" /> in this House and in which we refused to co-operate and in which all Deputies on the Opposition side, irrespective of Party, have refused to co-operate, a matter which the Minister for Local Government, in his own statement on Saturday night, admitted had been killed by the opposition put forward to it from this side of the House.  Yet, we have that matter resurrected to-day as the first paragraph of the Taoiseach's amendment and ruled upon by the Chair as in order because it is, as the Chair ruled, by way of preamble to the other paragraph in the amendment.  With all due respect to the Chair, I do not hold that it is a preamble.  It is a substantive motion reintroducing in substance, not in exact words, the motion already decided here in the matter of procedure and privilege, and that motion is deliberately brought in here in this form to cloak and cover the simple issue involved.</P>
    <P>In the second paragraph we had a reference to a ruling that was made by the Chair yesterday.  In express words no ruling was made by the Chair yesterday.  The only ruling that was made by the Chair yesterday was that the motion in the name of Deputy Mulcahy would be put down for to-day and that the discussion on the motion would take place to-day, but the Chair did say that in accepting the motion they implicitly censured the Minister for Local Government but, so far as there was an express ruling, there is no such thing.  In the third paragraph we are asked to accept that ruling as if it were an express ruling. What is the effect of that ruling, if it is a ruling at all? The effect is that as from to-night when the machined majority gets going what the Minister for Local Government said on Saturday night cannot in future be said by any Deputy outside the House. We have this whole travesty, this hypocritical performance going on in a vain attempt to save the face of the Minister for Local Government.  The case made for the amendment by the Taoiseach is that he would not introduce any <i>ex post facto</i> or retroactive legislation.  He would not introduce any Statutory Rule or Order in this House which would have retrospective <Col N="1802" /> effect, though the whole week and though the whole of last year he and his Ministers have been introducing Bill after Bill with retroactive effect and though the whole of his argument yesterday and last week on the Sinn Féin Fund Bill has been in favour of legislation with retroactive effect.  It all boils down to this.  It was not an offence for the Minister to make this wild statement on Saturday night but it will be an offence to-morrow night. If the Taoiseach thinks he can deceive the country by tactics of that kind, by a mere technicality, by mere verbiage, to cover the offence of the Minister, he is very much mistaken in the country's reaction at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach made the case that because the Standing Orders had not specifically provided for this particular offence there was no offence.  Many, many Statutes have been passed through this House and through other Houses to create new offences but there are many matters, even at present, which have not and are not likely to be legislated upon which are offensive. Offences against common decency and the ordinary decencies of debate and public life are, if not specific offences in the sense of breaches of by-laws of this House, certainly offences in the social sense.  Because there was no specific Order in the Standing Orders the argument has been put forward that there are no grounds upon which to censure the Minister and that, therefore, we must have this extraordinary provision brought in by which we are going to find a square peg for every little hole and gap that may likely be discovered in the future years.  Does anybody think for a moment that we can, by Order, legislate for every conceivable type of happening that may arise in the future as between Deputy and Minister, Minister and Minister, or between any Deputy of this House and the Chair? Does anybody think for a moment that we can cover all the gaps? I venture to prophesy that we will have many square pegs for the round holes of the future but that the Taoiseach and his Party will eventually discover many holes for which they cannot find pegs. The Taoiseach further said that he would not agree with Deputy Dillon <Col N="1803" /> when he suggested that there was precedent elsewhere which might be followed. Erskine May must not be followed here! We all know that the officers of this House and the Taoiseach himself have time out of number followed precedents laid down in that well-known authority.  I know that Erskine May is not a binding authority upon this Parliament or upon any other Parliament but I do say this much, that where there is no precedent here to govern the particular happening Erskine May is a persuasive authority which should be consulted and followed. The country will not be deceived by any of the tactics resorted to here by the deliberate attempt of the people on the other side to hurl mud and insult on the Deputies here who have, during the past few weeks, been trying to resist certain forms of legislation, certain encroachments by the Executive, upon other Departments of State.</P>
    <P>I do want to say this, in conclusion, that what was a very simple issue between the Minister, Deputy MacEntee, and the officers now holding the office of Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle, has been very much widened by the introduction of this amendment and that it is no longer a matter of a simple apology between the Minister and the particular occupants of the Chair but that the passing of this amendment is calculated to undermine the authority of the Chair&mdash;that the passing of this amendment is a deliberate attempt to sap the independence of the Chair and in their effort to sap and undermine the independence of the Chair, there is a deliberate attempt by the Taoiseach and his colleagues to sap and undermine the independence of Parliament. There is a deliberate effort being made, particularly in paragraph 1 of this amendment, to gag and bind the Deputies on this side of the House to silent opposition.  I appeal to all Deputies, irrespective of Party, not to lend their support to a measure of this kind which has as its objective the silencing of criticism in this House. This particular paragraph is deliberately calculated to aim at the independence of Deputies.  It is deliberately <Col N="1804" /> calculated to withdraw from Deputies the absolute privilege they have of speaking in this House.  As I have said already, we on this side of the House will fight to the death against that type of thing.  We will resist all efforts at silencing criticism here.  I have said, and I will say it until I am no longer a member of this House, that our business here is opposition, opposition all the time, constructive where possible. Our business is to endeavour to put the Government right when we see the Government are going wrong.  Deputy Burke charges us with being arch-hypocrites when we stand up in defence of principles.</P>

      <P>I think that the House ought to accept this amendment.  There is no use in saying that it is a subterfuge.  The fact is that it is necessary to have Standing Orders, apparently, dealing with conduct outside the House as well as conduct inside the House.  I can say, and I am sure I am speaking for every member of the Government, that, <Col N="1805" /> if there were such a Standing Order, no Minister or Deputy would have made any reflection on the Chair outside and that, if he did, no member of the Government would stand over it. Therefore, I say the House ought to accept this amendment.  I think this debate will do a lot of good.  It was edifying to find some Deputies who have shown very little respect for the Chair standing up for the Chair in the way they did.</P>
      <P>When I saw Deputy Dillon coming in here this afternoon I said: &ldquo;Surely he is not going to speak.&rdquo;  I was certain he was not going to speak because he had his overcoat on.  I thought he was going to listen.  It was only a couple of weeks ago, when you, Sir, were in the Chair, that I saw the Chair being treated with such contempt by Deputy Dillon as I have never seen it treated in my 20 years of experience in the House.  So bad was it that it evoked protests from Deputies of three different Parties &mdash; Deputy Blowick, Deputy Keyes and a Deputy from my Party.  The Deputy referred to the ruling of the Chair as nonsense.  He then turned his back on you, Sir, and carried on as if you had not drawn his attention to the fact that he was out of order.  If any quotation is required in support of that, I have it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon started his speech this afternoon by declaring that the Taoiseach was an audacious man.  Was there ever such audacity displayed in this House as was displayed by that Deputy who as recently as about three weeks ago referred to your ruling, Sir, as nonsense and actually went to the trouble of spelling out the simple word &ldquo;crime&rdquo; as if you, Sir, were too dense to understand it and then ostentatiously turned his back on you and addressed the House as if you were not worth consideration.  It is a very good thing to see Deputy Dillon now one of the foremost advocates of respect for the Chair.  Let us hope that he will continue in that attitude.  I may be wrong, and I hope I am wrong because I do not want to do him an injustice, but I had a feeling that Deputy Dillon from the day he came into this House deliberately put himself out to defy the Chair by taking advantage of the well-known indulgence of the Chair towards <Col N="1806" /> members of the Opposition, because it is proper that the minority in the House should get more latitude than the majority Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that Deputy Blowick stated that the Deputy had referred to the ruling of the Chair as nonsense.  Deputy Corry also objected, but the way in which he was treated was that he was put out and quite rightly.  I hope that as a result of this debate Deputy Dillon and others like him who are showing such anxiety that the Chair should be respected and protected will do it themselves and thus set an example.  I say that there is an absolute necessity for this regulation. As to the point about square pegs in round holes which Deputy Coogan referred to, what is all legislation only an attempt to remove flaws found in the existing law? It is by trial and error that humanity progresses. We try one thing and we think we are doing the best we can. We have several stages of Bills in this House and, with all our combined wisdom, inside a few weeks or so we may find some flaw that was not discovered. So far as putting square pegs in round holes is concerned, that will continue as long as humanity lasts.  If we find in future that, notwithstanding the rules we lay down by this amendment&mdash; which I hope will be accepted&mdash;something further is required, undoubtedly we will have to provide for it because that is the way humanity progresses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputies ought to approach this matter in a different way.  This is a genuine effort.  There is no attempt whatever being made to curtail liberty of debate.  There is a definite proposal here to lay down something in black and white so that nobody can say that he did not know about it.  If anyone does offend against it I, as one member of the Government, and I am sure I am speaking for the whole Government, will not stand over any Deputy breaking that rule.  As from yesterday, when the Chair ruled that there was a <Col N="1807" /> breach of privilege, I am sure that no Minister or Deputy will ever do it again.  If they do, you may take it that the members of the Government will not stand over it.  That is the way I should like the House to treat this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We have laid down Standing Orders to govern procedure and the conduct of members inside the House.  It has been stated that Erskine May's <i>Parliamentary Practice</i> should have been accepted.  Every Deputy has not studied that book.  It is no reflection on a great number of Deputies to say that they have not studied it.  They may not have been aware of it.  There may be certain standards which a certain number of people accept but others do not, but, if they are laid down in black and white, we cannot say that we do not know about them. What objection can there be to having a Standing Order dealing with the conduct of members outside the House as well as inside? There is no good in throwing mud on every suggestion made to get us out of the awkward dilemma which undoubtedly is there. We must have the Chair respected, both inside and outside the House.  I may be wrong, but I think it is a great pity that the Chair should not be respected outside the House; but I think it is far more serious when the Chair is treated by Deputies in the contemptuous manner that Deputy Dillon treated the Chair a few weeks ago.  It is far more damaging to the prestige of this House if members behave disrespectfully inside the House.  I deplore that anybody would be disrespectful inside or outside the House. I do not want to complicate the matter any further.  I will ask the House to consider the amendment on its merits. It simply means that we lay down a rule of conduct for ourselves outside as well as inside and that we will strictly adhere to it.</P>

      <P>For the past seven or eight days this Assembly has been engaged in the discussion of the Sinn Féin Funds Bill, and this motion to my mind, has been a waste of time.  If the people down the country who have elected us knew that we were coming to Dublin, to a certain extent at their expense, and that we were spending our time in such discussions as we have had to-day, apart altogether from the <Col N="1809" /> discussions early this week and last week, I wonder what they would do with us.  I would not like to have their verdict or to stand before them for an expression of their opinion.  It is a disgrace to have the whole of this day spent discussing the conduct of a Minister whom we all know, no matter what may be said here, will not be requested by the Government to apologise, and who will scarcely be asked by the Chair to leave the House.</P>
      <P>We have here a motion and an amendment.  The motion states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Minister for Local Government be suspended from the service of the Dáil until such time as he shall have made suitable apology to the Dáil for the adverse criticism of the conduct of the Chair made publicly by him at the Engineers' Hall, Dublin, and reported in the daily Press on Monday, 28th April, 1947.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That has been put down by the Opposition.  Then the Government Party put down what really seems to be a motion, though they term it an amendment.  All they accept of the main motion is the one word &ldquo;that&rdquo;. The amendment goes on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete all words after the word `that' and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `the Dáil is of opinion that it is desirable that the obligations and privileges of members should be more adequately defined, and that appropriate action to that end should be taken without delay;' &rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the important part of the amendment.  The House will remember that on one occasion a question arose as to whether it was parliamentary or otherwise to accuse another Deputy of telling a lie or an untruth. The Chair ruled that Deputies were not to use that expression directly or indirectly.  That ruling has been accepted by the House.  I was unaware of it and I came into the House after a short absence and with very good reason I said a Minister was telling an untruth or a lie.  I saw where the Taoiseach got away here with a similar statement and I felt it was in keeping with the Standing Orders and, unaware of the ruling, I followed in his footsteps. But I had a greater reason for <Col N="1810" /> my accusation than the Taoiseach had. Anyhow, the Chair took care that I would either withdraw my accusation or leave the House.</P>
    <P>I think the Chair will admit I was not removed from the House compulsorily. I went through the ordinary channels available to every Deputy and I demanded a decision of the House as to whether I should leave or remain. I knew the result beforehand.  I left the House when I was called upon, and so did my colleague, Deputy Commons. On two occasions since I entered the House in 1944 that has happened to me.</P>

If it has been accepted that the Minister for Local Government acted unwisely when delivering his speech in this particular hall, and if he apologised this afternoon and the Chair accepted his apology, or if he did not apologise and if you demanded of him as you demanded of me, that he should leave the House for a week, two weeks or a month, there would be no need for this amendment.</P>

      <P>If the House desired the Minister to leave there would be no necessity for this discussion or for this amendment.  We all at times make mistakes.  I am no immune from such mistakes.  For the short time I have been in public life I have not yet found any reason, either inside or outside the House, to make an attack upon the Ceann Comhairle or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  In fairness to these two gentlemen, I will say they have discharged their duties very reasonably and I think it is no credit to any Deputy who gets on a public platform and indulges in the type of criticism which we have seen in the daily papers. <Col N="1811" /> Certainly it is no credit to a Minister with such long experience as that of the Minister for Local Government, a Minister who holds very high office and who is at the head of an important Department.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Blowick pointed out, he once made a nasty slip but he was manly enough to come back here and apologise&mdash;and it takes something to do that.  It was already a week after the event when it was drawn to his notice. He came back and apologised to the Minister and to you, Sir.  But the Minister for Local Government is determined on not apologising and the Government, in my opinion, are determined in seeing that he will not be asked to apologise.  Because of that, we have this amendment brought forward as a kind of smoke-screen to try to cover him up.  The Opposition in this House have been accused of not carrying on debate in this House according to the standards which one would expect.  The Minister is aware that if Deputies, while speaking in this House, use unparliamentary expressions and if the Chair demands the withdrawal of these expressions, they must be withdrawn or else the member concerned must leave the House.  I cannot understand for the life of me, why the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the other members of the Front Bench of the Government Party should try to justify their action and the action of the Minister by quoting from the Official Debates certain statements made by Opposition Deputies during the debate on the Sinn Féin Funds Bill. There can be no analogy between such statements and the statements made by the Minister in his speech at the Engineers' Hall.  If Deputies have made statements here, these statements have arisen out of the fact that the Bill which was under discussion and the Minister responsible for the introduction of that Bill, forced these Deputies to criticise the chairman of the board mentioned in that Bill. There was no other way out and anything that was said was accepted as Parliamentary otherwise the Chair would have asked the Deputies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If we accept this amendment it is the first step towards muzzling Deputies inside this House and perhaps, at a later stage, outside the House.  For that reason alone we cannot accept the amendment because this is the one institution where the representatives of the people can discuss the interests of the people.  If the people feel that they have been unjustly treated by the Government of the day the public representatives in this institution, the first Assembly of the land, have the right to debate the matter here.  If we are going to be muzzled in the way in which the Taoiseach cunningly proposes, through this amendment, then in my opinion it is the first step on the road towards the introduction of a dictatorship and interference with Parliamentary representatives. It may suit some Deputies that a motion should be tabled and accepted for the muzzling or the bridling of Deputies inside and outside this House.  Naturally enough there are some members who are not active inside or outside the House and who have very little interest in the welfare of the people.  If they could get their colleagues muzzled, things would be very suitable for them.  For that reason I am opposed to the amendment. In my opinion there is no necessity for it.  If the Minister did what he should have done, this discussion would have ended about a quarter past three and we could have passed on to some other business which would be more appropriate to the <Col N="1813" /> House and more beneficial to the interests of the people as a whole.</P>

      <P>The most discreditable, degrading and reprehensible aspect of this disgusting action on the part of an individual who is supposed to be a responsible Minister of State, is to my mind, the attitude of the Government Party.  I listened to every speech made from the Government Benches this evening, from the Taoiseach down, and every speech was made in justification of the Minister's action.  No attempt has been made by anyone from that side of the House to offer an apology to the Chair.  I feel that is a most extraordinary situation.  The Taoiseach whom one would expect to uphold the dignity of the House and, above all, the dignity of the Chair, led off and tried to find a loop-hole and an excuse for the Minister's action last week. One would expect where the dignity of the House is concerned, to get an example from the Government Benches or from a member of the Government. At least there is a responsibility on a member of the Government, over and above that of an ordinary Deputy, to set a good example in that respect, but the reaction to this motion was simply to drag a red-herring across the motion and to refer to the attitude of Deputies in this House to the Chair as a justification of the Minister's action outside the House.  So far as any disrespect to the Chair here, or any action of a Deputy here which is contrary to dignity and decorum of this House is concerned, the Ceann Comhairle can take the necessary action and if necessary have a motion moved to suspend the Deputy from the service of the House.  The Deputy in that case pays the penalty.  The motion suggests a simple penalty, so far as the Minister is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any man with the spirit of manhood in him, having committed an offence of this sort, would be the first to spring to his feet and offer an apology, but the whole Fianna Fáil Party comes in here and tries to justify the disgusting and scurrilous attack on the conduct of the Chair here.  I was rather amused by the Minister for Justice who, in recommending the amendment to the House, advised us that it was a genuine attempt to deal with this matter.  I <Col N="1814" /> think he said they were in a rather awkward dilemma in respect of it.  He made no reference, good, bad or indifferent, to the matter before the House&mdash;the action of a Minister of State and his contemptuous and degrading reference to the Chair and the dignity of the Chair in Parliament.  He intervened on another occasion, while Deputy Coogan was speaking, to say that the Chair had actually ruled that the Minister had committed a breach of privilege, that the ruling of the Chair implied that a breach of the privileges of the House had been committed. If that is so, why does the Minister not apologise? It is a most illogical attitude which the Party has taken up.  If that Minister is right in saying that the Ceann Comhairle has ruled that a breach of the privileges of the House has been committed by the Minister, I see no reason for the Government's not accepting the motion. It is a natural consequence of a member committing a breach of privilege that he should apologise to the Chair and to the House, but the Government and the members of the Party have spent the whole evening attempting to justify the scurrilous attack made by the Minister for Local Government on the Chair last week.</P>
    <P>As I say, it is a most extraordinary attitude on the part of the Government, and particularly the Taoiseach. The only excuse the Taoiseach could offer is that there was no breach of any rule, and, because there was no breach of any rule, no offence had been committed.  Is it suggested that we are free to misconduct ourselves in every conceivable way, provided we are not offending against any particular rule?</P>
    <P>Is it not reasonable to suggest that there is an unwritten rule, at all events, so far as our attitude to the Ceann Comhairle and the office of the Ceann Comhairle is concerned, and that we are expected to have respect for the Ceann Comhairle, that it is right and proper that we should have that respect? If the deliberations and work of Parliament are to be conducted in a dignified and proper way, some respect must be maintained outside Parliament and what we expect from a Deputy, we expect from the people.  Surely it is reasonable to <Col N="1815" /> expect that on that important and vital matter, bearing in mind the vital function the Ceann Comhairle discharges, in relation to this democratic institution, we would have proper respect from a Minister of State.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice waxes indignant about the attitude of Deputy Dillon and it appeared to me an extraordinary attitude on the part of the Minister.  I am not expressing any view on Deputy Dillon's or any other Deputy's attitude, but are we to take it that, because a Deputy behaves in a disorderly way in the House, the Minister for Local Government is justified in going out and behaving in a most disorderly and scurrilous manner? That is the case made by the Government here and that is the case which has been argued by every speaker from the opposite benches.  I suggest that we cannot misconduct ourselves in that fashion, and it is absurd to suggest that because there is no definite rule governing the particular matter, what was not an offence yesterday is to be an offence to-morrow, merely because an amendment is brought in and a number of Deputies walk into a certain Lobby.</P>
    <P>We have been told here definitely that you, Sir, ruled that it was an offence against the privileges of the House, and I submit that the Government are not accepting your ruling on that matter.  That is a very serious aspect of this whole disgusting affair. I would not expect very much from the Minister for Local Government.  As a matter of fact, reading his speeches for many years now, I would expect nothing better, and although he has gone to live among the aristocrats in the city&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I personally could not support any part of that amendment. The first part is merely an attempt to bolster up a motion carried by the Government Party a few months ago for a completely different purpose and to put a different complexion on that motion.  The Government have been concerned all the time to find a loop-hole for defending the action of the Minister, regardless of what reflection it cast upon the Chair.  That is what we are concerned, and honestly concerned, with.  The whole amendment, to my mind, is hypocritical and false, and there is no sincerity whatever behind it.  If the Minister for Local Government wants to act as a man would act in the circumstances, he still has time to do so by offering his apology to you, Sir, to the office you occupy and to the House.  I submit that, before we finish with this matter, he has time to reconsider his position, and my advice to him is to behave, at least once in his lifetime, like a man, to stand up and say: &ldquo;I am sorry for the disrespect I offered to the Chair.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Members of this House who have been here as long as I have been, or who know the Minister's tactics, or antics, as well as I know them, know perfectly well that, on nearly every occasion on which he speaks in public, he speaks from prepared notes, that he makes prepared speeches.  He hands his notes to the Press in advance and these prepared speeches delivered by the Minister are nearly always prepared after consultation with his colleagues or advisers. I could not swear that the Minister takes advice from anybody.  There is no doubt that he is obliged to consult with the Taoiseach and leaders of the Party.  I <Col N="1817" /> take it that this speech was delivered after the usual consultation.  The strange thing is that this type of speech was delivered at a Fianna Fáil céilidhe.  I know of no other case, in relation to Fianna Fáil or any other Party, in which a speech of this type was delivered to young people coming together for amusement and enjoyment. Would the Minister for Justice, if he could collect all those who went to the Engineers' Hall last Saturday night to enjoy themselves by dancing and listening to good singers&mdash;would he say to the rising generation of Fianna Fáil supporters that that is the kind of tripe they should be asked to listen to at a Fianna Fáil céilidhe or &ldquo;hooley&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>That is the only portion of the proceedings I am concerned with.  Deputy O'Higgins was not historically accurate when he said that you, Sir, were put into the Chair 15 years ago by the votes of Deputies opposite.  Before you were put into the Chair, I remember having a sharp discussion with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and others.  This question was discussed.  It is not a secret at all because the Fianna Fáil Party did not get a majority of members of this House in the general election of 1932.  I remember the Taoiseach emphasising the necessity, from, his point of view&mdash;we had, ultimately, to appreciate that point of view&mdash;of having a person in the Chair during his period of office as head of the Government on whom he could rely and <Col N="1818" /> whom he could trust implicitly.  You were selected, Sir, and you and your predecessor had to pull me up during my membership of the House in reference to expressions used, without any deliberate intention, which might be taken as casting reflections on the Chair.  I bowed to your rulings but I must admit that I never liked your rulings.  However, I should never dream of going to my constituency and referring to the occupation of the Chair by yourself or your predecessor in the language used by this alleged gentleman on Saturday night at a céilidhe. On the same occasion that I used my vote, with those of my colleagues, to put you into the position which you occupy with such dignity and with so much respect from the House, I, unfortunately, by my vote and the votes of six other colleagues, made Deputy MacEntee Minister for Local Government. As I have not done so already, I take this opportunity of publicly apologising to my constituents for that particular vote, because I thought that the Taoiseach, when nominating Ministers, would nominate persons who were men and gentlemen, though not born gentlemen.</P>

I know of no man in public life who has taken advantage of his public position, not so much inside the House as outside the House, to slander his colleagues and everybody who does not agree with him.  In my constituency, he made four or five speeches of an abusive character concerning myself and a colleague on the Opposition Benches.

      <P>I do not want to take up the time of the House and, in expressing my views, I do not want to be abusive or to use unparliamentary expressions.  To anybody who studies the position impartially, it is evident that this amendment represents approval of the speech delivered&mdash;certainly, not condemnation.  It warns the man who made the speech that, if <Col N="1820" /> he repeats it, he will get the same dose of medicine as any other member of the House.  The Minister for Justice who speaks as he thinks&mdash;quite sincerely&mdash;and in a language that any ordinary Deputy can understand, came very near to saying that he personally disapproved of the type of speech and the nature of the criticism of the occupants of the Chair delivered last Saturday night.  I admit that it is next door to impossible to expect a colleague of the Minister for Local Government to condemn him publicly in this House but this whitewashing type of amendment is a curious way of dealing with a situation which should never have arisen.</P>
      <P>If a member of this House committed an offence against the Chair by making a speech of this kind, it would not be half as bad as in the case of the Minister, because a Minister, as a man and a gentleman, is supposed to give good example.  He is supposed to give good example to bad members of the House like myself and to new members who do not understand much about procedure and relevancy, as old members like myself are supposed to do.  Good example should be given by the Minister and those who sit on the Government Benches.</P>

      <P>I quite agree with the Minister when he says that this debate may not do any harm.  It may do a great deal of good, even under the terms of the amendment, if carried, if it brings the Minister for Local Government to a sense of decency.  The amendment puts the occupant of the Chair and his deputy in a mosthumiliating position.  It amounts to tacit approval of a speech delivered in which the Chair was severely and unfairly criticised.  The only value that can be seen in it is that it is a warning notice to the Minister and to all others that in the future anyone who repeats the offence will be dealt with very drastically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amongst those sitting on this side of the House&mdash;and, perhaps, amongst some of those on the other side, but they dare not say it&mdash;there is a sort of idea <Col N="1821" /> that the Taoiseach considers himself infallible and, therefore, those sitting behind him and around him must be infallible also.  That is, of course, in a political sense only.  It is regrettable that the time of the House should be taken up, at this time of the year, in dealing with this, and I do not want to take it up any longer.  The next time the Minister for Local Government wishes to attack his political opponents, as he is quite entitled to attack them, let him do so at some function other than a Fianna Fáil céilidhe.  Let it be fairly and decently done, in a plain straightforward way, in the way that I know the Tánaiste has been in the habit of attacking. The Tánaiste has been chasing me in my constituency in every general election.  I do not know whether he likes the place or not, but he feels it his duty and his obligation as a member of the Government Party to visit it, and deliver five or six speeches there in every general election.  I am bound to say that the Tánaiste does his job for his own Party and does it in a very clean and straightforward way, although his criticism of the Labour Party, and naturally of myself in particular, when he is in my constituency, is fairly strong and fairly convincing, because he is a man who can use the English language in a very convincing way.  I would take off my hat to him, even if he were responsible for defeating me in the next election. He fights the fight for Fianna Fáil in my constituency in a way unlike that of the Minister for Local Government, in a clean, straightforward way.</P>
    <P>I hope no member of this House, whether it be a Minister or a Deputy, inside or outside the House, at a Fianna Fáil céilidhe or at any public function or on any public platform, will repeat the type of language that was used regarding the Chair and the occupant of the Chair by the Minister for Local Government last Saturday night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regretted that, for a quibble, we should be forced to sit the whole day discussing the irresponsible utterances of the Minister for Local Government.  There is a dividing line between right and wrong and the Minister stepped over on the wrong <Col N="1822" /> side, in making certain criticisms of the occupant of the Chair, outside this House.  The Minister knew he was wrong and the Taoiseach and his colleagues on the Government Benches knew he was wrong; but, for a quibble, they have forced us to spend a day discussing that wrong attitude.  Had the Minister adopted the attitude pursued by any ordinary person, had he taken the opportunity to make a gentleman's gesture, there would be no need for the discussion to which we have listened all this day.  The Minister did not make that gesture and, therefore, the Taoiseach and other Ministers were forced to make some sort of case to the House to-day for the absence of an apology from the Minister.</P>
      <P>The deplorable position is that the Taoiseach and the Ministers know definitely that they are wrong.  This amendment by the Taoiseach is an admission that they are wrong.  The Taoiseach admits that the Minister made an adverse criticism of the Chair, outside the House, and that he was wrong in doing so.  The Minister for Justice followed later and spoke in the same tone.  He admitted it in clearer language than did the Taoiseach in his amendment.  The amendment says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...that in view of the fact that, prior to the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle on 29th instant, there has been no rule or resolution of the House or ruling of the Ceann Comhairle which declared it to be a breach of privilege for a member to criticise, outside the House, the conduct of the Chair...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is no rule or ruling and because there was no clear dividing line between right and wrong, the Minister was at liberty to step over on the wrong side, as he did, and the Government were within their rights in backing up the Minister because he stepped on the wrong side knowingly. It continues:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...that the Dáil accepts the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle, above referred to, and decides that, henceforth, adverse criticism of the conduct of the Chair, made outside the House, shall be a breach of privilege.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They accept the position that adverse <Col N="1823" /> criticism by outsiders shall be a breach of privilege.  If the Taoiseach was not convinced in his own mind that the action of the Minister constituted a breach of privilege, he would not have so readily accepted the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle that it was a breach, nor would he have brought in this amendment.  As Deputy Dillon said to-day, the Taoiseach is well advised. If he himself was not familiar with the work of Erskine May, there were officials in this House wise enough and clear enough in their knowledge to advise the Taoiseach that the Minister had stepped over the ordinary decent lines pursued in similar circumstances in any Parliament in the world.</P>
    <P>It is still not too late for the Taoiseach to request the Minister to take up the attitude of any decent, ordinary civilian man or woman, if knowingly or even unknowingly, they made an adverse criticism of the occupant of the Chair.  He could have pursued the ordinary course a Deputy or any decent citizen would have pursued and made a gentleman's gesture. Then there would not have been this discussion all this day.  Evidently, the Minister is not bound by the rules of ordinary decency, the rules that ordinary people with a gentlemanly instinct would pursue in a case of this kind.  Because the Minister is not imbued with those instincts, the Taoiseach feels it incumbent upon him to present us with this quibble, to get out of the difficulty in which the Minister has placed him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only two points to which I want to draw attention.  Does the Taoiseach stand over the action of the Minister in criticising the Chair outside the House in the way in which he did, then completely refusing to take any step to redress a gross and serious attack on the Chair and its vital functions? That is apart altogether from any attitude the Chair itself may take of the occurrence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is that it is definitely accepted by the Taoiseach and by the Government that the decision <Col N="1824" /> of the Chair was right in accepting my motion dealing with this matter&mdash;that this was an expression of opinion on the part of the Chair that an offence had been committed.  Yet, in face of that comment or judgment by the Chair on the occurrence, the Taoiseach was still quite unmoved in so far as the occurrence itself was concerned, but yet he was moved to introduce the amendment that we received ten minutes before the Dáil sat.  Naturally, it is going to be accepted as an offence in the future.  There has been a considerable amount of argument that because there was not a rule no offence was committed.  I do not accept the argument brought forward that Erskine May's rule was the procedure here.  It describes the procedure that has developed elsewhere, and it is useful to have his record in regard to other cases mentioned here so that we can measure our performance here from the point of view of public dignity, decorum and respect for the Chair by what has happened elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Those who mentioned Erskine May brought to our notice that in the case of the British House of Commons there have been many occasions upon which members have offended, even against the accepted rules there, in criticising the Chair outside.  In the whole of our Parliamentary history over the past 25 years there has not been a case of a single person offending in the way that the Minister for Local Government offended on Saturday night. During all that period, since the establishment of the State, it was not a rule that prevented an offence taking place, but the natural understanding, the natural intelligence and dignity of our people&mdash;our natural respect for this institution, and for the position that the Chair occupies and its vital function here.  We had to wait until Saturday night to see, for the first time in our Parliamentary history, the Chair insulted in the way in which it was.</P>
    <P>Now we are to get a rule.  The implications of the attitude of the Taoiseach, of the Minister and of the Government on this matter are that nothing matters if there is not a rule. The theory is now put forward that we <Col N="1825" /> must have a set of rules to keep us straight.  What rules are we going to have to uphold the justice, the prudence and the charity that we put in such a prominent way in the preamble to our Constitution? Are we going to have no prudence except the prudence that is dictated or covered by a rule, no justice that is not covered by a rule, and no charity that is not covered by a rule? We do not want to get ourselves into the strait-jacket of rules to teach us how to be either self-respecting citizens or responsibleminded Christians.  The suggestion that you must have a rule now is only just hypocrisy, humbug and deceit. We had to wait until the Minister's Party was celebrating its 24th birthday to have our standard of conduct here, and the conduct of members of the House in their respect for the Chair outraged in the way it was on Saturday night.  I regard the Taoiseach's amendment as just a way of escape, a way in which he hopes to be able to cover over the simple terms of this motion by a wide excursion into all kinds of irrelevancies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton, when he was speaking, seemed to suggest that the Minister for Local Government was encouraged. He may have been, but that is no reason why we should shut our eyes to a serious offence against the order and dignity of this House, or why we should hesitate to put down whatever motion was necessary to discuss and face this fact straightly and honestly, and take the decisions that our sense of responsibility dictates. Whatever weakness individuals, Miniisters or Deputies may have that would prevent them keeping to proper standards of conduct, or keeping within rules, we cannot, if we are going to preserve our institutions and our people, forget our responsibilities, or shut our eyes to actions that are injurious to our institutions here.  If any member of any Party other than a member of the Government Party had made statements critical of the Chair, such as the Minister for Local Government made the other night, we would not have to wait very long until the mover of the amendment to-night would have moved a motion such as we are moving.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1826" /> The issue before the House on this matter is whether a thing that you are now asked to accept as a rule, if passed by a Fianna Fáil majority in the House to-night, did, in fact, exist as a standard of decency on Saturday night: whether you are in accepting for to-morrow the judgment of the Ceann Comhairle that what was done on Saturday night was an infringement of the dignity of the Chair and of the dignity of this House, you are accepting that as necessary to protect his dignity and the dignity of the House against the actions of the Minister for Local Government on Saturday night.</P>
    <P>The issue is a simple, net and clear issue.  It is expressed clearly and simply in the motion that I have put down.  None of the smoke-screening of the Taoiseach's amendment or of any of the speeches that have been made here to-night from the Government Benches in such an irrelevant way should be allowed to obscure the issue.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government has offended against a standard of conduct naturally accepted by any person who ever entered this House in the last 25 years, since it was set up as an institution. He has offended against that.  The Ceann Comhairle has shown that in his judgment that is an offence against the Chair.  We can vote here according to our sense of responsibility that the Minister who is guilty of that should be punished if he does not apologise. The Government Party can defeat that. We can only leave it to the Minister himself, to the Taoiseach and his colleagues. Let the implication of their actions sink home on them.  We, at any rate&mdash;and I think every Party and every member of the House outside the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;are seeing this action of the Minister in its proper light and in its proper perspective and we are determined that, in so far as lies in our power, everything that can be done to uphold the dignity of the Chair and to preserve a keen appreciation of the vital function that the Chair serves and of the principle that the Chair must be obeyed in its rulings and must be respected both inside this <Col N="1827" /> House and outside and that, if we have any complaint to make against the Chair or any criticism to make of the Chair, we can only do it in a most formal manner here by putting down a motion expressing what we feel by way of criticism or by way of condemnation of any of his conduct or of his ruling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I was not in for the debate on this Estimate last night.  There are just one or two points on which I should like to get some enlightenment from the Minister. I do not know whether the points have already been put to him.  I should like, for instance, if the Minister would explain why, in the giving of the news relating to the business of this House when questions put and answered in the House are being dealt with, the name of the Deputy putting a question is always omitted and the name of the Minister answering the question is given.  I do not know whether the other matter has already been referred to, but I have no intention of going into it, that is, regarding the very definite bias that is shown in giving political news or news of the business transacted in this House.  That has become so notorious that I do not think it matters whether or not we refer to it here.</P>
      <P>So far as the service itself is concerned, I think that we ought to have reached the stage in this country when we can have a better and a more continuous service than we are getting. I am not, of course, now referring to the curtailment of the programme which has been brought about by recent conditions, over which I know the Minister any more than anybody else had no control.  But ordinarily I think that the people are entitled to get a more continuous service and I am not, I think, overstating it when I say that, even with the service we are getting, the people are not satisfied that the principal items in the ordinary service that we get from Radio Éireann are given at times when the majority of listeners would be free to listen to them.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that better use could not be made of wireless here so far as the agricultural community are concerned.  I think it is a service which could be used to greater advantage during the winter months&mdash;in the long winter evenings&mdash;to propagate news which would be of interest and of benefit to the farming community. I am not so sure that there are some features that we would not be better off without.  Equally, I think there are a number of features which are barred by the Minister from the people and which, I think, the people want and are entitled to get.</P>
      <P>I do not know to what extent, if any, the features given over the radio are a reflection of the Minister's own tastes with regard to music and so on.  I would not like to decry in any way the value of what people call classical music.  I do not know very much about music, but I am told that there is an unreasonable amount of the limited time which is utilised for broadcasting here devoted to features which, as large numbers of people say, are entirely over their heads.  I find in rural areas, and perhaps it is natural enough, that the majority of the people want to get native music which, I suppose, they understand better than the other, and I find considerable numbers of farmers and farmers' sons who are anxious to keep abreast of every modern development which would help towards increased agricultural production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be helpful and very instructive if we had over the radio from the experts who reside in this country short talks or lectures on modern developments tending towards <Col N="1835" /> an intensification in agricultural production. The utilisation to the best possible advantage of the limited fertilisers we have, the intelligent use of lime on certain classes of land, the varieties of cereals and root crops likely to give the best return from soil of a particular type or in different counties or parts of counties&mdash;all these things might be broadcast in an interesting fashion and unquestionably the information would be very useful to the agricultural community.  I would not like to see what I am now suggesting carried out in the way in which we have been accustomed to get things from the Department of Agriculture. That is, in a general sort of way, as if the land in every county was the same, as if there was no difference whatever in the soils.  We all know there is a vast difference, and a particular variety of seed that would be suitable for land in one parish would be quite unsuitable for the land in the next parish; what would be suitable in one field might not be suitable in another.</P>
    <P>What I am endeavouring to convey to the Minister is that we should get through our radio a number of features that would be useful to the people generally.  I would like the radio to be used for what I think everybody will agree is badly needed in this country, and that is to convey to our people, particularly those who are growing up, some sense of civic responsibility, some sense of respect for public property.  We know that irresponsible children and, indeed, persons who are not children but who are still irresponsible, have, not only in the city here, but through various parts of the country, caused great damage to public property of one kind or another.  I think responsibility of citizenship in this State is absolutely ignored.  It is one of the things that we are lacking in and I think the wireless could be used, at least to some extent, to help in that direction.  I think most Deputies will agree with me there.</P>
    <P>I do not want to suggest that the wireless station should be used entirely for instructive purposes, if I might put it that way, as people look to it for a <Col N="1836" /> certain amount of relaxation but at certain periods of the year, and at certain times of the day, we could have, judiciously blended with the ordinary entertainment programme, some features that would be as I say instructive, useful and beneficial, not only to the individual but to the country as a whole.  Our wireless station and its personnel are I think sufficiently long in existence now to be able to give us, having of course all the time regard to the size of the country and to our resources, as good a service as any other national broadcasting system.  I do not think, as I say, that we are making the best use or the fullest use of it.  I know that the Minister and that particular section of his Department, have, like other Departments, been carrying on under difficulties.  I know their difficulties have not lessened since the war ended but at the same time I feel that we are not getting as much from this service as we might get from it.  I know there are numerous complaints from people who pay an annual licence fee that they are not getting the worth of their money. That is a view to which I do not subscribe. I think that the annual licence fee is very reasonable and a very moderate one but it does bring in a rather substantial income in the year.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether we have yet reached the stage that we are spending on the station even the amount realised from wireless licences.  I think that the income from the service is the least that should be spent and, personally, I should be prepared, should it be necessary in order to derive the fullest benefit from the service, to vote any sum additional to that realised from the licence fees.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the position is still that which existed for many years, that artistes and other people whose services are utilised for broadcasting purposes have the complaint that they are very badly underpaid, and whether people are expected to come up from the country to take part in a particular feature, the recompense for that being two or three guineas. If so, I think it should be discontinued. If you want to get good service, whether on the wireless or in any other way, if you want to get the best man <Col N="1837" /> or the right man, you will have to pay for it.  I think that if the wireless service were utilised to the fullest extent possible it could confer many benefits on the country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The outstanding development indicated by the Minister for the coming year is the provision of a new short-wave station.  The Minister indicated that it is the intention of the broadcasting service to provide talks and entertainment for our people abroad.  This opens up a very wide field for discussion and consideration. If we are to provide a big expansion of our broadcasting service, if we are to give a more frequent news service, if we are to give talks to our people abroad, in addition to providing entertainment, the question raised by Deputy Morrissey at the outset comes up for consideration.  That question is: are we assured that through the broadcasting service all Parties in the State will receive fair treatment so far as the programmes are concerned? Broadcasting may be compared to the Press in a certain way.  It provides news, information, and frequently a certain amount of entertainment.</P>
      <P>The freedom of the Press is maintained because you have in every free country a number of newspapers competing against one another &mdash; rival papers, some privately owned, some owned, perhaps, by the Government or by the Party associated with the Government. In broadcasting you have just one service controlled by the Government and every section of the community has to contribute to the upkeep of that service.  People who disagree with the Government on matters of policy have to pay licence fees just the same as supporters of the Government. It is, therefore, essential if we are to continue to have a national broadcasting service that we must have impartial administration, so far as all Parties and all political views are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the time has come when we should consider the setting up of a council, representative of all Parties in the State, to control our broadcasting service or, at least, advise in the control of our broadcasting service so as to ensure that people whose views are not in complete agreement with those of the Government, will get a fair voice in <Col N="1838" /> the service.  Some people might say that the best way out of that difficulty is to have a kind of neutral broadcasting service, something similar to a Government Department, a service which confines itself only to the broadcasting of topics which are not the subjects of controversy.  That kind of service, not only where news is concerned, but where comments on passing events and things of that sort are concerned, is certain to be a dead-and-alive affair.</P>
    <P>You can imagine a newspaper run exclusively by civil servants.  Such a newspaper would have to avoid offending any section of the community.  The news contained in such a newspaper would be so could and dead that nobody at all would read it.  The same is true of broadcasting.  If you try to avoid contentious subjects, try to avoid offending anybody, you have got to confine yourself to very neutral subjects of discussion.  I think that would not make for good broadcasting and would not make for a service which would hold the interest of people abroad.  If we are going to have a short-wave station, to address, first of all, our Irish citizens and people abroad of Irish birth and, secondly, the citizens of other countries, and interest them in the affairs of this country, we shall have to speak on matters of topical interest, not only in this country but in every country in the world.  If we have to do that, we cannot express a dead neutral point of view on all questions.  This matter comes to my mind in regard to our Irish people in Great Britain.  It is desirable that our broadcasting station, speaking to our people in Great Britain, should uphold the good name of this country, should seek to convince our people in Great Britain that this is a nation with a future and seek to inspire them with respect and admiration for their mother country.  Until very recently, I was supplied, free of charge, with a newspaper which circulated amongst our Irish people in Great Britain.  It is definitely a Communist organ, calling itself <i>The Irish Democrat.</i></P>
    <P>That paper has a wide circulation, and I think it is a terrible thing that our people in Great Britain, and particularly our young people, should be exposed to the type of propaganda <Col N="1839" /> contained in that paper and similar papers, without anything being done by our broadcasting station to counteract Communism.  I think it is the duty of our broadcasting service to uphold the Christian concept of life and to fight Communism, and particularly to fight it when it seeks to win the support of our Irish-born people.  There is no doubt whatever that the propaganda of the Communists in Great Britain, particularly when they call themselves the Connolly Association, and seek to win our young people over, will have a certain amount of effect.  It is our duty to fight that, but we cannot fight it through a broadcasting service which is run as our present service is run. We must have a council representative of all responsible Parties in the country controlling the propaganda of our broadcasting service, and directed, as I say, to keeping the Irish Christian and national viewpoint before our people abroad.</P>
    <P>Then, again, there is the question of utilising our broadcasting service to advance the cause of national unity. We cannot expect civil servants to direct a campaign in support of national unity, to fight to uphold Ireland's case and to contest all the contentious issues that may be raised in regard to Partition.  There again a national council representative of all Parties in the country is essential, if such a world-wide propaganda campaign is to be directed by Radio Éireann.  We must have people expressing the Irish viewpoint over the radio, people who are not confined exclusively to one Party and who are not paid officials of the State.  A considerable amount of freedom must be recognised and accepted, and such a campaign will require the united and careful consideration of all Parties in the State.  It is a national question, the biggest national issue facing us, and a question upon which all Parties in the State can and should co-operate. There can be no question of having only the viewpoint of Fianna Fáil in regard to Partition expressed by Radio Éireann.  The national viewpoint must be expressed, and, for that reason, it is essential that machinery be set up to provide for the co-operation of all Parties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1840" /> It may be that the Minister will tell me that there is no intention to utilise this short-wave station to conduct a campaign for national unity.  If that is so, I hold that the expenditure on a short-wave station is to a very large extent a waste of public money.  We must use that short-wave station for national propagandist purposes.  Propaganda is being used and will continue to be used against this nation outside this country, and it is the duty of the nation to counteract that propaganda and to put the Irish case clearly before the people of Great Britain and other nations.  We may be told that if we set out to educate British public opinion in regard to this matter of national unity we are merely repeating what the various constitutional political Parties undertook in the past century, that we are merely repeating or reintroducing the policy which was discredited in 1916 or 1918.  I do not quite agree with that view.  I do not quite agree that the energy, the enthusiasm and the effort which was put into the work of educating British public opinion in regard to the Irish question by O'Connell and the other constitutional leaders who succeeded him was entirely wasted.  I believe it contributed in very far-reaching measure to the ultimate independence of this country, and I believe that a campaign directed towards educating British public opinion in regard to our rights in the matter of national unity will also bear fruit.</P>
    <P>It is essential that such a campaign must not be rushed into in a headlong or haphazard kind of way.  It must be carefully considered and must receive the whole-hearted attention of every Irishman who has the interests of the Irish nation and the interests of Irish unity at heart.  It must not be a haphazard, slapdash affair.  Carefully considered and carefully directed, a propagandist campaign in support of Irish unity, appealing directly to the people of Northern Ireland and Great Britain, will bear fruit.  Its message and its effort will be supported.  I am sure, by our people in the United States.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if allocations of the 110,000 tons of maize imported during the past year were made on the basis of 25 per cent. of their 1939 trade to registered maize millers; if he will state why an allocation has been refused to Cornelius Keohane, Western Bridge, Kinsale, who was a registered maize miller at the vital period, ending July, 1939; also, if any other such registered maize millers were refused; and if so, on what grounds.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.</P>
      <P>An allocation of maize was not made to Mr. Keohane as he did not manufacture any maize meal mixture during the year ended 31st July, 1939.  Mr. Keohane's registration in the Register of Maize Millers, kept under the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Acts, was cancelled on 23rd May, 1936, and was not restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allocations of maize were made to all maize millers who were registered in the Register of Maize Millers on 31st July, 1939, and who manufactured <Col N="1702" /> maize meal mixture during the previous year.</P>
