      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether his attention has been directed to the case of Joseph Walsh, an Irish citizen resident in Britain, who, having been conscripted for service in the British Army, applied for and was refused an exit permit from Britain, declined to serve in the army there and was courtmartialled as a deserter; if he will state the findings of the courtmartial, and what steps have been or will be taken to protect the interests of this Irish citizen; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been making inquiries into this case.  At the time when he was conscripted, there was an arrangement in existence between the British authorities and ourselves which, if he had complied with it, would have entitled him to return to Ireland if he so desired.  I am at present considering his case to see whether it is possible to make representations on his behalf.  I am not in a position to say anything more at the moment, but may be able to give additional information if the Deputy will put down a question in, say, a month's time.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the last date on which he <Col N="980" /> authorised hotels and restaurants to increase the prices charged by them for meals, and the amount of the increase so authorised; and whether, in view of the steps taken in the Supplementary Budget to reduce the cost of certain foodstuffs, he will again review the prices charged for meals in hotels and restaurants so as to secure a reduction in such charges corresponding to the reduction of 13.2 points in the cost of living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 10th instant, because of increased costs due to higher wages and other factors, I authorised certain restaurants to increase the prices of á la carte items by 10 per cent. and table d'hôte meals by 6d. per meal.  The question of securing a reduction in the prices charged at present as a result of the reductions in prices of foodstuffs referred to by the Deputy is being examined.  An increase of 10 per cent. in hotel charges was authorised by the Irish Tourist Board early this year. Since then the wages of hotel employees have been increased and it will be necessary for the board to take into consideration such increases in costs in conjunction with the reduction in the prices of foodstuffs.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the three principal fuel merchants in Tralee are now purchasing supplies of turf for sale to customers in large lots only; that, consequently, there is practically no supply available for ordinary purchasers who can afford to buy only a bag at a time; and whether, as this practice is likely to cause serious hardship in the coming months, he will have the matter investigated, with a view to having it remedied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The turf position in Tralee has been under observation for some time past arising out of a demand made by certain merchants for permission to charge retail prices which were considered excessive.

    <P>I will be prepared to grant a permit under the Control of Timber Orders to the Wexford Corporation, or to the contractor engaged on the housing scheme promoted by the Wexford Corporation, which will authorise the purchase of any quantity of timber that may be needed to replace defective material purchased under the permits which have been issued.</P>

    <P>On the 9th September, 1947, Mr. Joseph Cooney, Secretary of Locke's Distillery Company, who was accompanied by Senator William Quirke, informed an officer of my Department that an Irish-controlled company in association with certain Swiss interests proposed to take over and carry on the distillery.  It was indicated that a prospect of developing the sale of Irish whiskey in Switzerland, a hard currency area, was foreseen but that its success would depend on the granting of some increase in the existing small export quota of 4,400 gallons, and a quota of 8,000 gallons was requested. <Col N="987" /> The application was referred to me and, on the understanding that the details of the proposed scheme for the acquisition and operation of the distillery were satisfactory and that the additional exports would go to Switzerland, I decided to sanction an increase in Locke's export quota of mature whiskey to 8,000 gallons per annum.</P>

      <P>Proposals for a water supply scheme for Ballinskelligs and Dungeagon were submitted to my Department by the former Board of Health and Public Assistance.  Considerable difficulty was experienced in obtaining a source of supply which would prove adequate for the needs of the area, and in November, 1939, the Kerry Board of Health and Public Assistance decided to defer the scheme indefinitely.  No further proposals have been received from the local authority in the matter.</P>

      <P>Hubert Kurt Sachell, who is an Austrian national and was born in Vienna, entered this country from Great Britain on the 2nd July, 1946.  He stated that he was European agent of a New York firm and that he intended to transfer his offices from London to Dublin.  He was granted permission to remain here up to the 30th of June. 1947.  He did not hold a passport on his arrival, but was in possession of a British Alien's Registration Certificate. He complied with the Aliens Order during his stay here.  In June last he was informed that his permit to reside here would not be renewed.  His solicitor then represented that Sachell would require time for the winding up of his affairs as legal proceedings might be involved, and he was informed that there would be no objection to his remaining here until the end of the year on the understanding that he would not engage in any business in the meantime. Recently it was discovered that he was still engaging in business, and he was warned that if he did not leave without delay he would be deported.  He left the country on 24th of October.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, may I inquire whether at any time he was informed as to the nature of Mr. Sachell's affairs and whether it is true that Mr. Sachell acquired a large farm in the West of Ireland?  Will the Minister say whether it is permissible for aliens without passports to acquire the fee simple of land in this country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

I am asking the Minister is he now satisfied that that representation was <i>bona fide</i> made, and how it is to be reconciled with the acquisition of a large farm in Galway on which, as far as I know, this man was resident?</P>

The question of the buying of the farm would not arise at all because, as the law stands, there is no obstacle to an alien doing that. As regards the clothing, I do not know Deputy Flanagan mentioned something about clothing, but I did not know what he was talking about.  I never heard anything about it, and neither was anything heard about it in my Department.  Apparently, Deputy <Col N="993" /> Flanagan thinks that I know something about it, but I know nothing about it. I inquired into it&mdash;it was the usual irresponsible stuff that we get from Deputy Flanagan&mdash;but I could not get anything whatever.  Deputy Dillon also said something about it.

      <P>The fact that a farm is put on the market is no reason why the Land Commission should take action. There is a much more serious consideration, and that is the question of security of tenure.  Farmers in this country have been fighting always for security of tenure.  If a man who owns a farm is not entitled to put it on the market, then he is not secure in his tenure.  The Land Commission should not necessarily take action in a matter of this kind because the farm has been put on the market.</P>

I am particularly concerned at the present moment with the congested districts counties where a condition exists that we must try to ameliorate.  I am not concerned too much with areas outside these districts.  I did say, however, to the deputation that if the conditions portrayed by the deputation exist there I would hope inside half a year&mdash;not a month&mdash;to be able to do something helpful in that particular area in regard to the Trench estate.  I have made personal inquiries.  I have examined the files in connection with the area and I notice that three estates right beside the Trench estate have been acquired, and, so far as I can find, there are no uneconomic holders in the district.  I am merely concerned with helping uneconomic holders.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not.  The Minister brings this Resolution before us on Report and asks the House to pass it.  It is a Resolution which means that £600,000 more than was previously contemplated would be taken, will be taken from income-tax payers this year and that, in a normal year, an extra £1,000,000 will be taken. We can only see that proposal in its proper perspective when we realise that the amount collected in 1938-39 from income-tax payers was £5,250,000. On the basis of the Budget introduced at the beginning of this year, the Minister contemplated that he would require to take over £12,000,000 from income-tax payers, as compared with £5,250,000 in pre-war times.  He says that the financial situation is now such that he must impose another increase in the income-tax so that in a normal year he will be able to collect another £1,000,000 in income-tax.</P>
      <P>The Minister puts that proposal before the House and he declines to discuss its implications for income-tax payers or the general reason why it is required to raise income-tax in that way.  When we discussed the implication for income-tax payers of the tax that was raised on the basis of the Budget as it stood at the beginning of the year, from every side of the House, except that safeguarded by the Minister and kept silent by him, there were voluminous expressions of opinion in regard to the position in which heads of families found themselves, in having to bear the cost of the rearing and education of their children and in being called upon to pay the very heavy burden that an income-tax of £12,250,000 represented. The Minister knows that since he introduced his proposals in respect of income-tax in the beginning of the year, not only has the ordinary cost of living very substantially increased but the cost of education, particularly in the secondary schools and the universities, has been substantially raised, thus imposing an additional burden on those who are charged with the responsibility of rearing and educating their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I opposed the introduction of this Resolution and I had hopes that the <Col N="1007" /> Minister would have been able to give some kind of adequate explanation of the proposal when we came to Report. The Minister now takes up the attitude that he simply will not tell us anything further than that he wants this money and that he is going to take it.  He is going to march the Party behind him into the lobby in support of his determination to take it.  He just makes that kind of sullen statement that he explained it already and that he will not give any further explanation.  The Minister and his colleagues have been appealing to the country to understand the general situation in which we find ourselves, and he has asked for more co-operation and more harmony in supporting the means to combat our present difficulties.  The Minister and his colleagues ought to practise in some kind of way what they are preaching outside.  I submit that his treatment of this House in putting before us a proposal to increase the burden of income-tax in a normal year to the extent of another £1,000,000, is certainly not calculated to promote harmony, an understanding view of the situation, or co-operation in any way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this Resolution upon which the Minister has grimly refused to comment, the explanation of his reluctance is perfectly simple.  He has not the faintest notion why he should put up income-tax. Austerity is becoming a word of common usage.  Austerity is disagreeable but austerity does not owe its virtue to the fact that it is disagreeable. Austerity owes its virtue to the fact that it is endured by the community in order to achieve an ascertainable end. But the Minister for Finance, with that very recognisable characteristic with which we have all become familiar, discovers a device which he understands is going to hurt someone, some section of the community, about which he does not give a tinker's curse and therefore he slaps it on.  Does he justify it? Most of his followers would not understand the justification if it were made. Those whom it hurts will not listen to its justification because they can see through it.  For the record&mdash;I have no hope of persuading the 77 sages who sit <Col N="1008" /> on the Fianna Fáil Benches&mdash;I desire to say that an increase in taxation could be a deflationary procedure, if the Minister announced that his purpose was to raise a Budgetary surplus for the purpose of paying off debt and of sterilising purchasing power.  But if the Minister further raises revenue by taxation and then proceeds to spend the money, there is no deflationary effect in that procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>With all respect, the Minister's justification for increasing income-tax and supertax was that he was going to take out of the hands of private individuals loose money they might otherwise spend on scarce goods. If on taking that money, he applies it to a purpose other than the purchase of goods by the Government and diverts it into a special channel where its purchasing power is not likely to affect the available supply of goods, he is taking a measure for which justification could be made but that is not his purpose.  So far as the Budget statement went, it led this House to believe that his purpose was to spend every penny of the money that he is now raising in the subsidisation of food.  If that is his purpose, and he has no deflationary intention in mind, why does he put on the tax at all?  He already has too much money at his disposal in the Exchequer to effect the subsidies he has in mind.  He has £4,000,000 in the Transition Development Fund which he cannot spend.  He has half the Army Estimates which he cannot spend, because he cannot get the men and he has an unprecedented opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I protest against the imposition of an additional 6d. in the £ by <Col N="1009" /> way of income-tax in order to raise £1,000,000.  Does the Minister tell us that, out of the Transition Development Fund, £4,000,000 of which is in his hands, out of the Army Estimate, £500,000 of which he admits is unspendable because he cannot get the men, out of other heads in the Estimates, every one of which stands at a record figure, he cannot get £1,000,000 unless he puts an extra 6d. on the income-tax?</P>
      <P>I make the reservation that I am talking for the record.  The case made for the imposition of this tax is childish and puerile; it would not deceive a fifth form schoolboy.  It was an election stunt designed to persuade the average Fianna Fáil supporter that the Minister for Finance was battering the rich man and plastering the poor man.  Unfortunately, some of the tag-rag and bobtail attach more importance to the increase in the price of tobacco than they do to the reduced price of flour.</P>

Attribute to him the wisdom of Solomon and proceed on that basis, or assume an ignorance vast and deep enough to contain the whole of the City of Dublin and proceed on that basis? The Minister does not know what the tax is about, what the purpose of it is or what the effect of it will be.</P>
      <P>It is a tragic fact that we who live in this country, who form part of it and make some contribution to its wealth, have to continue our efforts to do so saddled with a man who can put 6d. on the income-tax, who does not know why he is doing it and is not in a position to give us any useful information. He does not want this money if subsidies are in mind, but if it is deflation he is seeking to effect, he is not going the right way about it.  If neither of the purposes described in the Budget debate is served by this proposal, what purpose is served?  We are entitled to know what purpose will be served.</P>

People may have a few additional pounds, or £10,000 to spend to relieve the taxes, but I do not see why people with £4,000 should be picked out to add to the £53,000,000.  This is one of Fianna Fáil's hypocritical labours to show the people whose incomes have been taxed, whose beer has been taxed, who have been taxed in the transfer of property that they are taking something too from the rich people, the people who wear the tall hats.

      <P>Does the Minister intend to double the Garda Síochána Force?  With the small crop of oats, wheat and barley in certain parts of the country and the bad potato crop, a great deal will be manufactured into the native brew, and the Minister, by putting a tax of 6d. extra on spirits, is going to give one of the greatest possible fillips to a native industry which has not the sanction of any Party in this House or of the Minister for Finance.  The net result will be that the little still on the hill will be working harder than ever to the detriment of a great number of people.  I would like to ask the Minister whether he has considered all the dangers that this increase is likely to bring about in the country.  It is true that in winter time a drop of whiskey in the house is very useful to all types of workers and this 6d. per glass increase is not justified under the circumstances.</P>

I think that the Minister should dilate on this, particularly if there is a conflict between the explanation given either here or anywhere else by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to the intention of this.  If I understand the proposal put before the House by the Minister for Finance it intends to take £935,000 out of the pockets of the people who want to use spirits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>A little more than that was said about it.  That was not what the Minister said when this was being introduced, but because they wanted to stop the people drinking spirits so that we should have a greater exporting surplus of spirits, particularly whiskey, to enable us to get badly-needed dollars.  I should like to know whether the Minister or his Department has made any estimate of the additional amount of whiskey which it will be possible to export consequent on the imposition of this additional tax.  Can the Minister tell us whether any estimate has been made of the number of additional dollars we shall get for the additional whiskey so exported?  Will he tell us how the dollars which we get for all the whiskey we now export compare with the 4,500,000 dollars which we are expending for five air machines?</P>

If Deputy Davin would remember that he is not addressing a public meeting down the country, we should get along much more quickly with this business.  It is hoped to raise £935,000 by this increased duty on <Col N="1021" /> spirits.  There was no difference in the explanations given by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and myself in regard to the Budgetary proposals.  We hope to get this additional sum of £935,000 from the tax but if, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce said, by any chance, the Revenue Commissioners and I are wrong in our estimates and we do not get that amount, then there will be more whiskey for export.  The proposals were made on the assumption that we should get this increased revenue of £935,000 this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any explanation to give on this Resolution? Will he tell us why it was necessary to increase the price of all tobaccos and cigarettes, including ordinary plug tobacco?  Apparently, the Minister is going to sit silent.  I want to oppose this tax in its entirety.  I want to oppose it with particular reference to the fact that it makes the price of the ordinary plug tobacco, which is the tobacco used by the very poorest sections of our people, prohibitive.  May I remind the House that, under this new tax, the lowest price at which a person can buy one ounce of tobacco is 2/-?  This tax will hit, in the main, the most lowly-paid and lowly recompensed <Col N="1024" /> section of our community.  It will, particularly, affect the agricultural community. Two ounces of tobacco will cost 4/-.  Deputies on all sides of the House know from personal experience that the only comfort the old man who is beyond his labour and who is either entirely or mainly dependent on the old age pension has is his smoke.  One ounce of tobacco in the week will not, as every pipe smoker knows, give very much comfort, consolation or satisfaction to a man, young or old.  To buy one ounce of tobacco will cost many an old age pensioner one-fifth of his entire income for a week.</P>
      <P>I know and so does every Deputy who has any practical knowledge and experience of rural life that it was not uncommon to find farmers and farmers' sons, in the days when they could afford it, before the price rocketed to its present level, working alone in the fields all day with no company whatever except, perhaps, a pair of horses. It was not uncommon to find such men smoking as much as an ounce of tobacco per day.  Very few average pipe smokers in the country would smoke less than four ounces in the week.  Now, we get this.  Why?  The Minister has refused to be courteous enough to tell me the amount that is going to be realised by this particular Resolution.  Therefore, I have to depend on my memory, as I have not got a copy of his speech here before me.  Speaking from memory, I think he estimates something like £1,900,000 from this particular tax.  Perhaps the Minister would now be courteous enough to say whether I am correct or incorrect.</P>

      <P>I have no hesitation in saying that three-quarters of that sum will come from the pockets of the people for whose relief, according to the Minister, the food subsidies are introduced.  There is not a shadow of doubt about that.  There is not a shadow of doubt, of course, that the vast bulk of the revenue which is to be derived from this additional tax will <Col N="1025" /> come out of the pockets of those who smoke the popular or cheaper brands of tobacco and cigarettes, because they are naturally, of course, in the great majority.  With the prices of both tobacco and cigarettes at the level at which they are to-day there are comparatively few people in the country who can afford to smoke other than the very cheapest brands.  Therefore, I have no hesitation in saying that at least three-quarters of the additional tax collected under this resolution will come out of the pockets of the poor people for whom the Minister has said the other subsidies are introduced in order to reduce the cost of living.  To add to the humbug and to the hypocrisy of the whole thing, I understand it is now the intention to remove tobacco from the cost-of-living index to enable us to bring down the cost-of-living index.</P>
      <P>We get this from a Government, one of whose chief Ministers&mdash;of course in his customary, witty and well chosen words&mdash;accused a Minister of another Government of faking the cost-of-living index figure.  This tax is an unfair tax. It is an unjust tax.  It is an unnecessary tax.  If the Minister wants £2,000,000 and if he cannot save it out of the amount of money he is getting out of the main Budget of this year, then he is no longer fit to occupy the position of Minister for Finance.  If these reliefs which he has given can only be given by taxing what I said at the beginning is in many cases, the only comfort and, in most cases, the principal comfort which most of our old people have at the end of their lives then I would prefer to see the position left as it was.  May I remind the House, in order to give some indication of what is happening, that a few years ago the price of two ounces of plug tobacco was 1/7; now it is 4/-? May I again remind the House that when we talk about national and local taxation at the level at which it is under the present Government, and which is the main and the most significant factor in the cost of living, it is borne out here again? Four shillings for two ounces of tobacco.  The price of tobacco is probably about one shilling per ounce and the other three shillings go as tax to the present Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to appeal to the Minister to reconsider this imposition of an additional tax on tobacco.  Apart altogether from the case of the old age pensioners, I should like to draw the attention of the Minister and of the House to a very considerable section of the people on whom this burden will weigh very heavily.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the fact that the tendency of recent legislation is to retire men at 65 years of age when previously they were entitled, if they had the health and the physique to do so, to work up to 70 years of age.  These men, say, on the Great Northern Railway, Córas Iompair Éireann, and other large firms, are being retired at 65 years of age. They may retire on a small pension of, say, 10/- or 12/- per week.  Being only 65 years of age they are, naturally, not entitled to the old age pension.  Very often these people find themselves in the position overnight, so to speak, of being reduced to an income of 10/- or 12/- a week when previously they were enjoying a weekly income of anything from £4 to £6.  These people have now to pay this terrible price for an ounce of tobacco.  I would ask the Minister to consider that section of our people &mdash;and they are very considerable in number at the moment.  Deputy David knows that.  These people have reared large families, possibly most of whom have got married, and they are getting very little income from them.  In the majority of cases, possibly, very little money has been saved because it took all their earnings previous to their retirement to keep themselves and their families in anything approaching a decent cost of living level.  I speak on behalf of that section which, as the Minister himself knows well, is a very considerable section &mdash; especially in Dundalk.  A large number of men on the Great Northern Railway who are at present retired on a very small pension will feel the impact of this extra tax on what is regarded to be not a luxury, but a comfort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is vain to hope that the gentleman of the ascetic tastes and the Minister for Finance would understand how ordinary mortals such as old age pensioners and persons <Col N="1027" /> in receipt of low incomes manage to live and to provide themselves with the frugal luxuries which they are permitted to-day on their slender incomes. I think this tax on tobacco, particularly on the cheaper ranges of tobacco, is going to impose a very real hardship on the ordinary man in this country who is on a low scale of income and that it is going to be particularly hard in respect of old age pensioners.  In the case of the old age pensioner who goes into the Post Office on a Friday, collects there the miserable 12/6 which he gets under our old age pension legislation, it has been the custom, perhaps, after collecting the money to have a pint of beer and to buy his weekly supply of tobacco&mdash;perhaps two ounces of tobacco.  Nobody will say that that is an unreasonable form of recreation to be indulged in by an old age pensioner. Nobody will say that it is unreasonable for him, on the day he collects the old age pension, to buy a pint of beer and also, perhaps, two ounces of tobacco.  Yet, under this legislation which we are now being asked to enact he simply cannot do that because of the burden which this taxation will impose on his slender income.  Whatever justification the Minister may have for taxing luxuries such as cigars which are consumed by wealthy people&mdash;I am prepared to back the tax on cigars on the understanding that those who receive low incomes will be permitted to get their tobacco free from any additional taxation&mdash;I think he is acting unreasonably in imposing a tax on tobacco which he must know, as every ordinary man and woman in the country does know, has long ceased to be a luxury so far as the ordinary mortals in this country are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know, of course, that we have a rather mystic and ascetic variety of individuals who cannot understand why ordinary flesh should succumb to the wiles of tobacco, and why an ordinary person should indulge in the luxury of a pint of beer after the weekly or daily grind.  The fact remains that that is our pattern of life.  The masses of our people do that.  They are now being asked to do it in circumstances which will impose real hardship on them because, side by side with <Col N="1028" /> the additional taxation on tobacco and beer, they are being told by the Government that they must submit themselves to a wages standstill order, the effect of which, calculated on what we know from Government statements, is to endeavour to prevent persons in that position from improving their incomes in order to meet the new higher level of taxation and we have had statements from the Government benches that nothing can be done in the way of increasing old age pensions. The Taoiseach, according to a statement of his on Sunday last, does not intend to increase them because it would mean taking taxation out of the pockets of the people.  Taxation is being taken out of the pockets of the masses of the people under the Resolution we are being asked to enact.</P>
    <P>If this country were in a state of financial prostration, of agricultural and industrial chaos, one might understand the Minister being driven to extremes in raising money to meet the national housekeeping bill but that is not the case.  There are abundant sources from which the Minister can secure his additional taxation if such additional taxation is necessary.  I said before&mdash;the truth probably will bear repetition&mdash;that about 18 months ago the Minister handed back £3½ millions in the form of excess corporation profits tax.  That was done by the Minister in the pious hope that the effect of handing it back would be to reduce the price of commodities. The Minister by now must have abundant evidence that the handing back of that £3½ millions to what can only be described as a wealthy stratum of taxpayers, has not had the effect of reducing prices.  In fact, prices have risen more rapidly since that £3½ millions were paid back than at any time during the previous eight years.</P>
    <P>If the £3,500,000 was handed back in a pathetic belief that it would reduce prices, the Minister's hopes in that respect were based on extremely sandy foundation.  That money is available still.  The class who previously paid it and who have now got it back are still capable of bearing that additional taxation without its involving the slightest <Col N="1029" /> encroachment on their standard of living.  Why then do not we expect that stratum of the population, whose backs are broad and who are well upholstered financially, to make a contribution on an occasion like this in the form of additional taxation so as to obviate recourse to additional taxation on tobacco which, because of human usage and our pattern of life, has become an absolute essential for the masses of the people?</P>
    <P>The Minister on the occasion of his Budget speech had a simple recipe for those who find the additional taxation on tobacco and beer arduous.  It is as follows: If in the past you have taken a pint a day, that is seven pints in the week, take six pints in the week in future, in order to adjust yourself to this crazy type of Budget.  He had another recipe, dazzling in its simplicity, for those who use tobacco.  For every six cigarettes you are used to consuming, if you consume only five in future, everything will go on all right. The Minister might have gone further and suggested to those people that when they were ordering a pint of beer or an ounce of tobacco, they should ask the retailer to put out the lights and buy in the dark so that they would not know what they were getting.  Is the Minister so hopelessly divorced from the feelings of the people as not to know that you cannot suggest that pattern of life to our people?  That is something that they are not used to. They have a right to expect that on an occasion like this the Minister would survey the nation's resources and tax the backs that are broad enough to bear it.</P>
    <P>During the emergency we raised £3½ millions in the form of excess corporation profits tax.  It was given back, for nothing, as a gift to people well endowed with this world's goods. We are now raking taxation out of the pockets of the people who are not able to bear this imposition.  I would suggest to the Minister that he ought even now to say to those to whom he has given a very generous gift in the form of remitted excess corporation profits tax that they must yield up that taxation, because in our circumstances it is most <Col N="1030" /> unreasonable and unfair that tobacco and the ordinary pint of beer, which have been the right of the masses of the people for generations, should be taxed to the extent that they are being taxed in this Supplementary Budget. The wealthy classes in the community, who have escaped the devastation of war and who saw their property protected by the ordinary working-class people who joined the Army, ought to be glad to yield up their surplus wealth, their unwanted money, some of their deposits in the bank, in order to express even in token form the gratitude which they have a right to feel for the whole nation and for the masses of the people who comprised the nation's Army during the emergency.  Yet, in this Resolution the Minister is putting his hand down as far as he can get it into the pockets of the ordinary working-class people, the ordinary agricultural worker, the small farmer, the artisan and general labourer, while the wealthy classes are escaping relatively scot-free under this Budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister's concern in his Budget statement was for the lowly and the weak.  It strikes me that the Minister's concern in this matter is the kind of concern a greyhound has for a rabbit. The imposition of this taxation is unfair so long as there are other sources of wealth which can be tapped, even if we were again to tap excess corporation profits.  We ought to tax excess profits.  We ought to rake off every halfpenny of excess profits in a crisis of this kind.  While that course is open the Minister ought not hesitate to take it, and thus avoid the imposition of these new taxes on the masses of the people who are not equipped to bear them.</P>
    <P>Apart from excess corporation profits tax there are other sources of taxation. There is an abundance of luxuries in this country which are being purchased by those who are going scot-free under this Budget.  The Minister is not without resources for making them pay, in the national interest, a higher price for these luxuries, many of which are bought in dollar countries and the purchase of which contributes to our financial difficulties.  So long as these sources of taxation are available it is <Col N="1031" /> most unreasonable that the Minister should seek to impose on the ordinary people this additional taxation in the form of extra duties on tobacco and beer.</P>

      <P>During the excessively cold weather last winter I stopped to talk to a poor road worker who was having his lunch on the side of the road. His lunch consisted of three slices of bakers' bread and tea heated in a can. After his lunch he filled his pipe.  I asked him how much tobacco he used and he said about six ounces a week and that it took some management to make six ounces last the week.  I have the greatest sympathy with that man, working hard, away from home, inadequately fed, because of the conditions under which food had to be carried and cooked.  His only comfort was the pipe which enabled him to continue his work for the remainder of the day.  A person in that position will receive a benefit of about 6d. from the various subsidies provided in the Budget but the tax on tobacco alone will cost him an extra 2/- a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know, how does the Minister justify such an imposition upon the ordinary manual worker on any principle of fairplay, justice, or Christianity?  If the Minister thinks that people ought to be weaned off tobacco completely it would, I suppose, be far more equitable to set about some rationing system rather than impose this unjust burden. If he thinks that we are sending too much money out of the country for tobacco, and thereby using up our dollar resources, then surely it would be more reasonable to embark upon a scheme for the home-growing of tobacco.  This tax cannot be justified, no matter what angle it is viewed from. If taxation must be raised from some source, we ought to distribute the burden equitably as between the poor and the rich.  I do not suppose that, by indirect taxation, you can spread the burden equitably over all sections. There is no reason, however, why the excess corporation profits tax should have been removed.  If people make excess profits during a period of emergency <Col N="1032" /> it is only right that they should contribute portion of them to the State. That would be preferable to what, in reality, amounts to a direct tax on the poor and the working classes.  If an additional levy of 2/- were imposed upon the household of every small farmer and agricultural worker it would not be in the least bit more harsh than this additional levy on tobacco.  It is nonsense to say that the ordinary middle-aged man, who has been accustomed to consuming a certain amount of tobacco every day, can cut down his consumption at the present time.</P>
    <P>I think this is an infamous proposal on the part of the Minister, and that it shows a complete disregard for the rights and feelings of our people.  If we think that the poor working-man can do without the luxury of a smoke each day, then surely the Government could have done without the luxury of an inflated Army, of a make-believe Navy and of an expensive Viceregal Lodge which caters, as was revealed last week, for crooks.  This is a very serious matter for every section of the community, because it shows such a callous disregard, on the part of the Government, for the rights and interests of the people who maintain this State and produce its food and fuel that it must inevitably create widespread discontent.  I think that is the last thing we should be creating at the present time.  Instead, we ought to be giving to those who are so essential to the State&mdash;the workers on the land, in the bogs and in the factories&mdash;every incentive and encouragement to carry on their good work.  In the proposal before us we are simply trying to outrage their sense of justice and to impose upon them a crushing and unjustifiable burden.</P>

      <P>This Resolution purports to relieve the people generally of a certain amount of expenditure and to bring down the cost of living.  I do not believe it is going to achieve its object. The opinion generally held through the country is that it will have the opposite effect.  The Minister has expressed the view that if people would only give up certain luxuries they would realise the benefits which this tax would confer on them.  I should like to hear him <Col N="1033" /> explain what is the real dividing line between a necessity and a luxury.  It is a rather moot question.  Most people take a cup of tea in the morning and in the evening.  Is the drinking of a cup of tea a greater necessity for them than, say, the drinking of a pint of stout is for a docker who is engaged on dusty work, unloading coal, on a summer's day?  I think many would say that the drinking of a cup of tea by myself, or others, is not as great a necessity for us as the pint of stout is for the docker engaged in that class of employment.  Will the Minister say that there is any more food value in the cup of tea than there is in the pint of stout?  I am not speaking here for the purpose of encouraging intemperance. I am making an argument as between what is a necessity and what is a luxury.  I believe myself that the pint of stout, taken in moderation, is more of a necessity for the working-man than the cup of tea is for the many people who indulge in it.  I can speak with some freedom on this because I do not take any intoxicating drink.  I do know, however, that for a great section of the community, especially those doing heavy work, a pint of stout is a necessity.</P>

      <P>Well, the case of tobacco is even worse.  I wonder did the Minister ever read the popular story <i>Three Men in a Boat.</i>  If he did not, I suggest that he should get a copy of it and read and digest the dedication in it.  A pipe of tobacco is, to many men in the country, a necessity.  We have many men engaged on heavy arduous work which imposes a great strain on their nervous system.  We have, too, many harassed women, and the smoking of a mild cigarette has become a necessity for them.  We all know that there are many men and women who, having done a hard day's work, like to smoke either a pipe of tobacco or a cigarette after the evening meal.  They find that it helps to calm their nerves.  They could hardly call it the end of a perfect day unless they could indulge in a smoke.  I am sure that 90 per cent. of Deputies are <Col N="1034" /> smokers and they can realise what it would mean if they were suddenly to be cut off smoking or had to reduce it drastically.  I myself know something of the misery of it, because up to a year or so ago I was probably one of the heaviest smokers in this State.  I know what the sudden cutting off of smoking means to any person.  I know what it will mean to an unfortunte old age pensioner who smokes probably two ounces of tobacco of the lowest quality per week when he has to spend 4/- out of his 12/6 pension for tobacco that has become a necessity to him.  It is practically an impossibility for an old age pensioner who has been smoking probably for 50 years to give it up.  The Minister suggested that if he dropped his pipe he would gain by the relief on tea and sugar.  Is the Minister sure that if an old age pensioner got his choice between taking the relief on two ounces of tea or on two ounces of tobacco which he would choose?  I believe that the majority of the smokers would choose the two ounces of tobacco.</P>
      <P>It is ridiculous to suggest that the cost of living will be greatly reduced by the reliefs set out on rationed articles, such as two ounces of tea, three-quarters of a lb. of sugar, and a stone of flour per week.  If the Minister wants to give reliefs so as to bring down the cost of living, I am not afraid to say that I would prefer that he should not give them in the manner proposed.  I believe that the general run of people in this country, particularly the poor, would be more satisfied to be left as they were rather than be bamboozled with the suggestion that they are getting relief which they are not getting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various suggestions were made as to how this particular relief could be given other than in the manner in which the Minister proposes to tax the people. It has been suggested that a bigger tax could be put on excess profits.  If there are real excess profits, I believe that they should be taxed to the limit, if it is necessary to tax anything, and that real luxuries should be taxed.  The Minister can call to mind a great many luxuries other than tobacco and the cheaper brands of cigarettes or the pint <Col N="1035" /> of stout.  I suggest that a large share of this money could be found by taxing real luxuries.  I believe the bulk of the people are dissatisfied with this particular method of financing these reliefs and, in saying that, I am only giving expression to the voice of my constituents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to endorse the protest made by the previous speakers against this iniquitous tax on the poor. All the speakers have dealt with the callousness of inflicting this hardship on the most helpless section of the community&mdash;the old age and blind pensioners, the old citizens who have given of their best to the State, to whom a good deal of lip sympathy is paid but who seem to be singled out vindictively by the imposition of this tax.  Tobacco is their one luxury and it is now being placed completely beyond their reach.  It would take a very strong reason to justify such an action on the part of the Minister.  He has not vouchsafed any explanation, because, apparently, he has no explanation.  I think it would be difficult to give any explanation which would warrant or justify such a low, vindictive measure against a helpless section of the community in their declining years when they have only a miserable stipend to live on.  As Deputy Morrissey pointed out, one-fifth of their basic income will have to be paid for one ounce of tobacco per week, while two ounces would be the minimum that an old man would require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of it with which I am concerned, because it affects the working-man and the unemployed man who has to go to the labour exchange and whose one solace is his pipe.  Such a man can scarcely afford a pint in future.  It is a savage infliction on him to deny him tobacco, which is his one solace.  Then there are the agricultural workers and the small farmers who are our main producers. We are asking them for increased production and anything that would militate against that would be a very lopsided economy on the part of the Government.  The Minister may think that depriving the old age pensioner, <Col N="1036" /> the unemployed worker, and the lowly-paid worker of their tobacco will prevent inflation.  Many attempts have been made in the past to prevent inflation at the expense of old age pensioners and others.  I am very much afraid that you will reduce productivity on the land by this tax.  It takes a combination of factors to bring about good production on the land.  One of them, I contend, is contented and happy workmen.  During the emergency a call went out for more productivity on the land and that was contributed to by the loyalty and co-operation of the farm workers and the small farmer producers.  If you deprive the man who is ploughing with a pair of horses of his smoke you will not get the same return from his work.</P>
    <P>I have experience of these workingmen in the rural areas and I know their habits.  I suggest that if you deprive them of their smoke, their activities on the land will be very seriously curtailed, and that applies both to the employer and the worker.  It will have a reaction and be reflected in reduced production.  Already, they have been deprived of their pint of porter.  If they are also deprived of their smoke, it will militate against increased production.  I am sure the Minister cannot be so far removed from the plain people as not to know that there are thousands of people in the country who would prefer a smoke to their breakfast.  If the alternative was put up to them, they would take the smoke rather than the breakfast. I am serious in making the suggestion that this imposition will be reflected in reduced production on the land. That may make more of an appeal to the Minister than the human element. If the Minister makes inquiries from agricultural inspectors as to whether this will have any retarding influence on agricultural production, I believe he will find that what I say is correct, that the tax on tobacco, apart from the hardship it will inflict on the old age and blind pensioners and the unemployed, will have a reaction on the land workers which will not be to the benefit of the country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister showed his appreciation of the situation <Col N="1037" /> on a former occasion by excluding plugs and twist tobaccos from the increased taxation.  I should like to know the circumstances in which the Government feels that it should reverse itself now and to impose this increased taxation on these tobaccos.  I have no objection whatever to the people who are inclined to smoke the luxury tobaccos, cigars and cigarettes, being taxed to the limit.  Might I ask the Minister this question: What would be the cost of excluding plug and twist tobaccos from this increased taxation?  This tax, as Deputy Keyes has said, represents 9d. per week on the two ounces of tobacco purchased by the old man, the young man working on the farm, the artisan, the shoemaker, the tailor and the blacksmith like himself and myself, and I cannot for the life of me see why the Government should want to reverse itself now.  Why not exclude these types again?  On that occasion, they boasted that it was in the interest of the poorer citizen and designed to assist the old age pensioner and the other classes I have mentioned.  I suggest, without wishing to score any point whatever, that the Government would be well advised to pursue the opposite course and to remit this taxation. There is a huge sum of money to be got from it&mdash;£1,960,000&mdash;but I should like to know what it would cost to take the tax off plug and twist tobaccos.  I suggest that the more it costs, the greater the need for taking it off, because that greater sum is being extracted from the poorest elements in the community.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce was quite clear in his speech as to one of the main motives for imposing this tax.  At column 566 of the Official Report of October 16th he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Let it be clear that if it should involve a reduction in the consumption of tobacco it means a further saving of dollars, which is important in our circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The saving of dollars at the expense of the worker in order to provide nylon stockings for her ladyship is not, in my opinion, what one would expect from the poor man's Government in this country, and it shows how far the Government have departed from the doctrines and gospels they preached in <Col N="1038" /> 1929, 1930, 1931, and so on.  I appeal to the Minister to consider exempting plug and twist tobaccos, even at the expense of increasing the tax on others, if it is a matter of getting the money.  If it is a matter of saving dollars, it would be right to make it impossible for us to smoke any tobacco at all and let that be the sacrifice the people have to make for the saving of dollars in order to get essentials.  They must, however, be essentials and not knick-knacks like nylon stockings.  I have been informed by a trader in this city that he could get dollars to buy nylon stockings but could not get dollars to buy tractors. That is not at all as it should be.  Here we have this poor man's Government taking the pipe of tobacco from the old age pensioner after 15 years.  That is the best they can offer.  If they were able to say that they were giving him another pipeful and another pint of stout, instead of taking them from him, it would be something, but, after 15 years, the best they can do for the poor people is to grab the smoke and the pint from them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>If this tax and one or two other taxes&mdash;unnecessary taxes, as I suggest&mdash;are being imposed for the purpose of saving dollars, the Minister should frankly say so.  He has been very frank with the House on many occasions and that is to his credit. Whether this tax is being imposed for that purpose or not, I feel fully satisfied, from contacts with my constituents since the Budget was introduced, that it will result in a considerable reduction of the consumption of tobacco, especially in rural areas.  It is bound to have that effect in the case of the old age pensioner, but, apart from that, in the case of all those trying to live on low incomes, I suggest that the reduction in the circulation of money which is bound to follow the bad harvest this year will, in itself, help to reduce consumption, because this is a commodity which cannot be secured by the people in rural areas without cash and if there is a reduction in the circulation of cash in the case of any particular section in the rural areas, it is bound to affect the consumption of tobacco.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1039" /> This tax is one of the taxes which is to bring in a very high proportion of the total revenue to be derived on the passage of this Supplementary Budget, for the purpose, as alleged, of reducing the cost of living.  I had a question down to-day as to whether the reduction in the prices of bread, tea and sugar will be followed by a reduction in the prices charged to people who stay in hotels, guest-houses or ordinary lodging-houses.  The reply of the Minister for Industry and Commerce conveyed clearly to me that there is to be no reduction in the prices charged to such people.  A very big section of unmarried young men and women who work in the Civil Service, in public companies and in manufacturing concerns, are obliged to stay in lodginghouses or guest-houses and they are to get no benefit whatever, according to the Minister, from the reduction in the prices of these commodities.  Therefore, this is an additional tax, so far as they are concerned, if they smoke cigarettes or a pipe.</P>
    <P>I have no personal prejudices in this matter because I have not smoked a cigarette or pipe for 34 or 35 years.  I took a pledge to myself and it is one of the pledges I took which I have been able to keep.  I have taken other pledges which I may have forgotten, but I say quite definitely and without any political prejudice that the imposition of this tax will reduce consumption and the Minister will not get the revenue he estimates.  Is it a fact or not that following the conversations with his opposite number in England, the Chancellor of the Exchequer&mdash;the first conversation, I presume, he had with a British Chancellor&mdash;he has been advised&mdash;I do not say &ldquo;instructed&rdquo;&mdash; to reduce his applications for dollars from the British pool and that this is one of the ways in which he intends to carry out any undertaking he may have given in that respect, so that he will be able to go back and meet the Chancellor next Monday or Tuesday and tell him that whatever promises he made in this connection will be honoured by the passage of this Supplementary Budget, and, in particular, so far as it effects a tax on tobacco?</P>

      <P>As I have already said, I do not propose on the Report Stage on these Resolutions to enter into a general debate on the whole financial policy of the State.  There are appropriate occasions for doing that when the Budget is being discussed, but one of these occasions is not when particular Resolutions are being considered. I hope that by the time we come to the Second Stage of the Finance Bill, Deputy Norton will explain to me why he makes these wild charges against the Government for abolishing the excess corporation profits tax, which was exactly what the British Labour&mdash; L-a-b-o-u-r&mdash;Government did.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is advising me every day in the week to do what they are doing over in England but when I propose here in the Dáil to do what they have done in England&mdash;to take off the excess corporation profits. tax&mdash;Deputy Norton goes round the country and comes in here to the Dáil and says it is some blooming capitalist conspiracy.  If it is a capitalist conspiracy here, why was it not a capitalist conspiracy in England?  The Deputy can think over that and let me know the result of his cogitations on the Second Reading of the Finance Bill. He also alleges that this modest increase of 4d. per ounce on tobacco is another capitalist conspiracy against the working man.  If it is, how does he explain the 3/8 for plug tobacco in England?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <P>I hope that Deputy Norton will be able to explain the inconsistency of his Party's attitude in regard to these matters, on the Second Reading of the Finance Bill.  Deputy Bennett and Deputy Keyes said that this was a low vindictive measure&mdash; another extension of Deputy Norton's capitalist conspiracy theory.  I want to say that I am very sorry to have to put a tax on tobacco&mdash;very sorry indeed.  If we had not to get the money, I would not have put it on.  We did not go very far with it.  In order to avoid putting a higher tax on tobacco, we brought forward a number of other taxation proposals.  I pointed out previously that if a person felt that he was badly hit by this increase of 4d. per packet on cigarettes, or if it were going to lessen his ability to support himself or his family, he could avoid paying any more for tobacco if he smoked only five cigarettes in future where he formerly smoked six.  That is the plain mathematics of the proposal. It is no capitalist conspiracy, I assure Deputy Norton.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want just to ask one question.  I understand that the duty on tobacco is charged on the raw leaf before it is released to the factory. That means that many of the tobacco manufacturers had in stock a quantity of raw leaf on which they previously paid a certain rate of duty and it would take a few weeks after the release of that raw leaf from bond to the factory before the tobacco or cigarettes would be made available to the retailer and the customer.  If that is the position, will the Minister tell us why it was necessary for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to authorise higher prices for cigarettes and tobacco when, in fact, the tobacco in respect of which these higher charges were being made had been released from bond at a lower rate of taxation than that which is charged under this Resolution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is customary for tobacco manufacturers, I understand, to draw out their tobacco about once a fortnight.  If they have a certain carry-over, a few days' supply of tobacco on hands, when they make their draw on the bonded stores, they are that much to the good if the tax is increased.  But if the rates are decreased they have to stand the loss. That has been the custom generally. It simply means that when a new tax is imposed you have not to have a whole horde of officials running into every tobacco manufacturing concern in the country, into every wholesale premises and every retail shop to collect the correct amount of extra tax. The business community take advantage of that to put up their prices immediately, when there is no price control.  They gain something when taxes are rising but they also lose when taxes are falling.  I hope that some day or another soon, if the world swings that way, the individuals who gain now because of an increase in the tobacco will lose because of a decrease in taxation.</P>

    <P>(3)  That paragraph (c) of sub-section (3)  of Section 11 of the Finance Act, 1936 (No. 31 of 1936), shall, as respects entertainments duty (within the meaning of the said Section 11) paid on payments, made on or after the 16th day of January, 1948, for admission to an entertainment in any such theatre as is mentioned in the said sub-section (3), have effect as if, for the words &ldquo;thirty per cent. of the said duty&rdquo; (inserted by sub-section (3) of Section 10 of the Finance Act, 1947), there were substituted the words &ldquo;fifteen per cent. of the said duty.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to oppose this fresh imposition.  I do not share the view that is taken, apparently, by certain sections to be the popular view, that the cinema is an unmitigated evil and that people should be discouraged from attending.  I do not subscribe for one moment to what we often hear said by certain people in this House and very often hear from the Bench, that whatever demoralisation there is in the country, and particularly amongst <Col N="1046" /> the youth, can be traced directly and entirely to the influence of the cinema.</P>
      <P>I look upon the average cinematograph performance as a very legitimate type&mdash;and prior to this year a very cheap type&mdash;of enjoyment for our people, and particularly for the poorer sections.  I remember many years ago seeing in <i>Dublin Opinion</i> a drawing of a cinema in the back streets of the city and a queue of obviously very poor people, in clothing that was rather ragged, waiting for admission; and there was just one word under the drawing&mdash;&ldquo;Escape&rdquo;.  To a great many people in our cities and towns, a cheap seat in a warm, comfortable cinema for two and a half or three hours is two and a half or three hours' escape from the sordid conditions under which they have to live at home.</P>
      <P>Remember the additional taxes, which it is sought to impose under this Resolution that we are now considering, are not confined to the more expensive seats in the cinema.  Proportionately, the tax on the cheapest of the seating is higher and, needless to mention, will bear more heavily on those who are forced to occupy the cheapest seats.  Where the payment for admission does not exceed 5d., the rate of duty is to be 3d.; where it does not exceed 6d., the duty is to be 4d.; where it does not exceed 8d., the duty is to be 6d., and where it does not exceed 1/- the duty is to be 9d.  I venture to say that there are very few members in this House who have occupied a cheaper seat than a shilling one.  If the Minister tried to make a case for this particular imposition, he would find it hard to do so.  It is hard to justify it, particularly on the very cheapest seats.  It is all right for the Minister to say that those people need not go, just as he said they can drink a pint or a bottle of stout less in the week or smoke a packet less cigarettes or an ounce less tobacco.  The people are entitled to some relaxation after a day's work and, even if we have to mulct posterity, whatever relaxation the poor have ought not to be further restricted.  People who are compelled by their financial circumstances to go into the 5d., 6d. and 8d. seats have not a choice of a wide variety of enjoyments, fixtures or functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> I venture to say&mdash;and I can speak with some knowledge and authority on this matter&mdash;that after labouring in a working-class home from 7 o'clock in the morning to 12 o'clock at night, struggling to rear a family on a wage that cannot keep pace with the cost of living, a woman's sole relaxation is perhaps one visit, or two at the outside, to the local cinema each week. Surely, a woman who is working in surroundings which some of us can visualise, from one end of the week to the other, Sunday and Monday, providing for her husband and her family, is entitled to some relaxation, without being penalised in the way proposed in this Resolution.</P>
    <P>I do not look upon the cinema, certainly as regards the cheaper seats, as being a luxury.  Unless the very poor, those who are struggling from one end of the year to the other to make ends meet, on a comparatively low wage, are to be deprived entirely of any little enjoyment, we should not seek to impose this particular tax on them.  I am just as much opposed to this, even more opposed to it, than to some of the other taxes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise the question of an agreement arrived at between some of the cinema operators and the Revenue Commissioners, to increase the tax for the cheapest seats in picture houses.  I think that last year, in that case, permission for an increase by 2d. was given.  Under this Budget, is the Minister going to sanction a further increase now?  Is he going to sanction a further increase now in the arrangement between the Revenue Commissioners and these people in regard to the cheaper seats to compel the people to pay 8d. instead of 6d.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to Deputy Everett's question, it is not the Revenue Commissioners who fix the price of seats in cinemas.  What we are doing in this Resolution is that if a certain amount is charged for a seat the tax will be the amount set out in the Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey says that the tax on the cheaper seats is proportionately <Col N="1048" /> higher than the tax on the dearer seats. That is not so.  The tax on the very cheap seats is nil.  Up to 4d. it is nothing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <P>We are not getting very much assistance from the Minister. It has always been customary in matters like imposing a heavy taxation that <Col N="1050" /> the proposals and the effect of the proposed taxation would be explained, particularly when we had a procedure such as we had on this occasion when the House agreed, in view of the fact-that we had speeches from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, not to discuss these Resolutions on the day on which they were introduced.  That was something which the House agreed to but the Minister, notwithstanding that, is not prepared to give us very much help.  Am I right in assuming that this is the Resolution which is going to increase the price of the pink of stout and porter by 3d. and the price of the bottle by 1½d.?</P>

      <P>I do not want to delay the House on this question because we have had this matter before, and we probably know more about it and its. effects.  I am perfectly satisfied that the Minister will know more about it before the Second Stage of the Finance Bill is reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am opposing this Resolution for the same reason that I opposed the increase in the price of cinema seats.  I do not look on a pint of stout or porter or a bottle of stout as a luxury in the same way as some members of the Government apparently do.  I want to remind the House that on an occasion many years ago a very distinguished member of the medical profession stated in this House that for men engaged in laborious work&mdash;particularly, manual labour&mdash;a pint or two pints of stout in the day would be of benefit to them and was to be commended rather than decried, so long as. the practice was not abused.  He confined <Col N="1053" /> the allowance, more or less, to a couple of pints per day.  It is idle for us to pretend that an increase in the cost of the pint or bottle of stout or ounce of tobacco or packet of cigarettes will not affect the cost of living of the average person.  Of course, it will.  We are merely pretending when we suggest that it will not.  About 95 per cent. of the adults of this country&mdash; the ordinary, normal people&mdash;smoke or drink or go to the pictures or do two out of these things or all of them.  The price of these things definitely enters into their cost of living.  So long as the habit is not abused, I think it should enter into the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The Minister may make the case that, in order to give these food subsidies, it was necessary to impose additional taxation.  Could the money not be found out of savings from the already heavy taxation in force?  We might be prepared to grant that to the Minister as justification for the increase of duty on wine or even on whiskey.  We might say that whiskey <Col N="1054" /> or any other class of spirits should be regarded as luxury drinks, to be indulged in only by people able to pay for them.  Beer&mdash;or stout and porter, as we know the drink in this country&mdash; is in a different category.  I am opposed to this Resolution because it will have a very detrimental effect on the cost of living.  Whether the House or the Minister likes it or not, it will affect the household budget to a very substantial extent.  I do not want to go over the grounds again on which I am opposed to the Resolution.  If one person out of a household takes a pint of stout or beer per day or two bottles of stout&mdash; which is not an abuse&mdash;it will mean 1/9 per week to him in additional taxation. Apart from the increase in the price of tobacco and in cinema prices, that will go a long way to wipe out whatever little relief is given by way of the subsidies for which, we are told, these additional taxes are imposed.</P>

    <P>(a)  the person who becomes entitled to the entire beneficial interest in the property (or, where more than one person becomes entitled to a beneficial interest therein, each of them) is either&mdash;</P>

    <P>(v)  a person lawfully carrying on a business which comes within the provisions of any paragraph of sub-section (1) of Section 9 of the Control of Manufactures Act, 1934 (No. 36 of 1934), or</P>
    <P>(vi)  a body corporate incorporated in the State after the 15th day of October, 1947, where the issued shares of each class are, to an extent exceeding one-half (in nominal value) thereof, in the beneficial ownership of persons <Col N="1058" /> each of whom is within one of clauses (i) to (v) of this sub-paragraph,</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>(b)  the instrument contains a certificate to that effect by the party to whom the property is being conveyed or transferred.</P>
    <P>(5)  That in any case in which, by virtue of paragraph (4) of this Resolution, the provisions of paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of this Resolution have no effect, the stamp duties chargeable on conveyances or transfers of lands, tenements and hereditaments under the heading &ldquo;Conveyance or Transfer on sale of any property&rdquo; in the First Schedule to the Stamp Act, 1891, as amended by subsequent enactments, shall, on and after the 1st day of December, 1947, be at the rate (in this Resolution referred to as the higher rate) of £25 per cent. of the amount or value of the consideration in lieu of the rates immediately theretofore chargeable.</P>
    <P>(6)  That this Resolution shall apply to any conveyance or transfer of lands, tenements and hereditaments operating as a voluntary disposition <i>inter vivos</i>, and reference in this Resolution to the amount or value of any consideration shall be construed in relation to duty chargeable on such conveyance or transfer as a reference to the value of the property.</P>
    <P>(7) (a)  That this paragraph shall apply to every conveyance or transfer of lands, tenements and hereditaments, whether on sale or operating as a voluntary disposition <i>inter vivos</i>, unless the person becoming entitled to the entire beneficial interest in the property, or, where more than one person becomes entitled to a beneficial interest in the property, each of them, is within one of clauses (i) to (vi) of sub-paragraph (a) of paragraph (4) of this Resolution.</P>
    <P>(b)  That if, at the expiration of 30 days after the execution thereof, a conveyance or transfer to which this paragraph applies is not stamped or is not stamped at the higher rate, a sum equal to twice the amount of the duty at the <Col N="1059" /> higher rate shall thereupon be a debt due to the Minister for Finance for the benefit of the Central Fund by the person to whom the property is thereby conveyed or transferred, or in case there is more than one such person, by such persons jointly and severally, and shall be payable to the Revenue Commissioners, and the said sum shall be recoverable at the suit of the Attornery General in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, this Resolution relates to the stamp duty on the transfer of property.  I want to make it clear that the increased rate of stamp duty will not apply where local authorities provide houses for tenant purchasers or where a public utility society builds a house and sells it to one of its members.  That is usually done with no profit taken by the society.  In the Finance Bill I will introduce amendments in order to clarify that position and in order to ensure that there will be no alteration in the rate of stamp duty on houses built either by local authorities for tenant purchasers or by public utility societies for sale with no profit to their own members.  Another point which I propose to introduce in the Finance Bill is an amendment relating to the voluntary transfer of property by people who, during their lifetime, wish to transfer their lands to sons or to other lineal descendants of themselves or to a brother or sister.  In such cases the rate of stamp duty that will apply will be the same as that which applied heretofore.  The stamp duty does not affect transfers made in consideration of marriage.  The fixed duty on that will continue to be the 10/- per cent. no matter what the amount of property transferred.</P>
    <P>Another point which has been raised by some professional organisations and by the legal profession is the difficulty that there might be in certain cases of completing the execution of a sale, which was in course of being made, before the first day of December.  I have consulted the Revenue Commissioners and we have come to this arrangement: if the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1060" /> are notified that a contract was entered into before this day&mdash;the 29th of October&mdash;and where they are satisfied that a contract had, in fact, been entered into before the 29th day of October, they are agreeable that the new rates of duty will not apply.</P>
    <P>I thought when introducing the Budget that giving up to the 1st day of December was sufficiently long to cover all current cases but the representatives of the solicitors' profession explained that in certain cases it might not be possible for them to complete all the documents of sale within that period.  If the Revenue Commissioners now get notification before the 1st day of December the new rate of duty will not apply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this mean if before the 1st December the Revenue Commissioners are notified of contracts entered into before the 29th October?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The situation is this, according to this Resolution: If a person could enter into a contract to buy on the 30th November and if he could complete all the documents, he could get a stamp for the old rate of duty.  I intended that that might take place in certain cases.  I thought a six-weeks' average time was sufficient to cover all these cases but it has been pointed out that there are certain cases in which there is difficulty about title and matters of that kind in which it cannot be done.</P>
      <P>The last difficulty which confronted me referred to the amount which becomes payable where a conveyance which attracted the higher rate of duty&mdash;£25 per cent.&mdash;was not stamped at this rate within 30 days of execution. It has been represented to me that this provision as it stands will have to be invoked where a simple delay, without any suggestion of evasion of duty, had occurred, possibly through illness or pressure of other work.  Under the existing law, when a penalty has been incurred through failure to stamp documents the Revenue Commissioners have power to mitigate or remit a penalty if they think fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On consideration I propose that these powers may be extended to cover the sum payable by a transferee who has <Col N="1061" /> not stamped his conveyance at the higher rate but the powers will extend only to those cases where the delay in stamping the conveyance did not exceed three months from the date of its first execution.  I think these cover the points of the amendments that I want to see introduced to the stamp duties.  The wider question to which Deputy Byrne's amendment related, I think, should be debated on the Finance Bill itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The indication that the Minister has given as to the amendments to this Resolution which will be given effect to by the Finance Bill goes to some extent to meet the objections that we have to the details of this Resolution but, of course, do not in any way affect or touch the principle embodied by the Resolution.  As I understand it, the question of allowing what might be called current cases to be dealt with on the old rate amounts to this, that any transaction that is in fact completed before the 1st December, 1947, whenever it was entered into, will still be liable to the old rate but that in respect of transactions where contracts would have been entered into before to-day's date, if they are not completed before the 1st December, 1947, they will still be subject to the old rate of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That latter case is, apparently, subject to some form of notification to the Revenue Commissioners. I do not know why there should be any such notification necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It facilitates the Revenue Commissioners in deciding whether in fact a contract was legitimately&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought that the best evidence that there was of contract would be the production of the written document with a 6d. stamp, or other appropriate stamp, thereon, on which a date is impressed by the revenue officials themselves.  However, <Col N="1062" /> that may be a matter about which the Minister may have more information than I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>May I explain to the Deputy?  On my instructions, the Revenue Commissioners met the representatives of the solicitors' profession, the Incorporated Law Society, and discussed this difficulty with them, and this is the conclusion they arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This is really a matter for solicitors to some extent but it is also a matter for clients, and if the Minister tells me that an agreement has been reached with the Incorporated Law Society, who represent solicitors, I must pay considerable respect to that. But it is a matter affecting, not merely solicitors and the profession, it is a matter that affects clients and it has been known that solicitors have forgotten to do certain things.  In fact, it has been frequently known that they forgot to do certain things.  So that, if a solicitor inadvertently forgot to give this notification may be the client would suffer even though there was a contract in existence.  I would like just to have the matter examined to see whether or not a statutory requirement of notification might not in certain circumstances work hardship on the clients.  Beyond that, I have nothing to say.  The indication the Minister has given meets one of the matters that I had intended to raise and was asked to raise, not by solicitors but by members of my own profession who in fact are engaged at the present time in clearing up titles, and there is no possibility that titles in reference to contracts which have been entered into months ago could be cleared by the 1st December, 1947. Mortgages are outstanding which cannot be got in and there are other matters of that kind.  However, the Minister has indicated his views on this matter and we will await the inspection and consideration of the proposals when we see them in print.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that voluntary settlements by elderly people were going to be given certain preferential treatment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards marriage settlements, I gather from the Minister that lands transferred or conveyed or assured in consideration of marriage are not affected by this because they do not come within the definition of conveyance or transfer of sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell me whether or not transfer of property by a father to his son on the occasion of his son's marriage which, in law at all events, is a voluntary conveyance, would come within the revenue definition of a conveyance in consideration of marriage?  Legally, it will not.  There is no consideration for the father transferring his lands to his son on his son's marriage but I want to be assured that that particular transaction will get the benefit of this proposed privilege because it is a matter of some considerable importance in the country and one to which I had intended to advert on this Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general principle, if I had any assurance or belief that the proposed increase in taxation on the transfer of property would have any possible effect in rendering it either cheaper or easier to purchase a house at a reasonable cost at the present time and in existing circumstances, I would be wholeheartedly in support of this Resolution. However, on such consideration as I have been able to give it, and on anything that I have been able to learn, these additional taxes will have no effect on those people who are inflating the purchase price of houses and of other dwellings with vacant possession on ordinary people at the present time. We know that there are such people, that they have an unlimited amount of money and that they are able to pay three, four and five times the ordinary market value of a house in order to secure vacant possession in existing circumstances. <Col N="1064" /> The additional £300 or £400 that will be imposed by this taxation will make little, if any, difference to those people, just as the additional percentage that is paid to auctioneers on these increased prices has, in the past, not made any difference to them in their efforts to buy houses.  But it will make a substantial difference to those people who are trying to buy a house at some sort of a reasonable rate at the present time.  If these taxes are continued after the demands of those rich people, the people who have money to spend and are prepared to spend it in purchasing a house at any price, have been fulfilled&mdash;as I suppose they must be fulfilled some time&mdash;it will render it still more impossible for people in ordinary circumstances to buy houses in which they wish to reside.  It will make it impossible for young people getting married to buy a house.  It is impossible for them to do so at present. There is not any hope for them in the immediate future, apart even from these additional stamp duties.  But if these taxes are continued beyond a certain period they will put it beyond the bounds for young people getting married, or of young people who have got married to purchase a house until they are grandmothers and grandfathers.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any justification for this increased taxation beyond producing revenue.  If it produces revenue from the people who are spilling out money at the present time in their avaricious desire to get house property at any price, then it is a good tax, but if it is merely intended to produce revenue, then it is a bad tax.  The situation in this country at the present time in regard to house property and the price of it&mdash;the possibility of getting clear possession of a house within the range of any ordinary income&mdash;is bleak in the last degree for those people who are looking for houses.  The number of houses that have been built is very much below the requirements of people at the present time.  Even such houses as are being built are being sold at exorbitant prices.  We know of one particular case where a builder built a house actually and was able to sell it at £X, giving himself a reasonable profit.  The person to whom he sold it, sold it a few weeks later for £X plus <Col N="1065" /> £Y hundreds of pounds, while he in turn sold it again for £X plus £Y plus £Z hundreds of pounds.  These additional taxes will not make any difference to the people with the moneybags. We may have our own views as to where they got the money, but it will not make any difference to them.  It will make a difference, however, to young people who have got married and are trying to get a house for themselves. The prospect for them is rendered hopeless indeed by the imposition of this new taxation.  I cannot see any justification in principle for it, and perhaps the Minister would reconsider some other method of getting the additional taxation that he requires. Since I believe that this additional taxation will result merely in making house property dearer and the provision of houses for people who have only limited means impossible, I think the Minister's proposals are unjustified.</P>

      <P>In cases where application is made to the Land Commission for the subdivision of holdings, we know that it sometimes takes from six to 12 months before the consent is received. I know that, in connection with two or three small farms in my constituency, applications under this head have been made to the Land Commission. They may not give their consent for two or three months.  I am asking the Minister to see that the Land Commission will certify to the Revenue Commissioners that these applications were made before October so that the applicants concerned will not be charged the higher rate of duty. The delay is not due to any fault of theirs, and hence I hope that what I suggest will be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to confine myself on this Resolution to this new imposition on our own nationals.  I intend to deal with the matter more fully on the Finance Bill.  I do not know what the Minister's intention was in increasing the stamp duty on our own nationals from 1 per cent. to 5 per cent. If he thought that by doing so he was going in any way to improve the housing situation in the country I can tell him that he is sadly mistaken.  If this is meant as a purely revenue tax, <Col N="1066" /> then I suggest to him that he ought to try to get his revenue from some source other than houses.  Anybody who knows anything about the housing position, the housing market or the property market will, I think, agree with me that so far as the lower priced property is concerned, particularly the lower priced houses, this tax will be paid entirely by the purchaser.  So far as the higher priced properties are concerned&mdash;I am speaking now of the £10,000, £15,000, £20,000 and £30,000 properties&mdash;if they are purchased by non-nationals the possibility is that they may pay some portion of these duties. Personally, what I think will happen is that it is the Irish nationals who are selling the properties who will be mulcted in the full 25 per cent. by a reduction in the price that they would otherwise get.</P>
      <P>I propose to confine myself to the housing position in the City of Dublin and the townships, and to the tremendous demand there is for any house ranging in price from £1,500 to £3,000. I shall confine myself to a narrower circle&mdash;to the house selling at between £1,500 and £2,500.  It is quite well known to everybody that at the present time, within ten or 15 miles of Dublin, it is impossible to get any sort of house at £1,500&mdash;that is, anything worth being called a house.  Let us take the case of the £2,000 house and the position of the man who is in a flat or in lodgings or who may be sharing part of a house with his parents or other relatives.  He is, say, thinking of getting married, and he intends to buy a house at £2,000, if he can get one.  In at least 90, if not 95 per cent. of these cases, anything up to a maximum of 80 per cent. of the price of the house has to be borrowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the man who has borrowed or saved £500 and wants to buy a £2,000 house.  If he succeeds in getting a house for £2,000, he gets the maximum loan from a building society of 80 per cent.  At the moment, that £500 will about see him through; it hardly will, but let us say it will.  A sum of £400 goes by way of deposit, and the other £1,600 is put up by the building society. The stamp duty is £20.  Deputy O'Connor, if he speaks on this, will <Col N="1067" /> probably be in a better position to inform the House about it than I am. I think the remaining £80 would put him through, or very near it.  What is his position if the stamp duty is increased to £100, or £80 more?  He cannot touch that type of house.  It probably means that that man will be at least another year trying to put together, by way of saving and skimping, that additional £80.  Is it not rather absurd that, on the one hand, we should be giving free grants to builders to build houses out of taxation and then, when they are built, tax the people who are trying to buy them?</P>
    <P>I can see no case, good, bad or indifferent, that can possibly be made for this increase.  It is a heavy impost upon people who are already the victims of the inflationary prices that houses have reached.  I have some idea of the terrific demand there is for houses.  We know that numbers of prospective fathers and mothers dare not have a family on pain of being expelled from the flat or room which they now occupy.  We know sad cases of young couples with a child or two who will not even be considered as occupants of flats or rooms in this city. We all know there is no such thing nowadays as a house to rent.  To-day a person who has not a house or a home has only one possible chance of getting a house or a home and that is by buying it in the open market.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that this will be a harsh tax, particularly in a country like this where, instead of putting any further obstacles in the way of people getting married, we should be trying to remove whatever obstacles there are as our marriage rate is so lamentably low.  I can see no earthly reason for this tax.  To me it seems to be only a revenue tax pure and simple.  If revenue has to be got, I suggest that this is the last place where the Minister should seek it.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister appreciates this matter as much as anybody else.  He probably knows, because it is rather notorious, of the great scarcity of houses, the huge number of people who are looking for houses and who are unable to get them.  You will not improve <Col N="1068" /> the position by increasing the stamp duty on those people who some day hope to own a home of their own.  I assure the Minister that, in my humble opinion anyway, so far as lower-priced properties are concerned, this is a tax that will hit, not the seller of the house or the property, but the purchaser and, God knows, he has already a heavy burden enough to bear.</P>

      <P>Let us examine that. There are two stamp duties.  My claim is that, in the case of the ordinary 5 <Col N="1069" /> per cent. rate, the vendors will pay it because purchasers are in competition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that a 25 per cent. stamp duty has to be paid by foreigners puts Irishmen in a better position to compete with them to the extent of 20 per cent.  Take the £2,000 house that Deputy Morrissey mentioned. The Irishman who can either borrow or save £2,000 at the present time pays £20 stamp duty on such a house.  If he has only £2,000 or can only raise £2,000, he will have to bid for the house to such an amount less than £2,000 as will enable him to pay the stamp duty, the auctioneer's fees, the solicitor's costs and other costs. Having to pay £80 stamp duty, his price for that house will be £80 less.  The price of the house now is £2,000 simply because the man whom Deputy Morrissey mentioned, who is living in a flat, and has saved a few hundred pounds and is going to borrow £1,500 from a building society, is out to buy the house, and the man who is living in a room has to put himself in the same position in order to compete.  All that each of them can pay is £2,000&mdash;they cannot go any more&mdash;and if they could raise £3,000 at the moment, the price of the house would be £3,000.</P>

      <P>If one of them could raise the £3,000 and the other almost £3,000.  The house standing at £2,000 in the City of Dublin to-day was built pre-war for £600, and the reason that it is standing at the £2,000 figure is <Col N="1070" /> that is has been sold a few times, because, a couple of years ago, there was an amount of money floating around and in the hands of people wanting houses whose idea of what house values were was somewhere about £1,000 which rose then to £1,500 and has now reached £2,000.  There are certain cases&mdash;I know the particulars of some myself&mdash;of houses which have changed hands three times since the beginning of the war.  They were built for £600 or £700 and were sold for £1,200, £1,500 and, finally, for £2,000.  Some went even further, and when we are looking for taxation and when it is necessary to get the money, I think it only fair that a certain proportion of these very big inflated values which people have been getting for these properties should accrue to the State.</P>

      <P>I did not suggest that we should go so far in relation to the vendor.  I think 5 per cent. is enough.

But I think 5 per cent. is enough at the moment.</P>

      <P>Not to cheapen houses&mdash; to get money from the vendors of houses.  It will not cheapen houses.  The effect of the Resolution is, first, to take <Col N="1071" /> 5 per cent. from the vendors of property over £1,000 in value, and, secondly, to put Irishmen in a better position to compete against foreigners than they have been in heretofore.  The foreigner who buys a £2,000 house will have to pay another £500, whereas the Irishman will have to pay only £100, and the fact that he has to pay £400 more, will put a bit of a brake on his competition with the Irishman who has to pay only an additional £100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought there was another idea in this which I was inclined to welcome.  I am referring to the tax on the non-Irish citizen of 25 per cent.  I do not know if what Deputy Morrissey says will happen, but I want to take as an example the opposite case.  In the case of a £12,000 property, the man who is inclined to pay £12,000, the man of the type which, we are told, is swarming into the country, will not baulk at paying £15,000, as he will be paying in future if it comes off the purchaser.  What will happen then?  I thought I saw in this the germ of a proper idea&mdash;a recognition by the Minister that the English £ was over-valued here.  I asked recently if he could tell me what the real value of the £ sterling in terms of Irish money was and I thought that this meant an appreciation that it was worth about 15/-.  I do not think it is even worth as much, but only one man, the Governor of the Central Bank, can tell me that.</P>
      <P>What will be the result of all this if the situation is different from what Deputy Morrissey thinks will happen? Hordes of people who want houses at £12,000 will come in and will pay another £3,000 by way of tax.  That will mean £15,000 of English money lodged in this country and then we will go through the same old system.  We will print the equivalent in Irish notes of these sums of £15,000 which we get in English notes and pay pound for pound.  We will send back the English notes which will be banked for us on the other side, and, when we call on these for goods, we will get 10/- worth of goods for every pound we have banked.  We lose both on exchange and when it comes to trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1072" /> I shall have to give serious consideration to the Minister's new economics with regard to the impact of this tax on houses and their prices.  If there is to be a tax on the vendor&mdash;it is not so at the moment; there will be an easy way of making it so, which the Minister does not propose, but thinks will work out that way&mdash;there will be a reduction in the price of houses.  I thought that was his argument.  If the vendor feels he is going to lose because of the stamp duty, will he not put the price up?  What is to prevent him?  It is not because there is any sufficient supply of houses to meet the demand. We all know that.  What has held the prices down to what they are at the moment, I do not know, but they rise month by month and there is no sign of any drop.  That is the situation with regard to outsiders.</P>
    <P>With regard to nationals, can the Minister seriously argue, the house scarcity position being as it is, there is any possible merit in imposing a tax on people who want to buy houses? The Minister hopes that it will be paid by the vendor, but I do not think it will, and, if it is paid by the purchaser, it means that there will be a rise in the already swollen prices being paid for houses.  That is not good socially, at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's explanation of this imposition is so bewildering as to make it very difficult for any Deputy to attempt to unravel it in the three minutes left.  I am not so well informed in the matter of the situation with regard to house property in the city, but I think it highly undesirable that a levy or tax should be imposed on people who desire to buy or sell property.  Whether it is the vendor or the purchaser who pays, neither the one nor the other is an undesirable section of the community.  The sale and purchase of land or other property is a desirable business which ought not to be taxed out of existence.  Take the case of a farmer who has more land than he is able to manage adequately. Why should he be taxed if he tries to dispose of some of it to enable some other person to purchase an economic holding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1073" /> At present, we have legislation which seeks in various ways, by grants, subsidies and loans, to assist the construction and erection of dwellings on small holdings.  With one hand, we try to encourage the provision of new homes and homesteads and, with the other, to discourage and put a stop to that desirable activity.  This position is not similar to that of the vicious consumer of tobacco, of wines, spirits and beer whom it is sought to convert to a more virtuous way of living by taxation. This is a desirable enterprise which ought to be encouraged.</P>
    <P>The sale of land by one citizen to another and the construction of houses &mdash;these are highly desirable and urgently needed.  And yet, in this tax of 5 per cent., we have an attempt to discourage them, if not to bring them to a standstill.  I can see no justification whatever for this levy.  So far as the levy of 25 per cent. on the sale of property to non-nationals is concerned, I think we should go much further and should seek to prevent undesirable aliens from acquiring property in this country.</P>

    <P>During my absence in the country on political work, a discussion took place on Wednesday last, on the motion for the Adjournment of the Dáil following Questions that day, which raised, to my <Col N="1074" /> mind, a matter of serious public importance. I consider, in putting down this motion, I am discharging a public duty which I feel the Government ought to have regarded as their duty and in moving this motion I simply do so as a matter of formal public duty.  I do not wish to make accusations against any person or to repeat any accusations made, nor do I want to defend anybody either against accusations made or to defend anybody who made accusations that they ought not to make.  For that reason I asked the Government to-day whether they were going to accept this motion.  They said they could not say whether they would or not until they had heard the case made.  The reason I put down this motion is that I feel that a case has been made for it.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Deputy to listen to me and, if he has other tactics to pursue, let us know whether he is pursuing them.  I stated that I am performing a formal public duty which I regard as my responsibility, when the Government have not shown that they realise that they have a responsibility in the matter.  I am making the plea simply now that if the Government recognise that, as I believe they might, that they would say so after having heard me.  If they are of opinion that it is desirable that a public inquiry should take place and that a select committee should be set up to inquire into the matter in the way I suggest the committee should be set up forthwith and further discussion of the matters, that I understand have been raised here, might be left over until the select committee have inquired, ascertained the facts and reported to the Dáil on these facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my approach to this particular matter, the Ceann Comhairle suggested <Col N="1075" /> that the motion might be restricted in some way or another, that it was too wide.  I feel that the very nature of the statements made on the one hand, and the facts given by the Minister for Justice on the other, are of such a kind that the inquiry into this particular matter should be as open as members of the select committee set up by the Dáil would consider it should be.  I do not think it would be possible or desirable to restrict in any way the scope of the inquiry in view, as I say, of the type of statements made here and the admissions made in regard to certain of these matters by the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>Now while there may be a case to be made here such as the Ceann Comhairle mentioned, that this would open up an inquiry into every commercial transaction carried out by Locke's during that particular period, I think that is a rather exaggerated statement.  This inquiry arises out of definite incidents and only so far as the incidents relate to the matter of public importance connected with them would any Select Committee of the Dáil inquire.  Therefore I press for the acceptance of the motion in the form in which it is there.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday last, in his reply to the debate on the Adjournment, the Minister for Justice accepted certain facts&mdash;that a Swiss national of the name Eindiguer arrived in Ireland some time at the beginning of September, that he was accompanied by others, or at any rate by one person, who was posing under the name of Horace Henry Smith, but that probably his real name was Alexander Maximoe; that by the end of September the Department of Justice was aware that Eindiguer had entered into a contract to purchase Locke's distillery, that at the same time his Department had discovered that both Eindiguer and Maximoe were associating with an alien who was under orders to leave the country; that, following the publication of the news that members of this group had been received by the President, he had received a telephone message from a friend which resulted in the Minister for Justice signing a deportation order for the man who <Col N="1076" /> posed under the name of Smith.  Then subsequently we had newspaper information that while he was in process of deportation this man threw himself overboard.</P>
    <P>These very colourful circumstances on the surface would warrant some kind of investigation but when, in circumstances such as those admitted by the Minister for Justice, a Deputy in this House makes the allegation that this Swiss gentleman was able to approach the Department of Industry and Commerce and get from the Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It may be that the Department of Industry and Commerce was not specifically mentioned, but at any rate the general trend of the discussion and the statements made by Deputy Flanagan was such that the Minister for Justice picked it up that a charge was being made against the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that it is my duty to ask the Government to take cognisance of the debate, even if they take cognisance only of the reactions of that debate on the Minister for Justice.  It seems to me, from reading the whole of the debate, that there are allegations that the Department for Industry and Commerce gave concessions to this particular group that they were not prepared to give to others; there are allegations that a member of the Oireachtas used his influence as such to get concessions from the Government or some Government Department; there are allegations that a member of the Bar outside made use of his position to approach the President&mdash; to get some kind of influence or patronage through the Presidential office to <Col N="1078" /> get concessions that would not be available to other people.</P>
      <P>I ask the Government to realise the effect these allegations have on the public mind, on the prestige of this House and on the confidence of the people in the impartial administration of the Government.  If there are allegations made here that are unwarranted, if allegations are made inside the privileges of the House, then the House ought to be anxious to safeguard these privileges and ought to see that these privileges are not abused.</P>
      <P>One of the effects of setting up a tribunal would be to ascertain the facts and, as a necessary corollary to ascertaining the facts, to disclose whether an abuse was being made by any Deputy of the privileges of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>And then, if they are not warranted, in defence of our rights and prerogatives here, where we consider we have, under the Constitutions, rights guaranteed to us to speak here and be responsible to nobody unless to the House, then we must guard those rights and privileges.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the Taoiseach an opportunity, in the face of an actual happening, to set up a committee which will, if necessary, move somewhat along that road.  If we are to preserve our privileges here we will not do it by sitting down and, in an academic way, discussing hypothetical instances of how our privileges may be abused.  The type of inquiry I ask for is the type that is warranted by the circumstances and, if the Taoiseach has anything in his mind <Col N="1079" /> with regard to proceeding towards the proposals he had in his general resolution, he can only proceed in a satisfactory way by dealing with <i>ad hoc</i> matters as they arise here.</P>
      <P>I do not want to make any allegations here or support any allegations.  I am not saying that what Deputy Flanagan stated here is not correct; I am merely saying that these things were stated here and, once they were stated, apart from the reaction of the Minister for Justice to them, it should have been the Government's duty at once to proceed and have them investigated in the most formal way.</P>
      <P>Two of the persons whose conduct has been reflected upon here, Senator Quirke and Mr. Sweeney, have both sent communications to the Press, Senator Quirke saying: &ldquo;I shall lend any properly constituted judicial tribunal all the assistance in my power,&rdquo; and Mr. F. W. Gilligan, solicitor, writing on behalf of Mr. Seamus Sweeney, saying he would welcome the fullest possible inquiry into the transaction and his connection with it. These are people who have been aspersed in one way or another and they welcome an inquiry.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that the front or the back benchers in the Government Party will not face this matter in a serious and simple way. The debates in the Dáil on Wednesday, 22nd October, 1947, contain certain allegations and certain statements were made by the Minister for Justice as a comment on these allegations.  What is printed in the Official Report for that <Col N="1080" /> day warrants the setting-up of a select committee of Deputies publicly to investigate and report to the Dáil on the circumstances connected with any attempt to sell or buy Locke's Distillery during the period mentioned in the report.  I mention a date there, not because I want all the transactions going back to that date investigated, but merely because I think it necessary to inquire into any attempt by Locke's to sell their property or business in the recent past and it is necessary to inquire into all the facts in relation to any attempt made to buy the property or the business associated with Locke's Distillery.</P>
      <P>The allegation here is that in the dealings with Government Departments there was certain discrimination as between various bodies trying to buy the place.  There was particularly favourable discrimination in relation to the group that was referred to here by the Minister for Justice in his reply on the 22nd October.  It is stated that a member of the Oireachtas endeavoured to misuse his privileges in his contact with the Department to get concessions for his friends that other people might not get and that a member of the Bar attempted to make use of his connection with the President and make use of the Presidential office to have his interests assisted in some way or another.</P>
      <P>I think these are matters that, when the dignity and the prestige of the Oireachtas have to be maintained, Deputies on every side of the House should realise should be inquired into systematically and orderly, straight away.  I, therefore, move the motion that stands here and I seriously ask the Government to accept it that, in doing so, I am simply carrying out in a formal way a duty that I feel is my public responsibility.  They should be as wide awake to the fact that an inquiry of this kind is wanted and wanted immediately.</P>

      <P>A motion of this kind, moved by the Leader of the principal Opposition Party, has to be taken seriously. <Col N="1081" /> We do not have to take it seriously, however, that Deputy Mulcahy's pose on the altar of rectitude, is inspired by the highest motives.  He put down this motion in order to place the support of his party behind the allegations made last week by Deputy Flanagan. The purpose of the motion is political blackmail.  Deputy Mulcahy and every one of his colleagues know that, once a motion of this kind is submitted, the Government has either to accept it or take the risk that its refusal will be interpreted by foolish people as implying that it has something to conceal, that there is some substance in the allegations.</P>
      <P>Is it seriously suggested by Deputy Mulcahy that when any Deputy, with or without responsibility, makes an allegation concerning any member of the Government or any member of the Oireachtas, there must be an immediate public inquiry into it?  I submit that that is a most preposterous suggestion. Surely, before we establish a public inquiry and bring a whole lot of private citizens into the glare of publicity that attends a public inquiry, we should be satisfied, every one of us, that the allegations were made by a responsible person and with substance? Are we satisfied that that is so in this case?  Deputy Mulcahy washes his hands of responsibility for the allegations. He tells us he is not supporting the allegations or criticising the person who made them.  I submit that that is not good enough.  I submit that this Dáil should not, in any circumstances, pass a motion for the establishment of a public inquiry until it is sure that there is somebody with a serious charge to make, who is prepared to substantiate that charge before the inquiry.</P>
      <P>In this particular case, allegations have been made against a member of the Oireachtas and a member of the Government, unnamed, concerning transactions associated with the sale of Locke's Distillery, Kilbeggan.  They have been made by a Deputy who I think nobody will contend has been otherwise than notoriously reckless in matters of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>These charges were made under the privilege of the House. Deputy Mulcahy referred to the fact that two individuals, not members of this House, have welcomed this public inquiry.  Of course they welcome it. Their honour has been impugned, their reputations besmirched and, because these charges were made under privilege of this House, they have no other redress except a public inquiry.  If these charges were made elsewhere, they would have recourse to the ordinary process of the law to vindicate their characters.  They were made here, and made here in circumstances which ensured that, if the Deputy who made them is shown in an inquiry to have made them recklessly, he is still immune from all consequences to himself. He is immune from all consequences, even if it is shown that these charges were made maliciously, or worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy is very concerned about the dignity of the Dáil and the honour of our public life.  That issue does arise here, but does not arise out of the charges made by Deputy Flanagan. It arises in relation to Deputy Flanagan's conduct.  However, we have a motion here which requests the Dáil to agree to set up a committee of the Dáil to investigate and report on all the facts and all the circumstances connected with and surrounding any proposal made or attempted to be made at any time either to buy or to sell Locke's Distillery, Kilbeggan.  I submit that this Dáil is entitled to consider a proposal by a Deputy to establish an inquiry only if there are serious grounds for believing that a member of the Oireachtas, a member of the Government, an officer of the public service or other <Col N="1083" /> public official has in any way misused his position, or if it can be shown that there is a major matter of public issue involved.</P>
    <P>I submit that it is not within the competence of this Dáil to inquire into the private affairs of private citizens who themselves have committed no irregularity or broken no law.  If, therefore, there is to be an inquiry arising out of these allegations, that inquiry must be confined, I submit, to allegations that public men of any kind have abused their position.  I do not think we are entitled to inquire why the owners of Locke's Distillery have decided to sell it.  I do not think we should establish a precedent of that kind, because such a precedent would be very undesirable.</P>

      <P>I do not believe that Deputy Mulcahy is a Socialist, but I am quite certain that a motion of this kind, to inquire into private business transactions of private citizens who have broken no law, if it were persisted in and became a practice, would easily destroy all private business enterprise in this country.  Nobody denies the right of the Dáil to inquire into the conduct of public officials; nobody denies the right of the Dáil to establish an inquiry into allegations against Ministers or against members of the <Col N="1084" /> Dáil; but I do say that a motion which contemplates that, over and above the conduct of public men, there is to be an inquiry into the private business affairs of private citizens should not be entertained.</P>
      <P>Now whether the Government is going to agree to hold an inquiry or not will depend on this discussion.  I do not think that anything has been said to-night or last week which would justify the decision to establish an inquiry. I do not think we should agree to establish an inquiry, until it is made clear by statements here that a member of the Dáil or someone known to a member of the Dáil is in a position to produce evidence of any kind to support allegations which have been made against public men.  If there is going to be an inquiry&mdash;and I want Deputy Flanagan to listen to this&mdash;the inquiry will be by a judicial tribunal and all the witnesses will have to give evidence on oath.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will set out the facts of the case as I know them.  As far as the Department for Industry and Commerce is concerned the history of the case is as follows: The first reference on the Department's records to the possibility of the Kilbeggan Distillery <Col N="1085" /> changing hands was made at a conference which was attended by representatives of all the distilleries in the country and which was held on the 16th April, 1947.  At that conference Mr. Joseph Cooney, Manager of J. Locke and Co., Ltd., stated that the distillery was likely to change hands in the near future.  When the report of that conference reached me I decided that the firm of solicitors representing the owners of the distillery should be invited to the Department to discuss the position, and particularly for the purpose of conveying to them my concern at the possibility of the firm passing into the hands of persons who might have no interest in maintaining it or who might in any way pursue a policy which would be detrimental to the interests of the whole Irish whiskey trade.  An invitation to the solicitors representing J. Locke, Ltd., to come to the Department was issued on May 18th, and on May 21st the firm's solicitor was interviewed by a deputy secretary of the Department.  The solicitor confirmed the report that the business was for sale and stated that it had been advertised in British newspapers.  He said that inquiries had been already received.  The deputy secretary informed him that I was interested in developing exports, particularly to hard currency countries, that I considered that the distillery industry had good potentialities in that regard, and that I therefore considered it essential that nothing should happen which might prejudice the Irish whiskey trade.  He said that I was opposed to the sale if it seemed likely that the distillery was being bought for a short-term policy of exploiting the present shortage of whiskey or for a long-term policy of putting on the market the products of the distillery as a blend with other whiskey.  The solicitor mentioned that I had no power to interfere with the sale&mdash;as the Deputies are aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy secretary pointed out that while I had no power to prevent or to interfere with a sale to any person, I exercised a control over whiskey exports and the sale of whiskey in bond, and if the business were sold under circumstances which I thought detrimental to the national interests, then I might consider withholding facilities for export <Col N="1086" /> or for sale in bond.  The solicitor undertook to inform any likely purchaser of these circumstances and to inform the Department of any developments in regard to the sale.</P>
    <P>The next record on the Departmental file is that on May 30th representatives of certain British interests inquired at the Department and were informed of my attitude in the same terms as the company's solicitor.  Other tentative inquiries were received from Irish interests.</P>
    <P>On July 23rd Mr. Joseph Cooney, the manager of the firm, accompanied by Mr. P.L. MacEvoy were interviewed by the Assistant Secretary of the Department. Mr. Cooney intimated that he, Mr. MacEvoy and other friends were interested in the purchase of the distillery, but expressed the opinion that persons interested in the distillery in order to exploit the present shortage and others interested in restricting its development might bid more than a fair price and prevent him from acquiring it.  He urged that there should be further amplification of the conditions on which I would approve of the sale, the conditions which were communicated to the firm's solicitor on the occasion of his interview, in order to eliminate other purchasers who might have undesirable motives.  The secretary who interviewed Mr. Cooney and Mr. MacEvoy informed them of my general attitude as it was explained to the company's solicitor.</P>
    <P>On September 9th Mr. Cooney again visited the Department accompanied by Senator Quirke of the firm of Stokes and Quirke.  They stated that an Irish group in association with a Swiss group intended to purchase the distillery and that a company would be formed with a majority of Irish capital and of Irish directors.  Mr. Thomas Morris, Clonmel, was stated to be interested.</P>

      <P>It was stated that the new company was interested in whiskey exports to Switzerland and an increase in the company's small quota for export was requested.  The officer of the Department referred them on that point to an assistant secretary to whom they explained that the new company was prepared to extend operations and to produce for the Swiss market and that it would need an increase in the annual quota for the export of mature whiskey. That application, together with another application from another distillery, was referred to me at a conference that afternoon.  As both applications involved exports to hard currency areas I decided to grant them.</P>

      <P>The final record is that on September 30th the Minister for Justice informed the Department for Industry and Commerce that it was making inquiries in regard to Swiss nationals who were involved in the transaction, who were under suspicion because they were associated with another alien who was considered undesirable.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;He (the Minister) is also aware of the fact that a group of Irish citizens made an attempt to take over and develop and to improve the conditions in this distillery and that the Government refused to receive a deputation to discuss the matter and refused to entertain the claims of Irish nationalists for this distillery.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>My Department was approached on four occasions concerning the sale of this distillery: on the first occasion, by the solicitor of Locke and Company, a gentleman named Mooney; on the second occasion, by certain British interests who, so far as I know, disappeared from the picture, and, on the third occasion and on the fourth occasion by Mr. Cooney.  We were approached by nobody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that Deputy Morrissey's allegation?  I am stating the fact; the Deputy, presumably, believes what he states to be true and will testify to it.  Let me put something on the record: no individual or group approached my Department for information concerning the Government's attitude in connection with the sale of the distillery in any way which was not received and which did not receive precisely the same information as any other party obtained.  That is on the record and I shall testify to it.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall deal with them.  Deputy O'Higgins's testimony <Col N="1091" /> in that regard will come into the picture. Deputy Flanagan's second allegation was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister has very good reasons for withholding the information in order to safeguard the names of his colleagues and in order to safeguard a certain Minister of State that has a keen personal interest in the question of the sale of Locke's Distillery.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Who is the Minister?  Is this Dáil being asked to set up a committee of inquiry into charges against a Minister who will not be named?  Note the silence.  Is Deputy Mulcahy standing over his motion now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is helping me more and more to stand over it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an allegation against some Minister but so indefinite is that allegation that the name of that Minister will not be given.  I cannot ask Deputy Flanagan to answer now.  Even if I did, it would be quite useless.  When he comes to speak, I ask him to say what Minister he had in mind when saying that or what knowledge he has to support that allegation or, if he has not that knowledge, who has and what he means precisely by &ldquo;keen personal interest in the question of the sale of Locke's Distillery&rdquo;?  The Deputy's third allegation was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. George Eindiguer stated in the presence of a number of citizens in a certain hotel in this city that it was suggested by Senator Quirke that it might be a nice friendly gesture if Mr. Eindiguer would bring over a gold watch and give it to the Taoiseach's son as a present in order to soften things.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Silence is of no importance here because Deputy Flanagan went on:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That is a statement I can stand over; that is a statement that was made by Senator Quirke to Mr. Eindiguer.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is with some reluctance that I deal with this matter of the watch.  Nasty things come into the political life of this country and, as Deputy Mulcahy <Col N="1092" /> has associated himself with this nasty thing, he is going to feel the full brunt of this.  Senator Quirke has a sister to whom he is very deeply attached.  That sister was seriously ill.  She was in a sanatorium on the Continent and so ill that hopes of her recovery ended.  Senator Quirke arranged to bring her back to Ireland.  He brought her back and he placed her under the care of Dr. de Valera.  Under his care, she recovered&mdash;a rather remarkable recovery. So deeply grateful was Senator Quirke to Dr. de Valera for the care, attention and skill which he devoted to his sister and for the remarkable recovery which he effected that he was anxious to make to Dr. de Valera a presentation of some kind.  He saw Mr. Eindiguer wearing a watch and he said that that was the type of watch he would like to buy to present to Dr. de Valera.  That was the end of the matter.  So far as Senator Quirke was concerned, the watch was never purchased and never presented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy does not feel any sense of shame, he is beyond redemption.  What is the allegation? What is the purpose of Deputy Flanagan's mean insinuation?  Is it seriously believed by any Deputy opposite that Mr. Eindiguer was going to get some concession from the Department of Industry and Commerce because of a watch presented to Dr. de Valera?  Let me say here that, so far as I know, Dr. de Valera does not yet know that such a presentation was intended.  He was probably the only one who did not know that Senator Quirke had the idea in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is on the record, too, and the Deputy will, no doubt, of his own knowledge be able to testify to it.  Is it seriously believed by any Deputy here that by a process of bringing a watch to Dr. de Valera, a watch which he did not know he was going to get and has not yet got, Eindiguer or his friends got some concession in <Col N="1093" /> the Department of Industry and Commerce? What concession did they get? What is the allegation?  In what way is it suggested that as a result of that particular measure that they got any advantage?  What advantages is it alleged they got?  Is it seriously believed by anyone that I, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, dealing with that application for an increase in Locke's quota made by Mr. Cooney, the manager of Locke's, and who never heard of Eindiguer, who never before then knew of his existence or heard his name mentioned or knew of the watch, was nevertheless influenced in my judgment by this intention of Senator Quirke?  Is that a proper matter on which to set up a commission of inquiry to investigate?  I hope Deputy Mulcahy is beginning to feel some sense of shame.</P>

James Stewart and Co., Distillers, Park Lane, London, and for this transaction in the black market they were to get £660,000&rdquo;&mdash;no less. Does Deputy Flanagan know that to be a fact?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Deputy said that.  I am delighted to have that on the record because Mr. Cooney, the Managing Director of the Kilbeggan Distillery, wrote a letter on the 14th October, which is on the Departmental file, in which he stated that he had received a report that this whiskey was being offered and that it was stated on the document: &ldquo;Export licence available,&rdquo; and continued: &ldquo;I knew this was not so and that it would take a long number of years to deliver the quantity from our licence.&rdquo;  I am glad Mr. Cooney is being brought out into the open because I, personally, had no doubt as to who was inspiring <Col N="1094" /> Deputy Flanagan to raise this question here.  Did Mr. Cooney tell Deputy Flanagan that there were 61,000 gallons of mature whiskey in Kilbeggan?  Does Deputy Flanagan know that there are? At the conference which was held on the 16th April, at which all the distilleries were represented, and which was concerned with the possibility of increasing whiskey sales, Mr. Cooney, having mentioned the fact that the distillery was for sale, added that a change of ownership would not have any significant effect on the total quantity of whiskey to be released from bond as the Kilbeggan Distillery held only a very small stock of mature whiskey.  Is it beginning to dawn on Deputy Flanagan that he was led up the garden by Mr. Cooney?  If it is not, it will dawn on him yet.</P>

      <P>Just a minute.  There were certain non-nationals involved in this business.  Mr. Eindiguer.  I never heard of him until his name was mentioned by Mr. Cooney on the occasion of his visit to the Department on the 9th September.  I certainly hold no brief for him.  He was a visitor to this country and until we know otherwise we should at least moderate our language in relation to him.  The information available to us does not justify an assumption that he is other than what he represented himself to be. Enquiry was made from the police in Switzerland and from Scotland Yard and both reported that they know nothing against him.  A commercial enquiry agency states that he has displayed fairly wide commercial activity inside and outside Switzerland, and that he has been a director of various companies.  So far as we are concerned, we have nothing against him except that he was found here in bad company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>He came as a representative of the group.  Mr. Eindiguer <Col N="1097" /> came here because, I understand, he had established contacts in Switzerland with Mr. Morris of Clonmel.  Mr. Morris had visited Switzerland in connection with some dog-racing development.  He is, as everybody knows, the head of the dog-racing business in this country.  He met Mr. Eindiguer there and Mr. Eindiguer came here under the auspices of Mr. Morris.  He acted in a reputable way.  He employed the firm of Arthur Cox &amp; Co. as his solicitors and the firm of Stokes &amp; Quirke as his auctioneers to carry through the deal. After a period a report appeared in the newspapers that Mr. Eindiguer, Maximoe and another alien named Sachael had been received at Árus an Uachtaráin. How that came about I have no knowledge.  But immediately that report appeared in the newspapers, one man who knew something of this Mr. Sachael and who had previously been in contact with these other non-nationals and had entertained no doubts about their bona fides, became suspicious. That man was Senator Quirke.  The Minister for Justice referred here last week to a friend who rang him up and urged that inquiry should be made. That friend was Senator Quirke.  There was associated with this business Mr. Morris of Clonmel who, I understand, is a strong supporter of the Fine Gael Party, and Mr. Cooney, an adherent of Clann na Talmhan.  If they had any suspicion about the bona fides of these non-nationals they did not communicate them to the police.</P>

However, the fact of the matter is that when this report appeared in the newspaper, Senator Quirke became suspicious because, as I said, he knew something of Sachael, knew that he was an alien under orders for deportation, immediately telephoned the Minister for Justice, who immediately contacted the police and instructed them to make all requisite inquiries.</P>

      <P>That is typical of Deputy Flanagan's honesty.  In any case, the police made inquiries concerning this man, Smith, identified him with Maximoe who was wanted by Scotland Yard, found that he had entered the country on a false passport and he was deported.  According to the Press reports, he will not be available to give evidence at the tribunal.  Now, Deputy Flanagan says that Maximoe was arrested in the house of a friend of the Minister for Justice&mdash;this Mr. Sachael &mdash;such a friend of the Minister for Justice that the Minister for Justice ordered him to leave the country. Sachael was an alien who came here in circumstances described to-day by the Minister for Justice, and who at one time was interested in a project for the assembly of Czechoslovakian cars here. The police became suspicious of him and the period in which he was allowed to remain in the country was curtailed. If there is going to be any inquiry about that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>He had other business also.  In any case, as soon as the Guards began to make inquiries about him they decided that he was a man we were better off without and he was instructed to wind up his affairs and to get out.  He has gone.  Deputy Flanagan said he is an alien who sold £25,000 worth of Irish tweed to get dollars for &ldquo;you&rdquo;, the &ldquo;you&rdquo; being in this case the Minister for Justice or the Government.  Does Deputy Flanagan know that to be true?  Who told Deputy Flanagan that yarn?  Let me say, for the purpose of the record, that you cannot export any tweed or other cloth from this country without a permit and that no permit to export as much as one yard of cloth was issued to Mr. Sachael or anybody associated with him.  These are the allegations. Do you still want an inquiry?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is going to be <Col N="1102" /> an inquiry, we will give the tribunal something to inquire about.  I will make allegations.  Deputies opposite have not the monopoly of that.  At least, I will ask a few questions which this tribunal may well be asked to answer.  We know that there were other people interested in buying this distillery besides this particular group that are under discussion here.  We know that one gentleman, in the course of an interview with the Department, expressed concern that other bidders might offer a higher price for the distillery than he was prepared to bid. Every Deputy here knows that somebody briefed Deputy Flanagan.  Somebody induced him to come into this House and raise this question.  Will Deputy Flanagan say who it was?  The Deputy's silence will not protect him. That question will be asked in another place where he will have to answer and that is why I, for one, would be glad to see an inquiry.  Could it be that that person asked Deputy Flanagan to raise this question here in the way in which it was raised with the idea that if Deputy Flanagan raised enough stink other prospective purchasers would be warned off and he could buy the property cheaper?  I am not accusing Deputy Flanagan of being anything else but a tool.  I think he was just handed a stick which he thought he could use to beat the Government and had not the sense to inquire into the motives of the man who handed him the stick.  Or, was Deputy Flanagan a tool? Did he know the motives of the person who asked him to raise the matter here?  Did he know that the raising of this matter here might be of cash benefit to that individual?  I put this question on the record&mdash;to ask the tribunal to answer that also.</P>

      <P>I cannot imagine that the cause of decency in the public life of this country has been materially served by the contribution made by the Tánaiste. I frequently find myself finding fault with the Leader of the Opposition for that he leans backwards in moderation expecting to elicit from the Government Front Bench a similar solicitude for decency in public life and the dignity of this Parliament.  He never gets it, and instead of meeting with the <Col N="1103" /> moderate and judicial tone which he chose to adopt here to-day, the Tánaiste proceeded to put on a riotous and disedifying act.  In the course of a long defence of himself, of his Department and of his colleagues, for which this was not the occasion, I understood him to say that four separate parties, one after the other, were at his Department to inquire about the permissibility of purchasing this distillery, and the Minister added &ldquo;all four were told the same story&rdquo;.  Is that true? He seems to have forgotten that ten minutes before he had informed us that the first three parties were given all the warning that the fourth party, of which Senator Quirke was a member, got, the warning and also the information that the export quota of this distillery would be raised from 4,000 gallons to 8,000 gallons in order to test the Swiss market.  Now, there is an awful lot of money to be made out of an additional export of 4,000 gallons per annum, and if on my first request I could get a concession of 100 per cent. from the Department might not a modestly hopeful heart prophesy that at the next interview some further progress might be made in increasing the export quota which had already, at the first time of asking, gone up by 100 per cent.?  Surely, there is a difference between the story told to this fourth party and to the other three, and a vital difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I confess that when I heard Deputy Flanagan recite the story about Mr. Eindiguer being asked to bring a gold watch to this country to present it to the Taoiseach's son I regarded it as just fantastic nonsense&mdash;that Deputy Flanagan had been sold a dud.  I confess to being utterly stunned by the story told here by the Tánaiste to-day. Surely, if any of us wanted to make a handsome present to a person, to someone in whose debt we were deeply committed in the circumstances recited by the Tánaiste, it was reasonable, natural and to be expected that Senator Quirke would feel himself under a debt that no fee could pay to Dr. de Valera for the medical services he had done&mdash;but in that atmosphere is there not something strangely incongruous <Col N="1104" /> that when you are choosing your gift that you should choose to smuggle it?</P>

      <P>I have said that the thing is fantastic, but the Minister tells me that Senator Quirke said to Eindiguer &ldquo;that is the kind of watch I want; will you bring it over the next time you are coming?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Maybe the man meant that Endiguer would go around to the Department to get a licence from the Minister, import the watch, present it to the customs, pay duty on it and bring it in, and that he would recoup him, but it seems so odd to me, because if I felt my heart overflowing with the desire to offer something over and above a generous fee I would go down to West's or Weir's or Hopkins' and get a really choice watch to give to my benefactor.  However, it is quite conceivable that we here, hearing this story, are being wise after the event. Let me go on record in saying that I am as certain as that we are standing in this room that there was nothing present to the mind of the Taoiseach or Dr. de Valera which would for a moment justify&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the suggestion that they knew or heard anything or discussed anything.  I prefer to think, and I am prepared to concede in the context of the story told by the Tánaiste that in this matter Senator Quirke was guilty of an indiscretion.  Instead of going down town and buying a watch the thought occurred to his mind when he saw this time-piece in Eindiguer's hand.  Why he should draw Dr. de Valera's name into the matter and not realise that that name had associations in this country, that it was not a prudent thing to canvass about with a well-known <Col N="1105" /> financier, surpasses me to understand, but to pretend that the person to whom that story was told is moved by nothing but malice when he comments adversely upon it is fantastic. The best thing we can say is that a fantastic indiscretion took place on that occasion.  To mention the name of the Taoiseach's son in such a context was really beyond the limits of wild indiscretion.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste referred to a report made by Senator Quirke to the Minister for Justice that his suspicious were aroused by the appearance of Mr. Sachael in the company of Mr. Maximoe and Mr. Eindiguer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but as Mr. Smith.  I can well imagine Senator Quirke acting in that way.  The Minister went on to say that Senator Quirke, Mr. Morris and Mr. Cooney were all apprised of this, but that only the public-spirited Senator Quirke rushed to the Minister for Justice and warned him.  That is one explanation, but if you want to make those kind of reflections remember that that story can be given another meaning.  I will tell the House in a moment that the way Sachael appeared in this whole transaction was that he was trying to muscle in on Senator Quirke's deal: that he had, in fact, taken away Senator Quirke's customer from him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it and a lot more that I propose to tell you before I sit <Col N="1106" /> down.  I know that Senator Quirke went to the Minister for Justice, because I was told so by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to-day, and directed the Minister's attention to the fact that Eindiguer was no longer in the company of Senator Quirke, but was drinking tea with Sachael in Árus an Uachtaráin.  The next performance was that the Minister for Industry and Commerce tells us that when he sent that message to the Minister he knew that Sachael was a man liable to deportation.  The Tánaiste went on to say that Sachael was gone. There is nobody muscling in on the bargain now.</P>

      <P>It is a fact.  Sachael is gone and you glory in it, and Sachael is gone at the instance of Senator Quirke.  I think he is a very good riddance.  It would have been a great deal better for all of us if he never came here and a great deal better still if he and Maximoe and Mr. Sweeney did not drink tea in the Presidential drawing-room and send the social secretary down to the telephone.  Those blushing souls whom we are not to drag into the light of publicity were not so coy when they asked the social secretary in Árus an Uachtaráin to telephone to several newspapers in Dublin to announce that they had been drinking tea with the President.  When some of the newspapers rang back to inquire were they to print it &ldquo;Messieurs Sachael, Maximoe and Eindiguer and Mr. and Mrs. Sweeney&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Before that it was Messieurs Eindiguer and Maximoe and Mr. Sachael.  That was the correction that was made.

      <P>I have seen so many of the Minister's supporters travel that road that I am intelligently deducing the future from what has occurred in the past.  As to the last point made by the Tánaiste.  &ldquo;I deny,&rdquo; says the Tánaiste, &ldquo;that any inquiry lies in regard to the conduct of private individuals.&rdquo; That is a general doctrine to which, ordinarily, we could all subscribe. I remember making that submission when Dr. Ward was the victim and it was rebutted very energetically from the opposite benches.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not his friend, protector or admirer, but I should like to see justice for the meanest creature in this country as for the most exalted. I agree with the general principle that the private affairs of Deputies or of citizens of this State are no concern of Parliament.  But since when was the President of Ireland a private individual? Since when are the social columns registering the comings and goings of guests to that house of election a matter of private individuals? Since when did private individuals desiring to have their activities retained within the sphere of private activity go down and telephone to the public Press asking them to record that they had been drinking tea in Arus an Uachtaráin?  We could understand <Col N="1108" /> foolish women with social aspirations seeking that distinction for no other purpose than to triumph over their neighbours.  But can you picture the hard Sachael, the experienced Maximoe seeking to include their names in the social register of Árus an Uachtaráin in order to say to their neighbours in Connemara: &ldquo;We got up to see the President and you did not&rdquo;? Was it social ambition that inspired them to appear in that <i>milieu</i> before their neighbours?</P>
      <P>That is in answer to the whirling language which the Tánaiste chose to employ.  But I will state with as great detachment as I can the reasons why I support the Leader of the Opposition in the motion he makes to-night.  He asks this House to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the transactions which have taken place in respect to Locke's Distillery.  Here is the way the transactions look to one citizen of this State&mdash;myself.</P>
      <P>From the information that came my way, every particle of which I thrust upon the Minister for Justice, not at his request but because I desire him to know it, I know that Mr. Eindiguer turns up in Ireland attended by Mr. Maximoe, <i>alias</i> Maxwell, <i>alias</i> Smith. But that is not all.  That was the party whose names were published in the social intelligence column.  But they were also attended, proximately or remotely, by Mrs. Chappell and Miss Donnico.  Now perhaps the learned Tánaiste, who knows so much about this business, can tell us what Mrs. Chappell's interest in it was or what she claimed it to be.  What was Miss Donnico's interest in this transaction?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume he desires to be known as ignorant and insolent.  The presence of these persons circulating in the atmosphere of this transaction causes me to wonder; but, let us not pretend that, in the course of trade and commerce, every casual person you meet in transacting business is a person for whose character and antecedents you can answer without reservation.  I have no doubt that I have, I have no doubt that Senator Quirke has, and I have no doubt that every man in business has, from time to time, casually come in contact with persons in the course of business of whom he knows nothing.</P>
      <P>But, then two new figures appear on the scene.  It is then that Mr. Sachael under the escort of Mr. Sweeney appeared and this peculiar picture unfolds&mdash;Senator Quirke, Mr. Eindiguer, Mr. Maximoe and their retinue&mdash;all that retinue, all those principals make contact with Mr. Sweeney and Mr. Sachael, except Senator Quirke.  The impression I draw from that is that Senator Quirke's position is: &ldquo;I am not going to have anything to do with Sachael and Sweeney.  I am prepared to transact this business for Mr. Eindiguer if he chooses to leave it in the hands of our firm, but Sachael and Sweeney have nothing to do with me and I want to have nothing to do with them.&rdquo;  I am confirmed in that view because I suggest that Eindiguer, having been Senator Quirke's client and the full resources of Messrs.  Stokes and Quirke being at his disposal, being approached to transfer his business from Senator Quirke's hands to Mr. Sweeney's, prudently replies: &ldquo;I am in the hands of a very good man, a very influential man, a man who knows the ropes and I want no better agent than Quirke.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Eindiguer is a man who spoke only French and German&mdash;he spoke no English at all.  He brought Maximoe here, or Maximoe alleged that he did, as his interpreter.  Sachael spoke German, and when Sachael is informed by Mr. Eindiguer that he wants no change, that he is well content with his advisers, <Col N="1111" /> who are influential men, what surmise can we make except that somebody said: &ldquo;Eindiguer believes that Quirke is the only man with pull in this country and he does not think Sweeney is worth a row of beans&rdquo;? Then, on the following day, there is a paragraph in the Fashionable Intelligence: &ldquo;Mr. Eindiguer, Mr. Maximoe and Mr. Sachael, with Mr. and Mrs. Sweeney, were entertained at Árus an Uachtaráin yesterday evening, where they drank tea with the President and his lady.&rdquo;  Am I prudish if I say it ought to be a matter of inquiry when the facts, the known facts, establish at least a <i>prima facie</i> case that the office of the President was being used to lubricate the wheels of a somewhat unsavoury real estate deal?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If my words bore that interpretation, I gladly add that, in so far as I am personally concerned, I am convinced that neither the President nor Mrs. O'Kelly was remotely conscious of this business, though I do not exonerate their secretarial staff who should be vigilant to protect the President and Mrs. O'Kelly from any form of exploitation of this kind, who should have been there at once to ask the President if he had satisfied himself as to the credentials of foreigners from abroad, and, on being told that a young man married to Mrs. O'Kelly's niece had introduced them, to have sounded a note of warning and to have said: &ldquo;Young people may often be imposed upon.  Will you not permit me to get in touch with Justice and the Aliens Department to satisfy ourselves that these are people proper to receive?&rdquo; It was not done, and the result was that so loathsome a situation was created in the morning's paper that Senator Quirke could not waste a moment until he got in touch with the Minister for Justice to say: &ldquo;Not only is this man Sachael unfit for presentation in the drawing-room of the President's wife, but he is a man <Col N="1112" /> I would not touch in the crudest business transaction, and not only that, but any person in his company at once becomes suspect in my eyes.&rdquo;  He knew all about Sachael's record, albeit he never met the man, never had dealings with him, but so notorious was Sachael that Senator Quirke felt entitled to go at once and warn the Minister for Justice: &ldquo;To be in that man's company is to be suspect.  You had better start inquiries at once.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Senator Quirke was perfectly right, because the Minister directed appropriate steps to be taken, and they were.  Two officers of the Aliens Department went out to the hotel where Eindiguer and Maximoe were staying, and, while they were looking at Eindiguer's passport, Maximoe slipped out the back door.  Sachael was present in Dún Laoghaire when Maximoe went out the back door. and the police redoubled their exertions searching for Maximoe.  Where did they find him after 24 hours' search? In the lavatory of Sachael's house, the door of which they had to break down with an axe before they could get him out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste is amazed that anyone should expect an inquiry to be held into the circumstances &ldquo;of a little private matter between private citizens&rdquo;.  The guest of yesterday of Árus an Uachtaráin is locked by his fellow-guests into the lavatory and the police break down the door to get in at him.  It could happen anywhere! Nothing unusual, nothing to get excited about, nothing to be making all this fuss about! I think it is disgusting. The person of the President and the residence of An Uachtarán are things which should not be lightly exposed to a public affront of that kind and those who made such an affront possible have something to answer for, more particularly if it emerges that these people were brought to Árus an Uachtaráin at the instance of Mr. Sweeney. This House is entitled to set up appropriate machinery to address the question to Mr. Sweeney: &ldquo;Why did you bring these people there?  Why did you think it right and for what purpose <Col N="1113" /> did you choose to introduce Sachael, Maximoe and Eindiguer to that House to which, by virtue of your relationship, you have the entrée&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>As the issue of this harmless exchange in Sachael's residence, Mr. Maximoe was put aboard a boat.  Now Mr. Maximoe had arranged to go out from Collinstown Airport in an aeroplane with Mr. Eindiguer.  Mr. Eindiguer caught the plane.  He left the Royal Marine Hotel at 4 o'clock in the morning, on the morning after he had been interviewed by the two aliens officers.  In calm dignity he emerged at 4 o'clock in the morning and shot away from the door of the hotel, having first thrown Mr. Cooney and then Miss Donnico out of his taxicab, hotly pursued to Collinstown.  He got on the aeroplane; Maximoe did not, but Maximoe's luggage was at the airport. I asked the Minister for Justice what was found in Maximoe's luggage after this unhappy man had destroyed himself. The Minister replied to me that on his person, not his luggage, there was found a sum of £55 19s. 7½d. in Irish and British currency, a dollarnote and 1,000 franc note&mdash;I forget the exact amount.  Did that inventory include what was found in his luggage at Collinstown or has the Minister yet inquired what was found in his luggage at Collinstown?  Maximoe was located at Sachael's house, he was put on board and he jumped overboard, it is believed, to his death.</P>
      <P>The case of Sachael was then inquired into.  Such was his reputation, he was not deported; he was invited to go.  There might have been difficulty in deporting him.  He is one of the gentlemen who by design would have taken the midwives' drive.  He would come expeditiously; he had no home to go to.  Having come without credentials, Sachael became a landed proprietor in this country.  I think Deputy Beegan had the honour of representing him in this House.  Mr. Sachael who had arrived here from nowhere without a passport to transact import and export business&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I doubt not he was looking for a picture of Parnell to hang up in his kitchen.</P>

Sachael is gone, Maximoe is gone, Eindiguer is gone.  But is there any power of attorney for Mr. Eindiguer in existence?

      <P>Eindiguer began in this country as the client of one firm which was lawfully and legitimately entitled to collect a handsome commission on a perfectly ordinary transaction.  If my information is correct, after all this strange story has been told, Eindiguer is the client of another man who holds the power of attorney, a man he had never seen in his life or heard of till he came to Ireland, and the only nexus between them is the tea-party in Árus an Uachtaráin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Am I unduly solicitous?  Is it suggested that I am unreasonably fastidious in finding that transaction unsavoury and deserving of inquiry, or have we sunk to the level in this country that we take it as the norm <Col N="1116" /> that the office and prestige of the President of Ireland should be used for the purpose of lubricating unsavoury transactions?</P>
    <P>What I have here recited is all I know, every syllable and particle of which I communicated to the Minister for Justice before I entered this House and as soon as it came to my knowledge. On the facts as set out by me here, I believe there is a crying need for inquiry.  It is necessary to assure the public, first, that conduct of this character meets with approbation in no responsible quarter and, secondly, to warn future parties that any attempt to turn this country into a banana republic with that kind of chicanery will not for one moment be tolerated and is fore-doomed to failure because there will be found Deputies in Dáil Eireann, if nowhere else, prepared to face the misrepresentation, the insolence, the threats and the blackmail of impudent members of the Government Party rather than recoil from the duty which they owe those who voted for them, to defend truth, to stand for decency, to condemn dirty chicanery of this kind, no matter what its source and whence it comes.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Government to accept this motion.  I assert that they should originally have set it down.  I hope that when they do establish a suitable tribunal, which shall be fearless and impartial, that the air of this country will be cleansed of a very dirty smell and that a standard of conduct will be established, not exalted, not exotic, but just the ordinary standard of honour and decency that up to now has been well known to the vast masses of our people, with instructions from nobody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a little explanation.  I do not want to intervene unless to clear up one point. It is about Senator Quirke.  I did not mention his name last week because I did not know whether the Chair would be prepared to let me do so, and his firm did not think I should.  The evening that Senator Quirke rang me up was the evening of the day the announcement appeared in the paper that this group had been received at Árus <Col N="1117" /> an Uachtaráin.  On that occasion he told me that he only knew of this man Sachael by name and he had no suspicion whatever that Sachael was connected with either Eindiguer or the man who up to that moment was known as Smith.  He was not aware, and neither were we until later, that Smith and Maximoe were the same person.</P>
      <P>It was because of his horror at seeing a man he believed to be a shady man in that company, that he got suspicious of the others.  I want to make that point quite clear.  It was not personal information.  I think someone asked how long did Senator Quirke know him.  He did not know him at all, only in the way business people get to know others, by reputation&mdash;it was only that way.  Senator Quirke had not read the paper until tea-time that evening because he was busy otherwise. When he was having tea at home he read it in the paper and he immediately got alarmed and rang me.</P>

      <P>I think it will be generally agreed that any and every sense of public decency and national pride must have been outraged by the frenzied antics of the Tánaiste here this evening.  Strangers not so familiar with the ease with which the same Minister can indulge in play-acting, must have wondered why, in the motion before the House, moved in the very serious and moderate tone in which it was moved, a Minister should immediately rush into a fanatical passion at white heat and attempt to bulldoze Deputies.  There is no doubt that the Minister's antics were an attempt to bulldoze and intimidate a Deputy who, I believe, is the youngest member of this House.  Why the heat?  Why the intimidation?  And why the attempted bulldozing?  It was all because that Deputy, arising out of questions put to Ministers, had been answered in such an unsatisfactory manner that the Ceann Comhairle thought it right that permission should be given to have the matter raised on the adjournment last Wednesday evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a correction by the master of misrepresentation in this House.  The questions were put down last Wednesday morning and as a result of the unsatisfactory answers given, allegations were made by a Deputy in Dáil Éireann on last Wednesday. What were the allegations? As far as I listened in to that debate, they were (1) that valuable concessions were given by the Minister's Department to financial speculators who were introduced to the Department by a man of immense political importance in the Minister's Party; (2) that in the course of conversations or discussions or meetings <Col N="1119" /> between that particular member of the Minister's Party and a wealthy alien who was interested in a purchase, a suggestion had been made that a watch would be brought into the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Taoiseach's son.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Taoiseach's son.  Then (3) that information was conveyed to the Minister for Justice with regard to the character and past record of one of the people concerned in this particular deal, and (4) that these undesirable characters, unwanted by this country, wanted by Scotland Yard, had been entertained at Árus an Uachtaráin.  As far as I recollect, and as far as I digested the Deputy's statement on Wednesday evening last, the substance of his statement fell within those four lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to that statement by the Deputy and having heard rumours about this city, I, in the absence of Deputy Mulcahy, as acting-leader of this Party, felt to be unwise the line the Minister opposite was taking of interrupting and more or less suppressing discussion.  I felt that it was in the interests of the good name of this country, and of this Parliament and its Government&mdash;and my words are there on record&mdash;to warn the Government that it was unwise to suppress discussion or withhold full information with regard to this particular transaction. In the course of that brief statement&mdash; five minutes in all&mdash;I stated that the <Col N="1120" /> allegations made might be unwarrantable, but that they were being bandied around from mouth to mouth and, because of that, any appearance of suppressing discussion or witholding information would not be in the best interests of the country.  Because of that attitude of mine, I pulled down on my head the frenzied anger and vituperation of the Tánaiste of the present Government.  Is that zeal, is it dignified, does it create a good or a bad impression on anybody, either an Irish national or a foreigner, interested in this particular question, which is an international question?</P>
    <P>Was there anything wrong in the motion there, that the whole thing in the public interest should be inquired into by 11 Deputies of this House, and moved in that moderate tone?  Was there anything in the tone that was provocative or suggestive?  Was there anything unjust in the speech we listened to from the supporters of this motion?  Was there anything that should produce heat nearly to the point of lunatic behaviour?  If there was anything in the statement or speech of the Leader of the Opposition that produced all that heat and ferocity, then it must have been the motion itself.</P>
    <P>Why should we not have a motion to the effect that 11 members of the Dáil should inquire into allegations and, if they were untrue, demonstrate and prove they were untrue and, if they were irresponsible and were not based on reliable information or information believed to be reliable, make them recoil on the Deputy or Deputies who uttered them?  Is there anything in that to produce all that heat, all that ferocity, that attempt to badger, intimidate and bulldoze a young Deputy of this House?  I regard the conduct of the Tánaiste as being next door to scandalous.  I do not believe there was ever a democratic Parliament where there was such a naked attempt to gag discussion on a question. The Taoiseach grunts, but the Taoiseach does not display a very pleasant smile.  It is rather a nasty grin and we had enough of that from his kettle drummer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am putting to the Taoiseach and to the interrupter up there is: &ldquo;Why all the heat, why all the rage?&rdquo; There was nothing in the speech to produce it.  Is it because 11 members of this House have been asked to inquire into the truth of allegations made?  If the allegations have so little foundation as the Minister would have us believe, is there any harm done?  Is there anything to get angry about, anything to get heated about, because an inquiry was asked for?  I object, as a senior member of this Assembly, to any Deputy being treated in the truculent manner in which the Tánaiste attempts to treat a young Deputy who happens to be an Independent, to have no Party and no colleagues.  It would be inexcusable if that particular line of intimidation and bulldozing were taken against one of the most senior members of this House with a large Party around him.  It is quite clear that the Minister does not want a full inquiry and I suggest, as the Leader of this Party suggested earlier to-night, that a tribunal should have been appointed rather than have this discussion to-night.  The type of debate in which the Tánaiste engaged could not produce anything but a debate nationally harmful and nationally discreditable.  It would certainly tempt and provoke any normal Deputy to reply in kind-this business of taking down every word a man spoke&mdash;&ldquo;put that on record&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;you will be called on to swear to that&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;you will get the opportunity of repeating that on oath.&rdquo;  Was there ever such scandalous behaviour on the part of a man occupying a high position and does the Taoiseach approve of his Tánaiste? Anybody with any sense of pride of Parliament, with respect for the years of sacrifice and the countless lives lost to establish an Irish Parliament, with any sense of decency, must have been shocked by such scandalous conduct from any Deputy, but particularly from the man holding the second highest and the second most responsible position in the Parliament.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>And Quirke was a party to it.  Senator Quirke is not so small that he is not to be seen in a room.  The Minister is holding a Punch and Judy show.  Punch is to be produced while Judy is around the corner.  Cooney is produced and Quirke is hidden.  At least this much comes out.  There had been three or four approaches to the Department between April and September, and on each occasion discouragement was given to them with regard to their prospects of increasing their quota of whiskey for export.  In fact, a whole lot of difficulties were put before them. Even according to the statement now, difficulties were put in the way of the purchase of the distillery.  There was no enthusiastic encouragement.  But then the financial syndicate associated with Senator Quirke blows across the carpet into the Department.</P>

      <P>I am standing over the Minister's statement to-night.  I want to be corrected if I am inaccurate. Cooney, plus Quirke, come along and then assurance is given that the export quota will be lifted from 4,000 to 8,000 gallons per annum.  That is admitted by the Minister and it is on record. Prior to the appearance of Senator Quirke there was nothing but toughness and discouragement, rather than enthusiasm.  That is the first point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point: it is admitted by the Minister's colleagues that these <Col N="1124" /> particular deportees were wanted men and that they were entertained at Árus an Uachtaráin.  That is one of the charges made by the Deputy and that is admitted now.</P>
    <P>The third charge made by the Deputy was that this particular gentleman was only deported and another individual was apparently collected by Scotland Yard after a friend of the Government had given information.

      <P>The third allegation made by Deputy Flanagan has been found to be correct. Are we to take it as a perfectly normal thing that people of that character and reputation, with the police of two countries after them, should sail up to Árus an Uachtaráin and be entertained and have their names in the paper?</P>
      <P>The fourth charge is in regard to a watch.  The Minister told a story about a watch.  I have no information beyond what I heard from the two sides of this House.  Even on the Minister's statement, or statements, impartial Deputies will agree that there is something which should be inquired into.  One of the extra things that should be inquired into is why a member of the Government&mdash;the leader's kettle-drummer on the left&mdash;showed such heat at the suggestion that 11 Deputies and Senators should inquire into the allegations made, deal with them, if proved, and repudiate them so that they would hurl back like a boomerang if found to be untrue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not congratulate the Government on the individual they selected to make their case this evening. In spite of the provocation given by the impudent manner in which the Minister has addressed himself to this House to-night, I ask the Head of the Government to ignore the antics of the Tánaiste and to face up to his responsibilities. Amongst those responsibilities is that of keeping the name of this Parliament and country clean.  If he faces up to that responsibility, he will establish this or some other type of tribunal to inquire in full into all details associated with that particular transaction.</P>

I am amazed and astonished at the antics and behaviour of the Tánaiste in this House to-night. He is a long way out if he believes that by shouting loudly across those benches or using threats that I shall have to go before a tribunal and that I will be on my oath he will seal my mouth or &ldquo;cow&rdquo; me so as to prevent me from making statements which I believe to be true.  It is not the first time that his colleagues in the Cabinet, his Leader, the Taoiseach, or other responsible men from the far benches have endeavoured to seal my lips. Whether I am in this House for long or short, I will devote all my energy to trying to expose Government <Col N="1126" /> rackets, many of which are in existence to-day.</P>

It was looked upon as if I were making statements of a fantastic nature to which there was neither beginning nor end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1127" /> In my opening remarks on last Wednesday night, and, previous to that, at Question Time, when I raised the question of the racket concerning the distillery at Kilbeggan, I made a few very important points which were reported both in the daily papers and in the Official Report.  Even on this side of the House, members were inclined to doubt the accuracy of my statements. When I mentioned about these crooks of international fame, these racketeers and gangsters, dining with the President of the State and introduced in his dining-room to the President's wife, I was laughed and jeered at even by members of the Opposition.  They believed that it would not be possible for the President of this State to stoop to the lowest depths of indecency&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only endeavouring to point out the need for the inquiry and how true and accurate my statements made on Wednesday night were when I said these people were entertained at Árus an Uachtaráin.  Even members on this side of the House were inclined to doubt it until the admission came from the Minister for Justice. He said that unfortunately those people did get into Árus an Uachtaráin.  It was unfortunate that they got in but unfortunately they did make their way in there.  Why not have as one of the terms of the reference of the committee to be appointed that they shall inquire as to who was responsible for the introduction, who was responsible for making the necessary arrangements to have those people entertained to tea at Árus an Uachtaráin?  Surely, if citizens of an undesirable character, wanted by the police in a number of countries, can walk into this country and first and foremost select no less exalted person with whom to have tea than the President of the State and his wife I believe that a very good and useful purpose would be served by the establishment of the committee of inquiry asked for here to-night by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party.  That was one of the accusations I made in this House which was admitted by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A second accusation, admitted by the Government, which even the members on this side of the House were inclined to doubt, was that representations were made to the Department of Industry and Commerce by a member of the Oireachtas who was a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I refer to none other than Senator Quirke, who was acting in his official capacity as a representative of the firm of Stokes and Quirke.  I accused the Senator of endeavouring to secure certain concessions for certain people, and to-night the Minister tells us that there were four callers to the Department of Industry and Commerce in connection with the sale of Locke's Distillery.  However, none of the callers who came in connection with Locke's Distillery were welcomed with anything like the welcome which was accorded Senator <Col N="1129" /> Quirke on his arrival.  The export licence for whiskey was increased from 4,000 to 8,000 gallons immediately on the mysterious appearance of Senator Quirke on the floor of the Department of Industry and Commerce in Kildare Street.  An increase of 4,000 gallons of whiskey to be exported was granted because of the appearance of Senator Quirke, who was using his high office as a Senator to advance his interests as an auctioneer.  Is that not the position with which we have been presented? Is that not the reason, A Leas-Chinn Comhairle, why the Government should not back out of an inquiry when such information has been placed at the disposal of this House and at the disposal of the people?  That accounts for two accusations. I made a further accusation which was laughed at not alone by the Government but by some of my colleagues on this side of the House.  I refer to the question of a presentation of a gold watch for the Taoiseach's son.  That was hardly credited by members of this House.  To-night we heard the Tánaiste giving us a cock-and-bull story about the manner in which the Taoiseach's son was to get that watch.  He said Senator Quirke's sister was dangerously ill in a hospital&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>A friend of Senator Quirke was dangerously ill in a hospital and this patient was placed under the very expert and good care of Dr. de Valera.  Through the doctor's good offices and through the proper application of his medical advice this patient was restored to her normal good health.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a mark of appreciation we have been told that Senator Quirke decided to make a present of a gold watch to the Taoiseach's son.  I am putting it to this House, because certainly it will not go up this cuff, that if the Senator wanted to make a presentation had he not many other items with which to present the doctor?  If he wanted a gold watch could he not have gone down to Benson's?  Could <Col N="1130" /> he not have toured some of the very best high-standard jewellery establishments in this city?  Could the Senator not have made inquiries as to whether he might secure a good up-to-date timepiece for the Taoiseach's son in return for the good service he had rendered in restoring his patient to her normal good health?  Was it not a strange coincidence that in Mr. Eindiguer's presence he should spot a watch on his arm and say: &ldquo;I would love a watch like that for the Taoiseach's son?&rdquo; Would one not expect that Senator Quirke would go out and buy a watch instead of going into the details of the illness of his relative as he did with Mr. Eindiguer?  If the Tánaiste's story goes down with certain members of this House it will not go down with me. There is a man in this building to-night who actually saw the watch, who actually had the watch in his hands and said: &ldquo;That is too good a watch for the Taoiseach's son.&rdquo;  That man is going to come forward to give evidence if the inquiry takes place.</P>

      <P>At the opening session of the inquiry, if it is to be undertaken, this question of the watch for the Taoiseach's son will very carefully be gone into.  But no person of proper or sane mind would believe for one moment the story surrounding the circumstances of the Senator getting this watch from Mr. Eindiguer to give to the Taoiseach's son.  The words that were used, according to my informant, who will give his evidence on oath at the opening session of the tribunal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, and you will be there, my boy.  According to my informant, the reason the watch was being given was for the purpose of a softening influence.  I want that recorded in the Official Debates of this House. Therefore, is it not quite clear to the <Col N="1131" /> House, is it not quite clear to the country, is it not quite clear to every broadminded and honest citizen, the allegations I made in this House on last Wednesday night have been admitted by the Government not in one, two or three forms but in all forms.  I hope that my colleagues on this side of the House are even now satisfied and convinced that if the Government succeeds in pulling wool over the eyes of members of the Opposition they will pull no wool over my eyes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been accused in the daily papers and by members of this House of abusing my privilege as a Deputy by naming certain citizens.  I should be long sorry, A Leas-Chinn Comhairle, to abuse my privilege as a Deputy of this House.  I think, however, I have a duty to perform on behalf of the people who sent me here and on behalf of every broadminded and honest citizen in the country by lending a hand towards cleaning up. That is the very reason I have been compelled to name certain people here. That was the position when I rose on last Wednesday night to give the names of those people who were associated with the question of the sale of Locke's Distillery at Kilbeggan.  We have even seen that in the very cagey corners in connection with this sale, even the solicitor, even the legal adviser, had political connections and political affiliations. We even saw that the auctioneer was a Fianna Fáil Senator.  We can read between the lines there.  We have heard the story about the presentation of a gold watch to the Taoiseach's son. We can, also, see the influence used at the Department of Industry and Commerce because when as I asked the Minister at Question Time to-day if a written application had been made to increase the export licence, he replied and said: &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  No written application was made to increase the export licence held by Locke's Distillery from 4,000 gallons to 8,000 gallons.  If I were to go into the Minister's office and to say that there is a man in my constituency in serious difficulties because of lack of kerosene for his tractors and <Col N="1132" /> machines which are held up in the tillage field the first thing I would be asked by the Minister would be if the man had made written application and I would be told that if he had not done so he must do so before an allowance of kerosene could be granted to him.  In this case, however, there was no question of &ldquo;You must make written application&rdquo;.  The Departmental red tape was completely cut.</P>
      <P>The appearance of Senator Quirke turned red tape into action and immediately the export licence, without written application being made, was increased from 4,000 to 8,000 gallons. In every other case the Minister's Department insists on written application being made.  I could name numerous cases for even the tiniest items that constituents would require&mdash; every Deputy in the House is aware of this as well as I am&mdash;in connection with which the first question asked by the civil servant is: &ldquo;Has written application been made?  Then it will be considered.&rdquo; There was no consideration necessary in this case.  The mighty ghost of Fianna Fáil appeared in Kildare Street and an export licence for 4,000 extra gallons of whiskey was given.  Surely when we see a member of the Oireachtas using his position as Senator to advance his interests as an auctioneer, it is something which stands for investigation and which should be investigated.</P>
      <P>I believe that I have been of national service in raising this matter.  I believe that the national service that I perform will not be completed until the results of an inquiry are made known. Senator Quirke has asked for the inquiry and would not we love to see that inquiry coming off to find out how this Mr. Sweeney got those people into Árus an Uachtaráin?  He used his relationship with the President.  He happens to be a nephew of the President.</P>

That is something which should come before the inquiry for consideration.  Deputy Dillon and other Deputies have made enquiries and have given information to the House concerning the activities of those aliens who came over here for the purpose of purchasing this distillery. One man's name was Sachael. I understand that since I raised this matter first in the House, on Wednesday night last, Sachael has gone from the country.  There was no question of making an order to deport Sachael, but Sachael was just politely asked to leave.</P>

      <P>I say that the Minister for Justice had the question of his deportation under review some time ago.  It was cancelled simply because it was understood that Sachael was about to sell his farm in Gort, in Deputy Beegan's constituency, and the moment the question of Locke's Distillery arose Mr. Sachael said: &ldquo;I cancel the sale of my farm in Gort now because I want a nice country residence in Galway.  I am going to be a director of the new distillery company&rdquo;.  It did not materialise but it was very, very near it.</P>

I am prepared to lend a hand and to co-operate with the Government in every way to expose rackets of this nature and to see that a speedy end is put to the racketeering that is going on and which probably will go on if somebody does not make an attempt to clear it up.

      <P>&ldquo;Evidence has come to light that behind the scenes the game was to sell whiskey in the black market in England or elsewhere and actually 60,000 had been offered to a firm in London at £11 per gallon who would have netted £660,000, out of which the purchase, lock, stock and barrel of Ireland's oldest distillery would be simply a matter of £305,000.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach or does the Minister believe that if we have a public-spirited citizen prepared to come forward on oath and prove evidence of this nature that the Government should refuse to hold an inquiry to investigate it?  If the Government refuses to hold an inquiry to investigate a matter of this nature I believe the country will go completely into ruin, and that you will have nothing in this country but rackets and racketeers and that Eire will be turned into a gangsters' paradise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the Government and on the Taoiseach with all the force, eloquence and might that I can put into my speech to consider every word that has come from the lips of Deputy O'Higgins, Deputy Mulcahy, Deputy Dillon and myself and of those who have endeavoured to co-operate in having this racket exposed.  I ask that the Government in their wisdom may see fit to accept the motion that has been so ably presented to the House by Deputy Mulcahy.  The motion merely asks for an investigation and that the facts be made known.  I sincerely hope and trust that the Government will do that on a careful consideration of the accusations that have been made and on the Government's own admission of the allegation I made here last Wednesday night.  I am very pleased that the Minister for Justice, the responsible head in charge, has admitted that there was truth in the allegations that I have made in this House, because it certainly vindicates me.  It clears me in the eyes of the <Col N="1137" /> people.  I was not talking this time&mdash; as the Minister for Industry and Commerce always says I am&mdash;trash.  There was no trash this time.  They were solid facts.  I was well briefed and properly briefed.  This case of Locke's Distillery is only one of many to come. I want the Taoiseach and the Ministers of the Government responsible listening to me, to be expecting more and further, because it was brought out in the Ward inquiry&mdash;it was said here in this House and I am the Deputy who said it&mdash;that there was no difference between Dr. Ward and any of the front benchers on the Government.  The only difference was that Dr. Ward was caught out and they are not caught out yet.  That was the only difference.</P>

      <P>As one of my colleagues remarked as I stood up, this is evidently going to be a slander factory.  There was an enquiry into the case of Dr. Ward.  The result of that enquiry was to prove that he was not guilty of corruption in his public office.  He was found guilty of not making a full disclosure of sales as a business man.  Now we are told that there was corruption.  It was implied that there was corruption.  Every time that an election is in the offing we have this charge against the Government. We have a Deputy in this House pointing to the members of the Government and saying that every one of them is guilty of corruption.  It is a lie.</P>

      <P>If the Deputies who say that they are interested in the <Col N="1138" /> honour of our country and of this Parliament had presented this case in a reasonable manner as people would who are interested in that, and solely interested in it, I think there would have been no trouble. But there were by-elections on, and it was not sufficient to suggest that there was public anxiety about certain strangers who came into this country: it was necessary to suggest that they were brought in by the Government, and that the Government was responsible for everything they did.</P>
      <P>Now, let us try, as calmly as we can, to unravel this thing and see exactly what is in it.  In so far as there is any charge against the Government, it is right and proper that it should be inquired into.  The moment charges of that sort are raised, the Government has to give an inquiry, inevitably.  I say that every member of the House has a responsibility to see that these inquiries are held into the things that it is right for this House to inquire into. Is it suggested that if there is some individual, some shady individual engaged in some deal or other in the country, that the Government is responsible for that, that the Government is responsible for the character and conduct of every person who comes into the country?  Of course, no Government could be responsible for that.  The Tánaiste has pointed out that a certain man from Switzerland came in here, that he was introduced by Irish citizens and apparently they accepted him as a colleague in some business enterprise.  It transpired from what appeared in the newspapers&mdash;this was the beginning as far as Government knowledge was concerned&mdash;that with this man who came in there was associated another man who was in some way suspect.  The moment it became known that this man was in the company of a suspected person enquiries were set on foot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing, in fact, that was done was that the Minister for Justice rang me up and told me that it had appeared in the papers that certain gentlemen had been received by the President and that one of the persons in question was one about whose conduct the Department of Justice was not <Col N="1139" /> at all satisfied.  I immediately made it my duty to go to the President and tell him so.  It is suggested here by a Deputy that because certain people of that type did happen to visit the President that the President stooped down to do this.  Is there no possibility that people can be mistaken?  Is there no possibility that people of a shady character can be introduced?  Is there no question of the President receiving these people in good faith? I myself receive hundreds of people in the course of the year.  I have to ask myself: &ldquo;Will I see them or will I not see them&rdquo;?  I generally try to get some information if I can.  If a friend that I happen to know brings them along and I have no reason to be unduly suspicious, I see them, and very often the result of seeing them is valuable from the point of view of our country.  Are we to take up the attitude that we are not going to be disturbed and that we are going to take the telephone off the rest for some particular period?  I think that if we were to adopt that attitude it would generally be found that the very time during which you had made up your mind not to attend to a call was the time that somebody who should have been seen would have to go away. You could not possibly do business on that basis, and Deputy Dillon knows it quite well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the President's secretary is a civil servant, I say that, in a case like that, no member of the staff could have provided for it, and the Deputy knows that as well as I do. If somebody that the President knew introduced some people, do you think that a member of the staff could come along and tell the President that he was not to receive these people?  The President is not in a position publicly to defend himself.  It is my business to see that he is defended when his name is introduced, and it is my business to see that his staff, who are civil servants, are also defended.  The only thing that can be said so far as the President is concerned is that these people did happen to find access to him. <Col N="1140" /> Of course, instead of taking the ordinary commonsense view of that, it is suggested that it was to make the deal easy.  In other words, the suggestion is that the President was going to use his position to ask for special facilities for the people he had received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have as much experience of secretaries as the Deputy, and no secretary could have said to the President in these circumstances: &ldquo;You are not to receive these people.&rdquo;  If a person who is related to the President makes a mistake, does not know the people he is dealing with and introduces them, I say that no member of the staff could have told the President: &ldquo;You must not do that.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I know nothing about the papers.  We have all sorts of details thrown across the House in order to cloud the real issue.  The real issue, so far as the President is concerned, and I am more interested in that aspect of it than any other, is that when the President received these people I am perfectly certain, although I did not put such a question to him, that he knew nothing about the character of the people, good, bad or indifferent.  They were introduced to him.  I can only guess, because I did not ask the President the question, that these people were introduced by a person whom he knew.  Under these circumstances, it is most unfair to suggest that the staff had any responsibility, unless the staff knew these people were wrong.  If they did, then they would have a responsibility. Underlying it all is the suggestion that the President knew and that the staff knew things that were not known to them, things that were not even known to the Government, and which only became known to the Government by the attention of the Minister for Justice being called to one name.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out what is the clear implication.  Deputy Mulcahy can rise in a very calm and judicial way and make the case for this and then the people who come after him can make the suggestions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly, the suggestions have been that the President's office was going to be used with the President's knowledge for the purpose, as was suggested in another connection, of &ldquo;softening the deal&rdquo;.  I say <Col N="1142" /> we shall have an inquiry into that.  But I want the members of the House and the people of the country to know that these are the suggestions that have been made and that there is not a single word of truth in the suggestion that the President was going to use his office or permit his office to be used for any improper purpose.  The only thing that emerges from it is that certain people did find access to him, some of whom were of a shady character.  The only thing that can be said in that whole connection is that the safeguards were not sufficient to prevent that, and I say that no safeguards can be devised which will completely and absolutely prevent that sort of thing.</P>
      <P>Now let me come to the next point. It has been suggested that a proposed present to my son was to &ldquo;soften the deal&rdquo;; in other words, that I and my son were of such a character that we could, by the present of a watch to him, be induced to do what the President in the other connection was supposed to do, namely, use our influence to get the Minister for Industry and Commerce or somebody else to abuse his position and give certain concessions.  Is there a single member of the House who believes that?  Yet, that is the clear implication of the suggestion that has been made, and we are ourselves to set up an inquiry to inquire into just that sort of thing.  The only reason we have to inquire into it is to make clear to the public the way that they are being abused.</P>
      <P>The honour of this country is something which everyone of us ought to be jealous of.  To seek to make it appear that the President of the State and Head of the Government are of such a type that they can be used to get concessions for strangers if they get some reward or other I think is damnable.  I think the whole thing is such as to make it very hard for any decent person to remain in public life in this country, and that is what some of the people making these suggestions are aiming at&mdash;that we will not have any honourable or honest man going up to represent the people, because he can be attacked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then they say: &ldquo;You can be cleared by an inquiry&rdquo;, but when you are <Col N="1143" /> cleared by an inquiry, then the result of the inquiry is forgotten.  Dr. Ward was cleared, and the charges against him were found, by a tribunal, so far as his public office was concerned, to have been recklessly made.  Is that part remembered?  When people talk of Dr. Ward in public, do they remember that?  No, they do not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to state the Government's attitude towards this motion.  On a previous occasion, when there were suggestions in the House with regard to inquiries, I pointed out that I did not believe at all that in matters of this sort a political committee was a proper committee.  The only way in which anybody in the House who wants to be satisfied will be satisfied, or in which the country can be satisfied, is by setting up a judicial inquiry.  We cannot have this matter settled on the basis of five or six people from one side and five or six people from the other.  The only type of inquiry which will satisfy our people in any matter of this sort is a judicial inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>With proper terms of reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With proper terms of reference.  That is the inquiry we propose&mdash;we oppose this motion because it seeks to have an inquiry by a different type of tribunal&mdash;and, as on a previous occasion, we will bring in a motion proposing the setting up of a judicial tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Who will be charged with responsibility for eliciting facts? The trouble about a judicial inquiry is that unless the Government charge somebody&mdash;not themselves but somebody&mdash;to elicit information, as in other inquiries of the kind, the judges find themselves with nobody to elicit facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the whole question raised here by the Tánaiste this evening was: What are the charges and who is going to stand behind them?  He was trying to get an answer to that question the whole time.  I take it that the Deputies here who made the charges will be prepared to be the accusers and that the tribunal, when set up, will, as on a previous occasion, arrange for the rest. We are anxious that the Deputies who made the insinuations will come forward and be the accusers and will bring forward the people who, they say, have the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is suggested that these inquiries can be lightly undertaken.  The fact is <Col N="1147" /> that, as the Opposition knows, the making of charges of this sort leaves no course open to the Government but to have an inquiry, and even if the Government thinks the charges are completely unfounded, is convinced that they are unfounded, we nevertheless have to set up these inquiries and have to go to all the expense involved, dragging in people from outside who may have no desire whatever to be involved and who may have no connection with it.  All this thing must be done, unless there is some sense of responsibility.</P>
    <P>Taking the two cases made up to the present, the President, first, is charged.  I ask any Deputy if he thinks for one moment that the charge is true. Next, I am charged, because there is a charge against me.  What would be the sense of speaking about the giving of a watch to my son, unless it was suggested that my son, getting the watch, was going to influence me, or that he or I was going to influence the Minister for Industry and Commerce, because I take it it was he who was to be influenced in this matter?  I knew nothing whatever about it and my son knew nothing about it.  I was just in the same position as I would be in if Deputy Flanagan came in here and said that somebody was going to give a diamond ring or a pearl necklace to my wife.  Is there to be any decency whatever in public life?</P>
    <P>The next suggestion made was that the Minister for Justice somehow connived at all this, that he was aware of these people and what they were doing, as if the Minister could know everything happening in the country, know every deal and transaction that was taking place.  Deputy Flanagan says that Sachael was a friend of his and that this man Maximoe was sheltered in the house of a friend of the Minister.  Is there any Deputy in the House who believes that for a moment?  Yet, we are going to have a judicial inquiry to find out if that is true.</P>
    <P>Then we have the charges against the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He has indicated to-night <Col N="1148" /> what the position was as far as he was concerned.  Is it suggested by the Deputy who pointed his finger at every one of us and who said that the only trouble was that we were all crooks, but that we had not been found out, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was influenced by these people, or that he knew that one or other of them was a crook, or that the people who were dealing with the matter in any way were crooks?  So far as I understand, the people who were dealing with them in the first place were the secretary of the company which has the distillery for sale, and the company's solicitors, and the only thing about which the Minister was concerned was that the distillery should be carried on as an Irish business concern and that if there was to be an export business in connection with it, it would be of a limited amount.  It is suggested that the amount was increased.  Let that be inquired into.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I say it was suggested that the amount was increased for some improper reason.  Is that not the suggestion, that it was increased for an improper reason?  I do not believe it, and I do not believe there is an honest Deputy in this House who believes it in his heart.  Yet, because it suited certain people to make these allegations in public, whilst the by-elections were on, with the object of throwing all the mud they could, in the belief that some of it would stick, we are going to have a judicial inquiry.  We are going to have judges spending their time.  We are going to have a big expenditure of public money because it suited certain people to make these suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion is, as everybody knows, that there were two of these people in here who were apparently shady characters.  They were pursued by the Minister for Justice and put out of the country.  So far as the other one is concerned, nobody has been able so far to find anything against him except that he happened to be with <Col N="1149" /> these people.  I do not know whether he was deceived by these people or not. I do not know enough about that, but it has been stated that Maximoe, or Smith as he was called when he came in here, came as an interpreter.  One of them suggested that that was the capacity in which he came and, as far as I know, that is correct.  Is it not possible that a businessman looking for an interpreter could come across a person of that sort and be deceived by him?  Is that not the whole technique of crooks, to deceive honest men?  As a rule, they are not able to deceive other people, but they sometimes deceive honest people.  I, at any rate, until it is proved to the contrary&mdash;I may be completely wrong, as I know nothing about him&mdash;think it a more rational explanation that Maximoe deceived Eindiguer than that they were colleagues in an enterprise either to buy or sell in the black market a distillery or anything else.  First of all, we were told quite definitely that 66,000 gallons was the amount concerned, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that that could not be the case because they had not that much mature whiskey and, secondly, they could not get permission to send it out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Or immature whiskey?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Dillon thinks that there is some point about mature whiskey for black marketing, and that there was a good sale for immature spirits, I can tell him that they could not get out mature or immature spirits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is wonderful what they could get out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is wonderful what the imagination of anybody who wants to think wrongly of another person can think of.  It is wonderful what the imagination of certain people can do if they want to attribute wrong motives to other people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, there is an accusation against the Government of corruption, because that is the word that has been most used throughout the country by Deputies who want to blacken members of the Government, because they have <Col N="1150" /> not themselves a decent policy to put before the country.  The only thing they can do in the country is to try to blacken the fame and the reputation of decent people.</P>
