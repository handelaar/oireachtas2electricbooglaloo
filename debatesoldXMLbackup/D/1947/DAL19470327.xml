      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state, arising out of his visit to London, what are the prospects of securing increased supplies of coal for essential needs for this country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I discussed fully with the British Ministers the very serious situation in which this country finds itself by reason of the recent suspension of our imports of coal.  I explained to them the gravity of the consequences which would be involved if the resumption of exports of coal from Great Britain is not permitted immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the British Ministers fully understood the grave and urgent character of our difficulties and expressed themselves as anxious to help us meet them, they naturally emphasised to me the very serious difficulties with which they have themselves been confronted in recent weeks as a result of the interruption of the production and transportation of coal in Great Britain by abnormal weather conditions.  I was, however, given an assurance that our position would receive early consideration and that the Minister for Fuel and Power would authorise such exports of coal as circumstances in Great Britain may permit. Since my return, a cargo of 3,500 tons of coal has been made available to Córas Iompair Éireann and 500 tons of coke have been released for export to the Dublin Gas Company, but I <Col N="316" /> have not yet been informed of the date and scale on which regular shipments may be resumed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he consulted the local parish council in Clondalkin before setting up the present emergency fuel depôt; if he is aware that this depôt is not suitable for the needs of the locality; if he will state the reasons why his Department refused to allow the local parish council to deal with the situation; and if his Department refused to give the parish council permission to purchase turf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no foundation for the suggestion that my Department refused to allow the Clondalkin Parish Council to deal with the fuel situation there during the recent bad weather, or refused to give the council permission to purchase turf.  Had the parish council approached my Department in the matter, their assistance would have been welcomed.  I am not clear as to the particular depôt to which the question refers as no fuel depôt was set up by my Department in Clondalkin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the serious fuel situation in Balbriggan at the moment; if he will state if anything can be done to relieve this situation; if he is prepared to direct that timber felled locally shall be used primarily to meet the local demands; and further, if he is aware that the people of Balbriggan will be in a position to obtain turf supplies from County Meath provided they are granted permission to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the fuel position in Balbriggan has recently been very difficult, but everything possible has been and will continue to be done to ease matters.  I have no power to direct that timber felled locally shall be used primarily to meet the local demand, and I do not consider <Col N="317" /> that such action generally would be in the public interest.  Neither would it be in the public interest to waive in favour of one particular locality the established regulations governing the movement of turf from the turf area to the non-turf area.  In any event, whilst individuals in Balbriggan might be able to get some supplies from Meath, the over-all turf position in that county leaves no surplus for export to Balbriggan or elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilBlanel" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether the Donegal Flour Milling Company, Milford, County Donegal, and Ballisodare Flour Milling Company, County Sligo, are being supplied with wheat of a quality inferior to that supplied to Dublin and other flour-milling companies throughout the country; and if so, if he will state the reasons, if any, why the Donegal and Ballisodare Flour Mills are not being given the same quality of wheat as that supplied to other mills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The distribution of wheat is officially controlled only in the case of imported wheat.  The Milford (Donegal) Flour Mills, Limited, and W. &amp; G.T. Pollexfen &amp; Company, Limited, Ballisodare, are being supplied with imported wheat of the same quality as that supplied to Dublin and other flour-milling companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilBlanel" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand from the Minister's reply that the Milford and Ballisodare flour mills are supplied with the same quality of wheat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as native wheat is concerned, millers are entitled to purchase their quota anywhere in the country that they can obtain it and there is no official regulation of such purchases.  Official control is exercised only in the case of imported wheat, and in the case of imported wheat these companies are getting the same quality of wheat, in the same proportion in relation to their total supplies, as other flour mills.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilBlanel" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The extraordinary thing about it is that the bread produced by bakeries getting a supply of flour from those mills is of a very inferior quality to that produced by bakeries getting a supply of flour from other mills.  On making inquiries at the Milford flour mill, I was given to understand that in regard to the amount of American flour imported here, a greater proportionate quantity was supplied to the Dublin mills than to the Ballisodare and Milford mills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There is a uniform admixture of foreign wheat in the grist of all mills.  It is the same for all mills in the country.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the reason for the rejection of a number of applications for an extra bread ration made by foremen or gangers, employed at road work, by the Cork County Council, whose hours of work, nature of work, and inability to have a midday meal at home are similar to members of their gangs whose applications have been granted; and if he will examine all such cases further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply I gave on March 20th was that gangers employed on road work in circumstances similar to ordinary road workers are entitled to a supplementary allowance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They were refused because the applications made by them appeared to convey the idea that their duties were mainly supervisory.  Where they are supervisory, no supplementary allowance is granted, but where they are working there is an allowance.</P>

    <P>This country's supplies of tea for the year ending 31st March, 1947, were fixed by the International Emergency Food Council at a figure of 18,000,000 lbs., which is being made available from the British Ministry of Food re-export quota for that period.  This tea is allocated by the British Ministry of Food to wholesale tea merchants in this country on the basis of their purchases of tea in the period of 12 months ended 30th June, 1939, and the wholesale merchants in turn make deliveries to their tea retailer customers on the same basis.  Maximum wholesale and retail prices of tea are fixed by Order on the basis of the average import cost of tea and of providing reasonable profit margins for the distributive trade.</P>

      <P>I am informed that the chairman of the Committee of Management of Cumann an Árachais Náisiúnta ar Shláinte gave evidence before the Labour Court on behalf of the society in connection with staff applications for court wages orders.  My authority was not required.  I am aware that the actuary has advised that there is a disposable surplus for expenditure on benefits amounting to £250,000 per annum during the quinquennium commencing on the 1st April next.  I am not aware that, apart from an emergency bonus of 16/- weekly, the staff of the society have received no increase in remuneration since 1939.  I understand that increases were granted in 1940 and that all salary scales were again revised, following the application to the Labour Court, with effect as from the 10th December last.  It is estimated that the society's expenditure on staff remuneration in the current year will amount to over £120,000, as compared with approximately £80,000 in 1939&mdash;an over-all increase of about 50 per cent.; in the same period, the total staff decreased by 17.</P>

Recently, this vessel pursued and arrested a trawler off the Blasket Islands and escorted her to Valentia under a charge of fishing inside territorial waters and refusing to heave to when ordered.

We are to be expected to go back and discuss the problems and proposals which were so contentious, both in their nature and in the manner of their presentation last year, in the second and most important part of the financial period.  We all had occasion, at the beginning of the session last year, to feel that the House was being very much abused in that, at a time when very serious financial and economic problems required clear and calm review and discussion here, the time of the House, which should have been devoted to that discussion, was devoted to the measure which is now to disappear from the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there were important and urgent problems to be discussed this time last year, they are more urgent and important now, I suggest, and, in the financial discussions about to take place in April and May, the whole attention of the Parliament should be induced and helped to concentrate on these, so that we may not find ourselves overlooking something which ought to be foreseen in the way in which many things were, no doubt, overlooked last year because of the turmoil into which the discussions of the House were thrown by the debate on the Public Health Bill.  I urgently appeal to the Government not to ask the House during the next two months at any rate to go back and discuss any proposals with regard to public health, so long as there are various Estimates dealing with the most serious part of our economy, so long as there are proposals dealing with our financial position, and the Budget, to <Col N="340" /> be discussed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three matters in connection with this Estimate to which I wish to direct the attention of the Minister for Justice, the first being the position of the widows of Guards. As things stand at the present time, if a Guard dies while he is an active member of the force, his widow, I believe, is entitled to a pension of £30 per annum and £10 in respect of each child under the age of 16, with the result, of course, that most women finding themselves in these distressing circumstances are constrained to part with their children to their relatives, if they can persuade their relatives to take them, and go out and work in order to try to maintain themselves and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to harrow the feelings of the House by a description of what this has meant to some women of my acquaintance who found themselves so circumstanced but I do put it to the Minister for Justice that the hardship which is manifestly involved by this arrangement would be greatly mitigated by a very simple expedient.  At the present time Gardaí, though doing work which <i>prima facie</i> suggests that they ought to stamp national health insurance cards, are by regulation made by him, doubtless in consultation with the Minister for Finance, exempted from the obligation to stamp national health insurance cards and are thereby deprived of the right to leave to their widows the assurance of a contributory widow's pension in the event of the Guard's premature death.  It is natural that the Gardaí should not ordinarily contribute to the national health insurance scheme in order to qualify for national health benefits because there is a full health service provided free of charge as part of their amenities. But if the Minister would require the National Health Insurance Society to make an actuarial calculation of what annual sum payable by the Minister to the National Health Insurance Society would be sufficient to indemnify the society for providing contributory widows' and orphans' pensions to members of the Garda I think he would find that the sum would be a small <Col N="343" /> one and we would then have the situation that the widow of a Guard would receive her £30 plus £10 for each child and, in addition, a contributory pension under the national health insurance scheme which would leave her, not in conditions of affluence, but at least with a reasonable modicum of security against absolute destitution and becoming a burden on her relatives unless she happened to be able to qualify as a maternity nurse or for some other walk of life in which she could earn her living and provide for such children as have come to bless her marriage.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the Borstal.  I am glad to observe from the Minister's opening statement that he now shares my view that Clonmel Jail is no fit place in which to have a Borstal and that he hopes some day to erect a new building on the land which he has acquired outside the City of Dublin as a site.  I remember last year Monsignor Flanagan turned up in this country and went galumphing around and read a book and got his photograph taken a great many times and made a variety of speeches to tell us what a wonderful man he was, what marvels he had achieved in the United States of America, and he then went back to America and published a series of falsehoods and slanders.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is carefully excogitated and deliberately uttered.  In my respectful judgment they were flagrantly in conflict with the elementary obligations not only of charity but of justice.  There is no more vigilant critic than I am of the Minister's activities in regard to prison, Borstal and industrial school administration, but when a Catholic monsignor uses language which appears to give the colour of justification for the cartoons in the American papers where muscular warders are seen flogging half-naked 14 year old boys with cat-o'-nine tails, then I think it is right to say in public of that monsignor that he should examine his conscience and ask himself, (1), if he has spoken the truth, and (2) <Col N="344" /> if he has considered the obligations of justice and charity.  If his conscience tells him that he has failed in one of these regards, I suggest to him that example is very much better than precept, and that it might be a useful thing, if he finds on closer investigation that the substance of what he is alleged to have said is grossly untrue, that he should have the moral courage to come out in public and say so, and correct in so far as he can the grave injustice he has done not only to the legislature of this country but to the decent, respectable men who are members of the Irish Christian Brothers, to the warders in our prisons and to the warders in the Borstal, and to the other individuals who are looking after young persons in the various places of detention provided by the State.</P>
      <P>Now, I am not to be taken as suggesting that the conditions obtaining here are ideal, or anything like it.  I have repeatedly stated in this House that I think them very far from ideal. I do not want to make any invidious comparisons between the care and solicitude shown for delinquents in this country&mdash;juveniles or adults&mdash;with that shown in the United States of America.  They have their own problems, but having, as emphatically as I can, rebutted the farrago of ill-informed nonsense for which Monsignor Flanagan was responsible, I want to urge on the Minister that the natural indignation caused by the monsignor's follies, and worse than follies, should not force me into the position of defending, without qualification, many things that exist in our prison, Borstal and reformatory school system which call for early attention and remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position with regard to Borstal here is that that was a system evolved in Great Britain in the not very remote past.  Great Britain has a peculiar problem.  She has a peculiar kind of population.  Hers is a great industrial population; ours is mainly a rural agricultural population, and institutions readily adaptable in Great Britain would require very considerable adaptation before they could be fitted into our particular mode of life.  In Great Britain, for many years, the Borstal was a kind of modified prison, a juvenile <Col N="345" /> prison, but under the administration of, I think, Sir Samuel Hoare, sweeping reforms were carried into effect, so that the old-fashioned system of Borstal treatment has completely vanished there.  Its place has been taken by a system of approved schools, the atmosphere of which closely approximates to that of the boarding-school to which any of us might have gone.</P>
    <P>There are various categories into which these adolescent delinquents are divided.  One school will accommodate the very intractable; another school will accommodate the problem boy; and the third type of school will be designed for the fellow who stands in need of very little else but normal discipline. There are no keys or railings or school uniforms.  The boys are treated, in so far as it is possible to treat them, as senior school boys. They repeatedly escape.  It is one of the hallmarks of the excellence of the system that it is perfectly easy to escape, but 90 per cent. of them never try to escape.  On occasion, shocking things happen.  Recently, in one of these approved schools in England, six boys were misled by two really bad lads into planning a murderous attack upon the headmaster, in the course of which one of the assistant masters was actually murdered.</P>
    <P>Many weak-minded people, in the presence of a tragedy of that kind, are frightened, and, in recoiling from the experiment, will cry out for padlocks and chains and bars.  Of course, nothing could be more foolish in the effort to reform boys whose lives have been hopelessly misused and warped. There are bound to be dangers and difficulties, and it is an edifying and splendid thing that you will find a body of teachers, such as there are in Great Britain, who are ready to face these dangers and do face them.  In the interests of the boys they are looking after they avoid all appearance of being jailers, or of having about their persons weapons to meet violence in case it should arise.  They do that even though experience has taught them that violence may occasionally arise.</P>
    <P>From that picture I want to turn to the grim spectacle in this country. Clonmel Jail was probably built in the <Col N="346" /> 18th century or the early part of the 19th century.  It is all that a jail might be expected to be.  The men looking after the inmates of that institution are dressed in warders' uniforms.  Now, you may explain until the cows come home to an adolescent youth that he is not going to jail: that he is going to a Borstal school, but if you bring him in through a 14-foot wooden door, studded all over with large iron nails, and he is there received by a body of men who are dressed in the same uniform that prison warders are dressed in, if he is then put into an apartment which is manifestly a prison cell albeit the door is left open and he is not strictly confined like the penal servitude prisoner &mdash;while it may appear to experienced men of our age that he is not in jail&mdash; the average youth of 16 or 17 going in there will feel that, if he is not in jail, he is in something very like a jail.  He is not interested in philosophical distinctions.  When we get one of these fellows who is manifestly on the high road to damning his soul and wrecking his life, our concern ought to be when he comes into the custody of the State&mdash;because it is no longer possible to leave him at large&mdash;to provide him with an environment and treatment which is best calculated to eradicate from his nature the flaws that brought him to where he now is, and to equip him to go out into the world at the end of his three years' detention with a fair chance of getting his feet under him and turning himself into a decent citizen.  The results in England, I think, were that as high as 70 per cent. never come into the hands of the police again.</P>
    <P>Of course, that is an immense achievement because the courts do not send a fellow to Borstal unless they regard him as virtually hopeless.  I heard Deputy Commons, in the very measured speech he made here last night, plead with the Minister not to put first offenders in alongside hardened criminals.  No court in this country ever put a first offender into prison or Borstal.  They are always, and rightly so, given chances: put on probation.  Every conceivable resource is exhausted before they are ultimately locked up and, therefore, it is a great <Col N="347" /> mistake to over-sentimentalise about the fellows in Borstal.  They are tough eggs; they would never have got into Borstal if they were not.  Every one of them has had several chances.  It is often a moving story to hear some middle-aged superintendent of the Gardaí in Dublin saying: &ldquo;I know that fellow well.  He had me persecuted trying to get him straightened out, talking to his mother and father, warning the boy, keeping an eye on him until, for his own good, we had to take him to Borstal&rdquo;.  Nothing is more fantastic&mdash;that the courts go out after children or young men&mdash;youths&mdash;and ram them into jail.  My experience is that the courts are very patient and that very often a penalty is not inflicted but ultimately some of them find their way into Borstal.</P>
    <P>I want to see here in this country such a school as is at present available for these boys in Great Britain and, mark this well, in Belfast.  It has not been beyond the resources of the Northern Government to provide a Borstal with suitable equipment, suitable surroundings, and a truly admirable spirit where&mdash;to their eternal credit&mdash;not only their social conduct but their spiritual welfare is solicitously looked after and no trouble is thought too much to build these boys up and restore them to the world as decent citizens.  I want to say this. It is something I am ashamed of, but if the Right Reverend Monsignor to whom I have already referred had employed prudent language and stated the truth instead of the farrago of nonsense he did, we might have had reason to blush, because he could have said a great deal that we might have felt constrained to apologise for and most especially about the Borstal.  I am told that building priorities make it impossible for the Minister to erect a Borstal as early as he would like.</P>
    <P>We are dealing not only in the physical health of adolescent youths&mdash; to-morrow to be men&mdash;we are dealing in immortal souls, and I put it to the Minister for Justice that there is no priority which can conceivably take precedence over the opportunity to save the immortal soul of one of our fellowcitizens <Col N="348" /> from damnation, and surely some of these boys are certainly as fated, if it is possible to say that of another human creature, to damn their souls if they do not get the kind of support and assistance they now stand in need of as it is possible to be.  On these grounds alone, I ask the Minister for Justice to approach the Government and to ask for a first priority both on revenue and supply to get an institution built where real justice can be done to these wayward and pseudo-criminal youths and a genuine effort made to reclaim them to the nation.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I will say no more about the Borstal this year but, with the help of God, if I am still a member of this House I will have plenty to say this time 12 months if more vigorous measures are not taken to provide the amenities which are manifestly urgently necessary, and which I believe the Minister for Justice in his heart knows are urgently necessary if individuals are not to be denied at the hands of the State in whose custody they are the minimum protection they are entitled to expect.</P>
    <P>The question of juvenile delinquency has been raised.  The Borstal cook caters for a different calibre.  There is a lot of speculation about the causes of juvenile delinquency.  Many people fall into the error of imagining that juvenile delinquency is a characteristic symptom of poverty.  Statistics prove that that is not true.  Juvenile delinquency is to be found in the families of the comparatively well-to-do just as frequently as it is in the families of the very poor.</P>
    <P>Probably if the statistics were complete, it would emerge that juvenile delinquency occurs more frequently in the families of the well-to-do, because remember if the son of any member of this House played ball in the street or broke a window, is it likely that he would be brought before a police court? Would the neighbours go to the police about him?  They would not.  They would come around and knock on our door and say: &ldquo;Tommy broke the window, what are you going to do about it?&rdquo; and we would go out with <Col N="349" /> a nice speech and say: &ldquo;We will send the glazier and fix it up&rdquo;; and there would be a lot of tarara-boom-de-ay and there would be no more about it. But take a young kid from Gloucester Street who takes it into his head to break a window.  Very quickly the Guards pick him up and admonish him, but if he keeps it up, as unfortunately he often does, he is brought before the magistrate.</P>
    <P>I beg Deputies to mark this clearly &mdash;no juvenile delinquent was ever sent, except by one magistrate who shall be nameless and who was a bit &ldquo;daft&rdquo;, to an industrial school on his first, second or third offence.  Every conceivable resource is exhausted.  The probation officer looks after him and it is only when it is manifest that there is nothing else to do, he is taken from his family.  That is as it should be. But bear in mind that a great many of the children of the middle class and well-to-do do not come within that experience because, long before it becomes necessary for the court to deal with them, their own parents take them to a doctor and say: &ldquo;This young fellow is terrible; he has been repeatedly punished for smashing up the furniture and yet, if you take your eye off him, he goes on purposelessly with the smashing.&rdquo;  Almost invariably, the physician or psychologist, after a period, discovers that there is something wrong, pschologically or physically with the youngster.  That defect being rectified, the whole problem is resolved and the child becomes normal again.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the fundamental point I want to discuss.  When a juvenile who is guilty of incorrigibly bad conduct is brought before the juvenile court up in the Castle and accused of having repeatedly and deliberately gone out and smashed the public lamps, the justice is told that he has been warned, and the Gardaí have brought him home to his people, that they have chastised him and that, still, out he pops at the first opportunity and commences to throw stones at the lamps.  The only course open to the district justice is to send him to an industrial school where there happens to <Col N="350" /> be a vacancy for a committed child. If that child were taken to a competent doctor, he might very easily find that there was some physical or psychological defect in his make-up. The very fact of making it impossible for him to break lamps, without correcting the defect out of which that desire grew, will, in his adolescence, turn him into that very kind of pervert which is the most difficult prolem the Garda and educational authorities have to deal with.  The comparatively harmless safety valve of smashing lamps has heretofore sublimated his particular complex.  Cut him off from that completely, thrust it underground and it breaks out in some entirely different direction at a later stage of his life in a form desperately difficult to control and well calculated to bring misery and wretchedness not only to himself but to all related to him and responsible for him.  All this because we will not provide what almost every civilised country provides&mdash;a clinic to which a child habitually brought before the children's court can be referred on remand so that, when he is brought back before the district justice to be disposed of finally, the district justice will have before him the report of competent observers as to the true cause of the child's delinquency.</P>
    <P>I want to say with the utmost deliberation that I am as certain as I am standing on this carpet that seven out of every ten children convicted in the children's court and committed to approved schools are no more guilty of malfeasance than the angels in heaven.  They are children with some internal conflict which precipitates them into a course of action they are not able to control.  They may be as transparently honest as glass but it may test the ingenuity of a highly-skilled doctor to discover the cause of the trouble.  Very often, the fault is not in themselves but in their parents. You find a child acting in a most extraordinary way and, when you proceed to ascertain the cause of that conduct, it is a complete mystery.  But go home and meet his mother.  You may then find that she is living with some man who is not her husband and the child, being conscious of the nature of that <Col N="351" /> situation, has an instinctively deep revulsion and his whole problem is a constant protest against a situation which, subconsciously, he regards as disgusting and shocking but which he is quite unable to connect with his conduct when categorically asked: &ldquo;Why do you do these astonishing things?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Conceive that kind of situation and consider the remedy provided&mdash;shipping that child off, lonely, perplexed, shocked to the very foundation of his being, to an approved school which knows nothing of his problem and cares less and which merely tries to fit him into the ordinary activities of the normal world.  Eighty per cent. of the occupants of an industrial school were never before a court at all.  They were committed because they were orphans or because their parents were too poor to maintain them or because something happened to break up the family and made it necessary to put the children into the care of nuns or brothers.  All I am asking is that, when a district justice makes up his mind that, for the sake of the child as well as for the sake of society, it is necessary to take him from the home of the parents whom God placed over him&mdash;and that will be a very rare case&mdash;the justice should be furnished with the minimum of information which he must have if he is to make proper provision for that child.</P>
    <P>The expense of this will not be £10,000 a year.  It will keep out of prison dozens of children who, for the want of this care, must find their way there in the long run.  It will spare society the solution of some of the most painful problems it is possible for society to have to deal with.  Let us not put a tooth in it.  It will rescue many a child from drifting into the horrors of sexual perversion and thus clouding and darkening its whole life. If the truth were told, this perversion had its roots in the cruel misusage the child received from society when it first manifested the symptoms of the fundamental illness from which it suffered. These are matters around which one always like to skirt.  I have been fighting for this reform for ten years.  Nobody ever says it is wrong.  Nobody <Col N="352" /> ever disagrees with me but nothing ever gets done.</P>
    <P>Can I reasonably hope now, after thousands of millions of pounds have been spent all over the world in blasting the world to pieces, that we should stipulate for £10,000 or £15,000 a year, in order to give those children who can be saved a chance that it is well within our power to give them?  Or are we to go on for ever, watching them being shovelled down the broad, high road to hell?</P>
    <P>I, therefore, ask that a clinic be established in this city, over which there should preside a motherly, highly-trained, qualified nurse, so that the first person a frightened, troublesome child will encounter, when brought from the courts, immensely distressed at being brought before the magistrate and taken away from its parents, would be a motherly woman, whose first concern is to smooth down his sorrows and restore his confidence, to assure him that no one is going to eat him, that everybody is anxious and solicitous to get him fixed up and that, maybe, after a week, he will be able to go home.  I ask that there be attached to that clinic a competent Catholic psychologist and, if necessary, a competent non-Catholic psychologist, who, in collaboration with the minister of religion to which the delinquent child may belong, will proceed skilfully and competently to investigate not only the state of the child's mind but the family background from which it came.</P>
    <P>During its period in that remand home, which ordinarily would not exceed a week, it will receive such medical treatment and such other treatment as should be necessary to restore it, as far as possible, to a normal state.  I ask that such investigations may be made as may be necessary to unravel the true nature of the causes of the child's misconduct and that all this information be laid before the district justice, so that he may dispose of the child in the child's best interests.</P>
    <P>Surely that is not an extravagant demand, either in its nature or in the expense it would involve?  The dividends <Col N="353" /> which it must pay are infinite and I doubt if there is a Deputy in this House who would not agree with me 100 per cent.  Granted what I say about these matters is true&mdash;and I think the Minister will confirm most of it&mdash;the proposal ought to be put in hand forthwith and this financial year should not pass without its being put into effect.</P>
    <P>I want to question the prudence of the regulation which prohibits prison officers from issuing writs for slander or libel when allegations are made about them that, in the course of their duty, they have transgressed the regulations which they are bound to observe.  A disreputable person recently published a book in this country called <i>I Did Penal Servitude.</i>  By the Lord Harry, by the time you had finished that book, you would think the only qualification for heroism or respectability in this country was that of serving a term of penal servitude.  You would begin to feel, by the time you reached the end of the book, that one who had not served a term of penal servitude was rather a disreputable character and ought to apologise for not having done his bit.  That is the author's own business, but it is different when it comes, in order to lend a veneer of versimilitude to his story, to describing a prison officer who can easily be identified and attributing to him, in the presence of the prisoner in his care, the foulest of foul language and conduct generally disreputable to himself and to the service to which he belongs.  The facts are that the man has been 30 years in the service and never had any complaint made against him, except that he sometimes allowed his solicitude and sympathy for a prisoner to deflect him from that degree of rigidity which a prison officer must necessarily maintain.</P>
    <P>This man was a regular weekly communicant, who had almost a fetish about bad language and who, as I say, has only one complaint against him&mdash; that from time to time his chief warder was obliged to say to him: &ldquo;Don't forget that those fellows are tough eggs and that you cannot be coddling them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="354" /> That man goes at once to his superior officer and says: &ldquo;I want permission to instruct a solicitor to issue a writ for libel against this blackguard&mdash;not that I can get anything out of him, as he has spent the proceeds of his thefts and apparently has no intention of trying to earn his living again, but in order to vindicate my good name.&rdquo; That officer is told the regulations will not permit him.  He and his family have to leave that record uncontradicted and uncorrected, because the regulations say it is not in the general interest that matters of this kind should be raised by an individual officer.  I have no desire to challenge or call into question a man who happens to have fallen into temptation which, because of its nature, involved his trial and sentence to penal servitude. That just happened to be his kind of condition.  If the truth were known, the temptations into which I have fallen may be far worse and far more numerous, only their character was of a different sort, which did not involve me in penal servitude.  Far be it from me to adopt a superior attitude to the man who did penal servitude. My complaint against him and my condemnation of him is that those who held out a hand to him, those who were kind, those who did not want to strike him in the hour of his affliction, are casually used for the purpose of setting his pot boiling and their modest reputation, which is as precious to them as that of the Taoiseach is to himself, is blackened and bespattered with dirt, in order to win the half-crowns of the sensation lovers in this country and of a visiting Monsignor from abroad.</P>
    <P>I am bound to say that I think one of the principal reasons for juvenile delinquency in this country is that parents seem to be abjuring their duty to their children.  One of the reasons is that, if a national school teacher gives a child a slap, he may find himself involved in something like the Nuremberg trial.  By the time Papa and Mamma have finished describing the massacre that took place, Belsen fades into insignificance beside the scenes that took place in the national school, and a fat stump of a child is sitting beside them, ready to get up and tell his story like a man.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> The gravamen of the complaint is that he was nearly beaten unconscious, by &ldquo;this ferocious villain who beat their darling child&rdquo;.  And yet we find people like Deputy Connolly&mdash;I was going to say &ldquo;God be good to him&rdquo;, but I believe he is still going strong, although he is not a member of the House now&mdash;getting up here and describing, while rolling his tongue, how they were beaten on their bottoms and what an awful thing it was that that should happen.  I think if Deputy Connolly had got a good few wallops on that particular portion of his anatomy, he would not have made such a silly speech.  But the national teacher who beats the child and is then brought into court on that account, is singled out and, even when she is going to Mass, people can say: &ldquo;That is the teacher who was up for beating the child.  She got out of it, you know, but there were strings pulled, of course.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Mind you, if there was a canvass taken here to-morrow of Deputies and they were asked: &ldquo;Do you believe in giving a child a good beating when nothing else would make it behave itself?&rdquo;, I bet you there are not 20 Deputies who would say: &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;  They would wobble and make reservations and say that in certain circumstances it might be justifiable, but it could not be the case with any of their neighbours' children, although there might be parts of the country where it would be a good thing to do. At the same time, every one of them knows, in respect of their own children and themselves, that if they did not get an odd touch in their youth, they would be a great deal worse than they are&mdash; and that is saying a great deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do you blame the children for running riot?  If children get it into their heads that in the last analysis they can defy their parents and teachers and there is no ultimate sanction to be invoked against them, who would blame them for plunging from one extreme to the other?  If mature people found themselves in a society where, if they indulged their baser natural instincts, <Col N="356" /> they could defy society and say, &ldquo;Well, even if you do not like it, we are going to do it&rdquo;, and if there was nobody there to take them by the collar of the coat and sling them into Mountjoy, no man or woman could walk with immunity in O'Connell Street.</P>
    <P>There is no society, mature or immature, in which, in the last analysis, there must not be an ultimate sanction, before which the stoutest heart would quail and, without resorting to the cato'-nine tails, so dear to the heart of Monsignor Flanagan, a ha'penny cane is quite enough, if it is hanging on the end of the dresser and all the household know that no one wants to see it come down but, if it has to come down, down it will come and the clearer that is made <i>ab initio</i>, the less frequently it will become necessary for the threat to materialise.</P>
    <P>The same is true of every national school in the country and, if the district justices had any sense, the minute they saw the indignant mamma coming in with the afflicted offspring, they would fine her £2 for neglecting her domestic duties and tell her the next time they would give her seven days.</P>
    <P>A great many District Court clerks undertook their duties when it was very difficult to get trained men to do what they were called upon to do.  Under the old dispensation the petty sessions clerks, although they were only part-time public servants, had pension rights.  The part-time nature of their duties created a situation in which the occupants of these offices were ordinarily men who could not regularly adapt themselves to the full Civil Service requirement of becoming removable, and that is an essential part of being an established officer under our Civil Service as at present organised. With the passage of the past 25 years, most of the men who came forward at the time and took up positions as District Court clerks, having been petty sessions clerks, are now about to retire and they are confronted with the situation that they have no pension rights.</P>
    <P>I have sympathy with the Minister in that, while he might be anxious to <Col N="357" /> make an exception in their case, his difficulty is that if he alters the rule in regard to these particular clerks, he will open the door so widely that there will be a regular deluge of applications for pension rights from unestablished officers and there will be a complete revolution in the existing principles.</P>
    <P>Without going into the merits of the whole question as to whether they should have pension rights or not, I am mainly concerned to get substantial justice for this limited class of persons, so that they will not go into retirement with a deep sense of grievance, in many cases to face real poverty.  I suggest, with respect to these persons in any case, that if the Minister is unable to secure pension rights for them, an <i>ad hoc</i> scheme should be evolved whereunder they will get a substantial grant on retiring, with a complete liquidation of any claims that they may have against the State.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose there can be more than two dozen of them, and the matter will be disposed of for all time in the course of the next five years.  It would be a grave injustice if such persons were left among their neighbours in a state of grave financial embarrassment. On the presumption that they did their duties conscientiously and well, they had no opportunity of growing rich in the capacity of court clerks, unless they approached those who had recourse to the courts and extracted from them gratuities or subsidies to which they had no real claim.  Happily, we have not had a single case in which a District Court clerk acted in that manner, and it would be a poor reward for them if we now leave them in a state of poverty in the evening of their days.</P>
    <P>The question of court costs is a very wide one and one that could not be adequately or satisfactorily dealt with in a general Estimate of this kind. There are Deputies from rural Ireland who will agree with me that however court costs are arrived at, the net result is that the last thing any sane man wants to do is to have recourse to the courts of the country in pursuit of justice, because the general belief is&mdash; and it is a well-founded belief&mdash;that if <Col N="358" /> you bring your dispute before a judge in this country it is absolute ruin for the unsuccessful litigant and very heavy financial embarrassment for the one who wins.  However that problem is to be resolved, it ought to be resolved. The proper way of settling disputes between neighbours is conciliation by their neighbour or the parish priest, as the case may be.  In default of that, and only as a last remedy, but it is a ready remedy, they have recourse to an impartial judge who will do justice between them.</P>
    <P>More and more that last recourse is being withdrawn from people with moderate means.  I am a member of the Bar and, to anyone who belongs to that happy company, it is treason to suggest that its identity should be merged in that of any other profession, but I cannot help thinking that in this country we are moving slowly to the position in which there is not scope for the division of the legal profession into solicitors and barristers.  While it is true that the cause of law itself in Dublin may, in some measure, suffer if the two professions were merged, I believe that the cause of justice&mdash;and it is the prime function of the judiciary to give the people justice&mdash;would be much more effectively served than it is at present if we had the American system in which there are attorneys-at-law who, in fact, discharge the functions of a solicitor or a barrister.</P>
    <P>It is true that in large urban centres where there is a great deal of specialised litigation, we do find in America a situation developing in which you will have six partners in an office, three of whom are, in effect, barristers and three, in effect, solicitors.  While the solicitor members of the partnership will prepare the briefs and do the solicitorial part of the work, the advocate will ordinarily appear in court. But all over rural America millions of Americans describe themselves as &ldquo;Judge This&rdquo; and &ldquo;Judge That&rdquo; not because they have ever sat on a bench but because their neighbours like them. If your neighbours like you in America, they call you &ldquo;General&rdquo; or &ldquo;Judge&rdquo;. In fact many of these judges practise before courts of all classes in which their neighbours are ordinarily engaged. <Col N="359" /> There is no question of paying a barrister £2 2s. 0d. for getting up in the Circuit Court to ask the judge if the guardian of Johnny Brown who is a ward of court, having the mighty fortune of £270 left him by a maiden aunt, should be allowed to spend 3/9 on a pair of shoes.  That, of course, is a poetic development of a system which obtains in the Chancery side but it is not in the strictest accord with economy.  I think the biggest number of my profession will agree that the effect of dividing the profession in rural Ireland is to add costs to the general procedure.</P>
    <P>In addition to that remedy, I feel that something should be done to reduce the cost of stamping documents and the costs of various functions of the court which become automatically payable by those who have recourse to the courts.  There should be cheap law, rapid law and certain law available to every citizen of the State, rich and poor.  The present system does not provide that.  The measures requisite to do so can only satisfactorily be ascertained by an inquiry conducted by competent persons who will report to the Legislature as to the most effective measures to be taken. I suggest to the Minister that it would be well to set such an inquiry on foot in order that we may be able to determine what requires to be done and how best to do it.</P>

      <P>I should like to take advantage of the fact that the Minister is present on this Estimate to raise one question as part of a general quest which I have been carrying out. I am looking for some Department in the State, or the Department of State, which can give us any information with regard to the position of the language in the Irish-speaking districts.  In November last I addressed a question to each Minister to ask in what particular way the country was divided from the point of view of his Department into Irish-speaking districts, for what purpose they were regarded as such and what exactly was being done in relation to that.  The Minister for Justice, in reply to my question, said as reported in column 1123 of the Debates of the 20th November last:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" />&ldquo;The only purpose for which a formal definition of Irish-speaking districts has been made in this Department is in connection with the sole use of Irish by members of the Garda Síochána in districts which are regarded as Irish-speaking districts and in which a special Gaeltacht allowance is paid to the members of the Garda Síochána.  The districts are as follows:&mdash;Galway, Clifden and Oughterard, in the Division of Galway West Riding; Milford, Killybegs and Clogher in the Division of Donegal, and Waterford and Dingle in the Division of Kerry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to ascertain to what extent, in any part of the various branches of administration under the Minister, cognisance is taken of the fact that Irish is the natural language of the people in that district, and to what extent cognisance is taken of the fact that the use of the language is either strengthening or weakening there. That is the first question I should like to ask him with regard to the Ministry of Justice and, indeed, with regard to various other Ministers.</P>
    <P>Recently, I addressed a question to the Ministers in charge of every Department asking them if they had a report from the Minister for Education that, in the case of three school areas in Kerry, two in Donegal and one in Mayo, he had decided that the language was not sufficiently spoken in those areas to regard them as purely Irish-speaking districts.  We know that it was decided in the last two or three years by the Minister for Education that in these districts the Irish language was fading.  I think we know that that decision was taken by the Minister for Education without any examination, good, bad or indifferent, into the conditions of the language in the school districts and was based entirely on an examination carried out in the schools.  So that as far as the Ministry of Education is concerned, it was brought home rather forcibly to me that although it would be suggested that the Minister for Education was the Minister mainly responsible for keeping the situation in the Irish-speaking districts under review, that was not being done, and that even <Col N="361" /> vital decisions affecting the use of the language in the schools were being taken by the Minister for Education without any examination at all as to what the position was outside the walls of the school.</P>
    <P>In reply to my question, I find from the Minister for Justice, as well as from other Ministers, that no report at all had been received by them from the Minister for Education to the effect that, as far as facts were concerned and knowledge went, however imperfectly it was collected, the Irish language was fading in these districts.  I would ask the Minister if he would let us know is there any part of his work, or any part of the administrative work carried out under him, that takes cognisance of, and reports as to, whether the Irish language is fading out of the various districts, because I am looking for the Department which accepts any responsibility for doing anything like that, and I think it is important that we should get this information.</P>
    <P>I have been prevented from putting down a general question to the Taoiseach on the matter but I feel that at the end of my quest, I am going to find whether there is any Department in the State that is viewing that aspect of the position at all, in spite of the fact that Article 8 of the Constitution regards the Irish language as the national language and as the first official language.</P>
    <P>Again, I ask the Minister why, from the point of view of his Department, and, so far as that is concerned, from the point of view of the Garda Síochána only, he regards as Irish-speaking districts, Galway, Clifden and Oughterard, Milford, Killybegs and Clogher, Waterville and Dingle, while part of County Waterford, part of Mayo and part of Clare are left out.  If the Minister will examine the information contained in columns 1119 to 1126 of the Official Reports for 20th November last, he will find that there is a difference in the way in which the various Departments define, for the purposes of their work, the Irish-speaking districts.  The fact is that there are Irish-speaking districts in Mayo, in <Col N="362" /> Waterford, in West Cork, and, to a much smaller extent, in Clare, and I ask in what respect, in relation to the work of the Garda, the courts or any other section of his Department, cognisance is taken of the fact that Irish is still the living language in small districts there.</P>
    <P>I ask these questions because we have placed the Irish language constitutionally and from an administrative point of view in the position in which it is supposed to be, because it is the national language which, from the time our people began to read, has not only been the vernacular of our people but has been the literary medium of our people.  It is still there with us, but it is fading, and, in so far as we have any positive implications at all, they are the implications contained in the actions of the Minister for Education, that is, that it is fading out of the hills and out of the glens in which, for a couple of thousand years, it has been the home language of our people, and, as I say, was the language of their literature when they were writing literature.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, if that position is allowed to continue, we are simply beating the air and being childish in thinking that we can revive and spread throughout the rest of the country a language which is fading out of the places where it is natural, traditional, and still strongly rooted.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I should like the Minister to understand that I want to know whether the Minister has any responsibility for letting anybody know whether the Irish language in the Irish-speaking districts is fading or not, and, in so far as his administration helps to strengthen the situation there, why he leaves out of consideration in relation to the work of the Guards, the fact that there are Irish-speaking districts in Mayo, Waterford, West Cork, and, to a very small extent, in Clare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If any Department of State gets the criticism it deserves, on the occasion of the Estimates, it is the Department of Justice.  Deputy Commons made a speech here last night in which he referred to political prisoners, and I am very sorry to state <Col N="363" /> that, having heard Deputy Dillon's speech, Deputy Commons was very much misrepresented.  Neither the Deputy nor I would stand up here and advocate that a citizen guilty of the deliberate shooting of a policeman should be treated in any different way from a citizen guilty of murder.  A political prisoner, in my opinion, is a citizen who has been punished, and perhaps victimised and hounded down by the officers of the state, because of the political views he holds.  Never at any time during my five years of membership of this House have I spoken in defence of either armed robbery or cold-blooded murder, and I think that Deputies on all sides of the House would be very slow at this stage to stand over, encourage or defend in any way such actions.  Political prisoners are men who have been, and are being, punished severely for the political views they hold.</P>
      <P>I watched the Minister for Justice smile at Deputy Commons last night when he made a reference to the fact that the Garda Síochána in his area have taken certain constituents of his to the barracks and questioned them as to their political affiliations.  I think that, under his breath, the Minister said that that was not the case.  Deputy Commons has been so informed by his constituents, and I have every reason to believe, from other information I have at my disposal from the same area, that Deputy Commons was right. If any Civic Guard in my district took into custody any of my constituents and questioned them as to whom they had voted for or against, I would deal with them properly, if the Minister did not do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is none of a Guard's business whom a citizen votes for, and I ask the Minister to have an inquiry into the complaint made here by Deputy Commons.  If the position is as stated by the Deputy, if Civic Guards in that area are terrorising people who are not supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party, it is about time that some serious steps were taken to put an end to it.  So far as my constituency is concerned, the Civic Guards have not probed into <Col N="364" /> the political affiliations of any of my constituents, so far as I am aware, but if I represented South Mayo, as do Deputies Cafferky and Commons, who have had the honour of having a month's holiday, if I may so term it, as guests of the State in Sligo prison, I certainly would not take such conduct as Deputy Commons and Deputy Cafferky are taking in their areas.</P>
    <P>It is only right, when such a charge against the Civic Guards has been made, that there should be a thorough investigation to ascertain if the facts are as stated by these Deputies.  If they are, immediate action should be taken to ensure that people are not brought to the barracks and questioned as to whether they are supporters of the Government, or whether they voted for Government candidates or for candidates opposed to Government policy.</P>
    <P>Repeated requests have been made by me to the Minister for Justice for permission to visit Portlaoighise Prison.  Back in 1943, I wrote to the Minister asking for permission to visit that prison, which is situated only four and a half miles from my home. I said I wanted to walk around the prison and to have a look at the sanitary conditions and at the cells.  I asked if I might go in while meals were being served to the prisoners and see the type of food given to them, the manner in which it was cooked and the conditions under which it was presented to the prisoners.  The Minister refused point-blank to permit me to go into the prison, which is situated, as I say, in the county town of my constituency, four and a half miles from my home.  The Minister had very good reason for not permitting me to visit the prison.  I am informed that at the time the Labour Party representatives visited the prison, representations were made to the Minister that I should be one of the party admitted to the prison.  The Minister for Justice replied: No, that I would not visit Portlaoighise Prison while he was Minister for Justice.  I submit most respectfully that the Minister for Justice has a very good reason for preventing me from visiting Portlaoighise Prison.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am convinced that the Minister for Justice knows the reasons why he will not admit me to Portlaoighise Prison.  I know very well that if the Minister for Justice had nothing to hide or if the Minister for Justice was not afraid that I would come out of that prison and disclose what I had seen within its walls, the Minister for Justice would allow me in. Perhaps, if I was foolish enough to take a bribe from either him or his Department, I would be allowed to go into Portlaoighise Prison and keep my mouth shut when I came out.  But the Minister for Justice knows that if I got into Portlaoighise, I would disclose to the general public exactly what I had seen in the prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I challenge the Minister here and now, if he has nothing to be afraid of within the walls of Portlaoighise Prison, why should he not authorise the governor of the prison to accompany me on an investigation of that institution at a convenient time to the governor of the prison and myself?  If everything is all right within the prison, if the Minister has nothing to worry about, he can safely grant, as far as I am concerned, the repeated requests I have made to visit that institution. If I have anything to talk about I will talk about it when my visit is over but the Minister has not seen fit to grant that request to me as an elected representative of the people in the constituency where the prison is situated.  I believe that the Minister has very good reasons for refusing my request to visit the prison.  He is afraid that some of the dirty work and some of the ill-treatment of the people who are in that prison would be exposed when I would come outside the walls.  I challenge the Minister now. When he was asked for an explanation as to why I would not be permitted to visit the prison, two years ago, he replied that I was too young, but I was not too young to leave the two Fianna Fáil candidates in my constituency at the bottom of the poll and I will not be too young the next time to leave the two of them out completely <Col N="366" /> because, while I have a tongue in my mouth and while I have the energy and the courage that I have to stand before my constituents, I am going to let the Minister for Justice and his Party satellites, back-benchers and yes-men, know where they stand as far as the Midlands are concerned.  I challenge the Minister and I defy him here and now to grant me permission to visit that prison.  If he does I will go and if everything is all right within the walls of that prison, I will be man enough to come out and say: &ldquo;I have seen things within the walls of Portlaoighise Prison and they are as the Minister for Justice has indicated and the prisoners, as the Minister has indicated, are being treated fairly, properly and rightly&rdquo;.  But, if they are not, and if conditions are not up to the standard in that prison, I shall certainly have no hesitation in letting my constituents, the House and the country know what the conditions are.</P>

      <P>Political prisoners, as I have always pointed out, are men who are interned because of their political views or political affiliations. Some time ago I thought the time for having political prisoners was over. The Minister for Justice made statements time and again that the continuous hunting down of these men was only an encouragement to them to carry on.  They are the Minister's own words and the Minister's own statement. I can safely say that you will have no peace or ease from that point of view while you have political prisoners.  Many of them are decent, harmless men.  Many of them are good, responsible citizens, whose only fault is that they do not accept the teachings laid down by the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is only right that the Minister should see that these men are immediately released.  If there was courage or guts in some of the Fianna Fáil Party, who are always talking and blowing about unity and about the republic, they would not stand behind the Minister for Justice in keeping these men behind locked gates and iron bars.  Some members of the Fianna <Col N="367" /> Fáil Party might qualify for honours under the Reward for Bravery Bill if they would have the courage and pluck to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; when the Minister says &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  That goes for the vast majority of Fianna Fáil back-benchers.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to indicate the prison rules now effective in relation to the ordinary prisons and convict prisons and, if there is any special code of rules governing prisons, to say where public representatives could find them.  I would be very interested in having a copy.  I have endeavoured on more than one occasion to lay my hand on some of these rules but have been unable to secure them.  If rules exist governing convict prisons and other prisons, they should be available in the Dáil Library and it should be possible for Deputies to secure them on application to the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>A good deal has been said about the Garda Síochána during this debate.  I would again ask the Minister to have a housing scheme formulated for the Garda Síochána.  I understand that the office of the Commissioner is inundated with applications from Civic Guards seeking transfers and accommodation in various parts of the country.  It is a disgraceful state of affairs to have Civic Guards applying to local authorities for houses.  In every district the State should provide the sergeant of the Garda with accommodation in barracks and should provide married Guards in the stations with proper housing accommodation. In every town the State should have at least six houses for these men so that Civic Guards will not have to apply for labourers' cottages as they become vacant or to urban district councils. There are too many of the workingclass people and too many agricultural workers and ordinary labouring men deprived of housing accommodation because of the present shortage in housing and it is most unfair that Civic Guards should compete against them.  It is time the Minister for Justice realised the seriousness of the situation as far as these men are concerned and he should have a scheme formulated with the least possible delay so that houses may be provided for members of the Garda force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="368" /> I do not know if the Minister's attention has already been drawn to the fact of the increase in drunkenness in this country.</P>

      <P>As one who has a good knowledge of rural life, I may say that bars and drinking at all-night dances should not be permitted.  The Minister's Department has responsibility in connection with the licences that are issued for the supply of drink in dance halls.  I think he should take steps to see that these licences are not granted.  Legislation along that line would be very welcome.  I am sorry to have to say that a great many of our young men, and I regret to say, too, a great many of our young women are stooping to the lowest degree of indecency. Drink is responsible for that. The bars in dance halls are an absolute encouragement to them.  I have condemned this in my own constituency and I will have the courage of my convictions to do so on every possible occasion.  These bars in dance halls are the ruination of the lives of our young boys and girls, and I am afraid they will go a long way towards the ruination of their immortal souls which, of course, is more serious still.  There is no doubt that drunkenness is spreading through the country.  The Department should do everything possible to put an end to the practice of having bars in dance halls.  There is so much drink consumed in them that you have nothing but rows.  As a result of excessive drinking I have seen some of those dance halls wrecked, with all the furniture completely smashed.  The sober, decent people who go to these dances are denied the opportunity of enjoying themselves.  They are completely disturbed by the tactics of those who go to those halls for the one purpose of getting drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should also bring to the notice of district justices that all-night dancing should not be encouraged. Dances should not be allowed to continue beyond 1 o'clock or 1.30 a.m. At present they go on until 4.30 or 5 a.m.  The result of that is that you <Col N="369" /> have young boys and girls setting out for home in the early hours of the morning under the horrid influence of drink.  They have sick heads for the remainder of the week, with the result that their work, their duties to their homes and their religion are neglected. The Minister should take a serious view of this matter and do his best to encourage good citizenship.</P>
    <P>I was amazed when legislation was passed here giving Bord na Móna the right to have licensed canteens on the bogs so that the workers could be supplied with intoxicating liquor.  In that way, the board will capture the few shillings that these unfortunate bog workers have to spend on drink. I think the workers will curse the day that these licensed canteens were set up.  They have the paltry wages of from £2 to £2 5s. 0d. a week, and I think it was a mean thing for a Government Department to grant this liquor licence because it means that, during the few hours the workers are off duty, the canteen will be able to squeeze the last halfpenny out of them for beer.  I am afraid these canteens will have a demoralising effect on our people.  The Government, instead of doing that, should be helping on temperance, thereby making our young people good honest citizens.  The bog workers should not be encouraged to consume intoxicating liquor.</P>
    <P>That is a bad policy.  I agree, of course, that a workman should be able to have one drink or two drinks if he wants it.  The danger, of course, is that when these men go to the canteens there will be abuses because they will drink too much.  If, say, ten men go into the canteen that means that each man will stand a round.  I think that when men take ten drinks they are bound to become fairly rowdy. There can be no peace or happiness where you have that sort of thing.  I would not be surprised if you saw those places burned to the ground.</P>
    <P>I put it seriously to the Minister that something should be done to restrict the sale of liquor in them.  In the towns near those turf camps we hear of scenes being created when men take too much drink.  The Government, I <Col N="370" /> think, are playing a very bad part so far as making the nation sober is concerned. I have referred to the abuses that take place in the dance halls where there are bars.  I might say that a lot of the abuses are caused by some of the &ldquo;quality&rdquo; who attend.  They encourage a lot of that sort of thing. The Minister should consider sympathetically the suggestion I make to him of seeing that licences are not granted for the sale of liquor in dance halls.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department also has responsibility in connection with the activities of aliens in this country.  I think that, as far as these people are concerned, the Minister is neglecting his duty very much.  I am sorry to say that half the industries in the country are controlled by aliens.  Very little is being done to give protection to our Irish industries.  We have foreigners and Jews in positions of command and control.</P>
    <P>I am aware that, in order to get a licence from the Department of Industry and Commerce to import wadding, an importer had first to get a letter from a firm that is controlled by a Jew.  That is a disgraceful state of affairs.  Deputy Childers, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government, who is here, is well aware that I brought some of these matters to his notice on more than one occasion.  The Minister for Justice should take serious notice of this. Another person, in order to obtain a licence from the Department of Industry and Commerce to import zip fasteners, had to get a letter from another firm under the control of a Jew.</P>

      <P>I am well aware of that.  What I am dealing with is the question of Jewish control here.  The Minister for Justice has some responsibility for the activities of aliens who were blown over here to get fatter and richer, while our Irish nationals are getting thinner and poorer.  I believe that this is something the Minister for Justice ought to wake up to and see that the Irish nationals are protected against the Jews and other aliens who have come over here to make a good thing out of ourselves and Irish industries. We have them paying rock-bottom wages to young boys and young girls, working here, day after day, in this very city, and I believe that the Minister for Justice ought to investigate the activities of such aliens. We have known cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most important of those men was a Mr. Sigal, whose activities certainly were to the credit of no citizen in this country, and he was an alien and the Minister for Justice saw fit, not too long ago, to see that the necessary steps were taken to have this man removed from here.  He should have been removed years ago&mdash;before he gave a lot of those letters to his friends and colleagues to have those licences issued.  Deputy Childers is very well aware of that.  No steps were <Col N="372" /> taken to remove Mr. Sigal from this country until it was getting hot for someone else and to hide Government policy&mdash;probably some of the Ministers &mdash;Mr. Sigal was immediately deported so that no dirty work would come out. It is not too long ago that I asked a question whether he paid his debts&mdash; property tax and income tax&mdash;and the Minister replied that it was a question for the Revenue Commissioners.  But certainly he gave them a right stick before he left.  The situation, as far as the control of Jews in this city and throughout the whole country is concerned, is very serious.  Aliens are buying up land, houses, property, and something will have to be done or the country will be overrun by foreigners here while we will be looking on and we will be turned into the slaves of the foreigner again.  Something will have to be done to see that the Irish race and the general public of this country are protected from the influence and destruction of aliens and Jews whose influence is growing stronger and stronger in this country every day.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice is also responsible, I understand, for the conduct and appointment of district justices and for the manner in which they carry out their duties. District justices are men appointed by the Department to carry out and exercise the law.  I may say that the attention of the Minister for Justice has been drawn, on more than one occasion, to the manner in which certain district justices abuse their privileged positions.  In the town of Edenderry&mdash;it is not too long ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I believe that the Minister should see that no abusive language should come from the lips of these men who are on the benches.  I have known unfortunate people who have had to suffer abuse from these men in their privileged positions and these unfortunate people had no protection from the abuse and impertinence from the men who are supposed to hold a high and honourable and dignified position in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions have arisen in this House from time to time about Communism, and I believe the Minister for Justice informed the House that as far as Communism was concerned he had his eye very carefully on the activities of promoters of Communism.  It is not so long since the Minister for Justice took steps to see that the strongest possible police force would be present in Croke Park to watch the activities of a few national teachers out to look for the best standard of living they could get. That was on the 6th October last.  The teachers were out to inform public opinion as to the genuineness of their grievance against the Department.  On the 27th October, Croke Park was again invaded by hordes of police officers and detectives to watch the activities of the few national teachers who were likely to be amongst the spectators.  Steps were taken by the Garda Síochána to deal very cruelly and harshly with these teachers.  The teachers were prevented from holding a meeting in Dublin by members of the Garda Síochána who received their instructions from the Department of <Col N="376" /> Justice.  The Minister for Justice stated at the time that it would not be in the public interest to allow the meeting to be held and he took steps to prevent it. The majority of the national teachers are good, honest, Irish Catholics who are a credit to their profession and to the dignified position they hold.  When these men were agitating for their rights, to save his colleague, the Minister for Education, from embarrassment, the Minister for Justice used the full force of the Garda Síochána to create uneasiness and to bring to an end, if possible, the campaign of the teachers.</P>
    <P>Then we saw the Dean of Canterbury, Dean Johnston, come to the Mansion House on the 25th November last to engage in his Communistic work. There were no hordes of Gardaí there to see that Communistic doctrines would not be taught.  Notices were published in the papers, under the auspices of the Irish Friends of Soviet Russia, and circulars were distributed to the citizens of Dublin regarding the holding of that meeting in the Mansion House.  The meeting was held with the full protection of the State and the Dean of Canterbury came over to plant the seeds of Communism here and to help to foster the seeds already planted by his colleagues in the Communistic movement prior to that.  Why had not the Minister the whole force of the Gardaí to prevent such a meeting?  He did not attempt to prevent the Communist meeting but he prevented the national teachers from having a meeting. That is a thing of which the Minister can be proud.  I ask the Minister to make an Order prohibiting this lecturer from lecturing in this country in future.  The Dean of Canterbury should never have been permitted to enter this country to give a lecture on Communism.  Now that the Minister knows what took place at the meeting and how certain citizens were treated, I hope he will take the necessary steps in connection with the Irish Friends of Soviet Russia.  Of course, the Minister has a great deal of sympathy with Soviet Russia.  In the Dáil, I think he advocated friendship between Soviet Russia and this country. Now that he knows the danger likely to result from lectures by such <Col N="377" /> persons as Dean Johnston, under the auspices of the Irish Friends of Soviet Russia, I hope he will see that an Order is made preventing this lecturer from landing in the country.  If the people had any spunk or guts they would kick him out and save the Minister the trouble of making the Order.</P>
    <P>The Dáil should protest in the strongest manner against any attempt to spread the seeds, or extend the roots, of Communism.  We have seen the curse brought upon other countries in Europe by Communistic activities. We saw how Communism was responsible for the imprisonment of one of the princes of the Church, Archbishop Stepinac.  It has brought distress, wreckage and ruin to many countries. The sooner the Minister wakens up, realises the seriousness of the position and puts his foot down on Communistic activities, which are spreading rapidly in the country, the better for the people.  We are all proud, as Christians, of the blessed year 432, when St. Patrick came to this island to spread the true faith.  Are we going to see the faith which was defended and cherished by the Irish people through generations wrecked and ruined by those who are out to spread Communism? It is the bounden duty of the Minister to see that such activities will be curtailed and prevented so far as possible.  It is only right that a statement should come from the Minister as to why he allowed that meeting to take place in the Mansion House and why he prevented the national teachers from holding one.  If the Garda assembled at Croke Park to prevent these teachers from having a demonstration, the same steps should have been taken to prevent the trouble that arose out of the Mansion House meeting.  I hope these steps will be taken in respect of future meetings and that this lecturer will be prevented, by Order, from delivering lectures so harmful to the nation.</P>
    <P>Representations have been repeatedly made to the Minister in connection with the provision of new Garda stations.  Whether the Minister's Department or the Board of Works are to blame, they have been very slow in <Col N="378" /> undertaking the work.  In many areas in the Midlands, there has been unreasonable delay in dealing with applications for new Garda stations and in having the stations erected.  The station at Shannonbridge, Ballinasloe, is very old and dilapidated.  The Board of Works have an excellent site for a new station right beside the existing barracks at Shannonbridge.  I would be very glad if the Minister would have the new Garda station erected at Shannonbridge as soon as possible, as the existing one is very old and is an eyesore in the district.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity of joining the other Deputies who have made an appeal to the Minister to see that the necessary legislation is implemented as soon as possible in regard to pensions for the District Court clerks.  They are certainly a section of the community&mdash;especially those who were appointed in the early days&mdash;who had a very important part to play and I think they are entitled to some pension after their years of service.</P>
    <P>It is not very long since a question was put to the Minister here about introducing legislation to cover the adoption of children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish, first of all, to add a few words in support of those speakers who have asked the Minister to consider the case of the District Court and Circuit Court clerks.  It has been amply covered by a number of other speakers and I merely wish to add my voice to what has been said by them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon raised the matter of legal costs.  Regarding his main contention, I should prefer not to attempt to deal with it at the moment, as it is something rather deeper and more fundamental than the mere question of expense.  Immediately relative to this Vote, however, there is another point. There has been a tendency during the past few years for costs connected with the administration of justice to increase, that is, costs that litigants have to pay directly in regard to the services which the courts have afforded. An example of that is to be found in the legal administration in a Department which may not be, strictly speaking, the Minister's responsibility but still is essentially tied up with the Department of Justice.  I refer to land registry fees.  I know they are probably not immediately the Minister's responsibility, but they are a very clear instance of costs being inflated, owing to increased administration costs which have nothing to do with the legal professions at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The administration of justice as between man and man for which our ordinary civil courts cater is of such importance to the community that an undue share of the expense involved should not be borne by the actual litigants.  At the moment, practically all the costs of a particular case are borne by the actual litigants, who very often are responsible for having matters decided which are of interest to the community as a whole.  For that reason, if there are of <Col N="381" /> necessity increased costs involved in the administration of the court machine, they should be borne by the community at large rather than be charged specifically to the litigants of the moment in the form of court fees.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in order to keep the administration of justice as between man and man an active and live thing, something that the citizen can avail of, any incidental increases in court fees whether from current economic circumstances or from a desire to raise money for the Exchequer, should be borne by the community at large and not by the individual litigants, as happens at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has raised a point that no one could ignore.  It is a point that many people have considered from time to time.  He prefaced his remarks by saying he was a member of the Bar and he addressed himself to the matter of costs.  His solution was to change radically the organisation of the legal profession in this country.  Many representatives of the two professions involved would sympathise with Deputy Dillon on this question of costs and would sympathise with constructive proposals to afford cheaper law for the community as a whole.  But I am afraid that Deputy Dillon, who prides himself so often on basing his arguments on principles and on the fundamentals of his subject, omitted in this case to examine the fundamentals. However, this is probably not just the best time to raise it.  For my own part, as I am speaking impromptu on the matter now, I feel that I have not marshalled the facts and the inferences and implications in this whole subject sufficiently to deal with it now.</P>
    <P>I do say this, that whatever the disadvantages of the present system, it has one advantage, that, in its structure and its framework, it is a guarantee against corruption in a way that nobody who has not studied it, or been intimately connected with it, can appreciate, and any proposal to modify or alter that position should be considered only if it affords the same guarantee of integrity as is afforded by the present system.  For the moment I confine my remarks strictly to that.  It is not a subject upon which, without <Col N="382" /> due preparation, I could give a considered and reasoned argument one way or the other.  I would not go so far on a matter of such fundamental importance to the individual, a matter which goes so fundamentally to the whole concept of personal freedom as we know it, without very careful consideration. Though I, like Deputy Dillon, happen to be a member of a certain profession, I would not deal with it without considering it primarily from the point of view of the ordinary citizen and then from the point of view of a Deputy, putting away as effectively as Deputy Dillon ever protested, all considerations of local professional associations or anything of that sort.</P>
    <P>I say again, approaching this matter as a citizen of the State with an interest in that concept of personal liberty as we know it, and then as a Deputy in this House with responsibility to a constituency and a portion of the community at large, that I could not address myself to this subject without very careful consideration, particularly in regard to the guarantees of integrity and the safeguards from corruption which the system which we have gives, and without adverting carefully to the abuses that are known to have been associated with the system to which Deputy Dillon refers, although that particular system might have advantages from a purely monetary point of view.  I am careful at this stage, for the very reason that I am approaching it as a citizen and as a Deputy and putting aside all fear, favour or prejudice with regard to any other association.  It is for that very reason that, having mentioned one problem involved, I here explicitly refrain from voicing my decision, so to speak, one way or the other, at this stage, because, if the matter is to be considered, it is a separate matter to be considered later.</P>
    <P>But it does lead on to this&mdash;and here I may run the risk of running foul of the limits imposed in a debate on the Estimate for the Department of Justice &mdash;that there is a tendency and there has been a tendency, not only in this country but in England&mdash;and it is a lamentable tendency&mdash;to restrict the legitimate civil jurisdiction of our <Col N="383" /> superior courts.  I think the Chair has ruled that it would not be proper to discuss impending legislation or legislation which we shall have an opportunity of discussing in other ways, but I take this opportunity to ask the Minister to guard against the tendency of the day to restrict, through the operation of the administrative machine, the jurisdiction and discretion of our superior courts, which are so necessary if democracy is to function as we should like it to function.  Unfortunately, one of the forms which the restriction of the superior courts takes is the increasing of the jurisdiction of inferior tribunals which have not got a sufficiently universal jurisdiction, while at the same time you restrict the right of appeal to a superior court.</P>
    <P>This is, perhaps, not the time for me to go into details.  I merely take the opportunity to express a view to the Minister and press upon him that there is a need at the present time to react against a certain tendency&mdash;that is, if we are to keep the system which is enshrined in the Constitution, and which we all really wish should be an actively working system.  But there is, resulting from economics and the recent war and other things, a tendency to make certain aspects of that system almost unworkable.  I ask the Minister, both in his legislation and in the question of appointments to judicial positions, to bear that in mind and, particularly, if the point that Deputy Dillon has made is to be considered at all, that it must be realised that here you have something that leads to a matter that is almost as fundamental to our whole structure as if Deputy Dillon had proposed that the judiciary should hold office during the pleasure of the Executive.</P>
    <P>When I put it that way, people see the danger of it.  I say that the proposal put forward by Deputy Dillon has implications as deep and as dangerous and whereas, as I have said, I have refrained completely from an expression of opinion one way or the other in regard to the present system, the reason is that such matters can only be considered as a fundamental question in our whole philosophy of <Col N="384" /> government and is not likely to be disposed of in the case of an Estimate such as this.</P>
    <P>I have taken it upon myself to make these remarks.  I am sorry, in a way, that it was not a Deputy who had no association with the legal profession who made these remarks.  I want it made perfectly plain that it is from the point of view of the ordinary man in the street and as a Deputy that I make them and that it has nothing whatever to do with mere, narrow, professional associations.  I say this as a word of warning, that if and when such a debate would arise, people should be very loath to suggest that if lawyers speak on such a matter or deal with it, that they are dealing with it from a local, professional point of view. Some may&mdash;it is a human matter&mdash;but in the main there are certain principles that have been established by the lawyers merely because the lawyers were the experts who had studied the matters in question.  Remember in the growth of law, the legal system which we have has been very closely associated with the growth of society and the growth of government and limited by the economic situation of the particular day when the decisions were made.  The people who laid down these principles were not doing it merely as academic lawyers.  They were crystallising the experience, not only of the courts but of the whole of society.  The principles in regard to the freedom and the rights of the individual, which are so important today, were deducted on general grounds, not merely on formal grounds, and they are essential and fundamental in our whole concept of government.  These remarks in a sense may be vague but the debate on this Estimate is not the time to go into the matter raised by Deputy Dillon.  I shall conclude with a word of warning that to approach such a subject merely on the occasion of the Estimate, might involve the community in very serious and radical results which nobody would welcome.</P>

      <P>The last speaker is very adept at giving a pin-prick where he should give a dagger thrust at the <Col N="385" /> administration that sits in front of him.  He has spoken rather with bated breath about costs.  Will he inquire from the Minister what proportion finally of costs is represented by what are known as court fees and will he use whatever influence he has in the background to try to prevent the long-drawn-out struggle on the part of the Department of Finance to use the courts to pay their own way?  That is the standard the Department sets.  If the Deputy will inquire as to the particular part of court costs in which there might be a diminution, he will find that a great diminution could be made if the Department of Finance was not so anxious to get what it thinks is its rightful share out of the different court fees and court documents.</P>
      <P>Before passing to the main points I desire to make, there are two special points to which I should like to direct attention.  The first has to do with future legislation and I suggest that this is a matter to which I might properly refer on this Estimate, notwithstanding the ruling which the Chair has already given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can refer to a broken promise, a promise made several years ago to Deputy Costello, to introduce a certain measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I allowed two Deputies yesterday to refer to two matters which might involve legislation. Another Deputy referred to a broken promise.  Rules were made long ago that on the Estimate a Minister might not be arraigned for not introducing legislation but having allowed the two matters to be discussed yesterday, I cannot now prohibit Deputy McGilligan from following the same line.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief in my references to them.  The Minister knows that a measure was introduced by Deputy Costello and myself dealing with the question of joint tort feasors and on that occasion he promised that he would take the matter up and get it dealt with in his Department.  One day subsequently, a colleague of mine waved a piece of <Col N="386" /> paper and said: &ldquo;There is the draft.&rdquo; That was not the present Attorney-General and if the measure was in draft such a long time ago, I wonder why it has not been introduced since? I do not see why that should be tied up with a whole lot of law rules.  There is one other matter that has been referred to and again I shall deal with it in one sentence.  We all know that attached to the pleadings is the old fiction that the king can do no wrong. That has been abolished in England but here we are in a State which does not recognise the king&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The measure has gone through one House.  It has got to the stage at least of being introduced before one House on the other side but still we have that old-time law here. If the small matter of joint tort feasors is not to be held up for a general revision of the law, I do not see why we should have to wait such a long time for it.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should take the matter in hand and let us know when we are likely to have a measure dealing with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter is also one to which I suggest I am perfectly in order in referring.  I want to ask the Minister to set his face sternly against a practice which has been spoken of here.  I believe there is some substance in the rumour that his Department from time to time send memoranda to district justices as to how they are to carry out their functions in certain respects.  If that is being done it is a scandal.  If it has to be done&mdash;and there may be occasions that call for it &mdash;it should be done openly and the public should know what sort of lecture is being given to a district justice. We have had the experience here of listening to a colleague of the Minister speaking in hostile terms of district justices because they had not sent enough people to jail for certain offences.  He criticised them and I am sure his criticism was brought to their notice.  On the matter as to whether the conduct of district justices can be brought under any sort of notice in this House, I suggest that it can and <Col N="387" /> that this is the only Estimate on which it can.</P>

      <P>The Minister in a recent piece of legislation abolished the old system of dealing with district justices and he took the power to himself that he would be the person who would report anything which seemed to him to call for inquiry in the conduct of a district justice, to a judge of the High Court, to conduct that inquiry.  The Minister is the man who reports to the judge of the High Court. That is the situation in a section of the Act of 1946.  The Minister is the person who must take cognisance of something that the district justice is doing and he must report&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He asks a judge of the High Court to conduct an inquiry and when the judge has finished that inquiry he reports direct to the Minister and there, so far as the law is concerned, the matter ends.  It is the Minister we have to attack in order to find out whether he has reported something which we think should not be reported or to find out what the nature of the report is.  I suggest in these circumstances, it is proper to ask the Minister in connection with an attack on individual district justices, whether his attention has been directed to what is alleged against the district justice, whether he has taken any action, if he has got a report and what is the effect of the report.  I am not proposing to do that now but I suggest that the matter which Deputy Flanagan was attempting to raise was in order on this Estimate.  I do not know what the facts are but I do say this that if I had any facts arising out of an attack on a district justice in court, I am entitled to raise that matter on this Estimate and I do not know how else I could do it.</P>

      <P>It is clearly the case that the Minister is the person responsible for initiating the inquiry by a High Court judge into the conduct of a district justice.  If that be so, the Minister is open to our criticism for failing to move, if particular circumstances seemed to a Deputy to call for movement on his part and I suggest it arises.  I wanted not to let the matter you ruled upon pass without making that protest against it and formulating the protest in that reasoned way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Estimate generally, we are getting accustomed to this procedure on the part of the Minister of coming in here and giving a long recital of statistics of crime.  I remember that, a couple of years ago, he said we had reached a point at which crime had become stabilised, and, when I laughed at him, he added hurriedly that it was stabilised at 100 per cent. above 1939, but, still, it was stabilised.  He commends himself this year for the fact that it is not even as high as it was last year.  He gives us an amount of statistics as to the number of criminals we have, together with a certain segregation of these criminals' offences under the headings <Col N="390" /> of &ldquo;indictable&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-indictable&rdquo; and gives us also statistics relating to crime by juveniles.  He refers us in particular to the report prepared by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  The only one I have been able to obtain relates to 1945 and I gather from his reference to the report for 1946 that it has not yet been put in final form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not printed yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest pabulum we have in connection with crime in the country, even in statistical form, is the Commissioner's report covering 1945.  Why this document of 22 pages could not be produced earlier than March of this year dealing with the year 1946, I do not know.  It is not that the difficulty is in relation to printing, to which another Minister referred, because it is in neo-styled form.  It is not much good to give us these statistics, although it may be some comfort to people to know that there is not any big jump in the matter of crime and it may please others to know that we are falling back a little from the allhigh levels we reached last year and the levels we reached in 1942 and 1943. That is not a great deal of good to people if they are trying to investigate the crime position.  What people are anxious to know is whether there has been any examination made as to the cause of crime, whether anybody in the Minister's entourage has attempted to discover what has led to the doubling of indictable crime in the country since 1939.  If we had some examination of that, we could ask the Minister whether or not any steps are being taken to eradicate these causes or whether the Minister merely says: &ldquo;That is my colleagues' doing, and, although I have collective responsibility with them for such things as the higher cost of living and degraded standards of living, it is not my particular responsibility on this Vote.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the statistics for what they are worth, one or two things strike me and I speak all the time about the 1945 figures.  It seems to be accepted as the proper average that proceedings are taken in roughly 50 per cent. of the crimes reported to <Col N="391" /> the police.  I take that as the general average.  Only in 50 per cent. of the cases reported to the police are proceedings eventually instituted and, of course, a lesser percentage of the proceedings result successfully, but on the whole it looks as if 50 per cent. is taken as the average, and apparently the Department is happy enough in that circumstance.  If the Guards take proceedings in roughly half the cases in which offences are notified, the matter is all right.  I wonder is the Minister satisfied that that is a good situation, or is there any explanation of why the other 50 per cent. are allowed to go without any proceedings being taken?</P>
    <P>That percentage is specially referred to in page 7 of this report under a particular heading.  Taking this matter of offences against property without violence, the average seems to be held all the way through.  The percentage of offences in which proceedings were taken in 1938 was 56.  It goes down as low as 44 per cent. in 1939 and reached the 50 per cent. mark only twice.  At the moment we are in the region of 48 or 49 per cent.  That, as I say, is a special heading, but, generally speaking, it looks as if the crimes, so far as advancing towards proceedings is concerned, are half mysteries.  The other half are brought before the judges and a determination follows.</P>
    <P>I was amazed on looking through this report by one figure.  I had thought that the great burden imposed on the courts, the lower regions of the courts, recently was in connection with the stealing of pedal cycles and I was amazed to find that, in 1938, there were 1,160 cases of thefts of pedal cycles. I do not know whether that figure represents the cases reported or the cases tried, but the figures are roughly the same.  Thefts of that type rose to 1,400 in the first year of the war and that cannot have been the effect of war conditions or of putting people on bicycles, because the figure is for 1939 and the increase in bicycle riding had not started to a great extent at that time.  We swing then from 1,400 in 1939 to 1,530.  One of the shocks I got was to find that, in spite of the very <Col N="392" /> big increase in the use of pedal cycles, the numbers of thefts have only risen from 1,400 to 1,530.  It was higher in 1942 and 1943 when it went up to 3,362 and to 2,252, but to me the fact that we are only at that figure now is rather surprising.</P>
    <P>I find in this report a comment upon which I myself must make a comment. The Commissioner on page 10 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The marked and sustained increase in larcenies since 1942 is regarded as unsatisfactory.  62 per cent. of the total number of larcenies was reported from the Dublin Metropolitan Division.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention now to this comment as showing the state of society we have:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Over 40 per cent. of these larcenies could have been prevented if the owners took reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of property, such as pedal cycles.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not so very big as I have shown&mdash;&ldquo;property in unattended vehicles, clothing left on clothes-lines at nights&rdquo;&mdash;that is almost put forward as a default on the part of the public. Apparently, society has come to the point that one is regarded as giving trouble to the police if one leaves clothes on a clothes-line at night&mdash;&ldquo;ladies' handbags in dance halls and churches, overcoats&rdquo;&mdash;I do not mind overcoats &ldquo;in hotels or restaurants&rdquo;&mdash; but overcoats &ldquo;in halls of houses.&rdquo; Have we come to the point that the Commissioner thinks fit to complain that the public are leaving the washing on the clothes-line at night, that women are leaving handbags in churches and that overcoats are being hung up in the halls of private houses? When I was a boy I used to be amused by the old melody about &ldquo;Rich and rare were the gems she wore&rdquo;, and the lady who could walk through all Ireland, and the comment: &ldquo;Were Erin's sons so good or so cold as not to be tempted by women or gold?&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think it is proper to throw that comment on the public without some explanation, that the Commissioner sees fit to complain that an extremely difficult task is left upon the police if people leave their overcoats in the hall at night, if women leave handbags in churches, and if the ordinary housewife leaves the washing on the line at night? Apparently, that is the situation that we have reached.</P>
      <P>I wonder has the Minister with his associates made any attempt to discover anything about the incidence of crime and the peculiar nature of it and what has led to this special outbreak in the last five or six years.  There have been many books written investigating this matter of recent years and they all appear to agree upon one or two points.  One is, first of all, that crime is not so common in a rural area as it is in a city.  Those statistics do not enable us to say whether that is so in this country or not but surely a very easy distribution of the statistical matter at the Minister's disposal would enable us to see whether that is so or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the next point&mdash;the special matter of juvenile delinquency &mdash;I find myself up against the comment of the Commissioner's at page 15.  He says that &ldquo;the circumstances contributing to delinquency are thought to be&rdquo;&mdash;I do not know why it is put in that rather detached way&mdash;&ldquo;lack of parental control, desire to get money for amusement, mischief, youthful gang influence, criminal associations and necessity.&rdquo;  The peculiar thing is that, in 1939, there is a 50 mark in regard to necessity and it only rises to 54 in 1945.  That is not stated to be a <Col N="394" /> percentage.  I take it to be actual cases.  If that is so, then it means that, on the Commissioner's view, necessity is having less absolute value as a source of crime than it used to have. If that is supposed to be the inference to be drawn from that, I do not agree with it and I do not know anybody who is interested in these criminological matters who would agree with that view.  In any event, that referred only to juvenile delinquency and I do not know what the Commissioner's views are with regard to crime on the whole because, on the whole, the view that I understand has been taken in regard to crime is that, first of all, it is less notorious in rural areas and, secondly&mdash; and here I do not want to be subjected to any distortion; I do not want anything I say here misrepresented&mdash;it is clearly recognised that the lower the element of society, judged entirely by the income group, definitely the more crime there is.  I do not say that with a view to criticising poor people in any community, particularly in this community, but it is stated to be a fact objectively found in other communities. I wonder is it the case here.</P>
    <P>There are many explanations.  The explanations run along very ordinary lines: that, in the first instance, the home circumstances are not very attractive and people are thrown, of necessity, out on the street more than when the home is in some way attractive; secondly, the type of control that is exercised in the poor household beset by all sorts of amazing difficulties arising out of the mere struggle to live, of course must be less effective than the control that is exercised when the parents of the family have some leisure to think about something else than how to get the next day's bread and butter. There is a third point: that the community life that is lived in a city, and particularly when one gets to the lower quarters of a city, is on a much lower level and that the standards that are achieved there are naturally of a lower type than they would be in other quarters.</P>
    <P>That is put in different ways.  One refers to what is called the sway of public opinion and it has been asserted definitely with regard to other commutive <Col N="395" /> nities than our own that in what I call the mean streets of any community, the swing of public opinion, the standard of public opinion and the standard of public morality is apt to be lower than in other places.  When one says that, one has to recognise the amazing examples to the contrary and there are amazing examples to the contrary.  I know that sociologists going around bad quarters in different cities are often struck at the amazing control that good parents achieve over their children and that good parents achieve even over the more or less adult members of their families, notwithstanding the desperate difficulties to which they are subjected.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister whether he could not assist us by dividing this statistical material for us a bit better in the future, so that we could learn is it true that the rural community is less inclined to crime and, secondly, is it true that, so to speak, the middle-class group has a less high incidence of crime amongst its members than the people who are forced to live in tenement houses and under all sorts of peculiar disorder and disagreeable conditions, because that has been suggested.  If figures prove these two facts then, of course, there are two tendencies in life here that it would be proper to attempt to correct from the angle of the prevention of crime or from the angle of diagnosing causes of crime and trying to prevent them having their usual effect.  One would be to try to prevent the amazing drift that there is to the cities and towns of this country from the countryside. The second thing is to attempt to prevent the degradation of life in the country which has been taking place here in the last five years through the terrible increase in the cost of living and the consequent decrease in the purchasing power of what people have got to live upon.  One cannot, in the absence of the statistical material, make any attempt to discover what are the reasons for this prevalence of crime and these amazingly large numbers of crime.</P>
    <P>People always refer casually to the war and say that war means disordered mentality and a loosening up of the <Col N="396" /> moral viewpoints of the community and, therefore, that you have, so to speak, to expect, even though you may deplore, an increase in crime during any war period.  We had not war.  We had not the war circumstances that have led to the loosening up of public morals and the giving of lesser standards amongst those who make public opinion.  We had not them, in any event, in full force.  But when that loosening of morals ascribed to war is further analysed, one of the points I find always adverted to is that homes are broken up and that where a home is broken up, and particularly where the male parent is forced away either to service of an army type or some sort of munition works then, of course, there is not the same standard in the house and, therefore, the children get more or less out of hand and, therefore, there is a disposition towards crime.</P>
    <P>Again, if that be the case, it must be remembered that, although we had not the impact of war here, we had the impact of very heavy emigration, which undoubtedly did help to break up homes in this country and undoubtedly did remove in very many cases the people to whom the children would ordinarily have looked for help, the people who were bringing in the money, the individual of the house, the father or possibly the mother or elder brother or sister, who was helping to support the home and who was getting some little bit of moral authority through the fact that he or she was a bread-earner for the little community. In the absence of the statistical material, it is not possible to go into this very much.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the matter of crime, its incidence and what causes it, the Minister and his Commissioner make a segregation into what are called indictable offences and non-indictable offences.  I gathered from my reading of the newspapers this morning that the non-indictable offences, about which we need not bother very much, are classified under four headings: (1) licences for dogs and all sorts of offences in connection with dogs; (2) offences under the Road Traffic Act and Acts; (3) offences under the Intoxicating <Col N="397" /> Liquor Acts; and (4) school attendance.  With regard to these, I have always felt that the Guards have impressed on them to too great a degree the necessity for seeing that publicans meticulously observe the intoxicating liquor laws.</P>
    <P>I would be prepared to go a good length of the way with Deputy Flanagan in saying that if there was more attention paid to the giving of licences in connection with all-night functions, if there was a greater tightening up in that respect, it would probably have a better effect on the whole community than these meticulous inquiries as to whether a publican has kept his licensed premises open for five or six minutes beyond the legal time.  From reports that I have seen myself, it would appear as if nine-tenths of a Guard's life is spent in looking for offences under the intoxicating liquor code. Why we should bother about that so much, I do not know.  At the moment it is not one of the great crimes against society.  I would not say that drunkenness is on the increase so far as the adult population is concerned, and in any event whatever degree of drunkenness there may be we are not likely to have any great addition to it if people do keep their premises open for five or seven minutes after the recognised time.  It seems to me a great waste of time, particularly in the rural areas, to have Guards setting out on patrol duty to see if the public houses in the area are closed at the proper time.</P>
    <P>Again, with regard to these non-indictable offences, I wish the Commissioner in his report to the Minister would make a further segregation. There is a fair amount of matter that comes before the District Courts which can be properly described as a sort of social bad manners.  While it may be described as that, it has not anything with a great moral fault in it.  I think it would be well if the Minister could get that further segregation so that we might have clearly before us incidents or offences which really might be called social bad manners as opposed to something that had about it incipient depravity.  In the courts, I have seen a number of Guards sworn to give evidence against unfortunate children found playing football around deserted <Col N="398" /> quarters in this city, quarters where there is no traffic and where there are no plate glass windows to be broken or property to be destroyed.  The country boy has the great advantage that there is no interference with him when he turns out to play football. If he feels the inclination to throw stones, he can do so because it is not apt to get him into trouble.  Country boys can engage in all the activities that boys will engage in, activities which are quite harmless and some of which are quite healthy.  If the city boy attempts the same thing, he is brought into court because there is the fear that if he gets beyond a certain point he is going to meet with an injury caused by vehicular traffic or that property will be broken or trespass done.  Quite an amount of that sort of thing might, I think, be described as bad manners from the aspect of society. If we had this further segregation that I speak about, we might be able to get from it some indication of what can be regarded as even budding crime, something that is going to cause the community harm, and what in the old days would not merit more for a youngster than a cuff in the ear.  At the moment we have the solemn farce of people being paraded in court and fined for these so-called offences.</P>
    <P>The matter of prisons has been very much debated.  I wish that at some time we could have a debate on prisons and on nothing else so that we might be able to find out if there is any common ground between us on the matter.  I wonder if the Minister or his officials has any real idea of what is happening in prisons, and whether he deliberately intends that some of the things that go on in them should take place.  Is there a mind and a purpose behind what goes on in them, or is the position what I am led to believe it is, namely, that there is a certain amount of tiredness, something in the nature of a recognition that this was the system which people found when they came to office, and that nothing is done because it would require a tremendous amount of energy to make a change?  If the objective of a prison is to degrade a person, then we should know whether the instrument is <Col N="399" /> properly fashioned to that end.  If the object be to punish a person for something that he has done, by depriving him of his liberty for a certain time, then we ought to know how much further we want to go in the way of punishment, or whether we really feel that when we deprive a person of his liberty that is the penalty he pays to society for whatever offence he has committed, but that beyond that we are not going to inflict any type of degradation upon him.</P>
    <P>I suggest that what happens is a tremendous degradation.  I do not think it is done deliberately, but definitely it is a degradation.  One cannot object to confinement.  People break the law and, apparently, the only punishment that the mind of man has thought over the centuries is that such people should, for a period, be deprived of the sweets of liberty, so that during that period they will be subjected to discipline.  They will have to rise at a certain time in the morning, go to bed at a certan time, retire to their cells at a certain hour, and will be more closely governed even than boys are in a boarding school and that is severe enough at times.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the situation is the same in prisons nowadays as it was many years ago, when I received a report on the subject.  I do not think there has been much change in the interval. Of course, there is the other side to it, that nobody wants to make prisons a home from home for people. I think some Deputies said that if that were done you would have people queueing up to get into them, especially during the hard weather.  No one wants to go that length.  The point, however, is that unnecessary hardship cannot do anything but hurt a man's personality, and that should be avoided.</P>
    <P>Jails are notoriously cold.  Hardly anybody can go into a gaol, even on a hot day, without feeling the cold.  It may be that part of the prison system is that gaols should be kept cold.  I am not thinking now of the present fuel difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the reason for that is that they are built of stone and it is hard to warm them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that part of the system, or would we like, if we could, to have the accommodation for prisoners somewhat better than it is from the angle of cold?  Even visitors to prisons, during warm weather, are oppressed by the cold.  As we know, a great many people in this country suffer from rheumatism.  A person in the incipient stages of that disease would be found to be suffering acutely from it after a short period in gaol because the conditions there, from the point of view of the cold, would be so different from what he was accustomed to in his own home.  Is the position this, that those in authority are too tired and too lazy to do anything about the matter?</P>
      <P>Similarly, with regard to light.  I do not know anything about Portlaoighise Prison.  I do not know why the Minister will not allow Deputy Flanagan to visit it, except that he might avail of the opportunity to barrack the Minister.  All that one can say is that the lighting conditions in most of these places is, generally speaking, deplorable.  The buildings may be old fashioned.  Let us take this test.  If a person were left in a cell the whole day long, on a winter's day, it would not be possible for him, with ordinary eyesight, to read the daily newspaper for a longer period than four hours.  If that is so and it has been put to me that it is so&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean by artificial light?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>By natural light.  I will speak of artificial light later.  It is not possible for a person to read on a winter's day for a period longer than four hours.  I believe that to be the situation.  I am questioned about artificial light.  I do not know what the circumstances generally are with regard to artificial light but complaints are that it is badly placed.  I do know that there are certain places where the situation is still this: that there is a flickering gas jet outside certain cells&mdash;it may have been replaced in recent periods by an electric bulb.  It is outside the cell and a person has to stand holding up a newspaper to the little circle of light which comes from outside.  If that is <Col N="401" /> so, it means that the person cannot read except four hours during the day&mdash;if he has anything of reading type to occupy himself and he is under difficulties when the artificial light is turned on.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of food, Deputies here have complained about it and it is a common complaint.  I find here two opposition points of view.  When I had something to do with government we often got reports as to the type of food that was supplied to the prison authorities and on that report a Minister could come into the Dáil and say that he had a good case and that nobody could have a better one.  &ldquo;We are buying as good food as the ordinary community,&rdquo; in whatever area the prison is.  But if you take the attitude of mind of the people who are getting the food, it undergoes an amazing change.  They say that the food is not good; alternatively, that it is good food supplied in a shockingly bad way.  There is no doubt about it the food is flung to prisoners.  It is not served.  There is no attempt at serving. Again the attitude is why would you coddle people who have committed crimes.  Let them have their food flung to them as if they were animals. That is part of the treatment.  We want to make it hard for them.  If we know that it is part of the punishment we can accommodate ourselves, but I strongly object to it.</P>
      <P>In spite of the fact that, from the point of view of price and everything else, good food is apparently going to certain jails, if you ask any of the prisoners&mdash;and they are not fastidious; they are not inclined to be finicky&mdash; undoubtedly a criticism comes that either the food is bad or very badly put up.  Deputy Cafferky and his colleague told us about the utensils that are used. That is all part of what I call the service. I suppose no one can expect snow-white napery.  But when one thinks of the warnings that are given outside of having a teacup with a cut on it and thinks of the level of life that is lived in a jail and thinks of the almost entirely broken crockery in which people are given their food, it all adds up to an avoidable amount of misery and suffering that is put on these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="402" /> Take the matter of dirt.  It has been associated with jails from time immemorial.  I am not speaking of that grave and active form of dirt known as vermin, but dirt generally as an accompaniment of jail treatment.  The difficulty of washing is sometimes pretty big.  A man who wants to keep himself clean even where he finds himself in the position where he is not going to be prevented from using a safety razor, is going to find it hard to keep himself clean.  A certain change comes over the man who is in the dock one day and who, a few days later, is required to give evidence in connection with some conspiracy.  Even after a few days there is a change in the man; where he may have passed himself off as an ordinary citizen before, he now has the stamp of a criminal and it is partly the result of the difficulties of keeping his person clean.  I do not know the present position in jails but I want to inquire into this matter. There was a system of having in cells what is known as a slop pail.  I do not know if that exists as an ordinary matter in a jail at the moment but if it does it is a scandal.  It means that a man may have to spend a great part of the night in a foggy atmosphere caused no doubt by himself, but caused naturally by himself.  It is often a situation where a man has to eat his food under such atmosphere conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same way still.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a place known as &ldquo;the chapel of ease&rdquo; at the Bridewell where more than one person can be put into the cell and where there is one lavatory-convenience put into the cell which all the occupants can use but the method of flushing the lavatory is outside.  So until a goodnatured Guard comes along and discharges that particular duty for them, the persons may have to pass part of their time and to eat their food in the odour of their own and other people's excrement.  That is a situation that I do not think should be tolerated and it would not require a great deal to make some improvement in that.  I have asked here whether these conditions prevail.  I understand they do in certain <Col N="403" /> circumstances.  Add all these together&mdash;cold, bad light, dirt and food which, even though it is properly procured, is certainly served in such a manner as not to be very attractive and appetising to a person.  Add to all that the fact that a man has to perform natural functions in the cramped area in which he has to live, and you get a system of prison treatment that is deplorable.  We may pride ourselves that we have advanced since the days when Dickens wrote about jails, but we have not gone very far in comparison to the advances that have been made outside jails.  At the end of all that, I want to ask the Minister if these are the prevailing conditions.  I suppose I have over-painted the matter but suppose that there is some substance in what I have said, is there no way of avoiding all that?  You do not hit the criminal hard enough! Is it a deliberate purpose or is it that we have still institutions and that the people who are connected with institutions tolerate conditions that they would not tolerate in their own homes?  Is there no way of getting some improvement in these conditions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some further points.  First and most important point I want to ask about is as to whether some inquiry should not be made into the causes of crime.  We could put our finger on certain things and attempt to stop the growth of crime amongst us. A certain part of this report by the Commissioner deals with juvenile crime.  Again, I wish the Minister to give us a little more information on this whole matter.  I am especially anxious to learn, in connection with juveniles, whether what is alleged against them as &ldquo;crime&rdquo; is really crime or pranks or mischief which the Gardaí think ought to be stopped because, if not stopped, it may cause some kind of public nuisance.  It is very disturbing to find that, amongst the juvenile offences, are house-breaking, burglary&mdash;I am leaving out the larceny of pedal cycles because that relates, as a general rule, to other classes&mdash;and larceny from unattended vehicles.  House-breaking is very big. Burglary is not so big.  Larcenies from shops and stalls amongst juveniles who, <Col N="404" /> I take it, are persons under 18, are very big indeed.  Larcenies not exceeding £5 in value are very big.  They are larcenies of something other than pedal cycles, which are segregated under a special heading.  It is amazing that there are a very big number of cases of malicious damage to property.  In that respect, I should like to know if &ldquo;malicious damage to property&rdquo; represents simply a boy pitching a stone in the air, not knowing where it will alight, the stone doing some damage.  Is &ldquo;malicious damage to property&rdquo; of that character in the main, or is it a thing which has more malice about it than throwing a stone in the air and being indifferent as to where it alights.</P>
    <P>I want to query matter on page 18. We have a statement as to the causes of the circumstances contributing to the delinquency under the headings of: lack of parental control, desire to get money for amusement, mischief, youthful gang influence, criminal association, and necessity.  Of these, the smallest group is &ldquo;necessity.&rdquo;  The next smallest group is &ldquo;criminal association.&rdquo;&ldquo;Lack of parental control&rdquo; is described as being the contributory circumstance in the great majority of cases.  I wonder what this is based upon and I should like to see it expanded in a future report.  I wonder what analysis is made in this connection. I have often heard the police giving evidence in court and talking about boys, with good parents, forming bad associations and going wrong from that point on.  But I cannot comprehend the statement in the year 1945 that &ldquo;necessity,&rdquo; as a contributory factor, amounts only to 54, while, in 1939, it amounted only to 50. As I have said, these are not percentages; they are absolute figures.  That amazes me.  It is contrary to all that has been discovered and written up in other countries where the matter has been under investigation.  There, it is stated that &ldquo;necessity&rdquo; is the greatest contributory factor to crime, particularly amongst juveniles.</P>
    <P>Again, these figures are not of much value to us unless we can get some assistance.  How many per 1,000 of the juvenile population come into court <Col N="405" /> for, say, indictable offences and for non-indictable offences?  I am not bothering so much about the non-indictable offences.  Is the number per 1,000 of the juveniles of Dublin coming before the courts increasing?  That is the only way to test this question of juvenile delinquency and find whether it is increasing or not.  An estimate should be made in succeeding years as to the number of juveniles who make their appearance more than once before the courts in the period in which they are described as juveniles.  Is this record one of persons appearing once, and once only, before the courts?  I understand not.  Many of them appear at the age of 14 or 15 years and appear again&mdash;sometimes more than once&mdash; before they pass the age of 18.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I want to go back to another table where we get the age groups in connection with crime. On page 12 of this 1945 report, we get under age groups the number of persons convicted.  The statistics are somewhat enlightening but they do not go far enough.  The groupings are: under 14, 14-16 and 16-18.  Then we get the big groups, 18-21 and 21-30. Those two groups combined give you, on the average, 50 per cent. of all the crimes committed in the country. It is, of course, a big age group, comprising 12 years between the two.  The groups specially noted cover from 14 to 40-26 years.  The others are: under 14 and over 40.  I ask the Minister to enable us to split up that group, 18-21 and, particularly, the group 21-30, because I understand that it is somewhere on that age group investigators are mainly working.  They believe that it is from that age group people may have entered upon crime but not gone so far as to be without possibility of reform.  In this group, between 21-30, the figures are just flung at us.  I think that it should be split into three-year periods.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the juveniles, I find it hard to accept this statement as to the circumstances contributing to crime.  It is put in a detached way.  It is stated that the &ldquo;circumstances contributing&rdquo; were &ldquo;thought to be&rdquo;, which would suggest that the statement was not based upon special reports <Col N="406" /> from Gardaí in individual cases with a generalisation made from those reports.  But there must be some background to the statement.  It attracts my attention because &ldquo;necessity&rdquo; is certainly regarded as one of the great contributing factors in other countries.  We shall be an exception if we find that that does not obtain here. &ldquo;Lack of parental control&rdquo; is then given as the great cause of crime.  That is a matter that should be further inquired into.  It is easy to paste that label&mdash;&ldquo;lack of parental control&rdquo;&mdash;on a case and say: &ldquo;That is what we found in that case&rdquo;.  Can the Minister not go more deeply into the matter than that and tell us the types of home this statistic refers to?</P>

      <P>No, the money going into the house.  I want to find out if we are in the same position as other countries, where they have come to the conclusion that crime, and the incidence of crime, undoubtedly attaches itself to poverty and bad conditions. I say that without attempting to be superior or attempting to pass criticism on people who, because they are poor, are subjected to greater temptation than others in respect of crime.  It has been found in other countries, too&mdash;this has, apparently, surprised a great many people&mdash;that what is called talent, or alertness of mind, is found, on the whole, to be better evidenced in better-class families than in the poorer-class families.  For the poverty has affected not merely the surroundings of the unfortunate child but its disposition and its chances of erring on the criminal side and also has had the effect of not prompting him to achieve the standard of intellectual development that people who are better placed are able to reach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that the herd instinct and the standard of morality are of a lower level the lower you go in the income groups and that, when you get, in an urban community, a group of people herded together with <Col N="407" /> the standard of morality at a low point because of the circumstances of the house, you are in for trouble.  It has been said that the more you multiply these circumstances, of an urban community and a degraded standard of living, the more you are certain to have outbreaks of trouble and the prevalence of crime.  If we got this statistical information, we could tackle this as a social problem and no longer think of it as something recorded in statistics. We have the Minister giving us year after year the number of offences committed and the number of people who have been sent to jail.  I suggest that this should be an occasion afforded to us for probing into these matters, instead of wringing our hands over increased numbers or cheering when they go down.  I do not see that we will get any further until there is an investigation into the social conditions of our people.  I still believe, and I have often said it here, that the more you allow your homes to be broken up by emigration, the more you tolerate bad housing conditions, the more you allow your cost of living to increase and to press on the moneys which people have got, the more you are heading for disease and crime. The statistics over the last five years have shown that abundantly.</P>
    <P>Someone has mentioned the influence of cinemas.  I wonder if anyone advising the Minister has passed any comment on that.  It is the easiest thing to say that children are led astray because of the exciting pictures they see.  People are beginning to criticise the use of what we used to call the &ldquo;shocker&rdquo; for the purposes of the radio and they are complaining that these are having a bad influence on the children.  I wonder if they are.  I hope the Minister may have some investigation into the point, so that, no matter how speculative the conclusions may be, we would have some conclusions. I cannot believe that the films I have seen really lead to any great increase in crime amongst children.  I do not believe that the wireless items pointed to as being dangerous have any effect whatever upon children's minds.  I remember <Col N="408" /> someone making a comment that those who were interested in hearing about the exploits of Dick Barton might do worse than that if they were to read the Life of the Taoiseach, because in Dick Barton's case virtue was triumphant while it may not be so in the other case.</P>
    <P>In turning now to the Civic Guards, I wish to think of them, not as guardians of law and order but as human beings.  The Minister told me yesterday that the old time salary for them was £2,400,000 and he is now going to give them an increase of £350,000. Surely he must recognise the force of what we have been arguing about in other Departments?  His colleagues must have told him about it.  Will he appreciate that the purchasing power of the £ is now 10/-.  His colleague, the Minister for Finance, has exhibited an index of wholesale prices.  I am not giving the cost-of-living figure, because that might only impact on small families or some families on a low standard.  The whole range of wholesale commodities in 1943 showed an increase over 1938 of 100 per cent., and it has gone up since then.  Retail prices, of course, show a much greater increase than that.  There is no figure to which anybody can look the consideration of which will not lead to the conclusion that the £ is worth only 10/-.  The mass of the people under the heading of Civic Guards who used to draw from the Minister £2,400,000 in purchasing capacity, will appreciate that in the last couple of years it has been worth only £1,200,000.  He proposes to give them £350,000.  He has raised them from something short of £2,500,000 to something less than £1,500,000&mdash;and I have no doubt that the addition of this £350,000 will have a certain inflationary effect and will reduce the value of the £ still further.</P>
    <P>How does a Minister justify that, since no one ever regarded their wage as being too extravagant a wage long ago?  Then, by a process of increasing costs and reducing values, these people are getting half of the old sum. We are giving them £350,000 and telling them to continue to be good boys and to do more work.  That is what is happening to the low-income groups.  I <Col N="409" /> want to plead for those people.  The Civic Guard we see in the courts and out on the streets, patrolling or directing the traffic, appears in uniform and is regarded as the protector of law and order for the community.  These men have homes.  Quite a number of them are married and they have responsibilities to their wives and children. Most of them are people who did make some little provision for their families. I found them amongst the most ambitious of the community in connection with trying to get schooling for children. Some of them made efforts to add to their earnings by work in leisure time.  A considerable number of them, especially around the city, have made extra money out of turf in the last three or four years, but that was by working hard over very protracted periods.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister stop to analyse the result of the reduction of wages that has taken place in their case?  It would take someone with greater imagination than we have here and with a better appreciation of the individual circumstances of those people, to draw a picture of the effect of that reduction.  One could break it up into all sorts of unhappiness&mdash; children not allowed to get the schooling which was intended for them, homes being run on a much more economical and grudging scale and in a more sordid way, the life that the man and his wife and children have to live being deprived of the little amenities that men who have risen to the point of being Civic Guards ought to be entitled to expect.  If they had anything of the nature of insurance or any bit of property, they found themselves in the position in which they had to liquidate most of the property and are living in half-empty houses, deprived of little comforts in the way of carpets they used to have in the old days.  It is not possible to arrive at any exact conclusion on that matter, but that there has been a vast amount of unhappiness caused to these people and their families is undoubtedly clear.</P>
    <P>The Minister now gives this little addition of £350,000.  I know he will reply that, if he gave way to all the demands, we would have a vast bill for the public services.  So we would <Col N="410" />&mdash;and I agree with the viewpoint put forward by the Minister for Industry and Commerce recently, that you must think of this no longer in terms of pounds but in terms of half-sovereigns. The trouble is that, when you look at the incidence of these charges, you see that we could all bear double the cost of Government as easily as we bore the other cost in 1938, if we were all getting double the income.  But we are not getting that.  If you put it in that fictitious way, you are saying to a person: &ldquo;There is a £52,000,000 Budget, but it is really only £26,000,000.&rdquo; But the group in the Civic Guards who used to get £2,500,000 between them suddenly realise they are getting only £1,200,000 and the Minister says: &ldquo;Take another £300,000 and that will make £1,500,000 between you&rdquo;, and with that sum they are expected to bear the burdens that they used to bear when they had between them £2,500,000.  That is a wholly unreal attitude for the Minister to adopt and it will not result in satisfaction among the members of the community concerned. Anyhow, that is the result of what has happened here.</P>
    <P>This is an extraordinary country Only four countries in the world have behaved as we have behaved.  We were singled out for exposition before the public by the Montreal Labour Office as one of the four countries in the world which let the wages paid during the war drop below pre-war level.  Of the other countries with us in that connection three are devastated countries, three countries that felt the impact of the war to the utmost&mdash; France, Czecho-Slovakia and Japan. Leaving out the devastated countries, we are singular in that we decided to depress the standard of living of the community here by the activities the Government engaged in.</P>
    <P>It is a painful past to look back upon, and it is particularly painful for this group with whom we are dealing. I have no objection to giving these people £300,000.  I am sorry it is not double or quadruple that amount.  If it were quadrupled it would be merely putting those people back into the position they occupied in 1938.  It would not be too much to think about putting them there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the Minister has, by his figures, shown that juvenile delinquency is on the increase.  I suppose the Minister is not in a position to give the causes of that increase. Sometimes people think that, possibly, in this country we are too sentimental so far as our attitude towards lawbreakers is concerned.  It is extraordinary that the first thing our sensitive people do is to find an excuse for the man who commits a crime.  It is an extraordinary mentality and if any check is to be put on this wave of juvenile delinquency it is up to the adult population to show a greater appreciation of their duties and a greater sense of their civic responsibilities. By co-operating with the Guards, they can help to put an end to a form of crime which, if allowed to develop, will react very unfavourably on the country as a whole in the future.</P>
      <P>I should like to express my astonishment at the report submitted by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and his reasons why certain crimes have been committed in this country.  I have in mind that part of the report in which the Commissioner seemed to attach a certain amount of blame to the people because of their carelessness in leaving things lying about.  It used to be the proud boast of our people, especially in the rural parts, that they never locked their doors at night and never locked the gate; they were able to leave most of their agricultural implements outside and never was there anything stolen.  I was surprised at the reference to people leaving things in motor cars.  If a man is honest he will not lift a thing in the street, unless to give it to a Guard or to some other responsible person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If people lived in the way we pretend we are living, there would not be any need for Civic Guards at all.  I am afraid that in this country there is not sufficient appreciation of the value of the words &ldquo;truth&rdquo; and &ldquo;honesty&rdquo;. I advise the Minister to have a consultation with the Minister for Education and point out to him that, in addition to educating our young people to get leaving certificates, they <Col N="412" /> should pay a little attention also to the meaning of those two words and then, perhaps, we would not have so much juvenile crime.</P>
    <P>As regards recruiting for the Civic Guards, I should like to know whether it is a fact that one of the conditions before a young fellow can join the Guards is that he must have a competent knowledge of Irish.  I can quite appreciate the importance of the language, but one of our proud boasts in the past was the physique of our police force.  People from all over the world used to stop in the street and admire the physique of the old force known as the Dublin Metropolitan Police.  I met numbers of fine young men recently in my county and they told me that they were unable to pass the entrance examination for the Guards because of the language condition.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Department are not paying sufficient attention to a most necessary qualification&mdash;physique.  I know members of the Garda Síochána who joined the force some years ago. So far as their education is concerned, I know for a fact that they did not pass the fourth standard in the national school, but I read with great satisfaction recently that tributes were paid to the manner in which they discharged their duties in the detection of crime.  If applicants for the Garda Síochána must have a competent knowledge of Irish, how is it that that condition is not insisted upon in the appointment of Supreme Court judges, High Court judges, Circuit Court judges, district justices and county registrars?  The old saying says that what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander.  In the case of appointments made recently, especially higher appointments in the courts, by no stretch of the imagination could it be argued that the people appointed have what is known as a competent knowledge of Irish.</P>
    <P>I know it is very unpopular to say anything about the Irish language.  I am not saying anything against it as a language, but I suggest it is hypocritical and inconsistent to make appointments in one section without insisting on this qualification but when you make <Col N="413" /> appointments for ordinary men who wish to join the Civic Guards, they are told they must have a competent knowledge of the language.  That is one thing I should like the Minister to clear up, because it has been put to me times out of number that some of these young men failed simply because of the language.  It may be argued that men who qualify in other subjects are equally competent in the Irish language.  Let me point out, however, that some boys have an aptitude for learning languages more quickly than others.</P>
    <P>I think there should be some marks given for physique.  Looking around now, one cannot say that many of those who joined the force recently are Joe Louises, or fulfil the physical conditions that used to be requisite years ago.  I think the Minister might relax the regulations to the extent that he could reserve some positions for those whose general education was of such a nature that it would fit them to become members of the Garda Síochána, but who possibly might fail to have the language qualification&mdash;a competent knowledge of Irish to enable them to carry out their duties in that language.  There is a certain inconsistency, apparently, in view of the question Deputy Mulcahy put about the use of the language by members of the force, even in the Gaeltacht areas.  Even though a man may have a competent knowledge of Irish when he is appointed, it might be only once in a blue moon, to use a local expression, that he is called upon to give a public exhibition of his knowledge of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest I might overlook that point, as so many points have been raised in the course of the debate, I had better deal with it now.  It is a fact that a person, in order to become a member of the Garda Síochána, must pass a qualifying examination which is set by the Civil Service Commission and a knowledge of Irish is necessary.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the standard is but it is set out in the programme. It is such a standard that out of 168 of the latest recruits, 69 <Col N="414" /> were from national schools and were able to pass it.  That will give some idea of the standard.  Deputy McGilligan made a very interesting speech, but I am afraid he did not go fully into the report of the Commissioner. I do not blame him for that because it is a very voluminous document. He asked some questions about the family circumstances of juvenile delinquents.  If he had studied some of the tables in that report&mdash;I have not done it myself, I must say, because I had not the time&mdash;he would find that some of these tables give as full an account of the circumstances of these delinquents as could be expected.</P>
      <P>For instance, one table in Appendix E, Section B, gives, amongst other particulars, the nature of the offence, the number detained in industrial schools and reformatory schools, the number who were previously convicted, the premises or place where the crime was committed, the occupations of the persons charged, the school attendance record, etc.  Another table, in Appendix C, Section E, gives particulars as to circumstances of parents, lack of parental control, desire to get money, the number of cases in which the offenders reside with parents, the usual occupation of parents or guardians, particulars as to whether they are industrial workers, casual labourers, or have no occupation, whether the parents or guardians have been recently unemployed, the criminal record, if any, of the parents or guardians, etc.  I think these returns are very full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy wanted to know the income, as far as I could ascertain it, of the families concerned.  I do not think I have got that information. There is another table giving the number of rooms in tenement houses occupied by delinquents.  I think it is a very full return but at the same time I shall ask the Commissioner to consider the desirability of segregating the offences in the manner suggested by Deputy McGilligan&mdash;for instance, petty crimes, such as playing ball on the streets, destruction of property, etc., from the more serious crimes.  I think we are all deeply concerned at the <Col N="415" /> widespread malicious destruction of public property, even in the streets. It is a pity that there is not a better public spirit in that regard.  I think if more people informed the police when they saw things being maliciously broken, it would have a very good effect.  For instance, one often sees the corporation making some very nice plantations and a few days later it is found that the trees have been pulled down and destroyed.</P>
    <P>On the whole question of juvenile delinquency and its causes, naturally the only thing the Commissioner has to go on is the information which he derives from consultation with his officers, but I think he has good authority for everything he does. Deputy McGilligan may have his views, as I have mine, as to how these matters should be dealt with, but I think he will find very full information under most of these headings.  Deputy Dillon made the suggestion that instead of a remand home, there should be a clinic at which juvenile delinquents could be examined by doctors.  The position at present is that there is no such clinic but if the district justice thinks that a delinquent is mentally deficient, there are ample facilities for having the delinquent examined by a doctor.  I shall see if anything more can be done in that direction.  The whole question is a very big one indeed and I do not think anybody can definitely point out what are the causes.  All I can do is to express an opinion in the same way as Deputy McGilligan.  I have got to assume that the Commissioner is in a better position than most people to express an opinion on these matters.  He has police officers who are dealing with all sorts of offenders and who make private inquiries as to what the circumstances are.  They are able to give him advice as to what the causes are likely to be.  Further than that I do not think he can go.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say what is the relation between the tables in regard to juvenile offenders and those in regard to senior offenders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, I have not gone fully into these tables and I <Col N="416" /> would ask those Deputies who take a special interest in them to study them for their own benefit.  I will admit that I am not in a position now to go into the details of the report but if any special aspect is brought to my attention I shall try to do what I can about it.  I did give some preliminary figures for last year as compared with 1945 but I have not got the complete report for last year.  I would ask Deputies to make suggestions, such as Deputy McGilligan did, as to what the Commissioner might do.  I think that some of the reforms which Deputy McGilligan suggested are already in operation.  He wanted to know how crimes are distributed over the country.  There is a table giving that but it gives the information for each division.  It gives a separate table for the Dublin metropolitan area but the rest of the country is dealt with by divisions.  Perhaps for the cities of Cork, Waterford, Galway and such places, it might be possible to segregate the information, but I think Appendix B giving the details for the different divisions, affords an idea of how crime is spread over the whole country fairly well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Too well spread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan wanted more details but I think the Commissioner has told us in a very clear way how it is spread.  That brings me to another point raised by Deputy Coogan as to giving too many duties to members of the Garda.  Some Deputies here complain that Guards in the country do not get enough to do, but if Deputies look at Appendix D they will find that there is a very high percentage of detections in the case of petty crime&mdash;88 per cent, 89 per cent. and 92 per cent. in Donegal for instance. It is the big City of Dublin which brings the all-over average down.  Nevertheless, the record of detection there compares favourably with cities of comparable size elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone will realise how easy it is for people who want to commit crime to do so in a big city.  On the point of the Commissioner's warning, I think he is perfectly justified in expecting <Col N="417" /> people to keep some watch on their property.  Deputy McGilligan quoted the words of the old song: &ldquo;Rich and rare were the gems she wore&rdquo;.  I always believed that that was a myth, that it never happened, but I may be wrong.  This is true, however, that, in times of scarcity such as the present, people who ordinarily would not dream of stealing anything will steal.  That, unfortunately, is the fact and people have appeared in court, who, if there had been no scarcity, would never have appeared there.  Deputy McGilligan referred to the Commissioner's statement about clothes on clotheslines. The position is that certain clothing is very scarce and people will steal it if they get the opportunity. With regard to the Commissioner's reference to overcoats hanging in halls, I remember as a very small boy my mother always telling us to make sure to shut the door, because, if it were left open, the person who knocked at the door might run away with a coat, and that was many years ago.  All the Commissioner is doing there is stating that, in his opinion and in the opinion of his advisers, if people in Dublin took more care of their property and did not leave it hanging around unattended, 40 per cent. of these larcenies would have been avoided.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We must take people as they are.  I think it was the present Judge Fionan Lynch who said it was not the Government's job to make saints of people.  It is not our job. There is something in human nature which breaks out at times, no matter what we do.  It is not the way we would wish things to be that things are, and the police must act in accordance with conditions as they find them.  The fact is, as everybody knows and especially since the war, that if people are short of some article which <Col N="418" /> they have no hope of getting, a great number of them will take it.  Certain things have been stolen which people would not have bothered looking at before the war, such as paper.  I announced some time ago that large quantities of paper had been stolen, because paper was dear at the time, and people were prepared to buy it. Whatever people may say about the effects of the war and the aftermath of the war, I maintain that it is largely responsible for quite a big amount of the dishonesty which exists leading to prosecutions and the crimes that have taken place, and most fair-minded people will admit that.</P>
      <P>In considering this matter of crime, we must bear in mind that, although big numbers of crimes are reported, it would not be correct to say that that number of individuals were concerned in them.  There are cases in which one or two people may have committed ten or 12 different crimes, but, on the other hand, it is true that several people might have committed one crime.  On the whole, however, it is true to say that a great number of crimes are committed by the same people.  I have not had the figures analysed, but I will try to get them analysed in order to get the actual numbers, although we are never sure until a crime has been brought home to somebody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not, but I will try to get it done, so as to find out how many crimes were committed by the same people.  This matter of crime is a very difficult problem and the cause and prevention of crime is scarcely the job of the police.  Their job is to deal with people when a crime has been committed.  It is scarcely their job to get people into the frame of mind in which they will not commit crime&mdash; they have to deal merely with the commission of crime, as is well recognised, and there is no use in trying to place on this Department responsibility for developing such a mentality in people that they will not steal.  That is something for somebody else&mdash;for parents, the schools, and the churches.  Everyone <Col N="419" /> is doing his best, but it is a difficult problem.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Borstal institute, Deputy Dillon said he was glad that I had come round to his view about Clonmel not being a suitable place.  I did not change my attitude in that regard at all.  All I said on the occasion on which the Deputy raised the matter of the transfer from Cork to Clonmel was that it was a better place than Cork in which to house boys.  I have no doubt whatever about that.  I never said, and do not say now, that it is the type of place in which I should like to see any type of prisoner kept for very long.  We are improving the Clonmel building.  I heard that the Deputy was in Clonmel recently, and he will have seen the changes which have been made there. We are doing all we can to brighten the lives of these young fellows and to reform them.  The Deputy said the cells had flagged floors.  That is not correct&mdash;they are wooden.  We have enlarged the windows and have taken all the iron off the doors of the cells and made the cells sleeping quarters, because they are out of them for the entire day.  There is only a light lock on the door and there are four or five large rooms available.  There is a recreation room and a workroom and, generally speaking, the way the boys are being treated there is about as good as I should like to see them treated.  We have to be careful that there will be some element of punishment. There must be that element of punishment; otherwise, we might have a queue of boys seeking to get in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan went very fully into the question of general prison treatment and many of the things he said are true.  The old slop vessel is there still and it is very difficult to make a change in that respect.  I should like to see a change, if it were possible, but we must remember that we do not get buildings overnight.  I am satisfied that these jails are out of date.  They are old and were constructed at a time when facilities for the provision of sanitary arrangements were not what they are now.  If there is any means of getting away from this <Col N="420" /> business of having to keep that vessel in the cell all night, I will see if it can be done, but it is difficult.  It is not as easy to remedy that situation as people may think.  Deputies can understand that if the cells are to be opened any time at night that any prisoner wishes, the warders will be kept going at night by fellows who might want merely to annoy them.  It is a very difficult thing to arrange&mdash;the problem is due to the construction of the prisons &mdash;but I will look into it.</P>
    <P>With regard to food, I think it is a fact that almost anywhere where food is cooked for a great number, it is very difficult to do it well, but I am satisfied that there could be an improvement in the cooking facilities.  I am not sure if we have got an improvement in Portlaoighise.  The food there was quite good, but there was a great sameness about it because it was all being steamed or boiled.  I asked the Department to try to get some other way of cooking the food, such as roasting, and, if they have not got the necessary equipment installed, they are about to get it.  With regard to quantity and the calories we hear so much about, I do not know if they are sufficient for people in prison, but I am told they are adequate, if there was more variety.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy spoke about the prison clothing.  I always regarded the clothing provided for prisoners as very depressing, and for long-term prisoners, such as those in Portlaoighise, I am trying to get a better type of uniform or suit.  Deputies can understand the difficulty about short-term prisoners.  If a man is imprisoned for a month, it cannot be expected that he will be provided with a new suit.  There would be difficulties about sizes for casual prisoners.  In the case of casual prisoners, if their own clothes are clean, they are allowed to wear them, if they want to do it.</P>
    <P>A certain amount of time is allowed for recreation now, and it takes different forms.  I agree that the old ring is a very depressing thing and in Mountjoy it has been removed.  I was there a long time myself and I know this old iron railing.  I often walked around it.  It did not depress me very much but it might depress people who would <Col N="421" /> be there for a long time.  That is gone now and we are making provision for handball alleys to give them a chance to get some exercise.  I suppose it is only the young people who would play handball.  We are doing the same in Portlaoighise and Clonmel.  Sligo Prison, which was referred to, is one of the oldest prisons in this country. There are very few prisoners in it and there are not the facilities there that are in the other prisons.  I am trying to do something in that matter.  We are going to build a hall or some place where concerts could be held or where prisoners could go for recreation.  I intend to be careful.  It would be the wish of the House that we should not rival the Gresham Hotel, for instance, because there would be a danger in that.  I do not want to have it that way.  The thing is to draw the line.  I would like to do anything that is humanly possible to try to uplift these people who go into prisons.  Deputy McGilligan asked me was it the deliberate policy to degrade these people and, if it was, that we should tell them that.  It surely is not that.  The fact of their being in prison may create the impression on these people that that is the intention.  I say that it is not the intention but it is not easy to change these things.  A certain amount has been done in the way of providing wireless sets for most of the prisons, and games, and an odd concert, and lectures.  In that way we are trying to prevent the prisoners feeling that they are being sent there for the purpose of degrading them in addition to their other punishment.</P>
    <P>Warders have been referred to.  If a warder who lives in wishes to stay out after 11 o'clock he has to ask permission but I do not think that it is ever refused.  I admit that I never heard very much about it.  I do not think it can be a very great hardship. If it were, I probably would have heard more about it.  This is the first time it has been mentioned here.  I will see what the position is.  If there had been a grievance, I would have heard about it.  If they want to stay out for a dance, they must ask the governor.</P>

The question of uniform, that was raised by two Deputies, I will have looked into to see what can be done about it, that is, their having to go in uniform with prisoners.  There may be some very good reason for that.  I will have it examined.  That is all that arose in regard to prisons.</P>

I have not been able to find that out since he asked me the question.  If he had let me know, I could have found out.  I am not complaining of that.  I am merely saying that that is why I cannot answer it.  The position is that every member of the Garda has to have a knowledge of Irish.</P>

I am saying that there is no report sent by the Garda Síochána, as such, on that particular aspect but they are all in a position to transact all their business, and do transact all their business, in the Irish language.  He knows that, of course.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coogan asked me to explain the need for the new appointments in the Minister's office.  I did not deliberately omit that, although it is an important matter.  The fact is that it is a reversion to a state of affairs that existed about ten years ago, when there were two assistant secretaries. It was found that certain very important branches of work were not being dealt with, which a Department of Justice ought to perform, such as law reform and the consolidation of law, and things of that kind.  It was felt necessary to go back to the system in which there were two assistant secretaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dealt with the matter of police on non-police duties.  If the Deputy wishes to look at the report and the tables, he will see that the fact of the matter is that almost all over the country detection of crime by the Gardaí is very high outside Dublin City and that it is not the position <Col N="424" /> that they are not able to do their police duties.  I said, when he was not here, that many people believe that the actual police duties, as such, outside the big cities, would not take up their full time.</P>
    <P>He dealt with the Taca Síochána. The position about the Taca was that they came in at a higher rate than the ordinary recruits and they were not in the regular Garda force until after about 18 months or two years.  In that way they were getting a bigger initial pay for a period when new entrants would not be getting it.  They are not getting quite as much as the others are getting but, taking it on the whole, they got better conditions from the beginning and there is that to be put against the statement that was made that they were not being treated as well as the others.</P>
    <P>In regard to the widows and orphans of Gardaí, Deputy Dillon suggested the possibility of having them included in the widows' and orphans' pensions scheme under national health insurance in addition to whatever else they may get.  All that I can say is that that question was not touched on when the recent increases were given.  I cannot say anything more than that.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the salaries of District Court clerks and Circuit Court clerks.  I think there is a chance of something being done pretty soon for the Circuit Court clerks.  There is a difficulty with regard to the District Court clerks because the majority of them are part-time.  That brings in the question of unestablished people in the Civil Service.  That is a big obstacle to any settlement.  I am pressing the Minister for Finance to get something done in the matter.  All that I can say is that I will see him again about the court clerks, and particularly the group referred to by Deputies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cafferky wants me to give an instruction to district justices not to grant licences for dances.  Deputy Flanagan also referred to that.  Of course, that is not my job.  If abuses are taking place, I am sure district justices would be prepared to hear what public representatives had to <Col N="425" /> say on the matter.  I think any person of any standing can make a case before the courts.  It is not for me to tell the district justice what he is to do.  He is the judge as to whether a licence shall or shall not be given, and not the Minister.  If there is anything to be done about these dance-hall licences, it will have to be done by the courts. The Deputy also raised a question about increased accommodation for the Gardaí.  It is a good many years ago since I raised that matter myself.  We have not been able to do very much about it.  I am doing all in my power to get an early allocation on the priority list.  Of course, there are others competing for a place on that list too, and as Deputies can understand it is not easy for me to force my claim against the claims of others, but I am doing what I can.  I realise that it is necessary something should be done.  The position is becoming very bad.</P>
    <P>I am afraid what the Deputy said as to what goes on in the streets of Dublin at night is correct.  Things are becoming a bit of a scandal, but it is not easy to deal with it.  I have got some complaints about the way things are going in Dublin and as I say, they are pretty bad.  The Commissioner is seeing what he can do in the matter.  Deputies will realise that a Guard has to be very careful before he interferes in these matters.  I do think there is something in what the Deputy said that needs careful watching.</P>
    <P>Deputy M. O'Sullivan asked if anything had been done arising out of the findings of the members of the Labour Party following their visit to Portlaoighise Prison.  A handball alley has been provided and the matter of the cooking arrangements is being attended to.  I think I told the members what my views were about some of the things they reported on.  I will do all I can to have a better type of uniform clothing.  Deputy Costello spoke about instructions to justices.  They are never issued to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan suggested that we sent some circulars to district justices recently telling them what to do in certain circumstances.  I have no knowledge of that.  We did not do any <Col N="426" /> such thing.  The Deputy made his usual complaints about our refusal to give Garda reports in running down accidents.  The position is that where private people are concerned it is not desirable that the reports of the Gardaí should be made available to either party.  Those concerned should get the facts for themselves.  If a State car is involved it is a different matter.  The reports are then given, and I think that is fair enough.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne wants horse guards to regulate the traffic in Dublin.  We have no mounted force, and in any event I do not think it would work.  I suppose what he said is true that we want more uniformed Guards in Dublin.  Deputy Giles spoke about the frequent transfer of Guards.  All that I can say is that it is not such an easy matter to transfer a Guard who is married.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is need for some more.  The Commissioner feels that, too, and we will get them as soon as we can.  I do not know what the Deputy meant by his reference to the force going slack.  I took a note of what he said and I will look into the matter.  He also mentioned the need for new barracks and new houses.  We will get them as soon as we can.  Deputy McGilligan would not object to give the Guards four times as much pay as they are getting.  He said he was quite prepared to accept the statement of the Minister for Finance that the Budget is really only £26,000,000 and not £52,000,000.  I do not know whether the Minister for Finance agrees that the £ has only a purchasing value of 10/-.  The fact is that we are finding it hard to get the £52,000,000.  If we were to do what Deputy McGilligan has suggested, I do not know that we would be able to come to the House at all and ask for the sum that would be involved.  The position, of course, is that the cost of living has gone up for everybody, and that it will not come down until goods are in greater supply.  People cannot be fully compensated for the increased cost of living.  They have been compensated <Col N="427" /> to a certain extent, but it is elementary that until goods are in greater supply things will not be right. It is not my province to go into that. Deputy Moran and others spoke of the cost of the registration of title.  The position is that there was an increase in cost some years ago.  Following an action taken in the courts, it was decided by the Supreme Court that in the case of a transfer following death there was to be no fee charged.</P>

      <P>If we are going to make a practice of having Deputies going to these prisons and looking for complaints from some of these prisoners we will have nothing but trouble.  That was the result of the Labour Party visit.  We have a visiting committee there.  I am prepared to take any reasonable suggestion from any Party <Col N="429" /> as to who should be on that. There is nothing to hide.  All I want to do in the prisons is to see that the proper conditions are there and not to interfere with the management of the prisons.  I am afraid there is too much interference by Deputies.  We would create a position where convicts would be threatening warders and the Governor and it would be very undesirable.</P>

Deputies have their own sources of information and they have the right to criticise any orders that will not allow any deputation or public representatives to visit prisons.  If he took up that attitude whether it was supported all round or not we could sympathise with it, but when the Minister gets off his pedestal and comes down the slippery slope and says: &ldquo;I let a certain group of Deputies inside a certain prison but I will not allow one of the elected representatives from that particular constituency&rdquo;, I think there is no firm ground for that particular attitude.</P>

I answered that question and I have nothing to take from or add to that question.  I did not instruct the Guards to go there.  I did not give instructions to the Commissioner.  That is his responsibility.  He understands that if a certain amount of intimidatory language was likely to be used in certain areas that I am not going to say it is not to be allowed&mdash;I leave that to him.  That is his job.  He gets advice from his local area.  If I get a specific case of Guards having done what a Deputy said&mdash;actually having the impertinence to ask a man how he voted&mdash;I do not believe it, but if I get the evidence I will have the case examined.</P>

He raised that point when the Ceann Comhairle was here.  A judge or a district justice is in the same position.  They cannot be dismissed except by motion of both Houses.  He says it is incumbent upon me to take action.  It is, but I have got to get a form of complaint which can be supported before I can take action.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Act the present position of a district justice is that he has the same tenure of office as a judge.  Before that the practice was that there was a committee consisting of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney-General and if any complaints were made of misconduct, it had to be misconduct, about a district justice he was reported by the Minister for Justice.  I did it on a few occasions. I reported a district justice to that committee and if they recommended that a district justice ought to be dismissed that was reported to the Government and the Government could dismiss him.  The position now is that they are in the same position as judges and it is only by resolution of both Houses that they can be dismissed. That has enhanced their position but the committee is not there any longer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Taca Síochána were in receipt of a higher pay than the ordinary Guard at entrance.  The Taca was recruited in September, 1939, and after training they were sent out to Dublin.  In February, 1940, they went mostly to the Metropolitan Division.  They were in a temporary capacity and on probation for a period of 12 months, and they eventually were attested into the force in 1942.  I said yesterday that most of those men were of splendid physique and nearly all of a high standard of secondary school education. To my mind, they are the cream of the force at present.  They were certainly above any recruits I had experience of <Col N="436" /> in my time in the Gardaí and they are certainly performing their duties in a zealous and very efficient manner. As a result of the new Order, the members of the Taca are virtually losing two and a half years' service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In the way of increment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  They are not getting the benefit of that service.  I understand that former members of the Army who rejoined the Army got the benefit of their former service and members of the Army who joined the prison service got the benefit of Army service towards prison service for pension purposes.  I think there is an anomaly there in the treatment of those men, which I want to emphasise and bring to the Minister's notice, in the hope that he may be able to relieve it. Take a man of 27 years who attested in 1942 and a Taca who came in in 1939 and you will find that the man who came in 1942 is getting something like 9/6 per week more than the Taca who had actually longer service.  That is creating a certain amount of discontent and ill-feeling in the force.</P>
      <P>There is another problem which arises by reason of the fact that their service is not regarded as continuous. Men who are eligible in the ordinary way for promotion, eligible in every way as regards education and professional attainments, may be promoted if they have five years' service, but Taca men are not regarded as eligible for promotion.  Recently I understand that members of the Taca who applied for promotion were rejected, whereas men with similar service in the uniform force were allowed to compete in the examinations.  These are anomalies affecting this small body of men which ought to be removed.  I mention these matters as I did not give them fully yesterday, and I think they are deserving of the Minister's consideration.  I would ask him to look into these points and, if at all possible, try to meet the grievances of these men and settle, once and for all, the grievances they are under and the discontent that is there.  It causes friction, as I said yesterday, in individual stations, and I suggest there is a case there that wants looking into.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised a question yesterday as to the wisdom of retaining the existing Garda regulation which prevents a member of the Garda Síochána being stationed within 30 miles of his own place.  I do not know whether the Minister had an opportunity of replying to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is familiar with the facts of the case, I am quite satisfied with a promise that he will look into the matter sympathetically and he might be in a position to modify the regulation in the light of the experience of the past 25 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall draw the Commissioner's attention to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want that; that is a very perfunctory way of doing it.  I want the Minister to examine the matter and to realise that the regulation has no real wisdom behind it in existing circumstances.  It was framed for the purpose of dealing with a new and untried force, but there is no reason to look on the force now with the suspicion which, I think, was the inspiration behind that regulation originally.  Fortified by his experience over the years, I feel sure that if he examines the matter sympathetically he will come to the conclusion that the regulation can well be modified.  Then he could make representations to the Commissioner.  Will the Minister be prepared to do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good reason for that regulation.  The point is whether 30 miles is reasonable or otherwise. That is another matter.  There is more than one point of view to be considered in relation to this.  It is important that the Guard should not be too near his native place or the place from which his wife's people come.  I think that is admitted.  Whether 30 miles is too far a distance, I am not quite sure.  I know that the Commissioner endeavours to arrange that the Guards will be in direct communication, by way of bus or other forms of transport, with their native areas.  He <Col N="438" /> arranges that as best he can.  But there is a good reason for the regulation, speaking generally.  However, I shall look into the matter and see if the regulation can be modified.  All sorts of representations have been made, covering every point of view.  We may be told that Guard So-and-So married into a family in a certain district and he is prejudiced against this or that person.  For the Guard's own sake it is desirable that he should not be in the immediate neighbourhood of his own or his wife's family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Cases like that could be inquired into and I will ask the Commissioner to deal with them.  But there is a good reason for the regulation. You will find there are more requests to have that done than there are complaints that it has been done.  That is the information that I have, anyway. Whether it is true or not, you will find people saying that the Guards are prejudiced against them because of his wife's people or his own people.</P>

The problem here is more difficult, for one reason or another, because of the general upset with regard to distribution of population, distribution of employment and so on, and, in common with other countries, we have the aftermath of the war to deal with, so that I am not, therefore, in a position to make any detailed statement on future policy with regard to social services unless to say, as I said before, that I should like to see a unified scheme under which we could insure a person against sickness, unemployment, old age, widowhood of his wife and, perhaps, against a large family; I should like to see as many of these as possible being brought into one unified scheme which will be dealt with by one card and one stamp for each period of a week or whatever it might be, and dealt with by one official or agent at the field end and centrally through the one fund, and through the one system of filing, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the aim we have in view and, as I said already, I expect that we may <Col N="442" /> be able to announce a scheme of that kind within 12 months.  If we have not the legislation actually here, we should at least be in a position within 12 months to give something equivalent to a White Paper on a unified scheme of that kind.  I am very much personally in favour of a contributory scheme for all these various items but again it would be a difficult problem to draw up a contributory scheme for the greater part of the population because a big part of the population, as Deputies know, are not working for wages.  It is not easy to devise a contributory scheme where people are not wage-earners because it is not so easy to collect the contributions that would be due from week to week.</P>
    <P>From the Votes that are before us. Deputies will learn that we are first of all dealing with the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare.  Under that Vote we have collected together the staffs that were dealing with the various social services last year.  Some of them come from the Revenue Commissioners, some from Finance, some from Local Government and some from Industry and Commerce.  They are all now under the new Department and their salaries are being accounted for in this Vote.  We are also dealing with Old Age Pensions, Vote No. 7; Widows' and Orphans' Pensions, Vote No. 17; National Health Insurance, Vote No. 44; Children's Allowances, Vote No. 57; Unemployment Insurance and Unemployment Assistance, Vote No. 59, and the new Vote, Miscellaneous Social Welfare Services, Vote No. 67.  We have in that last Vote a number of small items, that so far were not given the dignity of a separate Vote.  They are collected from a number of other Departments and put into this miscellaneous group.  It perhaps would have been better and more convenient for Deputies and everybody else, if these Votes had been consecutive in the Book of Estimates, but there was no room for that.  As a matter of fact, the Book of Estimates was largely prepared before the new Department was set up and we had therefore to make as little change as possible in the set-up of the Book of <Col N="443" /> Estimates for the present year.  Next year we may be able to do a little more in that regard.</P>
    <P>Since this Book of Estimates was prepared, the Government decided to introduce a new list of supplements in substitution for those already in operation. That necessitated a reprinting of some of the Estimates in substitution for the Estimates set out in the book. Five of them have been reprinted in that way&mdash;National Health Insurance, Widows' and Orphans' Pensions, Old Age Pensions, Unemployment Insurance and Unemployment Assistance and the last group, Miscellaneous Social Welfare Services.  Generally speaking, what we set out to do in these supplements was to give something substantially over and above what the various recipients were getting in 1939 and the total amounts as spent under each of these Votes are set out in each of these reprinted Estimates.  When reprinted in that way, it is much more convenient from the legal point of view as well as from the accounting point of view, to carry out these services during the year.  It is an advantage also in summarising, as it were, the total amounts spent on each of those services. Five of the Estimates withdrawn are substituted by the reprints.  In addition, we are taking two Estimates from the book which it was found necessary to reprint, the Vote for Children's Allowances in which no change has to be made, and the Office of the Minister which is now under consideration.</P>
    <P>There is another Estimate&mdash;Vote 68, Food and Supplementary Allowances&mdash; that will drop out because practically all the items under that Estimate will be substituted by cash.  Where they are not substituted by cash, the amount to be spent in any particular service is going into the Vote concerned.  For instance, we are carrying on the food allowances under old age pensions but that will go into the Old Age Pensions Vote.  We have to carry on for a short time the food allowances for widows and orphans but that will be accounted for under the Vote for Widows and Orphans, so that it will not be necessary to move the Vote in the Book for Food and Supplementary Allowances. <Col N="444" /> The difference between the total of these Estimates last year and the Estimate for the coming year is £2,250,000, even allowing for the saving by dropping Vote 68.</P>
    <P>The aggregate provision made for these Estimates in 1947-48 is £11,359,620 as against a provision of £9,137,873 in 1946-47.  Some Deputies have probably made out for themselves how these increases have arisen.  In the case of old age pensions there is an increase of almost £1,000,000&mdash;an increase of £985,750; in widows' and orphans' pensions an increase of £212,500; in national health insurance, an increase of £475,400, and in children's allowances, an increase of £51,200. That increase is not due to the recent supplement; it is due to a natural increase. In unemployment insurance and assistance there is an increase of £466,700, and miscellaneous social welfare services have gone down by £28,100.  The net result is that there is an increase of almost £2,250,000 over last year.  Now that practically all goes to the recipients.  In other words, so far as administration goes, administration is up by £58,000, £46,000 of which is due to the recent consolidation of Civil Service salaries generally.</P>
    <P>The aggregate of the amount provided for the year 1947-48 in the Social Welfare Department will take over 20 per cent. of the total raised for all supply services during the year.  To give an idea of how social services compare with income from particular sources, social welfare schemes, it is estimated, will cost £11,360,000.  Customs revenue for 1946-47 will amount to about £17,000,000, excise revenue to about £10,000,000, and income-tax revenue to about £12,000,000, so that of these three big items, amounting to practically £40,000,000, we find that social welfare expenditure will account for almost one-third of the total.</P>
    <P>I want to give a few details which perhaps I have given already, but which I think it is no harm to repeat with regard to these supplements.  It is proposed to cut out the food allowances, except in the case of old age and blind pensioners, and to substitute them by cash.  The food allowance is taken to be value for about 2/6, and <Col N="445" /> the cash equivalent being given is 2/6. It amounts, as Deputies may be aware, to three pints of milk, ¼ lb. butter and 3 lbs. of bread.  It is a weekly food allowance in all cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it include the allowance for fuel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the fuel is not being touched.  In the case of the old age pensioners, there will be an additional 2/6 per week in all cases and in all towns and cities the food allowance will continue.  In the rural areas, where the local authority is giving, on application, additional sums of 2/6, they will also continue, if the local authority so agrees, and wherever the local authority continues to pay, or, indeed, if they should decide to pay even new applicants, they will be recouped to the extent of 75 per cent. from the Exchequer of what they pay out in that way.</P>
      <P>There is one very serious difficulty we are up against in relation to old age pensioners.  Old age pensioners are paid through the Post Office and there are 150,000 of them, so that the printing of the books is a very big task. When we thought of giving these additional allowances&mdash;I suppose, some six weeks ago&mdash;we were told by the people concerned with the supply of books that they could not possibly issue new books for about six months, the printing trade being as it is.  We did not know how we might get over this very serious difficulty, and that was one of the reasons why we decided to leave the food allowances with the old age pensioners.  We considered various other suggestions with regard to issuing stamps value for 2/6 each, but it is extremely difficult, and, in fact, impossible, to pay the old age pensioners from 1st April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are paid through the Post Office which is one very big difficulty. I suppose Deputies realise&mdash;perhaps better than I do, many of them&mdash;the very big amount of work which has to be done by Post Office assistants in practically every village and the various types of payments they have to make&mdash;old age pensions of different amounts, blind pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions of all sorts of <Col N="446" /> amounts, children's allowances and other items under smaller schemes&mdash; and we are advised that it would not be possible for the Post Office to undertake to pay anything except what is actually set out on the book presented. In other words, we could not ask the Post Office to pay 12/6 where 10/- is set out on the book, because too many mistakes would probably be made.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we must wait until we have these books either overprinted or reprinted, and the best we can do is to say to the old age pensioners: &ldquo;You will get your increases from 1st April, but they may be in arrears for some time before you actually get the increase&rdquo;.  We can only say to the old age pensioners: &ldquo;Tell your grocer and the other people that this is coming to you and we will give you the amount as soon as we possibly can&rdquo;.  I am afraid they will not get the increase until between two and three months from 1st April, but it cannot be helped.  In the meantime, the food allowances will continue and possibly continue even beyond that, instead of being converted into cash.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They will, eventually.  It will be credited to them from 1st April &mdash;that is all we can promise.  To some extent, that applies also to the widows and orphans.  The increases in respect of these pensioners vary very much&mdash;in fact, it is a frightfully involved table&mdash;but to take a simple case, in the case of a widow who was getting 8/- a week and a food voucher, that food voucher being worth 2/6, we replace that by cash, and bring the amount up by 50 per cent., making it 12/-, and give her another 1/6.  The easiest thing we can do with the widows&mdash;it will be some time before we can get the books reprinted&mdash;is to continue the food vouchers until the new books are ready&mdash;probably in two or three months' time&mdash;and to give them the arrears of the extra amount in cash, whatever it may be&mdash;perhaps 1/6 a week&mdash;when the new book is ready.  These are the two cases which will give so much trouble that we shall be unable to pay them from 1st April. <Col N="447" /> We can only place it to their credit and let them draw it after two or three months.</P>
      <P>Under national health insurance, as I announced already, a man is now entitled to 15/- sickness benefit.  He will get 7/6 extra, or 22/6.  A woman gets 12/- now and will get 6/- extra, and they both get 7/6 disablement benefit.  In that case, the man will get 7/6 extra and a woman 6/- extra, and they can draw that from 1st April, because national health insurance is paid by the National Health Insurance Society who are able to make their own arrangements.  They will be able to carry out the scheme from 1st April and it will not give us any further trouble.  In the case of disablement benefit recipients who are now getting food vouchers, the food vouchers will cease.  In the case of unemployment insurance, there will not be any great trouble.  The increases will be paid from 1st April also.  A man gets 7/6 extra, a woman 6/- extra, a boy 4/-extra and a girl 3/- extra.  There are no food vouchers in these cases, so that all that happens is that 50 per cent. is added on from 1st April and paid in cash without any difficulty.</P>
      <P>There are food vouchers in the case of recipients of unemployment assistance, which will be replaced by cash, and then the amount will be brought up, as nearly as possible, to 50 per cent. over 1939.  When I say &ldquo;as nearly as possible,&rdquo; I mean that we must keep to units of 6d., as we do not want to go into pennies and halfpence. Again, there is no difficulty about making these payments from 1st April.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with widows' and orphans' pensions.  I have told the House that food vouchers in the cities and towns will be continued until the new books are ready, whenever that may be, and where there is a cash supplement the arrears will be put aside and paid out as soon as the new books are ready.  The total of all these is something over £2,100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other insurance scheme which was taken over by me when I took over this Department, that is, the <Col N="448" /> wet time insurance scheme.  There has been a demand for some time for an increase in the benefit under the Insurance (Intermittent Unemployment) Act, 1942, which provides benefits for manual workers employed in the building trade who lose wages through stoppage of work due to inclement weather. There was since the Act was passed a change in the contributions, which were reduced, but now it is possible to increase the payments.  The present rate for skilled workers is 1/- per hour. That can be increased to 1/6 per hour. The present rate for unskilled workers is 7½d. per hour, which can be increased to 1/-, and for a young person, 3d. per hour which can be increased to 5d. per hour.  These increases can be made and the fund can afford the new payments without any increase whatever in contributions and there will be no charge on the Exchequer for the change that is made in regard to this particular fund.</P>

      <P>For the purpose of procedure, I move that Vote 66 (Office of the Minister for Social Welfare)&mdash;instead of Vote 67, which I have starred on the Order Paper&mdash;be referred back for reconsideration.  The Minister mentioned increases in benefits under the wet time insurance scheme.  Has he considered how he is able to effect these increases?  There is, in my opinion, a most unfair and unjust method of getting a great many workers to contribute to that scheme who are not affected by the weather. The Minister is probably just as well aware of that as I am.  There has been discussion on the social welfare schemes for a very long time and I suppose it started many years ago. That discussion was greatly increased on the introduction of the Beveridge Plan in Great Britain.  I take it that most of these proposals had their genesis in an effort to see what this country could do along the lines of <Col N="449" /> social welfare.  In connection with the new headings represented in Votes 66, 67 and 71, we ought to begin as we intend to go on, and it is rather to the form of the Estimates than to the actual results that they may produce that I wish to direct attention.</P>
      <P>When the question of social welfare and of public health was under discussion, there was a great deal of criticism on this side of the House as to administration.  We complained that there was one compartment for old age pensions, another for home assistance, another for child welfare, another for medical attention in schools, and so on.  These were all grouped under Local Government.  The contention of the Government was that they should be under the separate care and attention of two Ministers.  When we came to criticise this, the Minister for Local Government was most vague as to details.  In moving the Vote to-night, the Minister for Social Welfare has told us of some of the difficulties in printing books for old age pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions.  It is commonplace to remark that if they had started earlier they would have had the scheme ready sooner and we must suppose that they started rather late.  As proof of that, the Estimates, as originally drawn up, provided for, in Vote 66&mdash;nil, in Vote 67, £400 and in Vote 71, £3,340, making a modest total of £3,740.  Now they had apparently another &ldquo;think&rdquo; and came out with a Book of Estimates of close on £1,400,000.  The difficulty the Government have in making up their minds has been proved since we came into the House yesterday when an additional Estimate&mdash;Vote 67&mdash; which amounts to £170,000 extra, was handed to us.  It is going to be difficult to discuss these Estimates if they are to be raised or lowered in that way. The Minister will probably tell us that the £170,000 has been taken off the Estimate for the Local Government Department, so that one would really want to consider together Votes 66, 67 and 71.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister seems to have taken to heart some of the criticisms made from this side of the House, because he mentioned that his Department was working towards the idea of one card <Col N="450" /> and one stamp.  We could entirely agree with that, especially where there are going to be increased social services. That seems to be likely, because the Minister adumbrated further schemes in his introductory speech.  Whether that is to be so or not our great complaint is about the way in which these schemes are kept in water-tight compartments and distributed under separate Votes.  Apparently, the revision of an old age pension will still be undertaken by one set of officials, the revision of widows' pensions by another set of officials and so on.  I think somebody made the calculation that there are 14 or 15 separate grants, some of them for small sums of money, but each entailing an examination of family means. The Government should bear in mind that whether there are going to be increased social services or not, nothing but good can come from an amalgamation of the compartments dealing with all these sections of the community.</P>
    <P>Some months ago I asked if the offices in which the officials were working in the Custom House were to be transferred to a separate building for social services and health.  I got no answer, and the Minister did not mention the matter to-day.  I really do not know what the address of the Minister for Social Welfare is.  For all I know he may have moved out under one of the railway arches outside the Custom House.  At any rate one would think that there ought to be some re-grouping and an effort made to have these various investigations carried out under one person.  I am not suggesting that the person who investigates an old age pension claim could also make a medical inspection of a child.</P>
    <P>I do suggest that the amalgamation. I have referred to should, as far as possible, be carried out.  The British Government appear to have grouped all the departments dealing with children under one section.  We appear to have taken the opposite course.  During the emergency the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce was split and a new Ministery set up&mdash;that of Supplies.  That created such frightful confusion that the scheme had to be abandoned and the two offices amalgamated. <Col N="451" /> In this case the Government have, out of the bowels of the Department of Local Government, taken the Minister for Social Welfare under Vote 66, the grants under Vote 67, and the Minister for Health under Vote 71.</P>
    <P>An examination of these Estimates reveals that if the whole body of a child was to be considered that that would happen under the Local Government head.  In the case of grants to local authorities, where a member of a family is suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, that child's stomach would come under health because there are grants for the supply of milk to necessitous children.  Supposing there was something wrong with the child's feet, or that it wanted footwear, that would come under social welfare and the grants for the supply of footwear for necessitous children.  There are also grants under education for the provision of meals.  We, on this side, do not want three or four Departments, each being divided into sub-heads, with the head of a child coming under one section, its stomach under another and its feet under a third section.  Surely, something could be done in the way of having all these problems dealt with under one head.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the Departments, or compartments, dealing with these sections of social welfare.  I have been looking for information as to whether the staffs have been regrouped in the Custom House or taken out of it.  Have they taken their experience and their records with them so that some continuity of policy can be maintained?  I am raising these matters because I feel that we are going to get the Estimates in future years in this form unless we make a vigorous protest against it now.  I would like to make a very vigorous protest about the way these accounts have been presented to us.  Other Deputies will, no doubt, come along and criticise the details of these grants.  I merely wish to deal with the form and structure of the accounts as presented to us and I am sorry to say that I cannot conceive them presented to us in a worse or more complicated form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the Minister appears in the House to-night as Minister for Social Welfare and that he has presented to us this limited but welcome improvement in the social code for the most deserving sections of the people is in great vindication of the action of another distinguished Irishman in the recent past, a distinguished member of the Irish hierarchy, Dr. Dignan, who paved the way for what has been done here this evening and whose report and recommendations aroused in the country perhaps more interest than anything that happened in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first limited steps along the road that he indicated are being taken here this evening.  It is true that what the Minister has put forward in this House is a very pale imitation of what was outlined by Dr. Dignan in his famous and, may I say, historic report, but at least it is a recognition now, in spite of many symptoms that appeared in the country at that time, that the line that he took on that occasion was the only one that could be taken in the circumstances if the obligations of the State in this connection were to be honoured and realised.  The benefits indicated by the Minister to-night are welcomed so far as they go but very, very serious social problems of very many years' standing still remain untouched and one can only hope very sincerely that the Minister will take the earliest opportunity of bringing forward more courageous proposals along this road that he has set his steps on this evening. May I remind him that the important and, I think, to many people in this country, one of the most serious problems that still remain is the poor law system in its present form in this country?  The poor law system is a penal relic of the old famine times in this country.  It is a degrading relic of that time and it contains still out-wardly and right through its whole make-up many of the marks of deliberate degradation which it had when it was first imposed on the people of this country.  I should like to remind the Minister this evening of the words of Dr. Dignan&mdash;that the poor law system, as we know it in this country, is something that should not alone be blotted out from the Statute Book of this <Col N="453" /> country but also from the memory of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>If the Minister will be given the privilege&mdash;I think it would be a great privilege for an Irish Minister to be given&mdash;of being able to set his hand to the removal of this poor law system in this country, then he will have done a great service to the country and he will have performed an act of tremendous advantage to many people in this country whose circumstances, whose difficulties and whose claims are very important and far-reaching ones.  I should like to see an early move made in that direction.  It seems to me that an opportunity of doing that&mdash;of making the first move in that direction&mdash; would be by the provision for the people of the country of medical benefits.</P>
    <P>Many years ago when the national health insurance scheme was going through the British Parliament, it was intended to apply medical benefits to this country and for some reason or another that it is not necessary to go into now, even if we know what the reason was, that scheme was abandoned. In my judgment, the dispensary system in this country has reached a point where it must be completely overhauled.  I believe that and I say that quite positively.  It is entirely out of harmony with any progressive medical service which the country requires at the present time and I believe that the Minister's Department and the schemes that the Minister may have in mind afford a very fine opportunity of overhauling that service and affording to the people of the country a medical benefit scheme that will give them the widest choice in the matter of the selection of surgical medical assistance, advice and treatment when and as far as they need it.  It is not only a desirable thing for many people but it is an absolute necessity for a very large number of deserving people throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Let me take that very large and representative section of our population, the small farmers of the country.  They are not entitled to the benefits, such benefits as there are, of the poor law system, of obtaining treatment in the <Col N="454" /> local hospitals, at the local dispensaries or being sent to external hospitals by the local authority free of charge.  The charges they have to meet for medical and surgical attendance and treatment are for many of them a very heavy burden and I venture to say that a great deal of illness could be prevented and perhaps lives could be saved which are lost because of the fear of the expense involved in treatment of this kind for many of those people.  When I talk about this matter I am not talking on a matter of which I am entirely without knowledge.  I am talking about a matter with which I have a fairly constant association as a member of a local authority.  May I remind the Minister that there was another very important provision in the Dignan Report?  That was that there should be, in a scheme of social security, some provision for allowances for people when they reach a certain age and are unable to continue their labours.  I know of no more dreadful time in the life of an ordinary person without means than the period between 65 and 70 years.  A large number of persons are beyond their labour at 65. That is not so in every case but we have a large number of those people in lonely and poverty-stricken circumstances who should be provided for within the ambit of a social security scheme until they are eligible for another scheme which will assist them in the evening of their lives.</P>
    <P>This all involves a great deal of money.  It would be a very unreal contribution to the discussion not to admit that and to face it.  I entirely agree with the Minister's view, and I endorse his hope, that it may be possible to cover the main provisions of a social security scheme by one contribution. But I should like to remind him that it was proposed, when this scheme was originally outlined in the way I have already described, to bring within its scope 90 per cent. of the people.  I trust that the ingenuity of the officers who will be working out and elaborating a scheme of this kind will be able to devise a means by which 90 per cent. of the people can be brought within its scope on a contributory basis.  I realise that this may entail for many people substantial national health insurance <Col N="455" /> and other contributions.  Offering a personal opinion, I am prepared to face that, and I am prepared to say that it would be extremely good value for the people as a whole.  If the poor law system is overhauled and many kindred schemes examined and explored, it should be possible to make substantial economies which could be applied to the building up of a comprehensive human, Christian and dignified scheme of this type.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that there has been a change of policy with regard to the food allowances and that it is proposed to substitute cash payments.  That is a step in the right direction.  While the difficulties of the present time may make food allowances and the granting of special types of food more attractive than cash payments, in my opinion a food allowance scheme propagated and operated by a scheme of vouchers is a degrading scheme.</P>
    <P>I think that the beneficiaries should always be able to get the money and make their own purchases as they think fit.  For that reason, I should be glad to see the food allowances scheme entirely altered in favour of this new method and I hope the full operation of that change will be made effective in the shortest possible time.  One can appreciate the difficulty of the Minister in bringing this scheme into immediate operation by reason of inability to procure new payment-books or overprinted books for the additional benefits. I suggest one way of meeting the difficulty.  I do so with some reluctance because there are objections to it.  I suggest that the Minister should, in the intervening period, ask the county councils or the local authorities to pay these allowances and that, in two or three months, when he is in a position to do so, he should recoup these local authorities in full for the amounts so paid.  A number of people who would be beneficiaries under this scheme may be beyond all earthly reward by the time payment comes to be made.</P>
    <P>The Minister appreciates that the receipt of these extra payments is a matter of considerable urgency for a number of those people.  I should <Col N="456" /> prefer to see local authorities kept away completely from schemes of this kind.  I regarded the additional payment of 2/6 to the old age pensioners through local authorities as a most unfortunate means of providing something extra for those pensioners.  I make the suggestion that local authorities should pay these allowances in the interval because it is the only way I can think of of meeting the difficulty and because these payments are a matter of urgency for the people concerned.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Party with which I am associated, and personally, I welcome the steps the Minister has indicated in introducing these Estimates, and I welcome even more the hints he has given that there are other and, I hope, braver steps to follow.  May I express the hope that the matters I have mentioned will have the sympathetic interest of the Minister and that he will be able at some future time to lay before this House for approval all the proposals originally outlined in the Dignan Report?  I trust, too, that means will be provided for financing those schemes in a fair and proper way without imposing an undue burden on the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>I do not think that Deputies ever dealt with any Estimates that were so involved, complicated and so difficult to follow as this set of Estimates.  We have the Book of Estimates and we have the additional sheet just issued.  When one studies the additional sheet, one finds that the figure which is sought refers to transferred sums, so that you have to go back and either add to or subtract from the parent book.  I grant that a lot of that type of difficulty and complication is due to the fact that we have a new Minister just beginning to function over a new Department, which is, probably, only in process of being built up.  I do not think that any Deputy will discuss this Estimate in a critical manner&mdash; critical in the sense of creating difficulties either for the Minister or the Administration.  Whereas there was a definite necessity for a breaking-up inside the old Department of Local Government and Public Health&mdash;a divorce of the health side from the <Col N="457" /> local government side&mdash;and while the association of all these social services with the health side was a move in the right direction, it is beginning to become apparent that we are taking too many steps in the right direction.</P>
      <P>I venture to prophesy that, before this House is three years older, we will have an amalgamation of the Departments of Health and Social Welfare. Some of the difficulties are becoming painfully clear to those engaged in the administration of the various things covered in this group of Estimates, in the counties and, presumably, in the city.  You are dealing, as Deputy Dockrell said, with the necessitous household, and you are supplying certain requirements in the way of food to a case in that house that happens to be tuberculous.  These things have to be accounted for in the strictest modern manner.  You are doing that under the Department of Health.  You are ensuring that a little brother or sister is properly shod as a necessitous case, under the other Department, and managers and other administrators find that, whereas they were dealing with one Department which got too large for smooth running and they hoped for an improvement, they are now dealing with three and even four different Departments&mdash;as school premises, school children and the meals supplied come very closely into these schemes.  The work and the accountancy is undoubtedly increasing and complexities are arising, not only by the rapidity of the change but by the multiple changes.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister stating that his aim was the consolidation of all the various services into one comprehensive insurance scheme, whether contributory or otherwise.  I think it is not sufficient to say that that is the aim.  A new Department of this kind should start by saying that that is the intention and that it is its determination to reach that particular point at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an individual worker in one capacity, going from home to home and moving generally amongst the very poor people, all my professional life, long before this State was established <Col N="458" /> and this Dáil brought into being, I could never understand why, in a tiny little country like this with just a handful of a population, we had all the various widely divergent services, schemes and standards.  I could never understand why persons unemployed because of economic circumstances, of illness, through accident, old age, or blindness, were all in different classes. Why should all people depending on the State get different financial grants or allowances to maintain them? Surely there is a standard rate necessary to maintain a child, a juvenile and an adult?  If a person is unemployed, whether through illness, accident or economic conditions, infirmity or old age, there should be a uniform standard of grant and one service to administer it.  It is fantastic, in a little State like this, that if a man in receipt of £3 10s. 0d. a week wages meets with an accident and is disabled as a result for a definite length of time, he will get £3 10s. 0d. a week; a brother workman invalided because of illness will drop down to 14/- a week, and sometimes lower, dependent on the extent to which he is in benefit; another brother, who is unemployed because of economic circumstances and not through accident or illness, will get a different measure of financial assistance; and another who has the misfortune to be blind will be treated differently.</P>
    <P>The growth of such an organisation may be quite easy to understand in a densely populated and highly industrialised country like the neighbouring one, but with us it is merely a legacy from the close association between the two countries and the common Parliament of the past.  It is a legacy that we developed, and over-developed, by the wide divergence between various Government Departments and even between the various sections and subsections within the same Department. Be that as it may, at least it is the Minister's expressed aim to bring about a certain amount of order to replace the existing confusion, to bring about a certain amount of sanity to replace the type of lunacy that is clearly there at the moment and has been developing rapidly in recent years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="459" /> There is apparent a kind of pride in the amount of money spent on social services.  We should speak of that amount of money with bated breath, because its measure is, in the main, the measure of the failure of the State as a whole&mdash;not the Government&mdash; within its own economic system to make ample provision for the people. The more people you have unemployed, naturally the greater the demand in the Vote for Social Services.  The more people you have unemployed, the more the economy of the State has failed to cater for a tiny population.  The more people you have who are in no position to make provision for the rainy day, the more necessitous cases that you have to introduce Votes for in order to supply boots or clothes or fuel under the label of being necessitous cases, the more the State machinery and the economy of the State have failed, in the task of making conditions such that each individual is able to make reasonable provision for his family.</P>
    <P>Perhaps none of us may live to see it, but I would like to visualise the day when a Minister for social services would get up and say: &ldquo;My demand this year is nil.  Everybody in this country is working, earning good wages.  Even where there happens to be illness, the economy of the State is so sound and the earnings so reasonable that provision can be made for those temporary upsets.&rdquo;  The country which would have a Minister who could make such a statement nowadays to his Parliament would be in a unique position, a proud position, envied by every other country in the world.  Our aim should be to bring about conditions in this country so that demands for social services would be reduced every year.  That would be evidence of increasing strength in industry, in agriculture and in the general economy of the country.  The more people we have drawing and dragging out of the pool available for social services, the less we have to give to each.  The more we reduce the drag out of that pool, the more adequately we are able to deal with the smaller number drawing from it.</P>
    <P>I see in this Vote a sum of approximately <Col N="460" /> £750,000 per annum for administration, for supervision, for inspections, for the various clerical exercises and operations that have to take place in order to administer these services. It strikes me that that is an unduly high charge on the whole fund.  When, in the past, Deputies were asking for something in the nature of a social services Ministry, the arguments always advanced were to have amalgamation of these services, that it would lead to greater efficiency, would cut out delays and would bring about substantial economies.  The rake-off from those economies could, in turn, be utilised so as to give more benefits to the recipients.  I may be incorrect in my examination of the Estimates before us, but in the way of administrative cost I do not see that there is any economy. I do not see any evidence even of a plan towards economy.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that under a new title we are going to carry on in the same old way; that if a person is unemployed and an applicant for unemployment insurance or unemployment assistance, he will have to go through the same old procedure and then he will get whatever is coming to him; if a person is destitute, or a family is destitute, the home help representatives will investigate the circumstances and make a recommendation; if a person is suffering from tuberculosis, the domestic circumstances are closely examined and there is a grant as a result.  Surely some one of the various organisations that are administering, each in its own way, a very small sum &mdash;surely some authority&mdash;should build up a domiciliary register so that that register could be the standard register, the test, and it could be kept up to date from year to year, and from it information could be procured with regard to the number of inmates, the economic circumstances, of the particular home.</P>
    <P>I admit that in a city such a thing might be very difficult to carry out and keep up to date, but there should be some such machinery by which information would be available to the Departments interested as to the circumstances existing in whatever household required assistance.  As things are at <Col N="461" /> the moment, any of us could give an example where, in the same small house, because of different circumstances affecting different people, four or five different investigators would call independently of one another in the same week.  They would all report the economic circumstances, they would all make a similar report and they would make it, perhaps, to different Government Departments; but, when all is said and done, to the same common administration.  Based on those reports, the various machines would get functioning and four or five little streams of money would roll into that house.</P>
    <P>I admit I am probably pushing an open door when I argue that particular point, because in the Minister's introductory remarks he said that his hope was to have a consultation on all those things and to produce a scheme, contributory if possible, but I think that the longer the machine operates, particularly under a new Ministry, along the old rotten lines, the more difficult it will be to operate it.  Remember, you are creating, even under this new Ministry, new vested interests, vested interests of many kinds, and anybody must naturally be hesitant to interfere with vested interests.  The plan should have been made, overhauled and perfected before the new Ministries were created.</P>
    <P>I can look forward to 12 months' time or to two years or three years' time when the sheen of newness has gone off this Ministry, and I can see that aims will still be aims, hopes will still be hopes, but the Minister will be slowly but surely getting strangled and submerged by the multiplicity of tentacles inside his own new Ministry. That is as certain as I am standing here.  One announcement of the Minister I certainly welcome and consider a sound decision.  Of course, I do not know whether he was talking in the capacity of Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde but, more specifically, he spoke in the capacity of Minister for Social Welfare. I do not know if his remarks or decisions were equally applicable to his administration as Minister for Health, but I think his decision to replace the food vouchers by cash was sound.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="462" /> I think the food voucher system, although it was a perfectly legitimate course to experiment with, was beginning to be impossible in a good many respects.  A person might be entitled to three pints of milk in a certain district but you might not be able to get three pints of milk and you had no authority to give anything in lieu of that.  Then an order might be given for three pints of milk for a certain house and when you made inquiries directly from the milkman you found that the orders of the milkman from other parties went down by three pints.  You might avoid all that by giving a cash allowance straight away. I do not think, however, that as things stand at present the Minister can get away from the fuel issue.  Small people and poor people might find it impossible to get fuel for cash if they were left to their own resources.  I think for the time being it is wise to retain that particular scheme.</P>
    <P>When the Minister referred to cash in lieu of food issues, I do not know whether that applied to the Ministry of Health or not.  The food issues made in connection with the Ministry of Health, although a very welcome thing, would bear investigation; it would be sounder and more economic to issue cash there too.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision does not refer to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister in course of time will look into the advisability of applying the new method there also.  I would not urge that nourishment in kind and food should be dropped without a very full and searching examination, but here and there a belief is growing up that a lot of these commodities are issued and then sold for half-price to somebody else.  It would be better in such circumstances that they should get the full price.  I think that is happening to a very great extent with regard to clothes.  If the money were given, possibly some of it at least would be expended on clothes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I desire to say to the Minister, with regard to the attitude and outlook of this Party, regarding his new Ministry and his new administration, that it will be given a fair and encouraging start. It will be given in its early months all <Col N="463" /> the assistance and all the advice that it is possible to give to a Department that is created to do not only a work that is necessary but a very good and desirable type of work.  Whatever criticism he will receive will be based on the idea of making the machine more efficient and more effective.  There will be no tendency to criticise that Minister or his administration merely because his geographical position in this Chamber happens to be on the other side of the strip of carpet.  At the same time I want to repeat the hope that the Minister expressed at the opening of his remarks, that he will steer the machine towards the comprehensive insurance scheme that would embrace all these particular channels covered by the multiplicity of Departments and sub-Departments that exist at the moment.  I think that when that day is reached, you will be in a position without demanding extra money, without imposing extra taxes, to give considerably more assistance and more benefit to those who require these benefits. One way in which that can be done is by economy at the top. Another is by ensuring that &ldquo;shysters&rdquo; are not drawing out of the pool down below.  There are more people down below, whose responsibility it is to certify or vouch in one way or another, for the genuineness of an applicant.</P>
    <P>If you can get the whole-hearted support and co-operation of every individual dealing with social services, from the top down to the most remote parish in Ireland, and convince the people that the pool will remain fixed, that because there are fewer people drawing, the Vote will not be reduced from year to year, that if there are fewer people drawing it will mean that the smaller number of people will get greater benefits, you will develop a spirit that when men know that a colleague is malingering, and drawing something out of the common pool, his comrades will look on him as an unworthy type of citizen.  If you get co-operation, and I think by asking for co-operation you will get it, there will be economy and sound administration not only at the bottom but in the middle and right up to the top.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have now reached a point at which we are about to have placed before us a comprehensive scheme of social services.  We hope that in the next 12 months the Minister, as he has said, will put that scheme in its entirety before the country. It is rather difficult at the moment to speak of social services because we do not know what will finally emerge, but, in connection with social services generally, I should like to mention particularly the position of the blind.  We all have every sympathy with blind persons, which sympathy has been embodied from time to time in various Acts relating to blind persons. Blind persons receive a pension from the State, but I do not wish to go into the grants of money which are given to the blind as individuals. I wish to speak of the schemes which exist for the assistance of blind persons.</P>
      <P>We have for a long time recognised the special position of the blind and the particular difficulties of the blind. One of these difficulties is their inability to live ordinary lives as citizens, but various philanthropic societies and institutions have played, and are playing, a very great part in helping blind persons, and I put it to the Minister, at what I might refer to as the dawn of a new epoch in the matter of social welfare, that he should do everything he can to assist these people to help themselves.  There is a body, the National Council of the Blind, which exists mainly on voluntary subscriptions, and the very fine work of which has been recognised by the Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council. These authorities give small grants to that body and I suggest that the Minister should look into the matter with a view to giving this body a grant of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That council has home teachers who go into the homes of blind persons and teach them Braille and Moon and they also teach them how to get about. They bring to their notice any mechanical aids for the assistance of such people and teach them handicrafts in their homes.  They also cheer them up and assist them in every way they can.  They are specially trained for that purpose, and, in addition, they <Col N="465" /> have lay people who assist the blind as a part of a voluntary social service. The council has branches in the provinces and the head organisation disseminates information for the general welfare of the blind through these branches.  I suggest that any method which helps blind persons to help themselves is worthy of Governmental support.</P>
    <P>When we think of blind persons, we usually think of persons who have been blind from birth.  That is a very tragic condition, but in many cases such people go to institutions which do magnificent work in the provision of care and training for these blind persons. These institutions also are worthy of support, and, I think, get a good deal of support, but this National Council of the Blind very often has to deal with persons who become blind late in life.</P>
    <P>Such people are not always able to go to institutions.  It is not always possible for them to go there&mdash;they may be advanced in age or may not wish to leave their homes, so that this work in no way conflicts with the work done by institutions but, in a large measure, caters for a type of blind person with whom the institutions are not able to deal.  The Minister has become head of a new Department, the work of which has, I suppose, been only vaguely planned, and I appeal to him to assist this body and any other similar body, though I do not know of any similar body which caters for the welfare of the blind in their own homes.  It is very splendid work which is very worthy of the support of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this new scheme of social services.  It is rather complicated, and one has to add and subtract, with the result that arriving at an understanding of it is rather difficult.  I take it that the increase of 2/6 a week to old age pensioners and blind pensioners will be deferred for a period of three months, until the books are ready, that in the meantime the food allowance is to continue, that when the books are ready the food allowances will disappear and that the arrears of allowances will be paid as and from the 1st April.  I take it that <Col N="466" /> will also apply to widows' and orphans' pensions.  Am I to understand that the special emergency allowance, one-fourth of which is contributed by the local authorities and three-fourths by the Government, will continue in operation in addition to the new increase of 2/6?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am to take it, then, that the food allowance will disappear when the 2/6 increase comes into operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I should have made that clear.  Food allowances are payable in cities and towns.  That will continue.  They will get an extra 2/6, which will not be paid for two or three months.  It will be accumulating to their benefit but they will not draw it for two months, so that when they do commence to draw it, on the 1st July, the old age pensioners will have 2/6 in cash and 2/6 worth of food as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It will mean that they will have 2/6 extra cash to draw?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>While that is a benefit, which is very much needed, to all these sections, I feel the Minister has not gone far enough to meet the case from a general point of view because the only person who will derive benefit is the person receiving the maximum old age pension of 10/-.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I am satisfied that the scheme will be helpful in a general way.  I want now to refer to the question of the means test.  I am sure that every Deputy is being asked to make representations as far as the means test is concerned.  I want to appeal especially on behalf of widows. If a widow has an income of £19 a year she will not qualify for a widow's pension or any portion of a widow's pension.  That is a very small income to deprive a widow of the means of State assistance that is in operation. A widow may be living in a cottage and may have three, four or five children between the ages of five and 20 years of age.  The eldest girl may leave the country to get employment or she may go into service.  If she contributes £10 or £15 a year and that fact comes to the knowledge of the Department, it is taken into account for the purposes of the means test and there is a re-investigation, with the result that the woman is deprived of part or of <Col N="468" /> the whole of the widow's pension. When she is deprived of a widow's pension, she is deprived of the supplementary allowance and the food allowance.</P>
      <P>That woman may have a very limited means of existence and being deprived of the widow's pension makes it very difficult for her to continue to provide for herself and her family.  The means test should be reviewed with the object of leaving wider scope for the assistance of a widow, a blind pensioner or an old age pensioner.  The method at present in operation makes it difficult for persons to qualify for these pensions. In the case of the old age pension, a man may have two or three sons and, when he comes to the age of 70, he may transfer the place to one of his sons.  When he does that, he makes application for an old age pension. The means test comes into operation and the case may be put that he transferred his property for the purpose of claiming the old age pension and his claim may be rejected.  That is one of the wrong things that can happen and that has happened and that, according to this scheme, cannot be remedied.</P>
      <P>I move to report progress.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
