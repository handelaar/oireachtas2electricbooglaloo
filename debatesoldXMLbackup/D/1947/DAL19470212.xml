      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state whether there have been any recent discussions with the British Government with a view to securing the removal of the restrictions on travel to Great Britain; and if there is any prospect of the removal of these restrictions in the near future.</P>

      <P>There have been no recent discussions with the British Government on this subject for the reasons which I explained in my replies to similar questions by Deputies Fogarty and O'Sullivan on the 14th February and 7th November, 1946.  The situation has not fundamentally changed and I have no information which would justify my forecasting an early removal of the restrictions in question.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he is aware of the anti-partition drive at present on foot in England; if he has any connection with these activities; and if not, if he will consider the advisability of the Government sponsoring activities of this kind so that the approach to the problem may be made on proper lines.</P>

      <P>I am aware that an organisation has been formed in Britain to bring the facts of the partition of this country to the attention of the British people.  I naturally <Col N="804" /> sympathise with efforts in this direction, but the Government as such must address its representations directly to the British Government.  Apart from any question of propriety, however, I do not think that Government sponsored activities would be as effective as independent and spontaneous ones.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if his attention has been drawn to an article in an Irish newspaper which stated that, in recent months, the Crown Agents for Colonies, in order to expedite the strengthening of the Palestine Police Force, have adopted the procedure of sending a representative to Dublin to interview persons who have applied for admission to that force, and also added that, in addition to the attractive terms of employment, there was a further inducement of excitement and variety; if he has any information to confirm the report that several hundreds of young men have joined; and further, if he will make known to the public the policy of the Government in connection with this matter, and take appropriate steps to have it enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen an article of the kind mentioned by the Deputy, in which it is alleged that young men here were joining the Palestine Police Force because they could expect to find some excitement and variety in that country and that the Crown Agents for Colonies had adopted the procedure of sending a <Col N="805" /> representative to Dublin to interview applicants for that force.  I have no information which would confirm the suggestion that several hundred young men have joined the Palestine Police Force; on the contrary, as indicated in reply to a question by Deputy Dillon on 23rd January, I believe that it is unlikely that Irishmen would, in fact, join that force.  The Deputy will appreciate that, in any case, this is not a matter in which the Government can intervene.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that, during the past month, there have been no supplies of fuel available for the people of Cobh; and if he will state what steps, if any, he proposes to take to ensure that supplies of turf will be available for this district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unable to accept the suggestion that during the past month there have been no supplies of fuel available for the people of Cobh. The primary responsibility for obtaining turf supplies for Cobh, as in the rest of the turf areas, lies with the local merchants.  My Department has given the merchants every possible assistance in the matter and will continue to do so and it is hoped that it will be possible to maintain the recent improvement in supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>On four occasions during the past month I was in the town of Cobh and I found that the merchants there had notices on their doors, saying: &ldquo;No orders accepted&rdquo;.  They could not supply even half a cwt. of turf to men who, in the ordinary course, would get half a ton.  The principal trouble is with the C.I.E. wagons.  That is the information I got from the merchants there.  Will the Minister see that wagons are furnished in order to supply turf to the town?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The total quantity of turf which reached Cobh in the month of January was 300 tons, which was normal for that month.  The quantity which reached Cobh during the first week in February was 112 tons, which <Col N="806" /> was above normal for that time of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that fuel merchants in Cobh charge for turf at the rate of 4/- a cwt. bag; further, that the charge for turf in Midleton, which is the same distance as Cobh from the source of supply, is from 3/3 to 3/6 a cwt. bag; if he will give the reasons for this discrepancy in price; and if he will have inquiries made as to the reasonableness or otherwise of the charges in Cobh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the facts are as stated by the Deputy. The price of turf in Cobh for small lots, I am informed, is 3/6 per cwt. and I am of the opinion that this price is a reasonable one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that 4/- per bag was charged for turf in Cobh.  I am prepared to stand over that.  I asked the merchants what was the price and they told me that it was 4/- a bag.  I do not know where the Minister got his information from in connection with that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that, although Cobh is 15 miles further than Cork from the source of its turf supply, Cork is scheduled as a non-turf area, while Cobh is scheduled as a turf area; and if he will take steps to have Cobh scheduled as a non-turf area, so that turf supplied there may qualify for the same rate of subsidy, 38/- a ton, as applies to turf supplied to Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that Cobh, like the whole of County Cork, apart from Cork City and its immediate neighbourhood, is in the scheduled turf area.  Full consideration was given to all relevant circumstances when Cobh was included in the turf area in 1941 and I am not prepared now to take steps to have it included in the non-turf area.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has been pointing out certain things in relation to other questions already. <Col N="807" /> Does he not realise that at question time supplementary questions only may be asked and that Deputies must not reply to a Minister's statement?  If the Deputy has any supplementary question to ask, he may ask it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the serious fuel position in East Meath; if it is his intention to declare the area concerned a non-turf area; and if not, if he will have special arrangements made to ensure that much scrub timber, which abounds in this area, is made available to the local people at a price in keeping with their means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The fuel position in East Meath is no worse than in many other parts of the country and it would not be eased in any way at the present time by declaring East Meath to be a non-turf area since the adequacy of the dumps to meet the demands of the non-turf area is already a matter for considerable anxiety.  The provision of firewood or an alternative fuel is entirely a matter for local enterprise. The price of firewood is controlled by Emergency Powers (Control of Prices) (No. 121) Order 1942 as amended by Emergency Powers (Control of Prices) (No. 121) Order 1942 (Amendment) (No. 1) Order 1943.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skinner</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that the appointment of a cottage rent and water rate collector was recently made by the Cork county manager as a result of competitive examination and interview; if he will state the subjects of the examination and who set the papers and conducted the interview; further, if he will state the total marks awarded for the examination and the interview and what marks were given for service in the Defence Forces; whether any preference was given to married and unemployed men; whether the position was allotted to a man who already had whole-time employment; and if so, if he will make a statement on this aspect of the matter.</P>

      <P>On the 13th January, 1947, the assistant county manager for North Cork made an appointment to the part-time post of cottage and water rent collector.  The appointment was made as the result of a written examination and interview by a selection board.  The subjects of the written examination were English and Arithmetic, and for the interview General Knowledge and Irish.  Marks were awarded for education and experience and general suitability.  The examination and interview were conducted by experienced public officials but it is not considered desirable to publish their names.  The total marks awarded were 500 apportioned as to 200 for examination and 300 for interview. Marks for service in the Defence Forces were allotted in accordance with the terms of the circular letter <Col N="809" /> issued by my Department on the 27th November, 1946, in relation to resettlement of members of the Defence Forces.  I am informed that in assessing marks for general suitability definite preferential marks were given to married and unemployed applicants. I am informed that the successful applicant is employed for only a few hours per week, at a salary at the rate of £20 per annum, conducting a farm costing scheme at Mitchelstown creamery under the supervision of Professor M. Murphy, University College, Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>The causes of the rise of prices which has occurred here since August, 1939, are, in the main, the same as those which have operated in other countries. These general causes include reduced domestic output, contraction of supplies from abroad, expansion of money incomes through higher wages, salaries and profits, increased landed costs of imports, higher agricultural and <Col N="812" /> other prices, increased emigrants' remittances and tourist expenditure, and the greater volume of State outlay on emergency and other services with resultant Budget deficits.  We have also had during this period an excess of exports, visible and invisible, over current imports which has caused an inflow of money not balanced by goods and has thus increased the disparity between money incomes and available supplies.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to circulate a White Paper on the matter as it is not possible to assess precisely the degree of influence of the several causes of the decline in purchasing power of money since 1939.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated the causes. If there were no purchases on the market to-morrow the price of goods would fall.  The people in this matter have the remedy largely in their own hands. If they would refrain from purchasing or over-buying, when goods are in short supply, the price of goods would fall.  If a person who happens to have £100 or £1 in his pocket could keep it over the next 12 months it would probably appreciate greatly in value.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the decrease in interest on savings certificates has anything to do with the matter at all.  A person can get 2½ per cent. free of income-tax on savings certificates at this moment.  There has been a reduction in the interest of about 1/2 per cent., but if enough people who have a reasonable amount of goods in their possession, would refrain from buying further quantities of these goods, they would probably <Col N="813" /> find, by keeping the £100 which they have available for spending, that it would be worth £110 or £120 a year hence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that the pension of £60 a year provided for widows of deceased members of the Garda Síochána is grossly inadequate; and whether he will consider making an annual payment to the funds of the National Health Insurance Society with a view to making these widows eligible for non-contributory widows' pensions under the scheme operated by that society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is that the pensions for which provision is made under the Garda Síochána Pensions Code for the widows of deceased members of the force were not intended to be in complete substitution for the normal provision which a man would make for his wife in the event of her becoming a widow, but were in the nature of a special addition to such provision in the case of Gardaí.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, it may be pointed out that the average Garda widow's pension is substantially higher than the non-contributory widow's pension payable under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I made a mistake in putting the question in this form.  The prefix &ldquo;non&rdquo; should not appear before the word &ldquo;contributory&rdquo;.  What I intended to suggest to the Minister was, that in view of the fact that under some Garda regulation, Guards do not pay national health insurance, when they die, their widows are not entitled to contributory widows' pensions.  That is what I meant to bring before the Minister. Would the Minister consider making some annual payment to the national health insurance fund which, albeit that it would not entitle a Guard to sickness benefit, would ensure that the widow of a deceased Guard would be entitled to receive a contributory <Col N="814" /> widows' and orphans' pension in addition to the £60 provided by the Garda Síochána Fund and £30 for each of her children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The pensions which were granted to widows were supplementary to the ordinary provision that a man would make for his wife.  They were related to the Garda pay of the day, I take it.  The Garda pay now is in process of being increased substantially, and I take it that, when that particular operation has been completed, the question of pensions for widows of members of the existing Garda force will be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would say that he would look into the possibility of a contribution, such as I suggest, with a view to securing the right of the widows of those men getting a contributory pension through a scheme which, after all, applies to every other class of person similarly employed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is now raising a very big question&mdash;whether we will have contributions made by State servants.  There are no widows' pensions in the Civil Service, but there are in the Army and in the Gardaí. It would be a new principle to call for a contribution in the case of State servants.</P>

      <P>(c) 7,000 tons of 50-60 per cent. potash were allocated to this country by the Spanish authorities and my Department nominated Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, Teoranta, as agents for the purchase, shipment and distribution of this allocation.</P>
      <P>(d) 2,500 tons of 40 per cent. potash have been ordered from the United States zone of Germany.  I am hopeful that this material may arrive in time for distribution through the ordinary trade channels.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state whether, in view of the serious decline in the production of milk which has resulted in a substantially lower production of butter in the current season compared with the past few years, and which is mainly due to uneconomic milk prices, he is prepared to take immediate action with a view to fixing the price of milk delivered to creameries during <Col N="833" /> the coming season at the rate of 50 per cent. above the current price of 10 1/2d. per gallon, such increased price to remain in force pending the examination of the whole question of milk prices by the Agricultural Produce Costings Tribunal which it has been decided to establish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>A preliminary survey of milk supplies received by creameries in 1946 shows that there has been a reduction of approximately 6 per cent. as compared with 1945, but supplies in 1946 were virtually the same as in 1944. Weather conditions in 1945 were favourable for milk production but in 1946 they were consistently unfavourable.</P>
      <P>Government policy in relation to the dairying industry is set out in the White Paper issued a year ago, in which it is stated that the guaranteed price for milk supplied to creamaries will be subject to variation up or down according as the costs of milk production rise or fall.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this Bill as, on the whole, a laudable attempt to salvage the vast sums of money spent at Rineanna.  I do not think that rational people have any doubt that, in ten years' time, no transatlantic passenger plane bound for the Continent of Europe or Great Britain will stop at Rineanna, and if there was nothing but passenger traffic scheduled for Rineanna in ten years' time we would have nothing in Rineanna but rabbits.  It is quite manifest that the idea of express passenger traffic using Rineanna as a transatlantic port is fantastic. <Col N="836" /> With the increased range of aircraft which is developing daily, it would be as ludicrous to suggest that, in ten years' time, transatlantic express passenger services would stop at Rineanna as it would be to suggest that the &ldquo;Queen Elizabeth&rdquo; would stop at Castletownberehaven to take on fresh water.  But there has been from the beginning, and there may yet be, a reasonable chance of making Rineanna serve as an aerial <i>entrepót</i> distribution centre for the Continent of Europe, provided we offer at this end adequate facilities.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell us that at some early date he could afford to be somewhat more explicit as to the facilities he intends to provide.  It is not enough to say that we propose to do all we can to make this depót useful. In business, there are any number of people who make vague general offers, but busy men have not got the time to go rooting around to find out what exactly these offers in general terms mean.  The offer which gets business is the offer which sets out in black and white precisely what the vendor is offering for the purchaser's money. I do not think we have attempted to do that yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that if we are to salvage anything out of Rineanna&mdash;and it is very problematical whether we will or not; it is more than likely that Rineanna will be a deserted wilderness in ten years' time and any aerial traffic we have will be handled at Collinstown or some station near Dublin&mdash;we must at once provide certain facilities and tell those we expect to use them what those facilities are.  We must have adequate refrigeration; we must have a staff of persons in Rineanna who are familiar with the traffic regulations relating to every form of merchandise traffic in every country in Europe; and we must be in a position to say&mdash;and to perform &mdash;that any consignor in the United States of America who wishes to despatch an express parcel to any country on the Continent of Europe may deliver it at Rineanna, that we will there, if necessary, break bulk and divide the parcel for different destinations, that we will there guarantee <Col N="837" /> to keep it in perfect condition and that we will thence despatch it on its way in the shortest possible time to the destination for which the consignor intends it.</P>
    <P>We must do that at once.  We must get all these facilities provided at the earliest possible moment, because, if we do not, as certain as we are here, one of the coastal countries of the Continent of Europe will provide that kind of facility.  I think I am right in saying that Hamburg was the great <i>entrepót</i> port in Europe prior to the war for seaborne traffic.  Inevitably, there will be some kind of airport on the Continent of Europe in the near future.  It may be Lisbon, it may be one of the Dutch ports.  But the first in will have an immense advantage, and to get in it is vitally important that what we have to offer should be made known to consignors at once.  We have one immense advantage, <i>pace</i> the Gaelic League, and that is that we speak English and we therefore can transact business with the American people who will be our principal consignors in a language which they can understand.  That is an advantage which gives us a fighting chance at this stage over any European country.  But the important thing is that we should exploit it by making the service really first-class, by making it that at once, and by intelligently communicating the service we have to offer to potential customers without delay.</P>
    <P>Two things remain to be said.  One is that we ought to get a traffic expert from the United States of America at the earliest possible moment to tell us what consignors in America want. Secondly, having got that expert advice and acted on it, we ought to give up the idea that we can advertise our wares through Consul's offices in America.  We should at once hire the best firm of advertising agents in the United States, a firm serving Reynold's tobacco, Marshall Fields, or other leading firms in the United States of America.  They are very expensive, their fees are very high; but if we are going to take a great chance in this investment we should <Col N="838" /> not spoil the ship for a ha'porth of tar.  We should get these people of prepare an effective publicity campaign, not addressed naturally to the 120,000,000 of people in the United States of America, because of that 120,000,000 perhaps about 100,000 are potential customers for this purpose, but through magazines like <i>Fortune</i> and other publications of that character which reach the people willing to consign goods, and that should be done without delay.  Thirdly, when you have sunk a large sum of money, as we have done, in a commercial enterprise such as the Shannon Airport is, there comes a time such as this which has come upon us now, when you have to make up your mind whether you are going to cut your losses or whether you are going to salvage what you have already spent and use it as a foundation to build up a prosperous business.  For good or ill, this House has apparently made up its mind to attempt salvage.  Very well.  If we are going to attempt salvage, it is no use attempting it in a pinchbeck way.  The only chance you have of saving Rineanna from becoming a rabbit-ridden wilderness in ten years' time is to make it the most efficient and up-to-date <i>entrepót</i> merchandise distribution centre in Europe.  That is going to cost money and it is going to require highly expert advice which is extremely expensive to purchase.</P>
    <P>I urge most strongly on the Minister that he should reassure us, now that these powers are given him, that he will get the best advice he can get from American transport companies, not as to what we should give them, but as to what they want, so that, whether we think they should have it or not, we shall give it to them in order to get us customers.  Secondly, that he will reassure us that the amenities we propose to provide will be brought to the attention of those whom we hope will use them by the most effective advertising campaign that money can purchase in the United States.  Thirdly, that his instructions to those charged with the responsibility of providing these amenities will be: &ldquo;Do not waste a penny of public money, but do not <Col N="839" /> let any consideration of money alone prevent you from providing the last thing in up-to-date accommodation for those who are going to use the port.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Many Deputies, I think, forget that part of that accommodation will have to be a service of aeroplanes which will carry the merchandise from Rineanna on to its ultimate destination.  That is going to be an immense investment.  I am not at all convinced that it is wise to embark upon it.  But, if Deputies are, I most strenuously urge upon them that they embark on it in the only way which shows hope of success, and that is the way of which I have given a general outline now and of which I look to the Minister confidently to fill in the details in a very explicit way at an early date for us through himself and through the most effective advertising medium he can command to our potential customers in the very early future.</P>

      <P>I understood from the draft that a director would hold only one share and one share would be transferred to him. Sub-section (2) (a) provides for the transfer to any person of one new share for the time being held by the Minister and (b) requires any member of the corporation to transfer any new share held by him to the Minister. That is, if he is resigning office, under paragraph (b) of sub-section (2) he surrenders his share.  Then you go on in sub-section (3) to talk about new &ldquo;shares&rdquo;.

Why should the Parliamentary Secretary or anyone else be nervous about putting that into the measure and making it the law that there will be no difference between the rate to be charged to the agricultural community and that charged for other purposes?  I suggest that the purpose towards which we will devote this money is as important as any other purpose for which we might provide money in this State.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the purpose for which we intend to provide money ought to be set out in the measure and there should be no variation afterwards.  We ought to be capable of covering every purpose for which money will be provided. The corporation have had years of experience and they found that the legislation originally enacted was too narrow.  I understand the purpose of this Bill is to widen the powers with respect to security.  We are asked to accept a measure empowering two Ministers by Order, which can by a motion here be annulled, to make an extension for a specific purpose provided it is for an agricultural purpose. I do not think that is quite desirable in what is intended to be permanent legislation.  It may be all right to give that power to a Minister in time <Col N="846" /> of emergency, but for permanent legislation it is undesirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a re-enactment of Section 12 (2) of the 1927 Act.  The advantage is that the corporation will be in a position to vary its own lending powers, subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture, without having to alter the memorandum and articles of association.  If it were to be obligatory on the corporation to have to alter its memorandum and articles of association, there would be considerable difficulty and it would impose unnecessary trouble on them with respect to printing and other matters.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (6) to delete paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) and substitute therefor the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A joint application in writing is made by the corporation and an intending borrower or by a recognised bank and an intending borrower for a copy or copies of the particulars of any chattel mortgage or chattel mortgages registered against the personal property of the intending borrower when such copy or copies shall be furnished. <Col N="849" /> Here is something that is of very great importance in my opinion.  I think it is an extraordinary proposal to empower the corporation or a duly authorised person to inspect the register. Surely if you want to encourage people to raise loans on chattel mortgages you should not empower individual clerks of authorised banks to inspect the register and enable them to see the name of every person who has a mortgage and to disclose that information to other people.  If there is an application for a loan and if the authorised bank or corporation wants to find out, as naturally they would want to find out, whether there are any mortgages, my amendment suggests that a joint application in writing should be made by the corporation and an intending borrower or by a recognised bank and an intending borrower for a copy or copies of the particulars of any chattel mortgage or chattel mortgages registered against the personal property of the intending borrower and that such copy or copies shall then be furnished.  That is all they want to know.  Why in the name of goodness should any clerk of a bank be authorised to inspect the register and see the position of every man who may have a mortgage marked against him?  If the Parliamentary Secretary wants to encourage people to borrow money on this basis, he is not going to succeed in doing that as people will object to having their private affairs disclosed to any bank clerk who may go to inspect the register on behalf of any authorised bank.  I feel that the matter could be much more easily approached in the way I suggest, that when a borrower goes in to seek a loan and the authorised bank or corporation wants to find out what is the position of that individual, they should make a joint application.  That application will indicate that you have the consent of the intending borrower to disclose the information that is there on the register and the information could then be supplied by the registrar. I think it would be preposterous to proceed in the way suggested in the Bill.  It would militate against the possibility of making this a useful means of securing money.</P>

      <P>We are re-enacting them.  The county registrar must have full right of inspection at all times because when he gets an execution order from the court, he must make a search to find out whether there is a chattel mortgage in existence on any stock which may be involved in the order which he is to execute.  Moreover, it is necessary that the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture should have power to inspect and make copies of any entry in the register because of loans, etc., made to farmers from voted moneys.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not any objection to the county registrar at all.  My amendment merely covers recognised banks or the corporation.  I have not gone so far as to include the whole lot, because I feel that it may be necessary for the county registrar to have access to the register.  He may have to deal with a number of people.  In the case of an applicant for a loan to an authorised bank or the corporation, why the application for information is not sufficient I cannot understand. The Parliamentary Secretary has not made a case against my amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill the Parliamentary Secretary admitted that farmers generally were reluctant to borrow from the corporation because of the amount of publicity attaching to such transactions. They preferred, in the main, to go to the ordinary joint stock banks, because they knew that when they did so their business would be kept secret.  The Parliamentary Secretary also admitted that very few people availed of the advantages of chattel mortgages.  Personally, I take it that <Col N="851" /> the type of borrowing that should be developed in this country, if we are going to advance normally as people are advancing in other countries, is through loans obtained from the credit corporation, but we must see, if these loans are to be availed of generally, that the transactions in connection with them are of the most confidential character.  It is provided in the section that an official of the credit corporation or an official of a bank, an official of the county registrar, an official of the Minister for Agriculture, an officer of the Circuit Court or of the Supreme Court can go to the registrar and demand the right to inspect the register of chattel mortgages. In other words, the Parliamentary Secretary is providing in the section opportunities for people to inspect the register and ascertain particulars relating to every mortgage entered thereon, as well as the names of the borrowers.  Personally, I think that is entirely wrong.  If loans are going to be advanced by the State to a borrower through the medium of the credit corporation, or any other organisation, then it is incumbent on the State to see that all such transactions are treated with a reasonable degree of secrecy.  I submit that there is a moral obligation on the State in regard to that particular matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, the sub-section as drawn will discourage people from having anything at all to do with the corporation.  I seriously suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should re-examine the sub-section with a view to seeing whether some machinery cannot be devised to ensure that wherever a chattel mortgage is issued the names of the persons on the register shall not be divulged except under very definite and specific circumstances.  The amendment may not be perfect from the point of view of drafting, but, nevertheless, it embodies, I think, the viewpoint of every member of the Dáil who is familiar with the feelings of farmers throughout the country in regard to their financial transactions.  We all know how anxious they are to surround these transactions with the utmost secrecy.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should <Col N="852" /> try to overhaul the sub-section with the object of securing that transactions relating to chattel mortgages shall be treated with the utmost degree of secrecy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should give the amendment further consideration. He may not be able to accept it in its present form.  Apart from what has been said about an actual borrower there is this point which has not been stressed but which was implied, namely, that a number of people would feel that if the register is made available for inspection to such bodies as are referred to in the amendment then their business transactions will come under inspection for some purpose entirely unrelated to this measure. As far as I understand the position, the section is designed to prevent a person having a mortgage with this institution and then borrowing from another body, giving at the same time the same chattels and goods for the second mortgage.  The object of the section, I understand, is to prevent that being done.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, the feeling that Deputy Hughes has referred to that when a person is borrowing he wants his business to be kept absolutely private.  It is quite understandable, of course, that a State body, or an official of the court, should be able to get the information required from the register.  It would, however, I think, arouse a certain amount of doubt if people got it into their minds that this register of loans was available for inspection not only to the credit corporation and recognised banks but to every banking institution.  People would then have to consider whether it was advisable to have transactions with the credit corporation at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart altogether from the purpose for which the inspection is made by an individual on behalf of an authorised banks or the corporation, there is no attempt made in the section as it stands to bind the individual who makes the inspection to secrecy.  What is to prevent him going out and talking about the transactions of people whose names appear on the <Col N="853" /> register?  I am glad to have Deputy Briscoe's support for the amendment. This provision is most undesirable in its present form.  The amendment was put down to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to this matter, and may not be perfect from the point of view of draftsmanship. The sub-section, if not amended, will vitiate the whole business of chattel mortgages altogether.</P>

I want, instead of this provision for inspection, machinery by which, on a joint application made by an intending borrower and a bank or the corporation, as the case may be, full information relating to his particular property will be obtainable.  Although I am rather slow to agree to it, the <Col N="854" /> county registrar might be allowed to inspect, as one individual, and the granting of that right to a representative of the Minister for Finance might also be defended but, in other cases, application in writing to get full information regarding the property of an individual applying for a loan ought to meet the case.</P>

      <P>He said that.  I agree with Deputy Hughes that, when the Parliamentary Secretary went on to explain to what extent he would do so, he appeared to miss the point of the amendment.  What I have in mind, and what, I think, Deputy Hughes has in mind, is that it is not reasonable to have it in the Bill that the register is legally open to inspection by outside, non State bodies, particularly where one of these outside bodies referred to, a lending institution or a bank, fears that an intending borrower may have already a mortgage with the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  In that case, the bank or lending institution should be satisfied to be able, with the consent of the intending borrower, to write to the registrar for the information. My sympathy with the amendment is due to the fact that, unless something of that kind is conceded, the agricultural community will, whether on good grounds or otherwise, believe <Col N="855" /> that the transactions between borrowers from this institution and the institution itself are not absolutely secret, no matter what the Act may say.  To that extent, there is agreement between Deputy Hughes and me and I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to say that he will give the matter consideration from that point of view, as distinguished from the point of view of secrecy in the case of officials or persons entitled to inspect the register.</P>

      <P>At the end of the section to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4) Where stock which is the subject of a chattel mortgage is purchased by a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser without the knowledge of the chattel mortgage such transaction so far as the purchaser is concerned shall be <Col N="856" /> a legitimate transaction and the purchaser shall not in any way be liable to the mortgagee.</P>
    <P>A man who purchases stock for values without the knowledge of a mortgage may be indirectly protected by the Bill but I want it to be specifically stated that he will not be liable in any way if such a transaction takes place. If a man <i>bona fide</i> purchases stock which is the subject of a chattel mortgage and pays for it, I think we should put in a specific provision to protect him.  I do not think that a cattle dealer, for instance, who is deliberately invited to purchase stock so as to defraud an authorised bank or the corporation and prevent a charge from being collected, ought to be protected.  A certain amount of protection is implied for the <i>bona fide</i> purchaser at present but it is not specific.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections 26 and 27 give the protection which the Deputy is seeking.  Such a purchaser as he refers to is adequately protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 26 affords protection to the extent that the property will not be seized but it does not state that the purchaser will not be liable in any way.  That is the reason I put in the amendment.  I want to provide that the purchaser will not be liable in any way because of the transaction.  I do not think that the Parliamentary Secretary should object to that.  He suggests that he is amply protected already.  There is a difference and I am making a distinction.  The provision as it stands simply says that the stock will not be seized from his place because Section 26 provides for the stock to be seized at any place it may be, other than where they are purchased by a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value.</P>

      <P>I wonder if Deputy Hughes has really considered the extent to which he wants to go?  I do not agree with him this time. Obviously, a person who has a mortgage on chattel cattle and disposes of them notwithstanding the mortgage is committing a criminal offence, and the <Col N="857" /> Agricultural Credit Corporation would have a claim on his land in respect of that disposal of the chattels.  I think the <i>bona fide</i> position as it is covered at present in the main section is sufficient.  Again, we are dealing with a case which is likely to arise only very occasionally.  It is not going to be a wholesale method of business all over the country.  As it is a criminal offence to dispose of things on which there is a mortgage, the corporation could have recourse to the land itself and I think the provisions are sufficient in that case.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-sections (1) and (2) to delete all words from the word &ldquo;which&rdquo; in line 31 to the end of sub-section (2) and substitute therefore the following words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;requiring the said county registrar to seize and remove from the custody of any person (other than a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value without notice of the chattel mortgage) and from any place (other than land or premises belonging to such purchaser) within the county or county borough of such county registrar all or any of the stock comprised in the chattel mortgage.</P>
      <P>The county registrar shall hold such stock in his custody until the mortgage secures a decree in court or until he the county registrar gets a direction from the court.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 26 provides that where a mortgage which falls due is not met,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the mortgagee may serve on the county registrar of the county or county borough in which any of the stock comprised in the chattel mortgage is situated an order...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are going to give authority to the corporation or an authorised bank to serve an order on the county registrar, <Col N="858" /> an official of the court, to distrain and dispose of the stock.  It does not even say how they should be sold.  I feel that that is altogether wrong and is contrary to the idea that a man's property should not be interfered with except by an order of the court.  I am not very keen on my own amendment. I was inclined to argue that they would have to wait to get a decree.  I anticipated the Parliamentary Secretary putting up the case that the stock might have disappeared in the mean-time and it might not be possible for a mortgagee to realise.  I have met that in my amendment by saying that the order will require the said county registrar to seize and then hold the stock in custody until he gets a direction from the court.  If there is anything wrong and if the court decides that the animals should be discharged and returned to the owner, the county registrar would get that direction.</P>
    <P>If there is a specific chattel mortgage on stock, it would be very difficult to show the specific stock.  If it is registered against five or six cattle, I doubt whether it would be possible to identify that particular stock in eight or 12 months' time, unless they are marked in some way.  It would not be desirable to mark them, as that would immediately indicate that they were mortgaged stock.  The present proposal would interfere with private property without any appeal to the court and I feel it is almost unconstitutional. The Parliamentary Secretary may suggest that there are certain powers already in distraining for rates and annuities, but we are going further now and allowing private individuals&mdash;an authorised bank is a private individual under the law&mdash;to order an officer of the court to go out and distrain.  That is most undesirable and I propose in this alternative that the stock be held by the county registrar until the court makes a decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendment, as obviously it would be impossible for the registrar on making a seizure to hold the stock pending the decision of the court.  There would be all the additional expense involved, apart from the difficulties of accommodation of the stock.  It might help the <Col N="859" /> Deputy if I were to remind him that the word &ldquo;stock&rdquo; covers not merely animals, which most of us are inclined to regard as stock, but also machinery. In practice, the corporation has found that these chattel mortgages are seldom related to cattle.  It may on rare occasions apply to pedigree stock, but in the main &ldquo;stock&rdquo; in this sense is meant to cover machinery and plant, which could be easily identified.  I agree with Deputy Hughes that, if we were to brand cattle, that would be a general notification to the public that they were subject to the chattel mortgage. I am sure the Deputy will understand the difficulties which would be placed on the county registrar if we were to compel him, to retain stock pending a decision of the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulties, but difficulties are no excuse for infringing on an important principle. A private individual is being allowed to order an officer of the court to distrain on stock without the authority of the court.  I take exception to that. There is no use in giving lip service to constitutions or ideals if we are going to infringe on them, or sail very closely to it.  I do not know whether this is absolutely unconstitutional or not, but my idea of constitutions&mdash;unwritten constitutions, if you like&mdash;is that no individual's property can be interfered with except under the authority of the court, that the mortgage is not a law unto himself and cannot order an officer of the court to distrain.  It was all right for the Parliamentary Secretary to make the excuse that it may be machinery.  This Bill provides for &ldquo;stock&rdquo; and that is defined in the Bill. The Parliamentary Secretary knows it includes cattle and birds &mdash; even pheasants, we were told to-night.  I do not know how he is going to collect the mortgage in that case when it falls due, but he told us it does include pheasants If that is so, a county registrar will have a job collecting, and in meeting my amendment by keeping them in his possession for a while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has suggested that there would be a difficulty. My answer is that we ought to make every effort to overcome the difficulty <Col N="860" /> to meet a principle.  We ought to be guided by principles, and it is the job of his Department and the Civil Service to overcome the difficulty in order to defend and preserve a principle.  I do not think there would be any great difficulty, that the stock could be impounded and fed.  It will not occur so very often, and where it does occur, where the county registrar has to distrain, there may be inconvenience as a result, but we all have to suffer inconvenience from time to time, and it should not be beyond the power of man to make provision for keeping stock for some days until the court makes a decision.  The stock could be fed and whatever costs were involved would obviously have to be met by the mortgagor, but he would feel that he had got the protection of the court.</P>
    <P>That is what we ought to stand for &mdash;that a man should get a fair hearing if he has a case to present to the court and if an injustice may possibly be done to him under this machinery. He may suffer very grave hardships in certain circumstances, and surely, if he has failed to meet an obligation, he is entitled to state in court why he has failed and why leniency should be shown in his case.  These are aspects which the Parliamentary Secretary appears to overlook completely.  I am concerned to ensure that the court gets an opportunity of doing justice, that we will not have law operating on a totalitarian idea that a certain individual or banking institution is to have power to order officials of the court to do certain things.  That is wholly objectionable and the Parliamentary Secretary, in fact, has made no attempt to defend it.</P>

      <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy Hughes that, in the circumstances, the borrower ought to be given the right to go into court, in that right will be involved the costs of going to court.  In addition, the whole object of this provision of the Bill with regard to chattel mortgages will be defeated, because no person would take a chattel mortgage if it is to be left to the discretion of the borrower to have that <Col N="861" /> chattel mortgage perhaps utilised in such a way that it would be useless by the time the court's decision had been given.  Take the case of a chattel mortgage on agricultural machinery, say, a tractor.</P>

      <P>I have already dealt with that aspect of it.  I have already referred to the difficulty that we would be encumbering the county registrar in his dealing with this matter and we would also be making it more difficult for the mortgagee to lend money and restricting the operation of the Bill, if this amendment were accepted.  With regard to giving the mortgagor the protection of the courts, you are going to involve him in additional costs and it will be very poor satisfaction to a man who is, perhaps, already in financial difficulties to have another burden, in the shape of court costs, imposed upon him.</P>

      <P>Merely to ensure that this will work, we are to trample underfoot a fundamental principle. That argument does not appeal to me &mdash;that, because extra costs are involved, we should give private individuals the right to direct an official of the court to distrain.  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary appreciates the implication there?  Does he come in here and say that so far as he, individually, is concerned he stands over that sort of machinery?  To meet his point, as I say, we are to trample underfoot the fundamental principle that no individual's property should be interfered with, except by an order of the court.  I subscribe to that principle and if the Parliamentary Secretary is not prepared to meet me, I must divide the House on the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment, because it would limit the power of the country registrar to sale by public auction.  Should the auction-sale prove abortive, what would be his remedy?  In any case, the county registrar is subject to well-known rules in the disposal of property. Under Section 8 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926, he must hold a public auction in the first instance.  If, however, the auction proves abortive, he is at liberty to sell by private treaty.  That is already covered.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) (d), line 14, before the word &ldquo;to&rdquo; to insert the following words &ldquo;and does not replace with new stock&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think the section overlooks the fact that in the ordinary course of business a mortgagor may be changing stock and replacing it by other stock.  We are not dealing now with a specific chattel mortgage.  We are dealing with a floating chattel mortgage.  If, in the ordinary course of business, a mortgagor is legitimately changing stock, there would be very grave hardship imposed on him if the mortgagee were to insist that portion of the loan must be discharged before the period of the loan has expired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment in this instance.  The insertion of the words &ldquo;does not replace with new stock&rdquo; would leave him open, say, to sell and to replace a smaller amount. Let us assume, for a moment, that the Deputy is thinking of stock in the way it is understood by farmers and the public generally, that is, cattle, and that he sells ten and replaces them by new stock only to the extent of two. If the Deputy knows of any specific cases of hardship of the kind, I will have the matter looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know of any specific cases.  But, supposing stock is mortgaged and 12 months later they are much more valuable and in the ordinary course of farming must be sold and are replaced to the same number by new stock, I submit that what is set out in paragraph (d) would be a hardship:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Whenever the mortgagor sells any of the stock for the time being on the land to impose on him the obligation of paying such (if any) part of the proceeds of such sale as the mortgagee shall require to the mortgagee in reduction or discharge of the principal moneys secured by the chattel mortgage and any interest <Col N="865" /> and costs due thereon and to confer on the mortgagor the right to pay the whole or any part of such proceeds of sale to the mortgagee in reduction or discharge of such principal moneys and interest and costs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Supposing it is a machine, a binder, which is a rather costly machine, my amendment covers that it has to be replaced by a similar machine.  It may be old and worn out and the farmer would be anxious to get an up-to-date machine.  If it is cattle and if there is a specific charge on a number of stock, I submit that when they reach maturity they must be sold in the ordinary course of business and we are giving the right to the mortgagee to step in at that point, even though discharge is not due, and demand discharge simply because the farmer is bound to sell that stock when they are fit for sale.  The mortgagee sets out in an arbitrary way what must be repaid at that point, although the loan has not fallen due.  Surely that is not reasonable.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary is anxious to have this right and if he considers it and the implications of it from a countryman's point of view, leaving the Civil Service out of it altogether, perhaps he may come much nearer to my point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>In actual practice the corporation have never come across a single instance of hardship as a result of that provision, and that is the existing law.  Obviously, no mortgagee would act in the harsh manner that Deputy Hughes seems to fear, because by so doing he would perhaps destroy the means of livelihood of the farmer and thus prevent the possibility of his being able to pay off the debt.  If the farmer is put out of business, what hope have they of recovering from him?  It has never happened in the past and what reason have we to assume that a continuation of this power will impose hardship in future? In addition, those who lent the money also have rights and there is an obligation on the borrower to repay at least portion of the money which he borrowed. Their rights have to be protected also if the Bill is to be effective because, if you do not protect their rights to a certain extent, then it will <Col N="866" /> be impossible for the type of person for whom we are trying to cater to borrow money at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is overlooking the implication of the paragraph, that you are empowering the mortgagee to step in at a certain stage and make a new condition so far as the loan is concerned that payment must be made immediately simply because in the ordinary course of farming, stock have to be sold.  That is what I am objecting to.  Remember that in the conditions under which the loan is made no reference is made to an interim payment when stock is sold but the moment stock is sold in the ordinary course of farming the Parliamentary Secretary proposes to empower the mortgagee to step in and make his own conditions as to what amount of the loan and interest thereon should be discharged.  I merely want protection there for the ordinary farming operation of disposing of stock on maturity.  If everything is going all right and the mortgagor has every intention of meeting his obligations when they fall due, why should you empower the mortgagee to step in at that juncture? The Parliamentary Secretary said that the mortgagee would not have any intention of doing that because he would not want to put the mortgagor out of business, but he might do him an injury and might upset his calculations very seriously by intervening at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not very clear as to why this particular paragraph has been drafted in its present form. Quite obviously, it is intended to give the mortgagee, which would be the bank, powers which apparently it has not at present.  It is also quite conceivable that a paragraph of this kind, if it were enforced, would do considerable harm to the unfortunate borrower.  If a loan is to be of value to them, borrowers, farmers, must have freedom in the spending of it.  There are farmers who change stock frequently. A farmer may get a corporation loan and he may invest it in the purchase of ten or 12 cattle.  He may keep them for some months until prices appreciate and then he will sell them.  The margin will probably be <Col N="867" /> small.  He buys other cattle.  In order to leave himself with a decent profit he may have to change cattle three or four times.</P>
      <P>The corporation can step in when he is disposing of the first lot of cattle, when his margin of profit is relatively small.  By doing that, they are inflicting grave hardship on the farmer and are negativing any advantages he may derive from the loan.  Indeed, as Deputy Hughes suggests, they may prevent him from restocking.  There is that power implicit in this paragraph. It is all very well for the Parliamentary Secretary to say that the corporation does not intend to inflict this hardship, but they have the power to do so.  If they do not intend to inflict it, why incorporate this paragraph in the Bill?</P>
      <P>This paragraph, in my opinion, needs to be closely re-examined.  As it is phrased, it would undoubtedly inflict a very grave hardship on farmers who borrow loans of this character.  It would prevent them from making the very best use of them.  The Parliamentary Secretary has made no effort to justify the paragraph and until he makes a better case I could not vote for it.</P>

      <P>There have been any amount of cases, but no case of hardship has yet arisen.  If you deprive the mortgagee of certain rights you will defeat the object of the Bill.  I appreciate the point of view put forward by Deputy Hughes and Deputy Roddy.  I am just as anxious to safeguard the interests of the borrower as they are. The whole object of the Bill, and indeed all these Acts, is to help people, particularly in the farming community, who, perhaps, could not get financial accommodation otherwise.</P>

      <P>On this section, I think the corporation should not be exempted in any way from proving a deed.  There should be no discrimination as between the corporation and any other individual in the State as to the proving of a deed before the court. This section sets out that a certificate signed or sealed by the corporation will be sufficient proof of the validity of the document.  I know there are precedents for that but I think we should not continue that policy of allowing Departments of State, or even local authorities, to prove documents by a certificate.  The onus of proof should be on the corporation and they should be compelled to prove their case by producing the necessary evidence like every other individual.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hughes seems to be under the impression that this <Col N="871" /> section has reference to deeds.  It has reference to nothing of the kind.  The corporation could sue Deputy Hughes to-morrow morning under this section for £50 and issue a certificate to the effect that Deputy Hughes owes them £50.  Deputy Hughes would then have to go into court and satisfy the court that he did not owe them £50.  If Deputy Hughes failed to satisfy the court by proof produced by him that he did not owe the corporation £50, the presumption that he did would remain and he would be decreed accordingly.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation under Section 53 could walk into court and sue Captain Byrne of the Guard of this House for £1,000,000 and unless Captain Byrne could prove that he did not owe them £1,000,000, which might be a difficult thing to do, the lawyers representing the Agricultural Credit Corporation would not have to open their mouths. The presumption would be that he did and on that presumption a decree would issue.  They would then get an instalment order against Captain Byrne, who would presumably spend the rest of his life sitting up in Mountjoy because he was not prepared to pay suitable instalments on the debt of £1,000,000 created under this section.</P>
      <P>That Ministers in a nominally democratic country could produce such a proposal is so fantastic as to make ordinary people gasp.  The queer thing is that it is so fantastic that nobody in this House will really believe that it means what it says.  There is my friend, Deputy Breathnach, sitting on the back benches of Fianna Fáil and he does not really believe that if under this section the corporation issued a certificate that he owes them £100, he would have to dash off to get a certificated accountant to go into court and prove that he did not.  Why should any corporation, any Minister or any person be entitled to haul his neighbour before a court of law and put his neighbour under the obligation of having to pay him a sum of money, without first producing some proof to the court that the money is due?</P>
      <P>The section in this Bill is an outrage. It is a violation of all accepted law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> Heretofore, this kind of fantastic power has been claimed by the Land Commission as an emergency kind of power to deal with an alleged conspiracy to withhold land annuities.  Now it is being brought into the ordinary law of the country.  Why?  To save the secretary of the Agricultural Credit Corporation the trouble of keeping proper records.  That is all it does.  Every shopkeeper in this country who gives credit must keep records and bring them into court if he wants to sue a customer for a debt due.  He must satisfy the court that the records are properly kept and are reliable.  If the judge believes the records, then the court may grant a verdict unless rebutting evidence is produced.  This gentleman produces no book and no records.  He produces nothing but a statement, under seal, that Deputy Cormac Breathnach owes him £150. Having heard the best case that the Deputy can put up, if he thinks the Deputy is in lively mood and impresses the court, he can tear up the certificate and negative the claim.  If he thinks the Deputy slipped up in the process of proving the £150 he can then go for him and mulct him, not by proving that he has any debt, but by making Deputy Breathnach prove that he does not owe it.</P>
    <P>Outside of Alice and the Looking-glass there has never been such a procedure of litigation devised as that. We have the Lord Mayor of Dublin here, we have Deputy Fogarty from Tipperary, we have Deputy O Briain, the champion of Gaelic law and justice in this country, and we have Deputy Cormac Breathnach.  Will any one of these four pillars of the Fianna Fáil Party get up and defend on its merits the proposition that anyone in this country can issue a certificate that they owe him £100, and that they are obliged to go into court and prove that they do not?  I challenge any one of them to get up and defend that proposition on its merits.  If they do I will give them the opportunity of waltzing through the lobbies and of saying why, in Irish or in English, they defend such a proposition on its merits.</P>

      <P>I agree with everything that Deputy Dillon has said on this section.  The only apology that I have to make for representing the matter in such a mild manner is that I have not read the section for a fortnight. I knew that it was an objectionable section and that the onus of proof should be put on the corporation. It should be made prove its case in court.  To my mind, the idea of a document is that they would have to prove the document in court, and prove that there was a loan advanced which was not repaid.  Surely it would be a disgraceful procedure if this House were to agree to a section which provides that the corporation can go into court and certify that a sum of money is due by an individual, and that he must prove that he does not owe the money.  That is contrary to the ideas that all of us hold in regard to well-established law.  The onus of proof should surely rest on the corporation. They should prove their case in the ordinary way.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hughes is aghast at the idea that this House might pass this section, but the Dáil passed a similar section in 1929, and the world has not fallen asunder since. The object of the section is to save the borrower unnecessary expense.  The whole object of this section is not to impose a hardship on any unfortunate borrower but to save him expense.  It was for that purpose that it was embodied in the 1929 Act.  The section was rendered inoperative because under the Rules of Court, which were drafted subsequent to the passing of that Act, it was held by the county registrars that the Agricultural Credit Corporation was not mentioned in Order 15 of the Rules of Court, and they refused to accept these certificates. Hence the section has been inserted in this Bill to enable proof of amounts due to be obtained by certificate in the court.  On the other hand, if the borrower has a case he can enter a defence and the courts are there to protect his rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should the corporation be placed in a different position from that of any other person who <Col N="875" /> wishes to prove a debt?  I do not suggest for a moment that the corporation, as the Parliamentary Secretary seemed to imagine, might issue a certificate that it was owed a debt when, in fact, it was not.  In the ordinary procedure with regard to a debt of this kind, or a mortgage transaction, the matter comes before the court on the claim made by a person who is owed money.  The ordinary proof goes through as a matter of form, but it does not involve any extra expense on the mortgagee.  If the money is owing, proofs are produced in court and a defence is filed in the ordinary way. If this procedure is adopted, a defence must still be filed and the person indebted will still have to produce proof.  I do not see why the Agricultural Credit Corporation should be exempted from the ordinary procedure.  In this case, a certificate issued by the corporation is regarded as evidence&mdash;<i>prima facie</i> evidence, I suppose.  That immediately places the burden on the alleged debtor to produce evidence.  If the proper procedure were adopted, the court would examine the claim and, probably, make a primary decree.  When that primary decree was made, the borrower would have to file a defence and the matter could then come up for plenary hearing.  There is no case for making an exception in the present circumstances. In the numerous cases which come before the court, the lender and the borrower are more or less in the same relationship.  The lender may not be a wealthy person.  In the ordinary course of business, the creditor might be an ordinary shopkeeper and his capacity to bear losses might be no greater than that of the borrower.  In this case we have a State-financed corporation, and a body such as that, with substantial financial backing, should not be exempted from the ordinary procedure.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Deputy misconceives the idea behind the section. It is not in the interest of the Agricultural Credit Corporation it is introduced but in the interest of the borrower&mdash;in order to save him expense. <Col N="876" /> If the borrower has a defence to put up, the courts are open to him. This section is introduced to save expense to borrowers who have no defence to put up.  If that is not the case, the borrower can resort to the courts in the usual way.  The sole purpose of the section is to save expense to the borrower and, as I have repeatedly stated, the corporation has to cater for a class of the farming community who are not in the best financial position.</P>

      <P>Any court proceedings are bound to involve cost and the idea of the section is to obviate, if possible, the necessity for poor borrowers having to resort to the courts.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not this procedure involve court proceedings?  A writ issues, in the first place, against the person owing the money.  When that person appears in court, the corporation can produce a certificate under its seal and, there and then, the onus <Col N="877" /> of proof passes over to the defendant. That is the only effect of this section. It averts no legal proceedings and avoids no legal expense.  It saves the officer of the Agricultural Credit Corporation from going down to court and proving his debt.  It exempts him from the obligation of going into the witness box and being cross-examined. That is what they want.  They want to be put in a kind of superior class. They want to be a quasi-Government Department when they are suing their debtors but they are not so anxious to be a quasi-Government Department when they are paying their employees. I want the Agricultural Credit Corporation, since it is not a Department of State, to be in the same position as any other corporation.  If Córas Iompair Éireann alleges that some man owes them money, they have to go down to court and prove their claim.  The Parliamentary Secretary seems to labour under the illusion that that is a desperately expensive procedure even when the debtor acknowledges the debt and does not intend to defend the proceedings.  In fact, no recourse need be had to open court at all.  The whole transaction can take place in the registrar's office. If the sum is small&mdash;and the Parliamentary Secretary speaks of small sums&mdash;you can issue a default civil bill.  If a defence is not entered to that within the prescribed number of days, a decree is given and it is unnecessary to go into court at all.  Is not that a perfectly cheap procedure? So far as I know, there is a default procedure in the High Court for larger sums but, if the case comes within the authority of the Circuit Court, and there is no answer to the claim, the default civil bill procedure can be resorted to without involving anybody in substantial expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other story is all eye-wash.  The real truth is that the lordlings of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, quasi-Government Departments and Government Departments consider it beneath their dignity to be brought down to the level of the common farmer or the common citizen.  If they claim a debt against the common creature, he has to come in and prove that it is not <Col N="878" /> due.  But if the common creature claims that a debt is due to him, he has to go in, prove his claim and have it adjudicated by a court of law.  There is nothing more evil than the tendency manifesting itself in this House to prevent the courts of law from standing between individual citizens and the Executive or the agents of the Executive.  That is one of the primary functions of the courts of law&mdash;to protect the ordinary citizen against a Government or the agents of a Government. This kind of section is designed to ensure that the ordinary citizen's recourse to the courts will be effectively rendered nugatory.  You could not lawfully pass an Act preventing the ordinary citizen from getting into the courts.  If you did, it would be unconstitutional and he would get into the courts in spite of any legislation passed by this House.  But you can go a long way by legislation to make the procedure of the courts and the normal protections afforded by the courts to citizens nugatory and ineffective <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Government and Departments of State.  These matters are highly technical and the average person does not understand them at all, so it is extremely difficult to arouse popular interest in them.  It is only when all these barriers have been torn down and destroyed that people begin to discover that their liberties have been gradually dissipated piecemeal without their knowing it.</P>
    <P>There is no reason on God's earth why the Agricultural Credit Corporation could not go to court and prove its debt like anybody else, except that all Governments and the agents of all Governments resent the obligation of coming before the courts of the country on an equal footing with the citizens of the State.  It should be our continual vigilant duty to insist that in the courts of law there should be equal law for everyone, whether it be the Government or the humblest creature in the community.  Every departure from that is an evil thing and there are very few Deputies sitting on the far side of the House who do not know that; but they are afraid to stand by their convictions.  They know how evil this is, but they also know that the people do not understand it and <Col N="879" /> therefore they cannot resist the Party Whip, because the people would not understand why they resisted.  Well, I suppose everyone has a price at which he is prepared to sell his soul.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary is under a complete misapprehension in this business.  In the ordinary procedure, if it is a specific debt&mdash;in other words, if it comes within the High Court range&mdash; there is a primary decree made and then the borrower has to come in and file a defence.  After the primary decree is made, a claim may issue on a summons and a defence would be filed. On the other hand, if it comes in the Circuit Court, the county registrar examines it and subsequently it may go before the court, if there is evidence that satisfies the county registrar that there is a debt.  It may go before the court, as Deputy Dillon says, either by default or on a civil bill where a claim is filed and subsequently a defence. But unless there is some evidence which satisfies the judge in the first instance in the High Court on a primary decree, or satisfies the county registrar in the second instance in the Circuit Court, then no expense can be put on the borrower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case, once a certificate issues from the corporation, the borrower has to go in and the onus is on him to prove he does not owe the money. While it may be a simple procedure, I think it is a bad procedure and it is wrong that State corporations or any State body of this kind should be placed in a superior position to the ordinary traders or ordinary citizens who borrow or lend.  For that reason, it is a bad form of legislation which <Col N="880" /> in any way exempts a large corporation of this kind&mdash;and particularly one that has statutory protection and is financed from State funds&mdash;and places it in a superior position <i>vis-a-vis</i> the situation of one citizen to another.  The Parliamentary Secretary should reconsider this section before allowing it to go through as it is.  I am very doubtful if it means any saving at all to the borrower.  In fact, he may find himself in more protracted proceedings under the section than if the corporation were obliged in the ordinary procedure to prove the debt.</P>

      <P>Is there any similarity between the procedure outlined in this section and that now adopted by the Land Commission for the collection of arrears of annuity from tenants?  In former years, when I became a member of the Dáil first in 1933, the procedure was that the Land Commission sued these tenants in the District Court.  An undefended proceeding of that nature by the Land Commission in the District Court at that time cost the tenant 32/-, in addition to the £5 or £6 he owed for a half-year.  After the passing of the Land Act of 1933, the system of collection was changed and the new procedure gave power to the county registrar to collect.  That was strenuously opposed here by the Opposition, and by Deputy Dillon, I think, but it has worked out very satisfactorily&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;from the point of view of the costs that the poor tenants in arrear have to bear.  The greatest cost that the county registrar can collect under the new system is 8/-, plus 1/- for postage and other expenses of that nature.  In the case of smaller rents, it would be 4/- or 5/-.  I know that from the experience I have had in approaching the county registrar on behalf of Land Commission annuitants who are in arrears.  If this proposal is something on the same lines, it is a <Col N="881" /> good system for the people concerned, the borrowers and the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and should be adopted.  I do not mind about the highfalutin principles Deputy Dillon is talking about.

      <P>When he speaks of highfalutin principles, what protection have free men at all except what he cares to describe as highfalutin principles? <Col N="882" /> If you say that, for convenience purely or for the saving of 25/- in the small number of cases where it is necessary to recover land annuities by decree, you are going to take away from every small farmer in Ireland his right to go into the courts in defence of what he believes are his rights as against the Government, surely, far from doing something prudent and sensible, you are doing something reckless and wrong.</P>
      <P>I quite agree and every experienced person must know that, of all the actions that are started in the courts by rational men, 85 per cent. will end in favour of the plaintiff, because the plaintiff would not go into court if he did not believe he was pretty sure of winning.  But 15 per cent. do not succeed, because the plaintiff is wrong. It is perfectly true to say that if one could examine the police records of all the prosecutions started by the police, one would find that 80 per cent. result in conviction, and 20 per cent. do not.  It would be very much more convenient and would save a lot of expense if a man could be given seven days in Mountjoy on the certificate of a Civic Guard, and in eight cases out of ten, justice would be done.  But it is because in two cases, or in one case, out of ten that justice would miscarry, if that abbreviated procedure were adopted, that we go to all the expense of having judges, magistrates and Circuit Court judges, all the machinery of evidence and all the majesty of the law.  In 80 per cent. of cases the certificate that the plaintiff's case was right would achieve substantial justice and yet, rightly, we try them, we insist on all the cases being tried out so as to ensure that justice will be done in all.</P>

    <P>I have no doubt that in 98 per cent. of the actions in respect of which certificates would be issued under this section, the debt would be due and if it had been made the subject of litigation for a week, the result would be the same, but that is no argument for abolishing the courts of law, for abolishing the procedure which these courts have devised as the only procedure which will ensure that justice will be done.  The Deputy shakes his head, but in the land code case to which he referred, <Col N="883" /> that was done&mdash;the courts were abolished altogether.</P>

      <P>Not that I know of.  Can any Deputy advise us?  So far as I know, that man had no remedy whatever. The money had to be paid, and there was no means of paying it back. That is my information.  I do not believe he had any right against the person against whom the Land Commission had intended to issue the certificate, so that in that case we did actually sweep the courts aside altogether. In this case, under Section 53, we do not intend to do that, but we intend to go into the courts and sweep aside the procedure laid down by them out of the fullness of their experience, to short circuit it, and to go through the form of preserving all the dignity of the law, but, in fact, by statute, destroying it.</P>
      <P>Will Deputies look at lines 21 and 22 of this section?  These provisions have been put in deliberately to offset a decision of the courts because the courts laid down that if you produce a document sealed, you must produce proof that the seal was regularly and properly applied to the document.  Is that not correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There were such cases. It has now become the fashion, when preparing sections of this character, to declare specifically that that proof heretofore required by the civil courts shall no longer be required.  I agree again that, in 99 per cent. of cases, to ask men to come down and prove the sealing of a document appears to be a waste of time, but the courts never established that procedure without <Col N="884" /> good reason, and you will always find that precautionary measures of that kind are only availed of in the very exceptional case; but is it not a reckless thing to do to sweep these precautions aside because only a few people will be hurt?  That has the familiar sound of the Taoiseach's famous dictum that you cannot have omelettes without breaking eggs.  I point out to Deputies now, as I pointed out to the Taoiseach on that occasion, that that is a very agreeable doctrine on the Taoiseach's lips until the Taoiseach happens to be the egg.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>Stripped of all the talk, I think we can get down to the plain and simple fact that we want to provide for the eventuality in which a person, having borrowed a sum of money from the Credit Corporation, is unable to pay and the corporation, in the ordinary course of its business, wishes to recover that sum of money. What is the best procedure?  Deputy Dillon is very solicitous for the welfare of the poor borrower, but he would go so far, if we were to listen to him, as to impose on the borrower all the costs of court proceedings in every single instance, even though he admits that, in 98 per cent. of the cases, the corporation would undoubtedly be able to prove the debt due.</P>
      <P>Yet because of the 2 per cent. in which, according to Deputy Dillon, they might not succeed, we are to impose all these expenses and go so far as to bring down a witness to prove that the seal had been affixed to the certificate of the corporation.  Who is to pay these expenses?  Is it not the unfortunate borrower?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If he cannot pay the debt, he cannot pay the expenses.  If you have stripped him to the buff, you can take no more.  You cannot take the breeches off a Highlander.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy, and I ask that I be given the same courtesy.  I will not detain the House very long.  In this section we want to prevent the unfortunate borrower from having to undergo unnecessary expense in a court of law.  We do not want to deprive him of one tittle <Col N="885" /> of his rights as a citizen.  We do not want to take any advantage of the position in which he finds himself, but rather than impose upon him the obligation of having to go into court and incur all the expenses involved in a case where he has practically no defence, this section is introduced to save him that expense.  On the other hand, if it is a case in which an error has been committed, which the Deputy referred to&mdash;in passing I might say that if any error of the kind was committed by the Land Commission I understand that compensation has been paid&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, it has been done, and no injustice has thereby been caused.  It is not the intention under this section to cause any injustice to any would-be borrower, far from it. The intention is to save the borrower from the expense in which court proceedings would involve him.  Let us assume it is a case which he thinks he should fight in the court.  There is nothing to prevent him from doing that.  This section does not prevent him from going to court.  He can engage a solicitor and file a defence and fight the case in the court, and the onus of proof is on the corporation, not on the individual.  They have to prove that the debt is due.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course he would. They will have to prove that it is due. Therefore, we are not depriving him of one scintilla of his rights.  We are only trying to save, perhaps a small section of the community, unnecessary legal expense.  That is all that is in the section.  We are not seeking to involve the debtor in any expense, but rather to save him from it.  The whole purpose of the Bill, as I have stated, is to help these people, not to hinder them.  You are going to do a bad day's work for the borrowers in opposing this section, because, as Deputy Ó Briain' pointed out, some years ago there were sheaves of decrees issued in favour of the Land Commission by the various courts.  There is not a Deputy who was in the Dáil at that time who, from <Col N="886" /> time to time, had not to go and look for time to pay for these unfortunate people.  That is not the position today, because of the passing of Section 28 of the 1933 Act.  Similarly, I hold that the passing of this section will be a boon for the unfortunate borrowers who find themselves in financial difficulties. There is no necessity to reiterate that their right and privileges are in no way interfered with.  Their right to go into court is still there and they have adequate protection in the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Who is going to be in the court?  Is it the debtor's ghost?  Is it his aunt or is it his grandmother? The section provides that civil proceedings will be started against the man who owes money to the corporation. That is the first procedure. When the case is joined between them in court, instead of counsel for the corporation saying: &ldquo;My Lord, on the 1st March, 1948, this man borrowed £1,000 on foot of a mortgage in respect of his land.  He has paid £150 and we now claim to recover £850 from him or get a suitable remedy under the mortgage deed.&rdquo;  All he need say is: &ldquo;I hand in a certificate to the effect that the £850 is due,&rdquo; and then sit down; whereupon counsel for defendant has to get up and prove that there is a flaw in the document.  Unless and until counsel for the farmer proves that the contents of the sealed certificate are false, the sealed certificate is conclusive evidence that the debt is due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="887" /> If counsel for the farmer proves that the contents of the certificate are false, there is nothing to prevent the corporation proceeding to produce their books and prove the debt in the ordinary way, but in what the Parliamentary Secretary tried to represent to the House he is clearly doing it for the purpose of misleading Deputy Ó Briain, because that Deputy thinks that this procedure is similar to the Land Commission procedure.  It has nothing to do with it.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that Section 53 is designed to protect debtors from the necessity of having to go into court. That is nonsense.  This document has no existence, has no purpose and no function unless and until the parties are in court.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary know that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Did he not tell the House that they would be abbreviated in a case where the debtor believed the debt was not due?  I submit that they would not be abbreviated in any way.  Suppose the debtor proceeded to satisfy the court that the certificate is in some material particular wrong and the court rejects the certificate.  That in no way debars the corporation from saying: &ldquo;If the court does not accept the certificate as conclusive evidence, we now produce the books and, on our records, we claim that the debt is due.&rdquo;  All the section says is that, unless and until the contents of the certificate are rebutted, the certificate remains conclusive evidence.  But, on its rebuttal &mdash;that there is a flaw in it&mdash;the corporation will be thrown back on its ordinary remedy and can then go on.  Therefore, far from sparing the litigant expense, it does nothing of the kind. If we envisage a case where the litigant knows that the money is due and that he has no defence, the existing legal procedure is the most inexpensive procedure that can be devised, and that is the default procedure in which no defence is entered at all.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the Parliamentary Secretary had anything to do with this section at all, because, as he said himself, it was carried forward from some other Bill.  It is a rotten principle and ought to be challenged on every possible occasion.  So far as I am concerned, if I ever have any say in it, every one of these sections will be followed up through the legislation of this kind and rooted out and the proper position restored.  In this country every man and woman, from the President down to the crossing-sweeper and from the Government to the smallest huckster in the meanest back street of this city, when they go into court should be equal before the law.  That is a sound doctrine and any departure from it is an evil out of which further and greater evils must inevitably grow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe there will be one Deputy who will dare to get up and second what I am about to propose, because the principle is so well established in this country that it is best to keep the bad dog with you, and the Gaelic League is universally recognised as the bad dog.  That proposal is put in there for the shameless and fraudulent purpose of excluding certain persons and jobbing incompetent <Col N="892" /> duds, who are prepared to lick the boot for Fianna Fáil, into the service of this corporation.</P>
      <P>It is one of the ingenious devices that is being worked out by the Fianna Fáil Party for the purpose of circum-navigating the Civil Service Commissioners, the Local Appointments Commissioners or any other body established to sieve out some of the rubbish that is tied to the tail of the Fianna Fáil Party.  When a fellow is so hopelessly incompetent that he could not hope to acquire employment in any public department according to any standard of competition that could be devised by the mind of man, they then lay down the doctrine that no person shall be appointed to any situation in the corporation's clerical grades unless, in the opinion of the directors, he possesses a competent knowledge of Irish.  But, do you imagine that if some of the great Moguls of the Fianna Fáil Party, who have been waiting with their tongues out for the past six months for the jobs that are to be given by the board of this corporation, do not know Irish, that that will disqualify them from collecting their £800 a year?  Not on your life.</P>
      <P>I suggest an amendment of this amendment and we will test the Parliamentary Secretary's good faith.  Will he provide that no director of the company will be elected unless he satisfies the Civil Service Commissioners that he has a competent knowledge of Irish? Will the Parliamentary Secretary put that provision into the Bill?  Let us make it Gaelic from roof to cellar and not have a Gaelic basement and a Sasana roof.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary place a statutory obligation on the five chimney-pots to be Gaels?</P>
      <P>Look at sub-section (2):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In making an appointment to any situation in the service of the corporation (other than a situation referred to in sub-section (1) of this section) regard shall be had to the knowledge of Irish possessed by candidates.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, you can bring in a fellow that should be locked up in Ballinasloe Lunatic Asylum as an imbecile, who has just enough intelligence to come in <Col N="893" /> out of the rain and you can say: &ldquo;we prefer him to an average intelligent man&rdquo;.  Why?  &ldquo;Because he has lovely Irish.  He has been studying in the Craobh na Cúig gCúigí for the last 35 years.  He has just got to the end of Book I of O'Growney and if he were not appointed now he would never persevere to the end of Book II.&rdquo;  Are people not ashamed at the extent to which we have succeeded in degrading our people?  Are there any Deputies in this House who remember the time when people learned Irish for the love of the language?  Are there any people in this House who remember the time when every Gaeltacht was not crawling with parasites who went down there to qualify for some job, the duties of which they were manifestly unfitted to discharge?  Surely there must be some sense of shame left somewhere.</P>
    <P>Surely we have not all become so utterly debased and corrupted that we can pass that kind of filthy fraud with a smirk, glorying in the fact that we can get away with it.  Is there no end to the hypocrisy that will enact subsections (1) and (2) of that amendment and forbear from saying that every director of this company shall be a native speaker or have that standard of Irish at his command?  Deputy O'Leary says it is not necessary.  In the name of goodness, what do clerks in the Agricultural Credit Corporation want with a competent knowledge of Irish?</P>

The farmers who can speak Irish in this country will not get any grants or loans or much civility either from the Agricultural Credit Corporation. If they see one coming in the front door they will tell him to go down to the servants' entrance, that the front entrance is reserved for the big fellows who come there in motor cars.  The <Col N="894" /> fellows who will be looking for loans under this scheme will not have to have Irish.  This is put in for the purpose I have described and no other purpose, and the only means we have of exposing the fraudulent purpose they have in mind is to challenge them to apply the same test to the job-hunters who are waiting in a row outside clamouring for appointment to this board.  Will you put into that amendment that they are to be Irish speakers too?  If you do, we shall be able to judge the measure of sincerity that lies behind this proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must admit that I am somewhat diffident in dealing with this matter. because it is a subject of which I know practically nothing.  My Department has, however, a great deal of information about it.  Several schemes were put up to it but no workable scheme seems to have been put up.  A number of suggestions were made.  One of these had to do with the appointment of wardens.  An obvious difficulty arises there.  How many wardens are to be appointed and who is to supervise them to see that they do their work properly?  Is it the intention to cover the entire country with wardens? That would involve the expenditure of a considerable sum of money. Another suggestion was concerned with the giving in of heads of different birds and animals injurious to game. I do not think that that would be a workable proposition.  My attitude is: if a scheme is put up that could be regarded as workable, I am prepared to go to the Minister for Finance and ask him to make a contribution.  I imagine that he would insist on some sort of reciprocal contribution on the part of the game preservation societies.  I think that it is well known that, when money comes entirely from the State and local people are not asked to make a contribution, they take little trouble to see that the money is properly expended.  If a workable scheme were put up, showing how this desirable object of preserving the game of the country could be attained, I do not think that it would be difficult to convince the Minister for Finance that he should make a grant towards its cost.  How much the grant would be. <Col N="899" /> I do not know.  If some of the societies which sent in proposals to the Department would put up a scheme which we would consider workable, I should be prepared to make a recommendation to the Minister for Finance in connection with it.</P>
      <P>As regards hen pheasants, a Deputy suggested that we should have complete prohibition of shooting of these birds for three years.  In certain parts of the country, there was a prohibition regarding the shooting of hen pheasants for a year.  That was, I think, last year.  At present, proposals from different game societies are before us with regard to the period in which the close season should be enforced in the coming year.  A great deal will depend on the case which is put up by those societies.  If those people, who are experts in the matter, can convince the Department, we shall make an Order, generally, in accordance with their proposals, as being the people who know most about the subject. Captain Giles referred to poisonous dressings.  Now that cartridges are becoming more plentiful, that practice may be discontinued. Deputy Moran said that holders of 5/- licences were doing a great deal of damage and that we should make clear to them that they are not entitled to shoot game.  I do not know who will stop them but we are going to put that clearly on the face of the licence.  It was suggested that the Gardaí should be made gamekeepers of a sort. Somebody suggested that nobody knew better how to poach than the Gardaí themselves.  I do not know whether that is true or not.  A good poacher would make an excellent gamekeeper and, if you could get the best poacher in the area and make him a gamekeeper, there might be good results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister's declaration is very fair.  No concrete proposal has been put up in the course of this discussion.  No proposal has been made which the Minister could accept.  Certainly, none has been made which I would accept.  This problem must be faced as a national problem.  For years, on the Land Commission Vote, I have been drawing attention, under the sub-head dealing with the letting of moors for the shooting of game, to the conditions under which these lettings take place.  I think that, ultimately, a section of that Department will have to deal with that problem if it is to be dealt with at all. The first essential is to appreciate the problem.  Until you do that, you cannot provide an effective remedy.  Since the passing of the Land Act of 1903, the protection of game has been disappearing year by year.  When the landlord was bought out and when the entire sporting rights, including fishing and shooting, passed to the tenantry, the protection of game was nobody's business.  The Land Commission, like all amateurs who never had anything to do with land, annually put an advertisement in the newspapers saying that over an area of moor situated at AB the shooting was for letting and they asked for tenders.  There was not a word in that as to how many birds were on it, or how many birds should be shot on it.  The man who took it could shoot on it and not leave a solitary feather for the following or any other season.  That was obviously stupid.  The people who put in the advertisement had no appreciation of their duty to the State, if game rights are to be of any value at all.  You must look upon this with a balanced view, where millions of pounds of public funds and private investment are being spent on the building of hotels and hostels to attract tourists.  Surely those buildings are not going to be in vain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="901" /> The visitors will come mainly, in a climate like ours, in the months of June, July, August and September. The best money in the tourist season is in August and September, and the very best in August.  The only things you have to offer a tourist in the way of sporting rights during August and September are fishing and grouse shooting.  I am profoundly sorry to have to say that my experience is that grouse in the main has disappeared, for the reasons I have indicated, through this policy of the Land Commission. They are the big owners of grouse shooting rights and have handled this in such a way that they have no conception at all as to the actual number of birds on any shoot of theirs, by not having a gamekeeper there to give the Department the approximate number of birds on it and the approximate number that should be shot, leaving a stock for the future years.</P>
    <P>The Department will have to go further and import fresh stock regularly. It is difficult to be dogmatic about wild birds.  In spite of the books that have been written about them for years and years, by men who gave their lives to the study of fish and birds of all kinds, it is impossible to say how and why these things work out.  However, in the main, grouse now have become, in my opinion, inbred, as regards the stock that remains.  You come to a point where your bird stock is going fairly well, but you reach the point where there has been no importation of fresh blood and then the decline is sudden, when breeding is so acute.  For the last six or seven years the reduction of grouse on the moors has been particularly conspicuous. The ordinary man will explain that it is due to the non-destruction of vermin. In a sense that is true and explains the case, but it does not fully explain it.  One of the main causes of the rapid decline now is the continuous inbreeding since 1912 or 1913, when the effect of the 1903 Act was felt, plus the effect of the 1909 Act, and then the landlords, having made up their minds that their day was finished, were finished also with the sporting rights. The whole thing became everybody's <Col N="902" /> concern&mdash;which meant it was nobody's concern.</P>
    <P>The first thing necessary is the destruction of vermin.  It is pure waste of time to talk about the preservation of grouse, as they are not there.  What is left is a mere skeleton, not worth being preserved.  On account of the inbreeding there will be no virile development, so you must at once import new blood from Northumberland, Cumberland and Scotland.  That was always done regularly about November, when I was a youngster.</P>
    <P>We have heard various suggestions, all well meant, on the creation of stock farms.  It is positively ridiculous to talk about setting up a farm for the preservation of grouse breeding.  You have to assume that on a given day you import 50 hens and 50 cocks and let them out on the farm.  Where will they be to-morrow?  Instead of that, they must be taken in crates on a lorry over a moor and you let two out here and another two the distance of the Phoenix Park and another two some miles further on, but not more than two at any point.  You must do it in the evenings, so that during the night they will settle down in the heather and get the atmosphere and not fly away.  If you let more than that out together, they will fly off and no one knows where they may land.  The propagation of grouse on a farm cannot be done.</P>
    <P>Then we have the destruction of vermin.  The war is over and there are plenty of guns and ammunition.  The foxes which develop rapidly can be destroyed just as rapidly.  During the war, they became a serious problem and turned even from hens to killing sheep and lambs.  Then the farmer's son on mountain and hillside is directly involved.  He did not care so long as it was his mother's or his sister's hens but when it came to killing his lambs he pricked his ears and got his gun or went to the chemist and got some strychnine to kill them off.</P>
    <P>As to importing fresh blood, are the conditions in Northumberland and Cumberland as they were 35 years ago, when anyone at all could get a crate of birds?  Have things gone wrong over <Col N="903" /> there?  I do not know how the landlords are getting on, but when they were preserving in the way I used to know, thousands and thousands of birds could be got and every five minutes the dogs would be on top of a covey.  On one of the finest moors I have been associated with for the last 55 years, I do not think the two best guns in Ireland would get ten brace of birds in a day.  I saw a party of two guns shooting 17 birds.  That is the general position.</P>
    <P>I know practically every moor in Ireland, having been up and down the whole country after dogs.  I can tell the Minister candidly I have no interest whatever in it but the interest of the country, in the sporting rights of the country from the tourist point of view. I keep dogs, but keep them just because I like them and not for the destruction or shooting of birds.  I never want to shoot a bird.  We must approach the Department of Lands and get them to set up a section like the Fisheries Section attached to the Department of Agriculture.  The machinery must be as simple as possible, as this can be done very simply by appointing some local game protection association or some committee of laymen in each district where there is a moor and let them appoint gamekeepers.</P>
    <P>The Minister is afraid that it will cost a lot of money.  It need not do so at all.  The landlords who formerly owned these shoots did it very cheaply and Deputies from country areas will know what happened.  The landlords gave some farmer's son or some small farmer who occupied a strategic position on the moor, from the point of view of watching the approach of poachers, the sum of £5 a year, which he was very glad to get, to preserve the game.  We need not set out to let people know that we have a highly valuable possession, because, if we do, it will push up the price of its protection; but it can be done quite simply.  The machinery is there that will effectively do the job.  The Land Commission now is the absolute owner of the sporting rights conveyed to them and there are also the rights asserted by the Government in regard to turbary <Col N="904" /> which make the appropriate Government Department complete owners of bog lands and this matter of protection should be made the responsibility of the Department of Lands. There are plenty of men associated with these little societies who would do the job voluntarily because they are sportsmen, and, whatever may be said about us anywhere, we are all sportsmen and will do things for the sake of sport that we would not do for any other reason.  The Land Commission could get these men to act voluntarily in this matter.</P>
    <P>We have nothing in the country at present to offer the men who come in in August and September as visitors except the prospect of sitting in a hotel and they are not content to do that and will go somewhere else.  The question is how this matter of preservation is to be done effectively.  There is no use in the Minister asking for sums of money, no matter how big, if they are to be handed over to some of these local bodies perhaps to be squandered and perhaps to get into the hands of men who are not sportsmen at all but who merely want to create some new racket, and we are quite good at that sort of thing.  It should be done on a voluntary basis, outside the cost involved by the provision of a gamekeeper who will not cost a large sum. There are men who go out through the sheep every day, who are on the move around the moor every day and who can tell you to within ten or a dozen birds how many are on a moor on a given day.  These men will be glad to get £5, or whatever sum will cover their rates and annuities.  There is not a district in Ireland in which men of that type, men who have been amateur sportsmen in the true sense all their lives, could not be got to do this work voluntarily.</P>
    <P>These are the problems: the destruction of vermin and the restocking of the moors.  Pheasants are quite a simple matter because they can be easily reared.  It is possible to buy the eggs, have them hatched and rear thousands of young birds in the one year in one meadow.  Upwards of 2,000 young pheasant chicks can be reared in one area of 10 or 12 acres, but grouse are a different matter.  The only way in which <Col N="905" /> that problem can be met is by getting them from Northumberland, Cumberland and Scotland.  The question is who is to get them there.  There is no use of talking at present about game preservation, because, in the main, there are no game to preserve, so the game must be got and I suggest that those Deputies who have spoken on this subject should put their heads together and put up a proposition to the Department with a view to having a section set up for dealing with it.</P>
    <P>We have seen recently millions of money being invested to attract tourists, but there is no use in spending that money unless we can take full advantage of it and reap the full harvest. For the last 50 years, since America became a great industrial country, industrialists from that country have been coming to England and Scotland and have paid huge sums for shoots.  We have no such attractions to offer these men at the moment. There is not one grouse shoot in this country for which I would ask any visitor to pay a price.</P>
    <P>Serious allegations have been made against poachers and I have no defence of the poacher to offer.  I have been associated with a moor all my life. It is a moor from which grouse have completely disappeared and in the last ten years I should say that not five brace of grouse were shot by poachers there, so that the position is not due to poachers, but to other causes, these causes being vermin, inbreeding and no restocking.  I do not know of a solitary bird having been imported into Donegal since 1913.  For over 30 years not a solitary drop of new blood has come in there, so that we have to start at the bottom.  We are down at rock-bottom and we must create the machinery to enable us to get back. It can, as I say, be done quite easily, and our policy should be to have that machinery as a permanent substitute for the work done by the landlords. These landlords were all absentee landlords and when their interest in rents disappeared, they disappeared, and now there is nobody to do the work they did, and did well and very cheaply for themselves.  They reaped the benefit at the time but they provided a <Col N="906" /> source of money for the country and there is no reason why we should not do the same.  Do we intend to do it?</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to vote for handing money over to private individuals for the carrying out of this work.  It should be done by the Department of Lands, the Department vitally concerned. That Department is also planning huge forests which will involve such game as pheasants, which are wood birds.  Nobody can touch these forests but the Department and there is, in addition, an enormous acreage of moor on which they own the sporting rights, and these are paramount reasons for the Department adopting what I have urged on every Estimate for the Department of Lands.  It is a step which is long overdue, but, when something does not press too hard, one is inclined to put it on the long finger.  I do not believe in putting this matter on the long finger.  It is a matter which was always urgent from the point of view of tourists coming to this country, because all that the man with the big money, the man who can afford to pay any price in reason, who comes in the months of August and September, and mainly in August, wants is a good service, rivers well stocked with salmon and moors well stocked with grouse&mdash;he has gone before the partridges arrive.</P>
    <P>These are the things for which he is prepared to pay big money.  We have not got them now, but they are potentially there.  A small sum of money will do it.  In my opinion, it is not a question of money; it is a question of a simple and efficient machine that would carry that out.  I suggest to the Minister that he should not bother going to the Department of Finance until he first sets up the machinery to do that.  Then he can appeal to the Minister for Finance and, of course, to the country and lay the foundation of what will be a great national asset in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was particularly interested to hear the views of Deputy McMenamin because, in case the Minister in charge of this particular debate <Col N="907" /> might not know it, I think it is no offence to any other Deputy to say that on this subject Deputy McMenamin is the greatest authority that ever graced this particular building.  I do not suppose there is a moor in Ireland, north, south, east or west, that he has not walked over behind setters or pointers or some particular form of game dog.  Certainly, he can talk with broad national knowledge on this particular subject.  Any of the rest of us, at best, can only speak from either parochial or county experience.</P>
      <P>I think it is within the knowledge of every one of us, even the youngest here, that feathered game has practically disappeared from this country and, in so far as it has not already gone, it is disappearing very rapidly.  The first cause of that is that, in an official sense, game is, in fact, nobody's business.  When we deal with game in this House, it is always an unfortunate Minister for Justice who is sitting opposite, merely because it impinges to some extent on the law.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be more appropriate if the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is concerned with tourism, the Minister for Agriculture, who is concerned with the economic existence of the farmers, and with fisheries, or the Minister for Lands should deal with this particular subject. Deputy McMenamin traced the disappearance of feathered game back to a period about 30 years ago with the disappearance of the big landlords.  I know that on a big estate neighbouring our own small place at home there was a big landlord.  He spent a round sum of £1,000 per annum stocking his place with pheasants and, incidentally, stocked the whole parish.  Even in the worst year he never lost money; in the best year he never made very much. But he stocked really the whole parish with pheasants for that expenditure and, on a two-days' shoot, recouped the full expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this particular motion urges the expenditure of certain money in order to restock the country with game and <Col N="908" /> preserve the game when the country is restocked, I do not believe that it is asking the Government, or public funds, or the pool suggested to take an unwise gamble.  I believe that any money spent in that particular direction will certainly be returned a hundredfold directly and indirectly to the State.  I remember a time as a boy when, in the third week in August, I would see traps coming back, one, two and three in the week, with scarcely room for the passengers on account of the numbers of grouse in each trap.  I know these hills since I was a boy.  I am certain that I am not saying anything inaccurate when I say that it is almost 20 years since I saw any grouse on that particular chain of hills.  I have gone over them with dogs time and time again and it is fully that length of time since I saw any grouse. I know places where, as a young man, I spent many days shooting on tracts of mountain; but it is 15 years since anybody, be he a man carrying a licence or a poacher, thought it worth his while to carry a gun there, because the game has gone.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I am familiar with a fairly large tract of land in the County Sligo in which a few people got interested because they saw the game rapidly disappearing from Sligo and Donegal.  They got interested in an area of, possibly, eight square miles, which happens to have water on two sides.  They got the local farmers interested, in so far as the son of the house here and the son of the house there got £1 or £2 a year to keep poachers off.  There was not a bird on that particular stretch.  In the first year they let off ten chicken hen pheasants and two cocks.  The following November 12 months I saw 50 birds taken off that stretch of territory. The expenditure was about £7 per year and whatever the cost of a dozen young birds would be.  Each of that dozen young birds was ringed with a number before being let off and, actually, of the first lot of colonists, only two of the total bagged were ringed birds.  The place was well preserved. The hawk and the weasel were kept out by the local farmers and their families being interested in the experiment.  The type of poacher that would shoot a young bird out of season <Col N="909" /> or shoot a bird on the nest was not let near the place.  Within two years that was in fact as valuable a pheasant shoot as could be found in the whole of Ireland.  At the time I speak of there was only one lot of young birds let out. There was no great expense incurred. There was the interest of the local people and just a tiny Christmas box to the agent here and the agent there to keep the poachers off.</P>
    <P>The suggestion in the motion is that the revenue derived from the £2 gun licence in each game district should be allocated towards the protection of game.  In the ordinary Departmental, mathematical way, people may sit down with pencils to work out that in such and such a county it only amounts to £40 and in another county it only amounts to so much.  That is not the way to look at it.  The way to look at it is, what it could amount to and what it would amount to if the game laws of this country were generally respected and adhered to.</P>
    <P>Many years ago when game existed and when there were big individuals here and there interested in the game of a county, there were game protection societies.  I do not know how many times, as a youth, I ran the gauntlet, afraid of being challenged for a licence, but certainly one would not go one mile of any public highway or convenient to any public highway without some authorised person coming along asking for your licence.  It is an unheard of thing in recent years, in fact I would be inclined to say in the lifetime of this State, for anybody carrying a gun to be asked to produce his game licence.  Everybody knows&mdash; and I am not saying it just to please the Minister opposite&mdash;that the Civic Guards in this country are overworked but you can carry a gun through any town or village in Ireland during the open season and not a man or woman will ask you to produce a game licence. If that particular bit of comparatively dead legislation were revived, and if farmers and others were interested in game protection, if hotel owners, publicans, shopkeepers, workers, as well as land holders, were educated into believing that game was a valuable asset in any district, valuable to the <Col N="910" /> hotel keeper and to everybody in the place, by attracting tourists, if that kind of education, through propaganda, were disseminated throughout the country, then the number of game licences in any particular district would be multiplied one hundred fold.</P>
    <P>There is a hotel that I used to stay at a number of years ago and to which I go occasionally now during the fishing season.  There are plenty of people there for the fishing season because the fishing is preserved and there is State interest in fishing.  Everybody has realised that fishing is a big national asset and a great attraction to the sporting visitor.  During the fishing season, that hotel is packed, mainly by people interested in fishing.  When I was a young doctor, just qualified, I spent a couple of holidays there.  At the time I was more interested in shooting.  During the shooting season you would have to book a room weeks in advance on account of the number of visitors there for the rough shooting. There has not been one feather of game seen there, I am sure, for the best part of 15 years.  I have not heard a shot fired after game for a considerable number of years.  Game has completely disappeared.  I was particularly interested in the suggestion of Deputy McMenamin with regard to inbreeding and the necessity for restocking, for the simple reason that I know that grouse, which I know far less about than pheasants or partridge, have disappeared over thousands of square miles of this country.</P>
    <P>The disappearance of grouse is certainly not due to poachers and only to a very tiny extent attributable to inroads made by vermin.  Grouse is far too alert and far too lively to be caught by the ordinary poacher.  I do not suppose there is any living man that could say with truth that he ever saw a sleeping grouse.  Any other form of game, partridge or pheasant, it is easy to walk up on resting in his sleep and is an easy target for anybody who is sufficiently unsporting to shoot him as a sitter on the ground.  It is rarely that chance will be given with grouse.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to convey to the appropriate Department, and I <Col N="911" /> think a number of Departments are concerned, the suggestions that have been made in the course of this debate. Everyone thinks his own suggestion is a sensible one.  There may have been a number of unwise suggestions made but there certainly have been a considerable number of sensible ones.  It is in the interests of the nation as a whole, not only from the point of view of tourists, but from the point of view of the denizens of this particular island, that any facilities we had in years gone by for our own entertainment, for our own benefit and for our own material welfare, should be preserved and retained as far as possible and revived, where simple measures and inexpensive steps are all that are required to revive them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in this motion from the point of view of seeing exactly what the movers of it are coming at.  In the first place, we are to restock with game.  Who is going to own the game?  We are told about the people who would gain&mdash;the local publican, the local hotel keeper, the gentleman in the city with too much money in his pocket who wants to go out for a day's sport.  We are told about all of those.  We are also told about the gentleman who is going to come in to buy a few of the clothing coupons that are scarce enough and to buy up the already dear clothing; of the people who will come in to eat some of the rations of the people that produce the rations, and all the rest of it.  What about all those?  We are not told what benefit this will give to the ordinary person in the country. Deputy O'Higgins told us about the farmer's son who will get £1 or £2 a year for watching his neighbours and keeping them off the track.  The ordinary farmer of this country has a 5/- licence so that he can shoot crows and thereby preserve enough wheat to keep the drones of this country fed during the winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea now seems to be that the farmer who takes out a 5/- licence will have a Civic Guard popping his head over the ditch in order to see if the farmer will be idiot enough to go outside his boundary, and if he does he <Col N="912" /> will be caught.  Who will own the game that will be preserved, and who will benefit from all this?  There are many coursing clubs established.  I happen to be a member of one.  They preserve hares and the farmers themselves have a little sport coursing.  The farmer's son goes out with a couple of greyhounds and enjoys himself.  But this is entirely different.  Nobody will pretend to me that pheasants live on air.  They will feed on the farmer's crops, but if the farmer's son happens to go outside the boundary of his father's land, there will be a Civic Guard waiting there to prosecute him; that is, if he can manage to remove himself from the local publichouse, where he is watching to see if an unfortunate man can be caught drinking a pint.</P>

      <P>The Deputy does not mention bread, which has been rationed for our people.  If you enter a Dublin hotel now you would think you were at the Tower of Babel.  There is room for everyone except a citizen of this country.  Of course, if you have not sufficient money you cannot go in there; indeed, you would need to be a millionaire.  I do not see how this proposal can benefit anybody.  There are some individuals who have plenty of money.  They can take out a £2 licence, hire a motor car on a Sunday and go out into the country shooting pheasants and other game.  One would not be surprised to see some of these gentlemen shooting a sitting hen or even tame ducks in the course of their travels.  They do not mind so long as they can go home with a full bag, wild or tame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see how any benefit will be conferred on the agricultural community who help to feed the pheasants and other game.  There may be something for the little boy or the scout who watches for the pheasants.  You will have every man watching his neighbour. I think the Minister for Finance could find some other use for public money besides spending it for the purpose of increasing the number of <Col N="913" /> pheasants and other game.  I heard Deputy O'Higgins mention that it might mean £1 a year to a farmer's son for watching his neighbour.  I cannot see who else will benefit by this thing.</P>
    <P>The tourist business is overdone in this country.  You have every half-starved foreigner chucking himself in here to fill his belly, and you have the workers of this country rationed in order that the visitors will have enough. It is about time somebody said that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the non-political matters that come before the Dáil and for that reason it might be possible to get general approval for what is suggested in the motion.  I think Deputies realise that this is a national problem.  There may be different views as to the desirability of encouraging tourists, but, assuming that we desire to maintain our tourist traffic, because of the people in the country who are engaged in the hotel business and who derive their livelihood from tourists, then we must see that unless the visitors get some form of amusement or sport they may decide to go elsewhere.  The tourists who have gone to places like Connemara, Mayo, Donegal and portions of Cork, will not go there again unless they have some sporting facilities.</P>
      <P>Leaving aside the question of tourists, there is a distinct advantage in preserving game and in endeavouring to make game available for farmers and others in different areas.  In many parts of the country gun clubs exist. The members of these clubs are drawn from all walks of life.  You have people from the local towns and villages combining with the farmers, over whose land they shoot.  In other years the landlords preserved the game.  Portions of their estates were protected so as to provide shooting facilities.  These facilities were usually restricted to the landlord and his friends.  Where gun clubs are established the members can now shoot over the lands formerly owned by the landlords.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The big estates were divided, but the division resulted, in many cases, in no protection being given to game.  Areas which formerly were preserved are now being cultivated.  While it is desirable <Col N="914" /> that these areas should be put to better use, I think if a determined effort were made by members of gun clubs, and they got assistance from the Gardaí, it would be possible to preserve them and so make available suitable ground for the preservation of different types of game.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin has described, in considerable detail, from his wide knowledge and experience, the requirements essential for the rearing of grouse and pheasants and other birds, together with the measures that should be taken to replenish stocks.  Assuming that an effort in that direction is desirable, and that Deputies are prepared to urge on the Minister and the Government the advisability of adopting some plan which will ensure that whatever facilities exist will be maintained and, if possible, improved, then I think the suggestion in the motion is a reasonably good one.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that it is not desirable to devote public money to purposes such as this and that the benefit to be derived, from the point of view of the people in general, would be limited. While that is so, the suggestion in the motion and the plan which is there put forward are, I think, reasonable because unless people, who take out £2 gun licences, are provided with some opportunities of game shooting, the number of such people will decrease.  The fact that people from cities and towns visit certain areas for shoots or that even local people go out shooting, means that extra money is circulated in one way or another in that area and the farmers and other people in the locality benefit as a result.  If the number of holders of £2 gun licences decreases, there will be a corresponding reduction in the amount of money in circulation in such areas.  I think that approximately £40,000 is available in revenue from that source each year and if the holders of these licences are provided with sufficient attractions in the way of game facilities in various localities, the sum derived from these licences can be devoted with beneficial effect towards defraying whatever cost may be involved in increased game preservation.</P>
    <P>I think it would not entail any considerable cost if, first of all, the gun <Col N="915" /> clubs are prepared to make an effort, but it must be a national effort because if the effort is confined to scattered localities, it will merely result in vermin going from one locality to another.  In fact in many places when scald-crows or foxes are disturbed, they migrate to other localities in which they are not subject to the same disturbance and where they can breed under more favourable conditions.</P>
    <P>First of all, I think the attempt at the extermination of vermin should be made during the breeding season. If, for instance, scald-crows are sufficiently disturbed during the laying season, they will have less chance of producing eggs.  Foxes also could be poisoned during the breeding season. One very successful method of dealing with foxes, on uplands at any rate&mdash; and the foxes to be found there are usually the most destructive type&mdash;is to inject or dose a dying sheep with strychnine.  Subsequently, when the sheep dies and the carcase gets into a state of putrefaction, the odour will attract foxes from a very wide radius, in fact from distances as far away as 15 or 20 miles.  I have known cases where very large numbers of foxes were destroyed in that way.  If the wind is sufficiently variable, it will veer round and the foxes from different localities will be attracted there.  There are numerous other methods but that is one way in which foxes could be destroyed.</P>
    <P>I think Deputies generally, but particularly those from the West and from Donegal, will realise that game is disappearing rapidly in certain areas.  Certainly, my experience visiting the West is that at present there is practically no game there.  It is as easy to preserve game as it is to preserve fish; in certain respects it is easier, and I think people in the country generally prefer shooting to fishing. Farmers and farmers' sons in many cases are given special facilities in gun clubs.  They are not called upon to subscribe as much as ordinary members because naturally if they allow shooting over their lands they are entitled to special consideration just as, in the case of hunts, farmers are called upon for a smaller subscription or in <Col N="916" /> many cases for no subscription because of the inconvenience which they suffer owing to the packs being allowed to hunt over their land.</P>
    <P>I think a national drive might be made through the gun clubs supported by the Gardaí in the various districts. The Gardaí, I imagine, would be prepared to give assistance voluntarily rather than by direction because in many parts of the country the Gardaí partake of any shooting available during the season.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that this is a problem which affects the Departments of three Ministers.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is interested from the point of view of the tourist traffic, the Minister for Lands is interested because of the damage occasioned by vermin to trees, and the Minister for Justice is interested from the point of view of the revenue derived from licences.  If these three Ministers would co-operate with local gun clubs, I think a determined drive could be made to eradicate vermin, but, as I have said before, it must be a national drive.  Local drives made in the past have merely resulted in transferring the problem from one part of the country to another.  Experience shows that when foxes, scald-crows, stoats or weasels are driven from one locality they multiply rapidly in another locality where they are not subjected to the same pressure.  The problem then presents itself anew for the people in that district.</P>
    <P>I think the House generally is in favour of some effort to preserve and improve whatever game facilities are available.  An abundance of game would benefit everyone in the locality where it exists.  The farmers would derive an income from the visitors who shoot over their land and the local shops and smaller hotels would also benefit financially.  This country in the past was famous for the sporting facilities which it afforded and I think every effort should be made to improve the present position.  It is, of course, questionable at the moment whether it is desirable to encourage tourists from abroad.  There are different views on that matter and it is quite reasonable that there should be but, leaving foreign tourists out of the question <Col N="917" /> altogether, I think it would be in the interests of the rural parts of the country to encourage people from the towns who are prepared to visit these areas to partake of the sporting facilities available there.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that a determined drive should be made to improve these facilities.  One result of this motion might be that the Minister and his colleagues who are directly concerned in this matter will co-operate with the local clubs in the preservation of game. If members of the Dáil who are interested are prepared to instruct localclubs&mdash;either gun dog associations or whatever other sporting associations are in existence in the various localities&mdash;to unite in a national drive and to co-operate with the authorities, then I think the facilities which are there can be exploited to the full and preserved for the benefit of the country generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold that, if the Minister takes a sympathetic view of the motion, he can improve very much what I regard as a very valuable national asset.  I was glad to observe from suggestions put forward that the motion has met with approval from practically every member who spoke, with the exception of Deputy Corry. Deputy McMenamin's suggestion about inbreeding doing a lot of damage must be very clear to even the youngest member of the House.  If something could be done along the lines suggested by Deputy McMenamin it would go a long way towards increasing grouse and pheasant, two classes of game that have practically disappeared from the countryside.  A sum of over £20,000 is collected each year in game licences.  I think that amount will decrease for the simple reason that the number of game licences taken out will correspond closely with the amount of game to be taken.  Only very few take out a game licence for the purpose of poaching or of slaughter for the pot, as we say.  If there was more game in the country more game licences would be taken out, and it is quite possible that this sum of £20,000 would soon double itself. If a small sum of money were given by the Minister for Finance on the lines suggested in the motion for <Col N="918" /> the protection of game it would, in my opinion, be money well spent.</P>
      <P>It would certainly result in increasing the amount of game.  The sum asked for is practically negligible, although, of course, Deputy Corry will tell us that it could be spent in other ways.  I wish very much that the Deputy would use half as much energy, as he used here to-night against this motion, with the Minister for Finance on the very important subject of drainage, because I do not believe he was sincere in what he said against the motion.  He is a very forceful speaker, but as I say I do not believe he was sincere to-night.  When speaking I noticed a merry twinkle in his eye which gave me to understand that he had not his heart in what he was saying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not hold with that.  I think it is a grand thing and a fine thing that to-day&mdash;and I am not the most ancient member of this House&mdash;we can see a farmer's son paying £2 for a game licence and going out to take game.  I saw the day, and so did Deputy Corry, when no farmer's son could do that&mdash;in the time when the landlords and others held this country.  That is not such a long time ago.  I can tell Deputy Corry that, if he comes down to the County Mayo, he will find plenty of small farmers' sons&mdash;some of them perhaps on the dole&mdash;who have taken out a game licence for the purpose of supplementing their income during the winter months when they cannot find employment. I know some neighbours of my own who, as a result of doing that, are able to go a long way towards keeping their wives and families in food.  The small farmer's son has just as much right to take out a £2 game licence to shoot game as the big man. I hold it is a grand thing that we see <Col N="919" /> the day in this country when the small farmer's son can do that, and not be overridden and terrified by the ascendancy class that we had here 25 or 30 years ago.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moran when speaking said that a lot of damage was done by the 5/- permit holder.  I do not agree with him.  In my opinion the 5/- permit holder is not such a good shot.  He certainly will not do near as much damage in the course of a year as a pair of scald-crows and some hawks will do within a period of 24 hours during the breeding season.  I might also say that foxes are doing very serious damage.  I think a very useful day's work would be done if all permits for game licences went hand in hand with the destruction of vermin. Scald-crows, hawks and foxes do a very considerable amount of damage to poultry and lambs.  Foxes play havoc with lambs.  Almost every county committee of agriculture in the country pays a premium for the head of a fox.  In my county we pay 7/6 for each fox that is killed because of the damage foxes do.  Scald-crows and hawks do great damage to poultry. They are a constant scourge.  If, as I say, the two things were taken hand in hand&mdash;permits for game licences and the destruction of vermin&mdash;it would be a very good thing.  A scheme of that sort would tend to increase game in the country and at the same time would do away with the vermin which is causing such extensive damage in the farmyards and fields of the farmers throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point.  It is a question which I would ask the Minister for Justice to take up with the Minister for Lands.  When the Land Commission acquires farms for subdivision it happens, in very many cases, that it retains the game rights over these lands.  In other cases it passes on the game rights to the previous owner of the land.  In the former case, I would ask the Minister for Justice to make representations to the Minister for Lands to give Irish nationals who take out a £2 game licence first preference when it is selling its shooting rights over the land it holds.  In the other case, where the original land <Col N="920" /> owner holds the game rights, the results are very damaging so far as the game on these lands is concerned.  I happen to know that from personal experience. What happens is that even if the tenants take out a game licence they have not the right to shoot game on the land.  The result is that the tenants and the previous owner of the land get so careless that the game on the land is allowed to be killed or slaughtered or destroyed.  They take no interest in the matter.</P>
    <P>As regards the first case, my suggestion is that the Land Commission should give first preference to Irish nationals for the shooting of the game over the land on which the Land Commission itself holds the game rights, and that in the second case the Land Commission should insist on taking over the game rights from the person from whom they acquire the land and do something to preserve the game on it.  The present position is that the former owner may be living out of this country and is doing nothing to preserve the game.  The game may be running over the land of the farmer occupiers and yet they find that even though they have taken out a £2 licence they have not the right to shoot it.  There is a great deal of carelessness caused in that way.  I hope that the Minister will be able to do something in regard to these matters.</P>

      <P>As the mover of the motion I am very glad to find that the Minister is sympathetic towards it.  I was also glad to find that the members of the House generally have given it their unstinted support with, of course, the one distinguished exception of Deputy Corry.  I would be rather disappointed if Deputy Corry endorsed anything that I proposed in the House.  The Minister has stated that he would like to get suggestions from interested parties throughout the country as to the best means of expending money on game protection and on the destruction of vermin, on the condition of our mountains and on all other details that pertain to effective game preservation throughout the country.  We have 57 game protection associations in the country which have been duly recognised by the <Col N="921" /> Minister for Justice.  I think that those associations would form a very useful medium for the expenditure of any money that may be voted by the Minister for Finance for the protection and preservation of game.  They contain a number of voluntary workers. They hold their meetings yearly, and make every effort to preserve game by employing gamekeepers.</P>
      <P>Efforts are being made to destroy vermin but, as Deputy Cosgrave said, these efforts are not always effective, because they are not carried out on a national scale.  I happen to be very familiar with the organising and conduct of game protection associations in my district in North Cork.  It is interesting to find that our association consists primarily of farmers' sons, agricultural workers and other people in the rural areas.  We have some 70 or 80 members and, when the 12th August comes along for grouse-shooting, they assemble at a particular place and are assigned their shooting area over the 25,000 acres of mountain we have preserved. We pay gamekeepers a nominal sum.  All the poorer members who live on the mountainside get some little remuneration out of our funds each year.  That small amount of remuneration is of help to people with low valuations, because it very often enables them to pay their rates on the mountain.  Each of them acts as a potential gamekeeper.  The more birds we find on the mountain, the more we pay the person concerned.  The great drawback under which we suffer is shortage of funds.  Since so large an income is derivable from the payment of the £2 licence fee, it would be but fair that an equitable portion of that money should be spent in helping those voluntary workers who are doing their best to preserve the game.</P>
      <P>As Deputy McMenamin wisely said, it would not be advisable to do anything that might lead to a lavish expenditure of money&mdash;public money, as some people call it.  Actually, it is not public money.  It is money handed in by the sportsmen themselves for the £2 licence.  It can only be described as &ldquo;public money&rdquo; because it goes, year after year, into the Treasury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that any help given to the <Col N="922" /> associations should be given on a contributory basis.  If each game protection association puts up a certain sum of money, the Department of Finance should contribute a sum proportionate to that.  If an association produces a certified account of their receipts, the Minister for Finance should, I think, contribute £2 for each £1 shown in those accounts.  There are already 57 associations and there is one national association throughout the country. There is an association in Munster in addition to several other local associations. I believe that any money given to those associations, which are controlled and directed by trustworthy sportsmen, would be well spent.  If each association of, say, 50 members could show that it had received in fees or contributions from members a sum of £50, then I think that the Government should come along and make a contribution of £100.  That would mean that there would be an expenditure of £150 per year in that area. That would be well-spent money, and it would be recouped, because the number of £2 licences would automatically increase.  No grant should be paid to any association which did not give some assurance that they were active and that they were prepared to spend the money wisely and well.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked members of the associations or members of the House to come together and put up practical suggestions.  If the Minister would decide on letting the associations have the sum of money I suggest on a contributory basis, it would, I think, meet the position for the present. I should like to tell those who spoke in pessimistic mood about the proposal that the amount of pleasure given to local people by these clubs during the winter months is enormous. That is a grand thing&mdash;and I speak from experience.  In my own locality, there were periods when neither farmers' sons nor workmen dared fire a shot.  The place was entirely preserved by the landlord class.  They have passed away and now the tenant farmers are the owners of the game.  This could be made a great source of wealth as well as a source of pleasure to our own people.  What is needed is that <Col N="923" /> the associations get the encouragement I suggest.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with the manner in which the Minister has met us.  I have been in constant communication with his Department for a number of years and I take this opportunity of testifying to the courtesy which I have always received and to the practical manner in which they have accepted suggestions from the organisations throughout the country.  If the Minister cannot see his way to agree to my suggestion, I and the other members who sponsored this motion would be very glad to form a committee of the House, or to act on committees appointed throughout the country, to place further suggestions before the Minister for his approval.  I think that we have done good work in helping to focus public attention on the potentialities of game protection associations, when properly organised, and in directing the attention of the Government to the possibilities of this sport, both from a national and international point of view, because it is bound to have an effect in attracting tourists to the country.  I should be very glad to meet the Minister later if he does not approve of the suggestion I made regarding grants on a contributory basis, and to discuss alternative schemes with him.  I want some earnest from the associations that they themselves will do something. I do not want money lavishly spent and I do not want any racket created by this proposal.  If associations do not give earnest of their desire to be useful in this regard, I should not be prepared to help them.  I wish, again, to thank the Minister for the sympathetic manner in which he received this motion.</P>

The Minister informs me&mdash;and he has authorised me to make the statement here in the House&mdash;that he is going forward as quickly as possible with the setting up of that tribunal. Some proposals are being made, and they will appear here in the immediate future in the form of a Bill for the setting up of a tribunal.  While that tribunal is being set up and is issuing its findings, some steps should be taken by the Government to ensure that the dairying industry would not be allowed to fall into a condition from which it would be very difficult to retrieve it later on.  I also wish, as a representative of the farmers, to urge their feelings and their wishes, that the price of wheat should be increased during the coming year, so as to encouage them to grow more wheat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Being of opinion that the provisions made for the payment of pensions to retired national school teachers have been totally inadequate, and that in existing circumstances, due to the substantial depreciation in the value of money, their present rate of pension is in most cases obviously insufficient to satisfy their reasonable needs, this House requests the Government to revise the scale of pensions with a view to making proper provision for the retired teachers.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this motion is to enlist the sympathy of the House and of the Minister for Education, who will be speaking on behalf of the Government, towards the reasonable claims of the retired national teachers, because of the services they have rendered to the nation, services which not only entitle them to sympathetic but indeed to generous consideration.  The Minister will probably contribute to this discussion the point of view that it is, if not impossible, at least not exactly easy, to segregate the claims of State pensioners as a whole and that it would not be within his province to deal with the question of retired teachers.  I suggest that, in the course of this debate, reasons will be adduced to convince him that these individuals can be placed in a special category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of pensions for all retired servants, I think it right that I should repeat a point of view I expressed last night, because of its importance. There is considerable surprise amongst the people as a whole, because of conditions which are known to everybody arising out of the cost of living, that the Government so far have taken no steps in regard to retired servants.  Apart from the necessity of doing that immediately, there is the desirability of doing it, if for no <Col N="927" /> other reason than that of removing the cynical belief now growing up that the aged people must be regarded in the future as scrap.  Public bodies and private employers are waiting for a lead from the Government on this particular issue, and I am satisfied that if that lead is given early, substantial benefit will flow to a large number of servants of public bodies and of private concerns.</P>
    <P>In this debate we will endeavour to show that the retired teachers come into a special category.  In the first place, it is well known that for a long number of years their salaries were so wretchedly low as to become a by-word in our history, so bad indeed that they evoked from a British Prime Minister on one occasion the statement that the salaries of Irish teachers were a disgrace to British administration.  I may say that that point of view was more or less subscribed to by members of this Government and of the past Government. The salaries, until comparatively recently, continued in that very low category, in varying degrees from 1922.  It follows that if salaries are low and if pensions are related to and based on low salaries, pensions must inevitably be low.</P>
    <P>We can understand what that would mean in normal times, but when low salaries producing low pensions are related to the position as we see it to-day, a position in which the cost of living has sky-rocketed to the extent of 70 per cent. above what it was in 1939, it is easy to get a picture of the domestic affairs of a large number of people who are now living on what may be described as low fixed incomes. That is one reason why the retired teacher differs in principle from the average State servant who has been retired, because, as I have said, he has enjoyed, if I may use the word, a consistently low salary for the greater portion of his service.</P>
    <P>There is the second reason that the teacher, while his salary is based on the same schedule as the civil servant, that is, an eightieth for each year of service, suffers the disability, as compared with the civil servant, that he is denied the retiring allowance or gratuity which flows to the civil servant <Col N="928" /> up to a maximum of a year and a half's salary.  The same disparity may be said to apply&mdash;and indeed in greater measure&mdash;to the servants of local authorities who receive, also on the basis of non-contributory pensions, two-thirds of their retiring salaries as also applies, I understand, to the Garda.  Here, therefore, in the case of teachers, we have definite and specific deviations from the ordinary code of State pensions, and I, therefore, suggest that, if the Minister uses the argument that they cannot be treated as a class apart, the House will agree with the contention I am making that there are substantial reasons why they can be dealt with now.</P>
    <P>As an instance of what the position is in regard to retired teachers, I have only to give the House the following table.  There are roughly 3,000 pensioned teachers, of whom 309 have pensions of £1 or less per week, 143 have pensions of between £1 and 30/-, 218 between 30/- and 40/-, 700 between 40/- and 50/-, 810 between 50/- and 60/- and 934 over 60/-.  In other words, of the total number, 2,180 have less than £3 a week, whereas the over-all average pension is £132 per annum, or, in round figures, 50/- per week, which may very well be split in two in order to get the purchasing value of that amount at present.  Taking the case of Northern Ireland pensions&mdash;and I think there will be no disagreement with an analogy of that kind being made&mdash;we find the approach to this question along these lines.  In November last, in the Northern House of Commons, the Minister of Finance, Major Sinclair, dealing with the question, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I should like to point out that there is no obligation on the Government to do anything at all in this direction because in fixing pension rates, no matter what time they are fixed, no consideration is given to the future trend of the cost of living or whether it will go up or whether it will come down.  I might cite an example.  Supposing one takes out an insurance policy, and that is what a contributory pension is, to have paid to one the sum of £100 a year when one retires at the age of <Col N="929" /> 50, would any insurance company entertain a plea that owing to the higher cost of living, they should now pay £130?  No insurance company would consider that for a moment and, strictly speaking, there is no reason why the Government should.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary for me to say that there is no relation between an insurance premium and a pension granted by the State.  One pays an insurance premium for a particular purpose to an insurance company as against a pensioner who has given service to the State and with whom it may be said that the State has entered into certain contractual obligations.</P>
    <P>But, having said that, the Finance Minister in the Northern House of Commons went on to indicate that, notwithstanding his view, as expressed in the quotation I have given, the retired teachers in the North of Ireland were about to benefit in a substantial way. They have done so to this extent, that bonuses have been granted of 30 per cent. to those with less than £100 a year, of 25 per cent. to those with less than £200 per year and 20 per cent. to those with less than £300 per year.  In addition, and it is rather important and, indeed, remarkable, having regard to the previous statement of Major Sinclair, the Northern Government found it possible also to give retiring gratuities to those actually on pension.  That is the position of teachers in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention now to another disability from which our teachers here have suffered as a result of an administrative act on the part of the Department of Education.  In 1938 without due warning, so far as I know, the Department decided to retire compulsorily a number of lady teachers, to the number of about 600 and representing approximately one-fifth of the entire number now on pension, at the age of 60, notwithstanding the fact that they had enjoyed, if not a prescriptive right, a privilege covering a period of some 30 odd years of continuing to teacn until they reached the age of 65. These teachers were swept out of the profession at a time when, I suggest to the Minister, their domestic commitments <Col N="930" /> were probably at their peak.  From our own personal experience, we can understand that a lady teacher might have children just about to be educated or might be supporting some elderly member of her family, and, in a number of ways of that kind, it will be agreed that round and about that age is a time of domestic anxiety for a number of people.</P>
    <P>I suggest that these lady teachers, to the number of 600 odd, have suffered a grave injustice.  They have suffered by reason of the fact that they were not alone deprived of enjoying their full pension rights at the age of 65, but in respect of the interim period between 60 and 65&mdash;it might be that some of them were going out at 62&mdash;they lost the salary they would have enjoyed in those years.  As indicating that the hardship of that particular state of affairs was apparently realised, the Department subsequently revoked that Order and I understand that lady teachers now can continue teaching until the age of 65.</P>
    <P>I have tried to indicate that the teacher is in a distinct category from other State pensioners.  I want to add this further point as weighting their credit balance on this particular claim, that in 1934 the teachers' pension fund was taken over by the Government.  I am not going into the question&mdash;it may be controversial&mdash;as to whether or not since 1934 there has actually been a contribution, either direct or indirect, so far as pension is concerned.  But the general belief is that following 1934, because of a certain scaling down of salaries&mdash; 9 per cent.  I think it was&mdash;at the time, that within that scaling down of 9 per cent., 4 per cent. was to be debited against teachers' pensions.</P>
    <P>In any case, this emerges from the taking over of the pension fund by the Government at that time, that as a result of the capital moneys provided by the teachers in the teachers' fund and the capital moneys available from what is known as the Church Temporalities Fund, the Government has had, since 1934, an annual contribution from both funds amounting to £83,000 a year.  That sum, since 1934, in other words multiplied by 12, gives a very nice figure indeed, and at least a good <Col N="931" /> proportion of it, not all, must be credited to the people now out on pension.</P>
    <P>I have indicated that the retired teacher is in a class apart from the ordinary civil servant for special consideration, because, in the first place, of the admittedly low salaries down the years; in the second place, because there is a disparity so far as their retiring allowance is concerned&mdash;in fact, they get no retiring allowance; thirdly, because of the hardship owing to the sudden decision in 1938 to deprive lady teachers of their teaching rights up to 65 years of age; and, finally, the contribution to which I have referred made out of funds which were available because of the efforts, at least in part, of the teachers themselves.</P>
    <P>I put it to the House and to the Minister that poverty at any time must inevitably bring hardship in its wake, but, obviously, poverty can be aggravated to a very serious degree when you have coupled with it the refinement of education. That is the position to which upwards of 3,000 of our highly cultured citizens have been reduced.  I am afraid that it is rather an indict ment of our concept of education and educational matters that individuals who are highly trained for educational purposes should now find themselves in the evening of their lives in a condition of distress.  I have here a number of authenticated details of individual members of the teaching profession who have been retired which would leave this House under no illusion as to what these people are suffering.  I have considered whether or not I should give these details and I have decided that it would not be wise to do so, because it is possible that some of the individuals might be identified, at least by their friends, as being in a state of poverty at present and it might hurt their feelings.</P>
    <P>I ask for sympathetic consideration for a very deserving class of the community who have rendered service down the years, not the least of which &mdash;and the Minister may be interested in this&mdash;was the personal sacrifice in time and money which they made when advanced in years to learn the Irish <Col N="932" /> language and to equip themselves to such a degree that they would be in a position to impart it to their students. These people are now thrown on the scrap heap.  I could not describe them as dissatisfied.  They are perhaps cynical.  Nevertheless, they are prepared to thrust their cynicism aside on this occasion, to which they are looking forward with interest.  They feel that their services will not have been forgotten, that their present position will be understood and appraised, and that it may be possible for this House, as a result of this motion, to bring them a speedy amelioration of their conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion appeals to me very strongly and I wish to say what is in my power in advocacy of its acceptance by the Minister.  Like every other Deputy, I know a certain number of these retired teachers in the country.  From my knowledge of their conditions, I would advocate the acceptance by the Minister of the proposal that their allowance should be increased, because I know that in many cases their means of living is much below what the ordinary person would require.  I suggest to the Minister that the duty of a Government in any State, particularly in this State of ours, which is a Christian State, is to provide for the needs of each family.  It is the duty of the Government to provide for these retired teachers so as to enable them to live in a fairly decent standard of comfort such as they had during their period of activity.</P>
      <P>I would be sorry to think that any Government here would respond to an appeal for the improvement of the condition of people who reached the retiring age in the service of the State less actively than they would to the claims of those actively engaged in occupations. Should that position arise, then we must come to the conclusion that it is only the mailed fist which is able to enforce a right to a living wage.  In this proposal for an increased allowance for retired teachers there is no threat of a strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people concerned are not organised and, even if they were organised, <Col N="933" /> their numbers are too small to affect public opinion.  By reason of their age they have not the energy to command and enlist public sympathy on their behalf.  They are retired servants, living in retirement, awaiting the final retirement from this life. One's age is a matter outside one's control. Recently, the Minister accepted the responsibility of increasing the salaries of those actively engaged in teaching.  He did that because representations were made to him which convinced him that these teachers were not paid salaries in conformity with the present cost of living or that would bear comparison with salaries paid for similar service in neighbouring countries. Therefore, the Minister accepted that the teachers were entitled to a higher salary.  If those teachers who retired prior to last year had the regulating of their age, they would naturally arrange to be five or ten years younger so that they would benefit from the increases in salaries granted some months ago.  I submit that the Minister should not wait until conditions compel the Government to act. There is a standard of justice which a Government is bound to observe, and that is, that the minimum allowance of pension or salary should be such as to enable the individual concerned to live and to maintain his family.</P>
    <P>I have always maintained that teachers are a class unto themselves. A certain amount of sacrifice is expected of teachers and without sacrifice on their part our system of education must be a failure.  A teacher to be successful in his profession must devote more of his time to his profession than is required of persons in any other walk of life.  Any of us who has a business may neglect it and will feel the consequences of that in reduced income but that is our own personal affair.  It may lead to the loss of our business but that is our own affair.  If, however, a teacher does not bestow constant attention all through the day on every day of the week, he may personally suffer financially in reduced emoluments, salary or pension, but the real sufferers are his pupils.  To ensure that teachers will give the best possible service they should be put in a position <Col N="934" /> which will enable them to give undivided attention to their work without financial worry.  The teacher's financial security in latter years should be ensured.  If it is found that the reward of teachers who gave service faithfully and well and who devoted all their energy to the teaching of the young is to live in semi-poverty in their latter years, how will we find new recruits to take up this great national work?</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning that I advocate improved pensions to ex-teachers because I know some of them and I know the conditions under which they live.  I say to the Government that, if they have respect, as I am sure they have, for the well-being and the education of our children, it is their duty to ensure that those who gave service in the teaching profession and worked to the utmost of their capacity in training the children under their charge, should not have to live in penury at the end of their days.  I am sure the Minister realises that probably better than I do.  He was engaged in the profession for a time and has been in closer contact with them than I have been.  I am speaking as a layman.  I am speaking, not as a member of the Party that raised this issue, but as an independent Deputy.</P>
    <P>I realise that the Government have had to face the problem of increased salaries and increased wages so often that they may be inclined to say: &ldquo;We have to set our face against all these applications.  Whether there is merit in them or no merit in them, the financial resources of the State will not bear such increased salaries and wages. Where is the money to come from?&rdquo; In the case of applications for increased wages for agricultural and industrial workers and others, viewing them from any reasonable point of view, we have had to admit time and again that, having regard to the cost of living now as compared with the pre-emergency period, there was fair justification for an increase.  At the same time I have always felt that in giving such increases we should say to those engaged in the work: &ldquo;We require an increase in production and that will balance the budget.&rdquo;  I realise fully that the Government are up against the position <Col N="935" /> that if they accede to every request, however reasonable, for increased wages, without there being increased production on the part of those in receipt of the wages, the position will inevitably deteriorate.</P>
    <P>In the case of teachers, where is the standard?  We gave increases to active teachers a few months ago.  Did we demand of them that they would teach more pupils than they had been teaching? Did we say to them that they would work longer hours?  Did we demand anything in return for that increase? No.  We gave them the increase because, on the figures and facts submitted, the Government were satisfied that the teachers were entitled to that increase.  If that be so in the case of acting teachers, let us, in Heaven's name, not do less by those who are now old and less capable of demanding their rights.</P>

      <P>I do not think it should call for many words of mine to commend this motion to the sympathetic consideration of the House and of the Minister.  It is well worth my while to read the motion:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Being of opinion that the provisions made for the payment of pensions to retired national teachers have been totally inadequate, and that in existing circumstances, due to the substantial depreciation in the value of money, their present rate of pension is in most cases obviously insufficient to satisfy their reasonable needs, this House requests the Government to revise the scale of pensions with a view to making proper provision for the retired teachers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think the moderation of the language in that motion has only been equalled by the moderation and the modesty of the case that was presented by Deputy O'Sullivan.  It was the mildest appeal that could be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it should be necessary for any Party to table a motion of this kind.  With the Deputy who has preceded me, I think the Government ought to have seen the justice of this case without waiting to be pushed from any side of the House.  As Deputy Maguire mentioned, there is a certain responsibility on the Government <Col N="936" /> and it should not be necessary to urge them to note the justice of this claim. They have been elected by the people of this country and they are working under a Constitution of which they are proud and of which they boast because of its Christian qualities.  If we do not live up to that Constitution, I feel we could be justly accused of hypocrisy. I do not want to use strong language, but if we allow certain sections of our community to live under such conditions as they are living under, we certainly risk the charge of hypocrisy if we shelter behind our Christian Constitution.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest they form the only deserving section, but I do say that the retired national school teachers are, comparatively, the most deserving.  I have had occasion to talk on behalf of other deserving sections of our citizens, to whom I cannot refer to-night except in passing.  I mean the old age pensioners, the blind and the widows and orphans.  If the Government do not see their way to increase the miserable stipend on which those unfortunate people are living, I cannot see very much hope for the teachers. Those teachers who have been spoken of by Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Maguire are in a class peculiar to themselves.</P>
    <P>They have contributed to their pensions; unlike civil servants and most other people, they have contributed generously to their pension fund.  I am glad the Minister is taking notes. We will go back to the time the Minister was responsible for the robbing of the Teachers' Pensions Fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister challenges my strong words.  At the time I speak of there was a pension fund supposed to be subscribed to by two parties, the Government and the teachers.  At that time we found that the Government side was empty, while the teachers' side had been fully subscribed; they had paid their contributions regularly and fairly.  I am not quite sure about the figure, but there was approximately £1,250,000 and that money was taken by the Government and put into their pockets.  They said to the teachers: &ldquo;We will give you a guaranteed pension and from this on you will be perfectly safe.&rdquo;  But they increased the contribution of the teachers from that date for another three or four years from 4 per cent. or 5 per cent.  to 9 per cent.  I say that that money was robbed from the teachers, and no other word will describe it.  Surely, it is parliamentary to express the truth?</P>
      <P>We are dealing with a class of people who have given great service in the education of our youth.  They put their money into a pension fund in order to make provision for the rainy day.  They have been shabbily treated by our native Governments since 1922.  The story might be too long to tell, but I am competent to do it, if necessary.</P>
      <P>Each of our Governments defrauded the teachers, the previous Government and this Government.  When the scales were fixed originally, they were put at less than the maximum because of an alleged drop in the cost of living.  The teachers suffered cut after cut, four in all, and then at the time I speak of, when the present Minister was dealing with the matter, a supreme effort was made to defraud the teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, we will deal with the men who have gone out of service, but who were then working and contributing to their pensions.  What do we find?  When they retired before the war, can it be <Col N="938" /> said that they got a reasonable pension? I do not think anybody can say that they did.  Even the Minister would not say it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever they got pre-war its value was X.  What is the value to-day?  Will the Minister say that the pensions that were worth a certain figure in 1938-39 have the same value to-day?  As regards the policy of the Government, its fallacy has been clearly demonstrated.  They introduced the standstill Order on wages and salaries and in that way they hit the wage earners.  They said: &ldquo;We cannot allow the working classes to have a privileged position, to have an unfair purchasing power on a declining market of commodities.&rdquo;  Those were the words of the Taoiseach.  The trade unions have now restored to them their right of action and they are functioning in a normal way.  They are not getting the step-by-step increases that they should have got; they are getting jumped increases.  The people who are not organised are still going to &ldquo;get the works&rdquo; from the Government.  The pensioned teachers are not going to get justice from the Government because they cannot fight for it.  If the blind and the aged and the widows are not getting justice, those others cannot hope for mercy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry I cannot adopt the moderate tone of Deputy O'Sullivan. These teachers have been suffering for a very long time.  The Minister knows that even in his own constituency there are many of them living under the poverty line.  They are people who have held their heads high.  They have given great service to the State teaching our children, bringing them to the standard they have reached to-day. The Gaelic revival movement, the Gaelic Athletic Association, and every movement worth talking about was contributed to by those teachers, who are living on such a low level at the present time.  Their scales are less than the board of health allowances and are scarcely sufficient to keep them from hunger and misery.  I feel indignant that the Government have <Col N="939" /> allowed the situation to go so far.  It is the Government's job to treat these people justly.  They should have attended to it before now and I ask them to do something without any further delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to those of other Deputies who have spoken on behalf of the pensioned teachers.  The salary of teachers for generations has been totally inadequate. I have not neglected any opportunity I ever got in this House of making a case for increased salaries for teachers but, however much sympathy I had for the teachers in service, I have more sympathy for those fine men and women who, now in their old age, are trying to live on an income that is totally inadequate at the present time.  A great many of those teachers taught during the best years of their lives for a miserable pittance. They had no opportunity during all those years of putting by anything for their old age.  I think it was the very exceptional teacher who even owned the house in which he lived at the time of retirement.  When these men were preparing for the profession, there were no opportunities of secondary and vocational education available such as there are at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Virtually the only outlet for the poor man's child who had exceptional brains was the teaching profession.  No education but that afforded in the primary schools was open to the great body of them.  They were scattered all over the country where no educational facilities other than those provided by the primary school existed.  What happened was that in these schools the ablest boys and the ablest girls were picked out and made monitors and monitresses.  They could follow then for a period of five years a course of instruction which prepared them for the training college.  They could not prepare for the professions, they could not even grind for the Civil Service but, having brains, they did the one thing that was open to them&mdash;they entered the teaching profession.  That is an explanation of why amongst these old pensioned teachers to-day we have some of the ablest men and women <Col N="940" /> in the country who, if they had the opportunity in their youth, would be occupying very different positions and a very different place in society at the present time.</P>
    <P>I often compare these men with men of similar or even inferior ability who were in the service of the Corporation of Dublin.  Most of the latter had the advantage of a cheap, secondary education. They had, as it were, an outlet into another channel and did not take up the teaching profession but after a much shorter service, very often to my knowledge, many of these men retired from the service of the corporation on a pension very much higher than the maximum awarded to teachers.  I mention that point only for this reason, that these men, conscious of their own ability and their claim on society, naturally feel more keenly than other classes the injustice under which they are suffering.  At the best, they did not reach a very big salary.  They reached only what we considered a very moderate, if not a very poor, salary and when it came to the time of retirement they had to go out on half of that salary.  That half, in the case of the large majority of these people, has not now the purchasing power of one-fourth of the small salary which they were receiving at the time of their retirement.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to give the most generous consideration to these very fine men and women who have not before them many more years of pilgrimage.  It would not represent a very great cost to the Government.  I am a member of the Government Party and I have an appreciation and an understanding of their difficulties but I do not think that it could be argued that it is reasonable to keep these men where they are in point of pension simply because you would have to increase the allowances of other pensioned people throughout the country. That argument might be valid if they were all on equal terms but I think that the pensioned teachers, in view of the service they have given, in view of their general ability and in view of their needs, are more deserving of consideration at this time than any other class.  I say that because members of this Party are not tongue-tied in expressing <Col N="941" /> their opinions.  Of course we are members of a Party and we must act with that Party in the matter of divisions.</P>

I would appeal to the Minister that at least the lowest paid pensioners should get some increase. I have listened to Deputy O'Sullivan reading out the rates which these people are receiving and I would say <Col N="942" /> that at least the lowest paid teachers, those trying to exist on £1 a week, are entitled to a substantial increase.  I saw a question in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> recently from a man who asked if the value of the £1 was now 10/11, what would one get for 10/-.  I should like to see that question answered next Sunday.  There is no doubt that the teachers do deserve some compensation for their years of service to the State. I was surprised yesterday to hear the Minister state that he was granting bonuses to teachers who remained at work and tried to break the national teachers' strike.  I then asked him would he apply that bonus to the religious orders of this country who stayed at their posts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle gave me permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of the scarcity of fuel in the City of Dublin.  I had given notice to raise also the question of the scarcity of milk, but that would have meant the attendance of two Minister during the short time available for this discussion.  I <Col N="943" /> hope on another occasion to raise the question of the seriousness of the scarcity of milk in the city and its effects on the children of Dublin.  Today and for the past couple of weeks we have all noticed the serious shortage of fuel of all kinds not only in this city but in the country.  I am anxious to know what is the cause of the great scarcity of reasonably dry turf for our people, especially those living in tenements and cottages who have no other fuel for heating or cooking.  As a member of the School Meals Committee, I visit some of our schools and see the fires in them completely black out.  I see the want of fuel there for the children who are able to attend.  The attendance at the schools has gone down considerably because of the terrifically cold weather that we are having.</P>
      <P>There is also a scarcity of milk.  Today there was neither fuel nor milk in some of the city schools.  Will the Minister say whether that is due to scarcity of transport?  If so, why is it that some of the hundreds of Army lorries in the Dublin barracks that are ready to go out at a moment's notice are not put at the disposal of those seeking transport to remove turf from the country districts to the city?  If there is a scarcity of turf I want to know from him why he is not ordering the turf dumps in Dublin to be opened up.  I know they were to be kept for the emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Well, there is an emergency here today. Children and invalids are suffering great hardship, and even people with money, who could pay for a half ton or a ton of turf, are without heating facilities and their children and families are also suffering.  My principal reason for drawing attention to this is because of the numerous complaints I got yesterday and the day before from the added areas in the City of Dublin.  I refer to Cabra and Cabra West, Crumlin, Larkhill and Kimmage.  Yesterday and the day before the depôts in those areas, which supply fuel to the people in two-stone and four-stone lots, did not get supplies until late in the day.  I saw women who should be in maternity homes hoisting, in some cases two-stone and <Col N="944" /> in other cases four-stone, lots of turf on their backs to bring home.  They had been waiting in a queue for two, three and four hours.  Yesterday in Cabra West they had to wait for over four hours.  I know the Minister is sympathetic and I know the Government's attitude.  I know of their determination to remedy these evils, but I greatly fear that their attention may not have been drawn to them.  I am now drawing the Minister's attention to what is going on in and around the city, and in the every heart of the city. You have people in the tenement quarters and in cottages carrying home the turf on their shoulders in two-stone and in four-stone lots.  I also saw children of six, eight and ten years of age dragging home sacks of wet turf.</P>
    <P>I attended the fuel depôts and saw what was going on.  The authorities in charge of them are, apparently, doing everything possible.  Every time a lorry of wet turf arrives at a depot it is there only a couple of hours until it is all drawn away by the people I have referred to.  I have seen them take it away in perambulators and, in some cases, in baths.  I do not mean that in a jocular way.  The baths were brought there in order to carry the turf home, and not because it was so wet.  Someone who wanted to make a joke might say that it should be sold in gallon lots at a time.  The fact that the turf is wet is not due to the fuel authorities but rather to the very bad weather that we have had.  More strenuous efforts, I think, ought to be made to bring as much dry turf as possible to the city.  Since I do not know what the regulations are I am not suggesting what services should be curtailed.</P>
    <P>Nearly all the tenements dwellers in the city have penny-in-the-slot gas meters for cooking purposes.  There is the danger that gas may not be available in a very short time.  When on a previous occasion I suggested that the Minister himself should go to the other side I was sorry that he took offence at what I said.  I think he could do splendid work if, as a Minister of this State, he went across to the other side to see if our friends there could supply us with goods in exchange for what we are giving them.  We are giving them <Col N="945" /> butter, eggs, Guinness and beef.  I think, because of the services that we are rendering to them, that he might be in a position to ask them to give us a few extra boat loads of coal for our gas service so that those of our people who are entirely dependent on the gas-ring and the penny-in-the-slot would not have to bear any greater hardship than they are bearing at the moment with the small quantity of gas they are getting for cooking purposes.  Yesterday, I saw a woman crossing the street from a house&mdash;I could give the name and address if required&mdash;to another house to use the gas-ring there.  She was dependent on turf and she was getting facilities from another occupant of the tenement dwellings who had a gas-ring.  That shows a very kindly spirit and one which is creditable to all parties concerned.  I am not raising this matter in any complaining or bitter way against the Government or the Minister.  I know of his anxiety in the matter but there is a terrible scarcity of fuel.  There is very grave hardship to people who have no blankets and little or no clothing.  They have to depend on a couple of stones of turf and, now, they are not getting it.  I appeal to the Minister to see that they are not asked to bear further hardship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the uncertainty of the position in England, I think that it is too early to expect the Minister to make a statement on the general prospects here.  However, I suggest to him that the House and the country are entitled to know at the earliest possible moment the prospects of importing further supplies of coal. Due to the appallingly bad season and to the very severe winter, the turf available is in many cases of bad quality.  But the Minister should endeavour to see that distribution is effective. In many parts of the city and, more particularly, of the county, distribution is, according to my information, ineffective.  In the city, there are numerous turf merchants and if the supplies of one turf merchant are not, for some reason, adequate, he can have his quota taken over by somebody else and distributed.  In the villages in County Dublin and in certain other parts of the country, there is, in many <Col N="946" /> cases, only one fuel merchant.  If that merchant goes out of business, or if, for some reason, he does not get his supplies of turf, the village is left without fuel.  I have a particular case in mind and I understand that, in other places, the position is not satisfactory. In the case of which I am thinking, there was one merchants in the village and another in an adjoining village.  One of these merchants went out of business owing to illness and the other has ceased to take his quota of turf.  The main problem in these cases is one of distribution.</P>
      <P>While it may not be possible, until the 1947 crop is available, to increase supplies, the Minister should consider consultation with the Department of Defence and the Department of Lands and Forestry as to the possibility of securing supplies of suitable timber.  I realise, of course, that timber suitable for other purposes must be conserved. I appreciate that it may be equally necessary to reserve timber suitable for building but I suggest to the Minister that there are, in parts of the country, adequate supplies of timber suited to domestic fuel purposes.  Until there is some prospect of increased supplies of coal or until the 1947 turf crop is available, the Government should consider the possibility of procuring suitable timber supplies.  Permits should be given for the cutting of suitable trees on condition that there is replacement of the trees.</P>
      <P>In many parts of the country, the only obstacle to obtaining suitable supplies of timber is the Department of Defence regulation regarding the cutting of trees.  According to my information&mdash;I have had some complaints &mdash;it is quite difficult to secure a permit to cut timber.  To bridge the gap between now and the time when supplies of turf or some other fuel will be available, the Minister should make representations to the Department of Defence to relax, at least, the prohibition on timber felling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In certain parts of the city some people have sufficient quantities of turf and timber but, in other parts, they have neither one nor the other, while the restriction on the use of electricity prevents them from using <Col N="947" /> current for the purpose of domestic heating.  Consideration should be given to the possibility of relaxing the restriction in those areas, which are, in the main, working-class areas.  In some of these areas, the Electricity Supply Board do their own rationing, due to the fact that it is difficult to cut off one consumer without cutting off the others.  Until some other means of heating is available, consideration should be given to the possibility of allowing electric current to be used for that purpose on the ground that, while these people have neither turf nor timber, others have both.  Many of the persons to whom I refer are labouring under great hardships.  The Minister is aware of that.  I suggest to him that one of the problems in the immediate future will be to distribute the turf and timber which is in the dumps or in stock.  The Minister should at first opportunity inform the House of the prospects of obtaining additional fuel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to learn from the Minister whether he is satisfied with the machinery at the disposal of his Department for advising him as to the fuel requirements not only of Dublin City but of other parts of the country.  What kind of machinery is at the disposal of the Minister for that purpose?  There is a shortage of turf not only in the city but in the turf areas which would normally supply the city.  In three of the larger towns in my constituency&mdash;towns surrounded by the biggest bogs in the Midlands, including Clonsast bog&mdash;there was a definite shortage of fuel last week so far as the poorer classes were concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was assured by the Minister some time ago that he was taking steps to relieve the position in one town.  I am told that satisfactory steps have not been taken in that regard.  If turf cannot be got in sufficient quantities for those who require it in the City of Dublin or elsewhere, there should, surely, be some way of getting timber. If the Minister were to make an appeal to the landowners and, particularly, to the Department of Lands and Forestry, some relief might be obtained in that regard.  There is too <Col N="948" /> much red tape surrounding the official attitude of the Department of Forestry in regard to issuing permits for the cutting of timber.  In emergency conditions like the present, these red tape regulations should be removed.  I hope the Minister will use his influence with the Department concerned for that particular purpose.  There is plenty of timber in the rural areas suitable for firewood and if turf cannot be got &mdash;and I realise that a sufficient quantity of the proper type of turf cannot be got&mdash;the Minister should fall back on the substitute, namely, timber.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous for Deputy Byrne to suggest at this particular period that the Minister should cross over in an aeroplane, if available, to ask the Minister for Fuel and Power in London to give us more coal.  If they have not sufficient coal for themselves, I do not suppose that we can force them to give us some.  It appears to me that coal will not be available for domestic purposes for some considerable time.  I laughed a few nights ago when, from the top of a tram going to Dalkey, I read an illuminated advertisement in Westmoreland Street appealing to people to buy So-and-So's coal for domestic use.  It was a brilliant electric advertisement&mdash;I will not mention the name&mdash;and I think that kind of thing should be cut out in present circumstances.  It would not appeal to the imagination of Deputy Byrne's friends, who cannot get coal, turf, or timber.</P>

      <P>Deputies must not discuss this fuel position as if it were an administrative problem which could be put right by giving the right orders to somebody.  We have here to deal with facts and the first fact.  I want the House to appreciate is that, if unfavourable weather conditions continue, we are facing, not merely in Dublin but over a great part of the country, a first-class crisis so far as domestic fuel supplies are concerned.</P>

      <P>On the contrary, I have made statements to similar effect on many occasions recently, in this Dáil <Col N="949" /> and outside it.  The position is that, so far as the eastern non-turf area is concerned, the total supplies of fuel in the dumps are barely sufficient to maintain the ration for the present rationing period, including all the turf in the dumps, good, bad and indifferent. Most Deputies will understand that it is not possible to work down to bare boards in distributing supplies of that nature and that inevitably, if the weather remains as it is, before the end of the ration period there will be portions of the area in which supplies will not be available at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that the problem we are facing as regards fuel supplies in Dublin and elsewhere is entirely due to the weather conditions.  Deputies may not like to face realities, but they must do so if they want to understand this situation. The total quantity of turf produced for the national pool last year by the various concerns producing for that pool&mdash;the county councils, Bord na Móna and private producers&mdash;was as large as in any previous year.  In fact, it was somewhat larger, but because of the abnormal weather which was experienced last autumn, 100,000 tons of turf produced for the turf dumps could not be taken from the bogs and transported to the dumps.  It was reasonable to assume last September and October, during the downpour, that a period of dry weather would follow in which that position could be remedied; but, as everybody now knows, there was no break in the bad weather, and during the past month we have had conditions which are entirely abnormal to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were some reserve stocks in the turf dumps carried over from the previous year's crop and it is those stocks which are now being utilised, but they are being very rapidly exhausted. Under the best conditions that we can conceive&mdash;and I am referring now mainly to weather conditions &mdash;the most that we can hope to do is to carry on the bare minimum of the ordinary ration in the non-turf area until the new crop becomes available without any reserve to carry forward into <Col N="950" /> the next year.  Under unfavourable conditions, we will have to face a reduction of the ration.  Under the worst conditions, there will be no fuel and there is nothing we can do about it.</P>
    <P>I am told to cut timber.  I do not believe that the quantity of firewood timber available in the vicinity of Dublin is large.  During the emergency it was practically all utilised and, although every facility has been given to fuel merchants and other persons who might be interested in that business to acquire and transport that timber for sale here, the quantity coming in has fallen to practically negligible dimensions during the past year.</P>
    <P>Deputies have made remarks about the quality of the turf.  That is determined largely by weather conditions. The turf in the dumps suffered very severely because of the abnormal weather during the past month.  There is no use in complaining about the quality.  There can be no improvement in quality unless we get an improvement in the weather.  Even a comparatively short spell of dry weather would mean a substantial improvement in the quality of the turf coming from the dumps.  We would require a longer, more protracted period of dry weather before the 100,000 tons in the bogs could be properly conditioned and transported to the non-turf area.  All the supplies under the control of Bord na Móna which were in any condition for use and accessible for transportation have been brought into Dublin in the past week.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne spoke about the fuel depots.  My remarks concerning the availability of supplies and the quality of turf referred to turf sold in the ordinary way on the ration.  As regards the turf which is distributed under the free fuel scheme and the cheap fuel scheme, these supplies are safe and will continue to be available.  The turf supplied under these schemes is machine-won turf from the mechanised bogs of Bord na Móna and is of good quality.  There is no reasonable ground for complaint concerning that turf.</P>
    <P>There are special difficulties affecting distribution which also must be noted. <Col N="951" /> First of all, the demand for turf in Dublin and throughout the eastern area has gone up extraordinarily this winter.  In each month of this winter, it was 50 per cent. higher than in the same month of the previous year.  There are, perhaps, a number of reasons for that increase of demand.  There was the abnormally harsh wet weather experienced, which made people draw their full ration who might not otherwise have done so.  There was the exhaustion of reserves of other fuels that might have been held and the depleted inflow of firewood.  There was also the fact that many Dublin families, the members of which worked all the summer to cut turf for themselves, in the Dublin mountain area, were unable to save it and had to fall back on the ordinary ration.  There is also, as the recent census shows, a substantial rise in population in this part of Ireland. During recent weeks, distribution has been disorganised, mainly as everybody knows on account of the abnormal snowfalls and the icy conditions of the streets which slowed down distribution.</P>
    <P>There is another reason, however, why the distribution is slow and difficult at the present time.  Ordinarily, the extraction of turf from the turf dumps in the Phoenix Park could be facilitated by having a large number of loading points situated a considerable distance apart in the large ricks.</P>
    <P>With the contraction of the total supply in the dumps, the area in which that supply is located has also contracted, and consequently only a smaller number of loading points can be operated and the lorries and carts drawing turf have to queue up for supplies.  That physical difficulty is slowing down delivery and it is unavoidable until fresh supplies of turf in usable condition begin to flow in from the country areas.  The position, therefore, is this that, with any reasonable kind of weather, Dublin can get through this fuel crisis without undue hardship.  If, however, weather conditions continue as they have been for the past month, we are facing the worst experience of the war.</P>
    <P>Deputies may ask if I have any advice to give.  There is one advice I <Col N="952" /> should like to give.  There may be people who have got reserves of turf saved from previous ration periods, or stocks of firewood, or who for some reason may be able to postpone ordering or purchasing turf now.  If there are any such people, I would urge them to do so.  By avoiding or by postponing ordering turf now from their suppliers, they will not merely facilitate the distribution of the available supplies to those whose need is greatest, but will also be benefiting themselves, because it is a reasonable assumption that, if we have fair weather conditions, the turf available later on in the ration period will be of better quality and in drier condition than that now being distributed.</P>
    <P>I should like Deputies to understand, however, that this is a serious situation, a situation which is due to the abnormal weather conditions of the past six months and is independent of the coal situation.  I had hoped, during the latter part of last year, when our coal supplies were improving, that we might at some stage begin to accumulate a stock of coal which could during the winter be made available, even if in very small quantities, for domestic purposes.</P>
    <P>In the event, however our imports of coal contracted drastically before Christmas, fell during the weeks after Christmas to much less than half of what they had previously been in each week, and now have ceased altogether, so that the prospect of easing our domestic fuel situation by the utilisation of coal has disappeared.  We can, I think, expect&mdash;we can certainly pray for&mdash;good weather in the coming weeks.  If we get that good weather, we will get through this period of crisis.  If we do not get that good weather, we are in for a very bad time indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am aware, there are no restrictions requiring relaxation on the felling of timber of firewood quality.  There are, of course, people anxious to fell timber of commercial quality, but we have, in addition to this fuel crisis, a timber crisis, and it would, I think, be undesirable to permit people to use timber of commercial quality for firewood purposes. There are many classes of timber unsuitable for firewood purposes, but, so far as I am aware, nobody who is interested in procuring supplies of firewood timber has been prevented from doing so by the restrictions to which the Deputy refers.</P>
