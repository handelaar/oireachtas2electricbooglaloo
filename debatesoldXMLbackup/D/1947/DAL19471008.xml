      <P>The Conference of European Economic Co-operation held in Paris has resulted in a report signed by the representatives of all the participating countries, including Ireland. The text of the general report is already available to Deputies in the Library, and copies of the technical committees' reports, which will soon be published, will be placed there also. The ultimate results of the conference will depend on the action taken by the United States on the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall have to consider the question of expense in that regard.  I am told that each of the copies of the technical committees' reports may cost as much as 10/- or 15/-.  I shall have to see whether or not it will be necessary to circulate them to Deputies.  A certain number of copies will be available and, so far as the general report is concerned, we could have copies made available to those who would ask for them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state whether estimates have been laid before the Paris Conference on the Marshall Plan proposals of the requirements of this country for the next four years: (1) to increase food and other production, and (ii) to supplement home production of foods for human consumption; <Col N="3" /> if so, if he will publish particulars of the estimates so made; and if he will state the nature of the consultations or conferences at which such estimates were made.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to questionnaires received from the Paris Conference, details of this country's estimated requirements and production targets were prepared at very short notice by the Departments concerned and furnished to the conference.  These details are too extensive to be given in answer to a Parliamentary Question, but they will be available to Deputies in the technical committees' reports, copies of which, as I have already stated, will be placed in the Library.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated, in reply to Deputy Mulcahy, that the reports of the technical committees may be very expensive.  Some copies will be placed in the Library and we might be able to arrange to supply copies to heads of Parties or others who make special application for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach be good enough to say if he is correctly reported as saying that our contribution to the European resources should be to increase the quantity of beet sugar produced here?  If so, is he aware that sugar is one of the few foodstuffs in the world in respect of which there is foreseeable an absolute surplus within the next 12 months?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not quite clear what the Deputy means by the contribution required from this country. Our contribution will be the efforts we make in reaching the targets of production indicated in our replies to the questionnaires received from the conference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if his attention has been directed to statements concerning the targets set for each country participating in the European self-help programme which has been submitted to the United States Government; and whether he will indicate the nature of the target set for this country, and the measures which will be required to ensure its fulfilment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will make a statement to the Dáil giving full details of the recent talks in London with members of the British Government; and if he will arrange for an opportunity for the Dáil to debate the matter, in view of the importance of such talks concerning the future economic position in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the three questions 6, 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>The purpose and result of the conference between Ministers were indicated in the communiqué issued to the Press after the meeting on the 19th September.  This communiqué was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The representatives of the two Governments explored in general terms the possibilities of dove-tailing to their mutual advantage plans for increasing supplies from each country to the other.</P>
      <P>Agreement was reached on the desirability of organising discussions at the official level with a view to submitting proposals giving practical expression in the common interest to the ideas developed at the inter-Ministerial discussions.  Arrangements for the discussions at the official level are being put in hand at once.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Since then, the discussions at the official level have been taking place, and, when they are concluded, the results will be submitted to the two Governments.  If any agreements are reached between the Governments, opportunities for dealing with them will present themselves in the ordinary way.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if it is now proposed <Col N="6" /> to withdraw the application of Ireland for admission to the United Nations Organisation; and if not, whether, in view of the rejection of the application, he will explain why it is not proposed to withdraw it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is scarcely correct to speak of this country's application as having been rejected.  The application has not come before the General Assembly as the Security Council has been unable to make the necessary recommendation, owing to the opposition of a single State.  The Deputy is aware that many States have expressed the view at the General Assembly, which is at present in session, that the technical provisions which prevent the assembly's pronouncing on our application should be modified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Risteárd Ua Maolchatha</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if, in view of the fact that the Tariffs and Trade Committee of the United Nations Preparatory Committee on Trade and Employment is officially reported to have reached agreement on the main outlines of a general agreement on tariffs and trade, and in view of the terms in which they have restated the principles of most-favoured-nation treatment, he will state whether any negotiations have taken place between the Government and the British Government on the question of imperial preferences, and whether the Irish Government have agreed to the making of any concessions in respect of such preferences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While a draft general agreement on tariffs and trade has been prepared by the 17 countries represented on the Preparatory Committee, it has not yet been signed or accepted.  The draft agreement contemplates the preparation of a schedule which will set out the rates of customs duty, including preference rates, on goods imported from any one of the negotiating countries into any of the others, but this schedule has not yet been completed.  Ireland is not one of the negotiating countries, but, as stated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the Dáil on the 17th <Col N="7" /> April last, we have had conversations with the British Government on some of the questions which might affect us and are under consideration.  We are being kept informed by the British authorities of the progress of the work in so far as it may bear on any modification of preferences which might be contemplated.  We understand that, up to the present, no final decisions have been reached on these matters.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether, in view of the urgent necessity of bringing about harmony and whole-hearted co-operation among all those upon whom increasing production depends, he will take immediate steps to bring into consultation with the Government, representatives of employers and workers generally, with a view to ascertaining what are the facts which give rise to the present strike tendencies, and, if possible, take such action as may remove this tendency which is interfering with production and causing very great hardship to the country generally.</P>

      <P>I am aware that turf supplies have not been reaching Cobh on a satisfactory level, especially from the point of view of securing reserve stocks to meet the heavy winter demand. Special measures have been taken to effect the necessary improvement, and there is no danger of a fuel famine in the town during the coming winter if merchants make full use of the transport facilities which are now being provided for them.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state his reasons for making Cork City a turf area and the towns of Cobh, Midleton and Youghal non-turf areas, having regard to the relative distance of these towns from nearest turf bogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question reverses the actual position.  Cork City is in the non-turf area; the County of Cork generally, including the towns of Cobh, Midleton and Youghal, is in the scheduled turf area. Cork City is excluded from the turf area because the size of its population puts the problem of providing fuel supplies beyond the capacity of private enterprise.  This consideration does not apply to Cobh, Midleton or Youghal.  The distances of these places from the nearest bogs is not a relevant factor in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

It was originally intended as a hostel to accommodate staff exployed at the flying boats base at Foynes.

The hostel was used up to June to accommodate transatlantic passengers and crews where services were delayed overnight at Rineanna.  Accommodation has now been provided at Rineanna for this purpose.

      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Chinn Comhairle, to take questions 31 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the shortage of accommodation for the reception and treatment of cases of tuberculosis in Cork City and County.  In pursuance of the powers conferred on me by the Tuberculosis (Erection of Sanatoria) Act, 1945, a site for a regional sanatorium at Cork which will contain approximately 700 beds was acquired at Sarsfieldcourt, Glanmire, County Cork, on 20th February, 1947.  The provision of this institution is a work of considerable magnitude involving the preparation of contract drawings for many separate buildings of various sizes together with specifications for the incidental, mechanical, electrical, medical, water supply, sewerage and other services.  It will be appreciated, therefore, that some time must elapse before this institution will be available but every possible effort is being made to press forward the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="19" /> I would point out, however, that the special measures authorised by the Act do not relieve the local authorities concerned, viz., Cork County Council and Cork Corporation, of their responsibility under the Tuberculosis (Prevention) Acts, to provide sufficient institutional accommodation to meet the requirements of their respective areas. I have recently approved of the provision of an additional 22 beds at Cork Sanatorium which is administered by a joint committee of these bodies.  This accommodation will be available for patients at an early date and further extension of 20 beds is contemplated.</P>

Employment in agriculture is specifically excepted from the scope of unemployment insurance by paragraph (a) of Part II of the First Schedule to the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920.  With regard to the last part of the question I would refer the Deputy to the statement I made on <Col N="22" /> the Vote for the Department of Social Welfare, in which I indicated that the whole position with regard to social services is being examined with a view to unification, and that a scheme would be announced in due course.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of the very serious hardships imposed on small farmers in County Mayo, whose valuations were considerably increased as a result of the revaluation of their turbary holdings, carried out last year; and if he will take immediate steps to have such cases reviewed and a reduction of the rates assessments made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the serious hardships to which the Deputy refers.  As he should know from previous references in the House to the matter of turbary valuations, such valuations are fixed on the basis of the net profits from the letting of turf banks or from sale of turf therefrom. They cannot, therefore, be regarded as imposing a hardship on the owners of the turbaries any more than a higher income-tax assessment can be so regarded in the case of a person whose income has increased.  If the owners of turbaries in County Mayo, the valuations of which were increased on the 1st March, 1947, felt aggrieved at the valuations, they could have appealed against them within the statutory period (1st to 28th March, 1947).  As no appeals were received, the valuations cannot be reopened in so far as they affect the current rating year.  Further, it is open to every ratepayer on or before the 15th June <Col N="27" /> in any year to claim revision of his valuation on the ground that it is excessive.  No such claim, however, in respect of a turbary valuation in County Mayo was received by the 15th June this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that most of those farmers whose valuations have been increased excessively from £2 10s. 0d. to £7 10s. 0d. were very small turbary owners with plots of only two or three acres who, in response to the appeals made by the Taoiseach, the Government and this House, were patriotic enough to help to provide fuel for the nation when it was confronted with a very grave crisis?  Having done that, they are now faced with an excessive increase in their valuations although they received no notice beforehand that such a thing would be done.</P>

      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 46, 47 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>I presume the pensioners Deputy Cafferky has in mind are national teacher pensioners.  There are 1,898 such in receipt of pensions of from 15/- to £3 per week.</P>
      <P>I have received representations urging an increase in the pensions of national school teachers, but I have nothing to add to my reply of the 28th January last to Deputy Alfred Byrne when I said that the claims of retired national school teachers for increased pensions could not be considered alone and apart from similar claims by other classes of superannuated public servants.  Any question of improving their position would, necessarily, depend on the Government deciding to review the question of pensions generally and no such decision has been taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that there are many pensioned teachers who are in receipt of only 15/- per week and who have family responsibilities? Is he not aware that these teachers in their day played a great part in moulding the characters of men sitting on these benches to-day and in helping to develop the Irish <Col N="30" /> language and to further the Irish national cause?  Is that the only appreciation that the Minister and the Government have for the men and women who made such great sacrifices in days gone by, to give them a miserable pension of 15/- a week which has no relation to the present cost of living?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister adverted to the fact that about 1918 a radical change was made in the status and remuneration of national teachers in this country as a result of the exertions of the representatives of our people at the time?  There are a number of old teachers in this country whose pensions are based on the deplorable rates of pay which obtained prior to that new departure.  They have no family responsibilities, of course; they are very old people.  Will the Minister, in respect of that restricted class, at least make some <i>ad interim</i> concession which will enable them at least to live respectably, because I believe many of them to be hungry, and thus, by restricting it to a very limited class, clearly defined, remove it from the scope of the general principle which the Minister for Finance might object to on the ground that it would be of universal application?  These are cases which should be considered.</P>

      <P>In replying on 28th January, 1947, and 6th May, 1947, to similar questions put to me by Deputies Heskin and Corry I gave the House to understand that it was my intention to set up a permanent tribunal or commission to advise as to appropriate producers' costs for agricultural products.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is telling the House that he has changed his mind, but, at Question Time, one cannot very well go into great detail as to the reasons for doing so.  I could give some of them and I will give the House one or two illustrations.  In considering the setting up of a costings tribunal, I had to ask myself what kind of tribunal it would be, in what way would it be constituted.  I had to ask myself if it would be a tribunal of technicians. If I said it was to be a tribunal of technicians, and it would seem that it should be, the farmers in the House and the people speaking for the farming community here and outside would not accept a tribunal of that kind.  If I were to come to the House with a tribunal composed entirely of farmers, other sections would naturally say: &ldquo;We have no confidence whatever in such a tribunal&rdquo;. <Col N="35" /> If, on the other hand, I were to come here with proposals for the establishment of a tribunal composed of technicians and farmers, I could see it as a tribunal, such as some of those I have already got, on which there would be a struggle&mdash;not an attempt to analyse a particular problem and to find out exactly the position&mdash;as to what kind of determination should be reached and that ultimately, irrespective of the kind of tribunal set up, it would fall on the shoulders of the Minister for Agriculture to settle such matters.  Since it is mainly the responsibility of the Minister to make decisions of the kind and to face the House and the country, I felt I would be on the right road in setting up in my own Department a body which would advise me on these matters, and that I would then make my decision and defend it when it was made.</P>

      <P>I have seen the wheat that was dished out this year to farmers for seed and I have seen the results.  I have taken several merchants from Cork City around with me to see the growing crops and here is what we found.  There was one sample of that seed wheat which was sold as Atle.  It contained seven heads of Atle, three of Diamante, two of April Bearded, two of Wilhelmina, one of barley, and three of oats.  That seed was supposed to go through £2,000 worth of a mill that was supposed to take everything out of it only the proper seed.  That was the result. Those particular crops gave yields of between two and three barrels per acre.</P>

      <P>So far as the criticism which has been levelled by Deputy Corry is concerned, I would like to remind him that the small quantity of seed wheat which we succeeded in the past in importing was sold to farmers more or less on the understanding that they would sell back again to the merchants from whom they bought it.  That understanding has not been observed and, as a result of its non-observance, our problem in building up suitable stocks of seed wheat has increased.  I would like to remind Deputy Corry that it is the practice of some growers to mix their seeds, especially those who take conacre.  Those are difficulties that my Department cannot overcome easily.  The House and county committees who have been devoting a lot of their time to a discussion of this matter will, I hope, realise that we are conscious of the fact that the seed position is not satisfactory, but we cannot, irrespective of our anxiety to do so, change that position.  We are doing our best and we will continue to do so.</P>

It is very necessary that the Minister and the Leader of the Opposition should feel themselves quite free to deal adequately with the occasion; but if other Deputies desire to take part in the discussion they will be reluctant to squeeze everybody else out.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill will be obvious to Deputies from the Title.  It is to amend and extend certain provisions of the Harbours Act, 1946, and make provision for some additional matters which were raised when the 1946 Act was under discussion here.  During the passage of the Harbours Act, 1946, I indicated to the Dáil that it was the intention of the Government to provide financial assistance where necessary for the development or restoration of harbour works, where there appeared to be a reasonable prospect of a revival of the trade of a harbour.  Since then, applications for financial assistance have been received from 21 harbour authorities and grants amounting to £668,000 have been approved in 12 cases.  There are other applications under consideration and as I anticipate that some Deputies may, in the course of the discussion on this Bill, raise the matter of delay in giving decisions upon outstanding applications, it might save time if I point out that the main cause of delay is that in most cases a survey must be carried out to determine the type and the cost of the works that are needed.  The Board of Works organisation is used for the purpose of conducting such surveys and they have been doing their utmost to expedite the work, but they are handicapped at present by the difficulty of providing suitable engineers with experience of marine works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, one application which has been approved is the subject of a provision in this Bill.  In the case of the Tralee and Fenit Harbour authority, the Government decided to make a grant of the full cost of providing a new viaduct and of widening the pier, works which are estimated to cost about £100,000.  They made that offer to defray the cost of these works on the condition that the Kerry County Council would remit the debt of approximately the same amount due to them by the harbour authority.  That debt <Col N="95" /> arises out of a loan guaranteed to the harbour authority in 1882 by the predecessors of the county council.  The loan had been raised originally for the purpose of constructing the pier and other works at Fenit.  In making remission of a debt a condition for the grant, the Government had regard to the fact that the restoration of the harbour is important to the future development of the whole of County Kerry that a contribution from local authorities towards the cost of harbour works has been made a condition of a grant in other cases and that no port of the size of Fenit could be expected to prosper when burdened with such a heavy debt.  The County Commissioner for Kerry agreed to wipe out the debt, but was advised by his legal advisers that Section 133 of the Harbours Act, 1946, which sets out the different ways in which a local authority may assist a harbour authority, does not authorise a local authority to remit such a debt. Section 6 of this Bill is intended to meet that difficulty and to clarify the position in regard to the grant of assistance by local authorities to harbour authorities.</P>
    <P>The next matter to which the Bill refers arose after the harbour elections of 1946.  It was found that certain schooners at Arklow harbour were owned by groups consisting of corporate bodies and individuals.  The Act provided for the granting of voting rights in respect of vessels owned by individuals or by corporate bodies, but we overlooked the possibility of a vessel being owned jointly by individuals and corporate bodies.  In the case of Arklow harbour, the returning officer, acting on legal advice, decided that he was unable to allow the owners of these schooners to take part in the elections, even though the vessels were registered in the State and the requisite amount had been paid in tonnage dues.  I undertook to have this matter considered in conjunction with any amending harbour legislation.  It is now proposed to substitute Section 2 of this Bill for sub-section (5) of Section 7 of the Harbours Act, 1946, so that the owners of all vessels registered in the State in respect of which the requisite tonnage rates have been paid may be <Col N="96" /> able to take part in an election, either directly or through their resident manager.  There is no departure in this from the principle adopted in the original Act.</P>
    <P>Prior to the war tenders for liners calling at Cobh were provided by commercial firms.  These firms were not in a position to restore tender services on the resumption of transatlantic liner traffic.  On the representations of Cork Harbour Commissioners provision was made in the Harbours Act to enable harbour authorities to provide tenders. Cork Harbour Commissioners have been involved in heavy capital outlay in providing the present tender service.</P>
    <P>With a view to offsetting some of the cost of providing this essential service they have now requested that they should be enabled to undertake other remunerative services with the tenders particularly excursions in the summer season when the vessels are not required for their main purpose. Similar services were provided by the commercial firms before the war and they were, I think, popular with Cork citizens and visitors to Cork.  Section 4 of the Bill accordingly empowers a harbour authority to carry passengers for reward in vessels provided by them, subject to the approval of the arrangement by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I think it is desirable to retain that requirement of Ministerial approval to ensure that the remunerative character of these excursion services may not induce a harbour authority to diminish in any way the adequacy of the tender services provided for liner traffic.  Section 8 of the Bill brings the provisions for the granting of travelling and subsistence allowances to members of harbour authorities into line with the provisions of the Local Government Act, 1946.  Deputies will remember that we aimed in all provisions of the Harbour Act relating to staff to maintain similarity with the local government legislation.  Since the Act was passed, however, the local government practice in regard to travelling allowances to members of local authorities has been changed.  We are effecting a corresponding change with regard to members of harbour authorities.  Under Section 38 of the <Col N="97" /> Harbours Act, 1946, vacancies for secretaries and technical officers employed by harbour authorities must be filled through the Local Appointments Commissioners.  In the case of a number of the smaller harbours where the salaries attaching to the posts are small and the work is usually of a parttime nature there appears to be a case for exempting the appointments at such harbours, at any rate for the time being, from the local appointments machinery, in the same way as posts such as town clerks and clerks of pension committees have been exempted under local government legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill therefore provides that local appointments machinery will not apply to any offices at the harbours of Annagassan, Ballyshannon, Baltimore and Skibbereen, Buncrana, Dingle, Killybegs, Kilrush, Kinsale, New Ross, Westport, Wicklow and Youghal unless the Minister so declares.  When the 1946 Act was under discussion I undertook to discuss with the Minister for Local Government as to whether arrangements could not be made to enable previous service with a local authority to be reckoned for pension purposes under a harbours superannuation scheme.  As a result of these consultations it is proposed in this Bill that power should be taken to include in a harbour superannuation scheme arrangements for reckoning past service with a local authority.  I understand that under the Local Government Superannuation Bill at present before the Dáil the Minister for Local Government proposes to include reciprocal provisions to deal with the cases of officers who retire from the service of a local authority having had previous service with a harbour authority.</P>
    <P>An annual payment of £369 4s. 8d. is made by the Cork Harbour Commissioners to the Cork Corporation under an agreement executed under the Cork Harbour Act, 1820.  Under that Act the corporation had abandoned rights which they claim to have had to levy dues and tolls on certain vessels entering the harbour.  During the passage of the 1946 Act the Cork Harbour Commissioners pressed that they should be relieved of that payment which was among the old levies <Col N="98" /> which the Harbours Tribunal had recommended should be abolished.  The Cork Corporation and the harbour authority have been in negotiation in the matter but have so far failed to reach agreement.  Section 9 of the Bill provides that the annual payment shall be discontinued and that compensation in lieu of the payment should be paid by the Cork Harbour Commissioners to the corporation.</P>
    <P>Failing agreement as to the amount of compensation the matter will be resolved by an arbitrator to be appointed by the Chief Justice.  These are the changes in the Harbour Act which this Bill proposes to make.  Deputies will remember that in connection with the Harbours Act arrangements were made for consultation with affected interests and, as a result of that consultation, the Bill was substantially altered.  I think the justification for that method is to be found in the fact that with experience in the operation of that complicated measure only these few changes are required in the provisions of that Act.  I think I can state in respect of all the matters to which this Bill relates and upon which disagreement might have been feared, such disagreement does not exist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there will be no objection to the Bill generally on this side of the House.  I was particularly pleased by the explanation given by the Minister of Section 2 of the Bill because already hidden and mysterious motives have been ascribed in certain quarters to this section.  I would be glad to learn from the Minister the power taken in Section 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  A harbour authority may, with the consent of the Minister and subject to such conditions (if any) as he may think fit to impose, employ any vessels, provided by them under this section, for the carriage of passengers for reward.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that in the case of the ferry service on the Liffey already operated by the Dublin Corporation, if it was decided at any time that this service should revert to the port authorities the port authorities would operate it under this section.  Actually the service at the moment is entirely inadequate <Col N="99" /> and something will have to be done.  I do not think the corporation are too keen on retaining the service. Power to change is given in this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the principle contained in Section 7 of the Bill in regard to the superannuation of officials is entirely sound.  I think that those who had service with a local authority and who enter the service of a harbour authority should have that service recognised. The logical sequel to that is that those with service under a harbour authority should have that service recognised if they go into the employment of a local authority.  Questions of that kind are occurring at the present time.  As the Minister has indicated it is proposed to deal with that matter under the Local Government Bill.  This Bill is non-contentious.  It is merely a tidying-up Bill, following upon the recent Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister upon this Bill and upon the fact that he has already made available £668,000 for the harbours of the country.  I should like to impress upon him the necessity for speeding up grants to the other harbours, especially Cork.  He himself must have seen the necessity during the past 12 months of improving the major ports.  He is aware that Dublin port was unable to handle all the traffic which came its way recently and that ships had to be diverted to other places.  Cork Harbour Commissioners are very anxious to go ahead with the work which they have in view as quickly as possible.  The week-end excursions will be of great benefit to the people of Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For years before the war, they were a most popular form of recreation.  Due to the closing down of the Cork and Crosshaven railway, they are more wanted than ever they were.  The cost of purchasing two tenders and practically renewing them will not be much short of £100,000.  That is a big outlay for a board such as the Cork Harbour Commissioners.  It may encourage the <Col N="100" /> Minister to speed up the grant for the other matters, as the money will be needed.  I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister on doing away with the old cocket tax.  There was no reason for its existence since this country got its freedom.  The payment to the corporation should not continue, either.  There does not seem to be any reason for one public body paying another public body when there does not seem to be any service given for the money.  On the Committee Stage, I may have something further to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to impress on the Minister the necessity for effecting some improvement in the ferry service. Whether that service should be controlled by the corporation or by the Port and Docks Board is not for me to suggest but it is well known that the ferry service is inadequate to the traffic from north to south and south to north. The Minister can confirm the fact that, even during the meal hour, many workers on the north side, anxious to go to the south side, and workers on the south side, anxious to go to the north side, have been unable to do so. The ferry service was not, on some occasions, to my personal knowledge, able to deal with the situation.  If the Minister would avail of the passing of this measure to improve the ferry service in the morning and during the meal hours, he would confer a great benefit on the increasing number of dockers and others who have to go from the north to the south wall and from the south wall to the north wall.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this Bill, with particular reference to Section 6, whereby local authorities will have power to remit debts incurred by way of guarantee of loans or grants to harbour authorities.  A harbour which I have in mind has deteriorated very much during the past nine or ten years, particularly during the emergency period.  Plans have been prepared for certain works at that harbour and attempts have been made to get them carried out.  In company with members of the local authority and members of that harbour board, I have visited the Department of Industry <Col N="101" /> and Commerce in connection with the matter.  I felt, not from the information we received there but from the information we received at the Department of Local Government, that the fact that that harbour authority had incurred certain debts, which the local authority had guaranteed to the bank, and that these moneys had not been repaid by the harbour authority operated against their receiving any further help from the Departments concerned. Under this Bill, there is the hope that these debts will be wiped out and that the works at that harbour, so essential at the moment, will be developed and the harbour put in a proper working condition.  The same remarks apply to another harbour I have in mind but I am happy to congratulate the Minister and his Department on their efforts to place that harbour on a proper footing by way of grants, technical help and otherwise.  The only thing which prevents the work going ahead at the moment is the shortage of a certain material.  Again, I congratulate the Minister on the contents of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan's reference was, I think, to Wicklow harbour. There is a scheme there for works of a <Col N="102" /> fairly substantial character.  The position as regards these works is that the Office of Public Works has been asked to carry out a survey and furnish reports as to the necessity for them and their probable cost.  I am not familiar with the position concerning the debts of the harbour authority to the local authority.  The decision on the application for financial assistance for the larger scheme of works must await the completion of the survey to which I have referred.</P>

The decision as to whether a grant might be approved in principle subject to the scheme of works being all right will be taken but if a survey is required then the Office of Public Works will be asked to undertake it.  I should point out that the Office of Public Works has, at the moment, very considerable difficulty in procuring engineers with experience of marine works.  Consequently delays in the completion of these surveys are apparently inevitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Before indicating the main purposes and provisions of the Bill Deputies might wish me to give a brief review of the circumstances which led to the intervention by the State in the working of the mineral resources of the country.  The Minerals Development Act of 1940 is the Act under which persons desiring to work any particular mineral resource in the State are given facilities for doing so.  As Deputies will remember, the fundamental assumption on which that Act was based is that the working of our mineral resources is primarily a matter for private enterprise.  Deputies therefore might ask why the Government has taken direct action to ensure the working of some of our mineral resources, having regard to the fact that its general policy in regard to them is to facilitate their development by private enterprise.  The answer which should be advanced to that query is that the Government has engaged only in propositions which it was satisfied would not appeal to private enterprise since there were no good prospects that <Col N="104" /> the working of the deposits in question would prove to be profitable. During the war the Government also engaged in the working of mineral properties so as to secure the maximum possible production of certain essential raw materials.</P>
      <P>I shall deal first with the development and the working of the anthracite coal deposits in the Slievardagh coalfield in County Tipperary.  During the years 1934-1937 the Government arranged to have a detailed examination of that coalfield carried out by a firm of consulting engineers.  The purpose of that examination was to ascertain the nature and the quality of the coal deposits there and to report on their suitability for commercial exploitation and on the advisability of undertaking their commercial exploitation. The consulting engineers employed estimated the reserves of coal in the area at about 5,500,000 tons and recommended that the commercial working of the coalfield should be undertaken. Their report was made available for inspection in the office of the geological survey.  It was there for quite a period but nobody with the necessary financial and technical resources came forward with acceptable proposals for the commercial working of the property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only at the Slievardagh end of the Leinster coalfield?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is only on these workings that the report was prepared and that is the report to which I am referring now.  Originally the Government felt it had done its duty by having these deposits fully explored, by having information as to their nature and extent made available to the public, together with the recommendation of this very reputable firm of consulting engineers that the deposits could be worked commercially and worked profitably.  As I have already <Col N="105" /> said, nobody came forward to work them.  After the war started, when it appeared likely that difficulties would arise in maintaining coal supplies, it was decided that the development and working of the coalfield should be undertaken by a State-financed company.</P>
      <P>In the year 1941 the Slievardagh Coalfield Development Act was passed by the Dáil and it authorised the creation of a company known as the Slievardagh Coalfield Company Limited.  That company was charged with the responsibility of developing and working the Slievardagh coalfield and it was financed for that purpose by means of repayable advances from State funds.  The Act placed a limit to such advances at £100,000.  In the same year it was also decided that the Government should assist in the exploration and development of other Irish mineral resources, and the Minerals Exploration and Development Act of 1941 was passed.  That Act also authorised the creation of a company which was known as the Minerals Exploration Company Limited.  It was intended that that exploration and development company should survey and examine mineralised areas other than those containing coal which had not been examined previously and that it should report on the deposits which it considered to be worth developing.  That company was also financed by means of repayable advances from State funds, the statutory limit being fixed at £50,000.  That sum was subsequently raised by Emergency Powers Order to £200,000 because shortly after the formation of that company difficulties began to be experienced in importing phosphate rock and pyrites which are used in the manufacture of superphosphate. It was, therefore, decided that the Exploration and Development Company should, during the emergency, instead of undertaking the exploration and development work which was originally contemplated, engage in the actual commercial production of phosphate rock in County Clare and of pyrites in County Wicklow for use in the manufacture of superphosphate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequently, after some years' experience of the working of the two companies, it was decided that they could <Col N="106" /> be worked more economically and efficiently if they were amalgamated and in 1945, the Minerals Company Act of that year was passed which provided for the dissolution of the Slievardagh Coalfield Company and the transfer of its undertaking to the Minerals Exploration and Development Company, under the new title of Mianraí Teoranta.  That continuing company was charged with the responsibility of producing coal, phosphate and pyrites during the remainder of the emergency. The limit of advances which could be made to it was increased to £400,000. The advances actually provided by the Slievardagh Coalfield Development Act, 1941, and the Minerals Exploration and Development Act, 1941, and under Emergency Powers Orders all merged in that £400,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that that Act increased the limit to £400,000 but in determining whether or not that limit had been reached all the moneys previously advanced under the previous Acts and the Emergency Powers Orders were taken into account.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The total quantities of minerals marketed by the company up to the 31st December of last year were: coal, 64,047 tons; phosphate rock, 66,114 tons, and pyrites, 6,096 tons.  The company has now prepared a programme for the post-war period, a programme which is based on the advice of expert consultants and is designed to ensure the detailed exploration and development of our mineral resources.  The programme comprises geological and geophysical surveying, diamond core drilling, sinking of shafts and so forth, and is estimated to occupy a period of seven years at a cost of £85,000 per year or £595,000 in all.  Exploration work, I may say by way of clarification, consists of the <Col N="107" /> sinking of bores, the driving of tunnels and the systematic sampling of cores, while development work consists of sinking of shafts and drainage and general work designed to bring the deposit into a condition for commercial working.  The object of this exploration and development programme is to obtain definite information in regard to the nature and quantity of the mineral resources of the country and the advisability of commercial exploitation of the more promising of these resources in the light of modern methods for the treatment of minerals.</P>
      <P>This Bill, as Deputies will have noted, is mainly a financial measure. It is intended to provide, first, further capital for the development and working of the Slievardagh coalfield by Mianraí Teoranta and, secondly, the capital required for the large-scale exploration and development programme to which I have referred.  That will be effected by certain amendments and extensions of the Act of 1941 and the Act of 1945.</P>
      <P>As regards Slievardagh coalfield, the House is aware that, on my instructions, Mianraí Teoranta made an effort to dispose of it to private enterprise. It was offered for sale as a going concern but no acceptable offers for its purchase have been received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Has any offer at all been received?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect, no serious offer has been received.  The matter for decision, therefore, is whether the operation of the coalfield by Mianraí Teoranta should cease or whether Mianraí Teoranta should be authorised to continue its working there and the conclusion which the Government arrived at is that it is preferable to authorise Mianraí Teoranta to continue the working of the coalfield.  That is due not solely to the continuing difficulty regarding coal supplies but also to the belief that the possibility of successfully disposing of it to private interests may be improved as a result of fresh exploration work and fresh development at the coalfield.  Section 3 of the Bill accordingly provides for the financing of the company for that purpose <Col N="108" /> by means of repayable advances and it fixes a limit to future advances for that purpose of £50,000.  It is provided that the provisions of Sections 11 and 12 of the Act of 1941, which deal with the payment of interest and the ultimate repayment of advances, shall apply to moneys paid in future to the company under this section, that is, moneys for the continued development of the Slievardagh coalfield.  The House is, I think, aware of the Government's view that it would prefer to see the property worked by private enterprise.  There is a hope that at some stage in the future that may be reached.  We regard it as rather undesirable that a State-financed company should be operating one coalfield in this country when all other coalfields are developed by private enterprise, but how long it will be before the State can get out of this position it is difficult to forecast.  Apart, however, from that operation of working the Slievardagh coalfield, it is intended that Mianraí Teoranta will not in future have any commercial enterprise under its direction, that it will confine itself to the exploration and development of our mineral resources as distinct from their commercial exploitation.</P>
      <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides that the Minister for Industry and Commerce may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, pay to the company in the current financial year and in each of the six following financial years, a grant not exceeding £85,000 to finance the exploration and development work to which I have referred, work which it may carry out either on its own initiative with the approval of the Minister for Industry and Commerce or at the request of the Minister. Grants made to the company under the section must not be used for any purpose other than that for which they are made available.  If the exploration and development work performed by the company reveals information which would appear to justify commercial working, it is intended to recover the cost of the work carried out by the company from the commercial operators who may lease and work the property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mianraí Teoranta was, of course, very considerably handicapped during <Col N="109" /> the war in the working of mineral deposits, not only by the technical difficulties arising from the irregular and faulted nature of the deposits which it was exploiting, but also by difficulties in the recruitment of skilled miners and in the purchase of mining equipment. It has incurred losses as a result of its operations during the emergency. It is estimated that at the passing of the Bill these losses will amount to approximately £414,000.  That figure represents the difference between the total amount of repayable advances which will have been made to the company together with interest on the advances and the actual value of the assets remaining to the company. Since the company will not in future be in a position to earn profits out of which its debts might be paid off, it is proposed to write off the balance of its indebtedness on the 30th September, 1947.  I think it would be undesirable to leave the company saddled with a debt arising out of its war-time operations which it would have no possibility of paying.  Section 2 of the Bill accordingly provides that the Minister for Finance will issue a certificate certifying (1) the value of the assets of the company on the 30th September, 1947, and (2) the total liability of the company on foot of repayable advances made to it, together with accrued interest. By virtue of sub-section (3) of Section 2 of the Bill the company will stand released from that portion of its liabilities represented by the difference between its assets and its liabilities as certified by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I have explained that the company will in future be financed mainly by means of non-repayable advances.  In view of that arrangement, the details of the company's operations, particularly those that are financed by means of grants, will be subject to closer supervision.  Provision is made in Section 7 of the Bill for the furnishing by the company to the Minister of an annual report giving the results of its prospecting exploration and development work during each year, and also such information in regard to its operations as the Minister may from time to time require.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" /> Section 8 of the Bill provides that the company shall not publish the results of any prospecting exploration or development work carried out by it or any information in relation thereto, without the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Having regard to the arrangements for financing the company's operations, as set forth in the Bill, it is provided in Section 9 that no further advances shall be made to the company under the Act of 1941 after the date of the passing of this Bill.  I have explained, of course, that advances will continue to be made to the company to continue the working of the Slievardagh coalfield.  These will be made under Section 3 of the Bill.  Section 10 provides that after the passing of the Bill the Minister for Industry and Commerce shall not require the company to carry out prospecting work under Section 13 of the Act of 1941, nor shall he pay any grants to the company for the purpose of complying with the provisions under that section.  The position of the company in the future will be that it will be entitled to receive repayable advances to the limit of £50,000 for the working of the Slievardagh coal, but apart from that particular activity it will have no commercial operations in progress, and its sole revenue will be the non-repayable advances to be voted to it each year by the Dáil for the next seven years, amounting to £85,000 per year.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, from various Press comments which have appeared from time to time, that there is some confusion in the minds of many persons as to the state of our knowledge of the value and extent of our mineral resources. We have, I think, a good idea of the value of our coal deposits. Although we know of the existence of deposits of other mineral resources, our knowledge of their probable extent and of their value is very incomplete. The Geological Survey is, of course, engaged in studying the geology of the country in its scientific and economic aspects.  The Geological Survey derives information from studies of surface and of underground workings, old plans, old bore holes and other indications, which information is supplemented by geophysical surveys of different types. <Col N="111" /> The Geological Survey carries the work to the stage where, if possible, a positive or a negative recommendation can be made as to the advisability of further exploration by methods of mining.  Exploration by methods of mining consists in the construction of underground working&mdash;the sinking of bore holes, the driving of shafts and tunnels, the testing and sampling of ore.  In that way the extent and the value of the deposit is determined and the advisability of working on a commercial scale is demonstrated.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the stage of exploration of our mineral resources which usually does not come within the province of the Geological Survey will be entrusted to Mianraí Teoranta.  That will be the main function of this company in future, apart from the special and, I hope, temporary arrangement under which it operates commercially at Slievardagh.  I feel that, as a result of the programme which has been prepared for the company and on which it is about to embark, we will be enabled to say definitely at the end of that seven-year period what accessible resources of minerals are available to us and what is their commercial value. We should be able to decide what strategic reserves of minerals exist which we could in another emergency produce for ourselves.  We can prepare our plans for future development with much greater reliance on the accuracy of our data than we can at the moment. It is work which, I think, should be undertaken.  It may or it may not produce activities of commercial value. We are all rather optimistic and hope that the survey will reveal the existence of valuable mineral deposits worth exploiting commercially.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Have they any survey of Slievardagh up to this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  This company will have nothing to do with coal except in the case of Slievardagh.  The original survey was carried out in the case of Slievardagh by a British firm of consulting engineers.  Its report was made available in the library of the Geological Survey.  It made a report very favourable to the commercial working <Col N="112" /> of the deposits but in fact nobody undertook their commercial working.  In 1941, when the emergency developed, the State decided that a State company would in fact do so and that State company has carried on the working up to this.  It tried to sell the coalfield as a going concern without success.  It has been decided to continue its working as a commercial undertaking for the time being in the belief that we will be able to demonstrate its value as a commercial concern more satisfactorily by doing so and ultimately dispose of it and also because we need coal.  We would not be justified in suspending any coal winning operations at the present time.  However, it must be remembered that the working of the Slievardagh coalfield will be rather an accidental activity of Mianraí Teoranta in the future.  Its main preoccupation will be the exploration and development programme prepared for it so that we may be able to have reliable data for our mineral resources. If this data reveals the existence of mineral deposits capable of satisfactory commercial working, then we will consider methods for securing the commercial workings of these deposits preferably by private enterprise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand so.  So far as I am concerned, the question which I had to decide and on which I had to make a recommendation to the Government was whether to close down the workings now to avoid any further expenditure or any possibility of further losses or let the company continue.  The company persuaded me that they could in fact considerably improve the commercial value of the works, subject to the provision of a further capital sum of £50,000.  If, in fact, as we must always assume in mining operations, their plans do not work out as they hope and a stage is reached when they cannot continue without further capital expenditure, the decision of the Government will probably be to close down the workings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I do not want to say that this is a final decision.  I say that we nearly decided on that course, <Col N="114" /> and the factor which weighed heavily with us was the present coal shortage. If that shortage had not existed, the decision might have gone the other way, even though the company believed they could further improve the value of the workings as a result of further expenditure.  In mining operations it is always difficult to resist the temptation to go further with development work in the belief that it will solve the problems that have emerged up to the present.  In this case we decided to go this stage further.  If that puts the company in a position where it can finance its own extensions in future out of profits of working, well and good. If it fails to do that, I think a decision will have to be taken to dispose of the property if we can, or, if not, to terminate the working.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that that is the reason why the Minister is desirous that a buyer should come along.  He might not be half as anxious to sell if it was profitable.  We are asked to provide a very substantial sum for the exploration and development of minerals.  I understand from <Col N="116" /> what the Minister said that exploration will be directed to minerals other than coal; that there will not be very much further exploration so far as coal is concerned.  In the Minister's opinion they have sufficient information as to that in the Department.  Even this big sum of £595,000, if it were definitely going to determine what our mineral resources are, would provide very valuable information.  So far as coal resources are concerned, quite a lot of people, even people in this House, believe that we have very substantial coal resources.  This might possibly explode that.  At all events, it would give us the information that is necessary as to what extent it is a commercial proposition, what are the possibilities of development of other mineral resources which are obviously there.  It is a very substantial sum and will be expended over a period of seven years in instalments of £85,000 per annum.  We have no objection to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the whole problem that is presented to the House is concerned, the Minister certainly cannot be congratulated on it or even on the manner in which it has been presented.  We are asked to provide moneys to write off a deficit of £414,000.  So far as that deficit is concerned, it is a complete muddle.  We are given no information. As a matter of fact, this is scarcely the place to examine how much has been lost by the company in Slievardagh and in its activities in phosphate development in Clare, and pyrites development in Wicklow.  Surely in expending public moneys, particularly where losses of this sort are incurred, there ought to be some precise information and there ought to be other machinery for examining that.  It is true that when we discussed this matter before the Minister informed us that the accounts of this company were not submitted to the Committee of Public Accounts and that there was no statutory responsibility for doing so.  So far as accounting for public moneys to this Parliament, which voted the public moneys in this matter, is concerned, we are completely in the dark.  We have to accept the information which the Minister has given the House that £414,000 has been expended to little or no purpose.  The Minister has told us that we got 64,000 tons of <Col N="117" /> coal from Slievardagh.  That was a very low output indeed.  If we had some costings&mdash;and I presume that some costings are available&mdash;the Minister might be able to tell us at least what it cost per ton to raise the 64,000 tons and what the actual loss incurred in the production of the 64,000 tons was.</P>
    <P>With regard to the production of phosphates and of pyrites in Wicklow, I feel that the whole method of financing these projects was completely wrong and that Parliament should disapprove of it.  If, in the emergency in which we found ourselves, it was essential to work the phosphate deposit in Clare&mdash;from a purely agricultural point of view a deposit which was not of good quality, not being very soluble&mdash;and pyrites in Wicklow, and to provide the finished article at a certain price to the agricultural community, I feel that the phosphate should have been paid for at what it cost and that the subsidy should have been fed in at a particular point.  If that had been done, we would know exactly where we stood, but the way the money has been pumped into this company and the muddle that has been made of it makes it impossible for any man, no matter how able an accountant, to disentangle the financial muddle which has been created as a result.  It is this sort of State organisation which the Vocational Commission so emphatically condemned&mdash;the nominal company, the shares held by the Minister for Finance, with a nominal board of directors.  The Minister might tell us later the personnel of the board of directors, but the whole system gives rise to the sort of operations and method of financing of projects of this kind that the Minister has described to the House.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, when we discussed this matter last, on 25th January, 1945, the Minister asked us for a further financial provision for Slievardagh and said, at column 1706, volume 95:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The mechanisation of production at the mines will, of course, involve further capital expenditure but it should enable coal production to be continued on an economic basis after the war.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="118" /> The Minister certainly was optimistic at that time and his information does not appear to have been correct. So far as the reputable firm of engineers the Minister told us about are concerned, their advice does not seem to have been very sound, because the development, from a purely business point of view, has been most unfavourable and the condition of the seams, so far as I understand, down in Slievardagh is most unfavourable.  They are tilted over very much&mdash;standing almost perpendicular in some cases&mdash;which makes for a condition in which it is almost impossible to work the seams at an economic price.  It is only because of the acute shortage of fuel that it is worth while to continue working at all, and, although it has been so unprofitable to work it up to the present, the Minister asks the House to throw another £50,000 into the melting-pot. If, at the end of the period, there is nobody in the market for a coal mine, what will happen?  Will we close it down?  What output does the Minister expect to get as a result of the further £50,000 and what will it cost per ton?  These are very pertinent questions which must be considered.</P>
    <P>In view of the report which the consulting engineers gave the Minister's Department, the optimism of the Minister the last time we discussed this matter and the very low output from this mine, the situation is extraordinary, because I am aware, as the Minister is aware, that none of the companies engaged in any mining which is taking place in the country of a private enterprise type have experienced the same difficulty.  At least, they are making it pay because they are continuing to work and they are not so philanthropic as to work at a loss. All the private companies operating are able to make coal mining a success, but here we have a quasi-State company, under a nominal board of directors, into which money has been poured by the Dáil to the tune of £414,000&mdash; practically half a million pounds&mdash;and they cannot make a success of it, although they have the services of an expert, reputable firm of mining engineers from Great Britain to advise them and all the resources of the State behind them to enable them to buy <Col N="119" /> whatever equipment is necessary and available.</P>
    <P>We have a situation in which 64,000 tons of coal were produced and the Minister is still optimistic enough to ask the House to vote a further £50,000. It certainly does not speak well for the policy of setting up companies of this sort and I would not be so optimistic as the Minister is as to hope that there will be any private enterprise in the market for a particular mine.  I venture to prophesy that we will spend another £50,000 and eventually close it down.</P>
    <P>With regard to the further activities of the company, Mianraí Teoranta, the Minister told us that these operations are confined to exploration and development and that they cannot work out beyond that.  Suppose that, having developed a mine, it goes on the market and you do not get any private enterprise to take it up.  What are you going to do about it, if the activities of the company are to be limited to exploration and development?  You will not close down, surely, until some private company comes along in two, three or four years time?  So far as those provisions are concerned, I think the Minister will have to widen them a little. It would scarcely be wise, if the company struck oil, to limit the company's activities, if there was no private enterprise in the market for the mine. There is a provision for recovering the cost in the event of the sale of the project to private enterprise.  That is a proper provision, but it is not wise to confine the company's activities merely to exploration and development, because that may create a further problem, adding to the many problems the Minister has to face in this matter.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by saying most emphatically that I wish to condemn the whole method of financing projects of this sort and especially the policy of asking the House to accept that sort of explanation with regard to the expenditure of a very considerable sum of public money.  The Minister, when he was questioned, was not able to apportion the losses and we have been told that, so far as the certificate of the Minister for Finance is concerned, <Col N="120" /> when it comes to valuing the assets of the company, that they will not be apportioned.  That is not a businesslike way of handling this matter.  It is not fair to ask the House to agree to meet a deficit of £414,000 and at the same time not give the proper details.</P>
    <P>I think the House should set up a special commission to examine this matter and to see how that money is being expended.  The House should satisfy itself that the money is being properly expended.  There is in existence a Committee of Public Accounts and the normal procedure of a Parliament&mdash;it is the procedure of the British Parliament&mdash;is always to insist that every shilling voted is properly accounted for.  Here we have certain sums voted by the House and I do not think I am unreasonable when I suggest that there was no attempt made by the Minister to account for the losses involved.  We should not be prepared to agree to that.</P>
    <P>So far as the financial provisions for further activities by the company are concerned, it seems very doubtful whether, on the company's record, it should be entrusted with such work. I hope the Minister will give the names of those who are on the board of directors.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given an estimate of the coal resources in that particular end of the Leinster coalfield.  The estimate is 5,500,000 tons.  Of that quantity, only 65,000 tons have been mined. There is fairly accurate information in the Department and I should like the Minister to give the estimate of the quantity of coal in the entire Leinster coalfield.</P>

      <P>Deputies and others who prate nowadays about leaving everything to private enterprise seem to have lost their memories.  Deputy Hughes seems to have forgotten the policy of Deputy McGilligan, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce in another Government.  If we left the development of our key industries, of everything that was worth while, to private enterprise, we would not have had coal, turf, food or fuel when we needed them most.  Deputy Hughes knows that and the Minister knows it better.  Will Deputy Hughes examine <Col N="121" /> the records of this House or the records of the Committee of Public Accounts? If he does, he will find out what it cost the State, the Department of Industry and Commerce, Fuel Importers and Bord na Móna to provide turf for the people in the cities and towns, turf which never would have been provided by private enterprise.  I advise the Deputy to read the illuminating speeches made in the early days by members of his own Party; let him read the speeches by Deputy McGilligan on the Shannon scheme and on other valuable schemes that were put into operation during the lifetime of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce to-day, in reply to Deputy Corry, referred to certain action that had to be taken for the provision of fuel for Cork City where private enterprise, behind which were the most intelligent and active-minded people in the country, was not able to get the job done.  The fact is that in Cork City private enterprise failed in that respect.  The people of Carlow or Tipperary or anywhere else are only trotting after them, and yet they were not able to get that job done in their own city.</P>

      <P>If I understood Deputy Hughes aright, he gave a cold-blooded condemnation of what is provided in this Bill.  He wants to close down these places and incur no more expenditure in the exploration and commercial workings of these mines.  I have a fairly long memory with regard to the development of our mineral resources, particularly in so far as they affect my own constituency.  One of the first jobs I got as a Deputy was to try to save the mines then being worked at Wolfhill. The Minister for Finance at the time, Mr. Blythe, pumped a good deal of the people's money into these mines in order to keep people in employment. That was good national work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to take a chance.  There is an Article in the Constitution which says that the mineral resources of this State are the property of the nation and not of any private individuals.  That is plainly written into our Constitution and I accept it.  I do not believe in the policy of using a good deal of the taxpayers' money to carry out exploratory work and then hand over those mines to people for profit-making purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not subscribe to that policy and I am amazed that the Minister, as far as I understand his policy for a long time, has reversed the previous policy of the Government in this matter.  Why should the taxpayers, or we representing the taxpayers, vote large sums of money for exploratory work in regard to a key industry which is owned by the nation, by all the people of the nation, and then let that be passed back after it has been fully developed, either to natives or to foreigners to be worked for a profit-making purpose?  I do not subscribe to that part of the policy of the present Government and of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, if that is the policy; but I do say &ldquo;carry on&rdquo; and I am not a bit afraid to get up and say anywhere in my constituency <Col N="123" /> or anywhere else that I would be prepared to carry on rather than lay down where we are at the moment.</P>
    <P>What is £414,000 when compared to the amount that the same Minister has had to find by way of subsidy in order to enable turf to be sold to the people of the towns and cities at a reasonable price?  Look up the Estimates for the past three or four years and you will see provision for a couple of million pounds a year in order that, during the emergency, the people may get fuel of some kind or another.  The same thing is being done to-day, because we cannot charge our people the actual or economic price of coal.  The Minister will probably bring in a Bill, in the very near future, asking us to provide portion of this subsidy in order to enable coal to be sold either to industrial concerns or to domestic users at a reasonable figure.  In other words, he will not be able to recover the full cost of providing coal in the cities for domestic users.  I would be much surprised if he were able to recover the whole of the cost.</P>
    <P>At any rate, we have had the Electricity Supply Board, which has been a fairly successful concern, and without which we would not have this country developed to its present extent; and we have Bord na Móna, which is the same kind of company but on a much bigger scale than this company carrying on at Slievardagh and elsewhere.  Did the people engaged in carrying on transport in this country under the system of private enterprise not collapse and was that not why Córas Iompair Éireann had to be established, to maintain public transport? The same applies to Aer Lingus, to a certain extent.  It is a State established, subsidised and managed concern. I do not see why, after having established it and set it up as a matter of policy, like the creation of the Electricity Supply Board, Bord na Móna, Córas Iompair Éireann and Aer Lingus, we are now going to turn and go backward in regard to the development of our mineral resources.  I certainly do not agree with that policy. In his explanatory memorandum, the Minister says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="124" />&ldquo;The Bill has two main purposes. It is intended to provide (a) further capital for the development and working of Slievardagh coalfield by Mianraí Teoranta, and (b) capital for the large-scale exploration and development of Irish mineral resources, which the company proposes to undertake.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Could the Minister, when replying, give us any more information as to the extent to which that kind of work has been carried out already?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, exploration and development work.  I made representations on more than one occasion, at the request of a large number of my constituents who believed that there were valuable coal resources in the Luggacurran area.  That is the same part of the country as Wolfhill and cutting across into Castlecomer.  I know from my limited knowledge of the Castlecomer area, that coal mining operations have been carried out there under private enterprise in a fairly efficient and satisfactory way.  I am admitting that.  On one occasion, when I was there with a colleague of the Minister's, trying to settle up&mdash;and we succeeded in doing so at the time&mdash;a long drawn out labour dispute, I was assured by Captain Prior Wandersforde that the failure to develop Castlecomer was due to the scarcity of skilled miners.  If that is so&mdash;and I accept it that it is so&mdash;what is the Department doing to try to get a greater number of people to take an interest in mining operations?  Is it not worth while spending some money by way of propa ganda or by offering higher rates of wages and better conditions?  The miner should be &ldquo;No. 1 Priority&rdquo; in matters of that kind, if we are to have any future for mining operations. Can something not be done in that direction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last time I was in the Kilkenny area&mdash;I know parts of Kilkenny fairly well&mdash;I was told there was a number of people working in the Castlecomer mines doing their best to get permits to go across to Great Britain to take up mining work there.  Certainly, as far as I could, I would advise the Minister <Col N="125" /> in cases of that kind not to issue the permits.  If there is any cause for complaint regarding working conditions or if there are people so foolish as to believe that they can get far better conditions in the long run by changing employment, changing from that of an agricultural labourer here to that of an agricultural labourer in Great Britain, or from that of a coal miner here to a coal miner in Great Britain, we should do something to improve the conditions here in order to make it quite clear to our own people who want to be coal miners or agricultural labourers that they are better off at home.  Can nothing be done by the Minister by way of propaganda or by better working conditions for these people, to get them to concentrate on their job; and not alone that, but to get more people into that employment?</P>
    <P>I do not know to what extent the miner's son goes into the same kind of employment.  The average man in any kind of occupation generally advises his son to go into a different kind of job from his own.  You will find that here in the city in industrial employment. The father hardly ever advises the son to take the same job, except in some soft job like that of a solicitor or some other profession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know what view the Minister has on that, or if anything can be done to get some of the rising generation to take more interest in this work and take an active part in it.  I was very glad to hear it said that the operating company in this case did not get anyone to make a decent bid that would enable this Slievardagh mine to pass over to private citizens for profit-making purposes. I dare say they are not prepared to take risks of that kind.  They want 50 or 100 per cent., they want <Col N="126" /> jam all the time, and are not prepared to take risks.  I do not think we should risk the people's money in guaranteeing development and exploratory work in order to hand it over to these lads who want to get rich quick.</P>
      <P>If the Minister has the figures available, perhaps he would tell us the amount given and in what way it is estimated the loss of £414,000 is made up.  If it covers, in the main, wages paid to workers, I do not think it is a loss.  You have 64,000 tons of coal out of it and that certainly brought in some revenue.  At any rate, in carrying out exploratory work in a key industry of this kind, the money paid in wages and salaries to experts or workers is not lost, if in the long run we succeed in proving to the satisfaction of the taxpayers that coal mining can be carried on as a commercial proposition, either under State supervision or by private individuals.  This work would have been done by the British Government when they were here only that they had no interest in developing our industries. It was quite the other way about and that is why this industry as well as others was not looked after.</P>
      <P>I would be sorry to hear from the Minister, even on the advice of experts, that there is no future for the coal-mining business in this country.  All the people who hold the view that there are so many million tons of coal between certain parts of this country and certain other parts cannot be wrong.  Surely the Minister has advisers at his right hand that he can rely upon.  I am sure they must have given him already some preliminary reports in connection with this matter.  I think I heard him mention 5,500,000 tons of coal being available in Slievardagh.  Surely it is well worth carrying out further development work at an increased cost in order to get that 5,500,000 tons, if it is lying in that particular area, even if we have to close down after the whole of that coal has been brought to the surface and burned in the factories or in the homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though it may not be pertinent to the discussion.  I wish to mention that we will have before us in the next few days a Bill entitled the Industrial Efficiency and Prices Bill.  When it becomes law, if it is passed in its present <Col N="127" /> form, we will have a tribunal set up for the purpose of carrying out investigations into the efficiency of our newly-established industries.  I wonder would that be too big a job to give to that particular body as the first attempt to prove their competence.  It would be a big job for them but they would have expert advisers, and when they had settled the question of price to the satisfaction of the Minister they might take on the job as a first attempt to inquire into the efficiency of coal-mining operations at Slievardagh.  If they were permitted to make comparisons with mines operated by private enterprise I would ask Deputy Hughes to read up the speeches made by Deputy McGilligan when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Fine Gael Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House will readily agree that the exploration and development of our national resources is a sound national policy, and that the results of the pioneer work done, generally under emergency conditions, cannot be calculated as a matter of £ s. d.  Surely there is a potential value apart from the product of the particular industry, as to whether it kept the wheels of industry going and gave employment during a most difficult period in our history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Referring to the Slievardagh project, I am fully in agreement with Deputy Davin that there should be no condemnation of what has been done. Quite the contrary.  If the 64,000 tons of coal produced were marketed at £8 per ton, which is the price that has been paid for some time for rather indifferent coal, it would mean a quarter of a million of money for our own coal money paid to our own workers for the develpment of our own resources. I would be very loath to see an industry of that kind, because of the expense involved, left there for private enterprise.  As Deputy Davin suggested, and as the Minister has laid out, the resources there are worth the expenditure of money.  It would be inequitable to compare, as Deputy Hughes has done, this pioneer work with industries of long standing which employed labour at a lower figure than it is to-day.  It is <Col N="128" /> true that when others had charge of the development of this country and ruled over it they had no interest in the development of our industries.  They went so far at times as to buy over some of our industries for the purpose of closing them down.  We have some record of activities in the past which it may serve us to look into.</P>
    <P>There is a very valuable commodity at Rinnevana&mdash;the old lead mines.  At the time of the survey which was made in 1834, ten years before the famine, 400 people were engaged in mining lead there and the mine still exists and it is a question whether at the present day it would be worth working.  I wonder what brought it to an end.  It might be the famine which occurred ten years subsequently.  I think the Minister in this Bill has shown much foresight in making the country conscious of the fact that further production is necessary above the ground and under the ground.  This measure will go a long way to prove to the people of this nation that all-round development is necessary for the good of the people to give continuous employment in our own land.  If the miners at Slievardagh came to the conclusion that after the expenditure of the £50,000 the matter would be left to private enterprise, then the miners would go and when private enterprise would take over they would not be able to get the skilled workers who were trained in those mines.  I think the Government would be wise to continue this and other projects of the kind until such time as adequate means could be got to keep on the mines by private enterprise or otherwise, and I would like to congratulate the Minister on this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I have, like other members of my Party, complained as often as anybody in this House of the squandering of public money on schemes which it was thought would not be of any benefit to this country at the present time or hereafter, but I candidly would not be opposed to spending money on the development of our mineral resources.  We have been led to believe that there has not been much development so far in this country and we have a certain amount of doubt as to what minerals we have in <Col N="129" /> the country, for the simple reason that we have not had a thorough examination of our resources.  When a certain amount of money has been spent developing a coal mine in a particular area I think it would be unfair to criticise the Government for carrying out such a scheme.  We know that in the different enterprises which the Government carry out they cannot be judged alike.  In dealing with a housing problem, for instance, the ground is known and they can see where they are to begin.  In the sinking of a shaft for coal it is hard to touch a seam of coal in the right place.  Even the experts in England very often do not strike the right place but they are not daunted by that; they try again; they see if the amount of minerals available would justify the spending of money.  It is a different problem in the case of private enterprise or monopolies by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am opposed to a certain degree to State monopolies but there are some things in this country that cannot be brought to a successful conclusion without aid from the Government. The mineral resources of the country are the first that should be in a Government monopoly and should take as much money as the Exchequer can afford in procuring the necessary competent engineers from Britain or other parts of the world if necessary to see the amount of coal we have and whether it is worth developing.  It will cost money, we know, but if the money is not spent we do not know whether it is there or not.  It is strange that in England there are many coal mines where the seams of many are pointing in our direction.  We are told that where the seam of coal is pointing the tendency is for the coal to increase rather than decrease.  If we sink our shafts deep enough having taken a proper survey we shall find out whether we have coal worth developing in this country.  Private enterprise will have its uses in every country as well as public enterprise.  Nobody can say that private enterprise will be able to bring about a survey of our mineral resources.  Small factories and industries can be established and carried on satisfactorily by private enterprise.  If <Col N="130" /> it would not pay the Government to interfere in the case of any enterprise they can ignore it and let a private individual carry on as best he can.  Even more money than is proposed should be spent on development of this kind.  We are told that, in the west and along County Sligo, there is an immensity of coal which only requires to be tapped in the proper way.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that he had a staff of French experts over and that that was only one of those deposits which the ordinary man can see on the surface when he walks around, but which, according to the engineers, would not be worth the expenditure of the amount of money which would be required to develop it.  We cannot question the authority of the experts on these matters but I am in complete agreement with the Minister so far as this Bill is concerned.  We heard of money being wasted in carrying out a survey.  Deputy Davin has pointed out that most of the money spent in carrying out a survey of any sort finds its way into the hands of labour.  Workers get a chance of earning this money and it is much better spent in this way than in the payment of doles or other such schemes of which the Government are so fond.  I shall give this experiment every encouragement.  I hope it will prove successful and that the Minister will find it worth his while to spend more money on mineral research and development.</P>

      <P>I did not hear the Minister's introductory statement but, in the explanatory leaflet issued in connection with the Bill, reference is made to the difficulties which the Slievardagh company experienced during the emergency, due to the fact that the deposits were difficult and that it was not easy to recruit skilled labour.  The problem of skilled labour in connection with mineral development will require very careful consideration and planning in advance.  I support this Bill in so far as it makes provision for a fairly comprehensive survey of existing deposits. When the deposits are fully ascertained, the next problem will be to ensure that skilled personnel will he available in the district to carry on the <Col N="131" /> work.  Nobody will deny that men who engage in work of this kind which is dangerous, difficult and arduous, should be amply remunerated</P>
      <P>My attention was drawn to a difficulty in certain coal-mining areas, apart from the question of remuneration. That was that there is not housing accommodation for workers adjacent to many of our mines.  Where there are deposits capable of development, a housing scheme should be embarked upon by this State company or by the company in co-operation with the Department of Local Government. Workers should be housed convenient to their place of work.  That is a very important consideration.  We have in this country a mal-distribution of population.  We have a huge concentration of population in the area around the mouth of the Liffey where there are no underground sources of wealth&mdash;except, perhaps, the black market.  We have also a big concentration of population in some of the western counties, where there are not sufficient sources of employment.  We find, however, that, in areas where there are mineral deposits, workers have often to travel long distances in mountainous and difficult country to their work.  That adds to the hardship of their employment and it is a problem which should be tackled in conjunction with any survey of our minerals which may be undertaken.  An adequate and up-to-date housing scheme should be provided for those workers.  If that were done, we should divert our population to the places where they are urgently required.  That is a branch of national planning which is badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally, this Bill is desirable. There are very conflicting ideas in respect of our mineral resources. When the country was under British control, most people with nationalist ideas believed that our mineral resources were almost unlimited and that they were being concealed by the then Government.  The investigations carried out by the Figgis Commission strengthened that belief.  During the years we have enjoyed, or endured, self-government, we have discovered <Col N="132" /> that our optimistic ideas in regard to the extent of our mineral resources were ill-founded.  There are, however, considerable mineral resources in the country and they should be developed to the utmost extent.  In this connection, we should be prepared to expend a fairly substantial amount of public money, firstly, on a survey, and, secondly, on the development of those resources.  Everything that adds to our country's production or that tends to provide the raw material for industry should be developed.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency of Wicklow there are very considerable mineral deposits.  Perhaps they may be of a somewhat diverse and composite nature but they are all capable of development.  Not only do the excavation sites require it but there is also a need for an adequate plan to produce the various mineral ores and to ensure that they will be of commercial value. While this House will be, I think, always favourable to all investigations and experiments directed towards extending the development of our mineral wealth, we shall, at all times, be very critical of the manner in which the money is used.  We will demand at any rate that the last ounce of value is extracted from expenditure.  We will also demand real efficiency in the work that is to be carried out.  We have not a long history, as compared with other nations, so far as mineral development is concerned.  I consider, however, that we in this country have engineers and geologists as skilled as are to be found in any nation in the world and that, if properly organised and directed, they can give a good account of themselves and thus render good service to the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a number of ways of looking at this measure.  I think the first way is to examine whether, having already expended so much money, the Oireachtas must decide either to cut its losses now or decide whether, having expended either by direct expenditure or incurred by way of loss a total outlay of over £400,000, it is not wiser particularly in present circumstances to spend more money in the hope that further development or further prospecting will reveal <Col N="133" /> not merely more extensive mineral deposits but also hold out some hope of recovery of existing expenditure.  I am not satisfied as to the reliability of the technical advice which is available.  Up to the present, apparently, the technical advice has not proved anything like satisfactory.</P>
      <P>In 1945 the Minister hoped that as a result of further equipment being available and as a result of the experience gathered it would be possible in a short time to produce coal on a larger scale and at a cheaper rate.  Since 1945 coal has come into this country in much larger quantities.  It is true that that coal is at a far higher price than coal ever before imported.  As I see it the question is whether we should continue to incur expenditure on what, so far, has not been very reliable advice in an attempt to produce coal which probably at the present time will be even dearer than the imported coal or whether we can hope for a reduction in the cost of imported coal and chance getting sufficient supplies to meet our requirements.  Before coming to any definite conclusion on this matter we should consider the report of the experts who have surveyed this area.  As far as one can gather the survey does warrant the conclusion that it is possible to develop further and on a more economic basis the Slievardagh coalfield. The fact is that up to the present the House has been left in the dark as to the expenditure incurred and the manner in which the losses occurred.  I think it is somewhat significant that in a number of areas in this country our mineral resources are being developed.  In almost all of these areas it happens for one reason or another that they are being developed by private companies.  It may be that there is, on the part of the various concerns which are operating, more readily available supplies of minerals and that it is possible to work them in a cheaper manner than the coal at Slievardagh.  It is possible, also, that it may be necessary to incur heavy initial expenditure before any coal can be won and that, consequently, the only possible company to do it is the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the House passes this Bill <Col N="134" /> giving further authority to the Minister to make advances to Mianraí Teoranta I consider that we should have a statement of the expenditure incurred to date, detailing under each area&mdash;whether it was at Slievardagh, Avoca or at the Clare phosphate rock deposits&mdash;the expenditure incurred.  Further, I think there should be available to the Committee of Public Accounts for the future details as to the manner in which the expenditure is incurred. It is hardly a fair way to treat the House to expect the members to write off a sum of £414,000 and to expect that we will make a further advance of £50,000, and possibly further advances in the future, without having the accounts of the operations of this company available to the Committee of Public Accounts.  In the present instance, in the light of our emergency experience, nobody will object to this maximum effort, even at the risk of possible further heavy losses, if he is satisfied that a genuine effort is being made to work these mines in a satisfactory way and in an economic fashion.  However, a little over two years ago, when these two companies were amalgamated in Mianraí Teoranta, the House was informed that it was likely that the Slievardagh coalfield could be operated on a more economic basis.  Apparently that hope has not been fulfilled.  Before we vote further money I would like to be assured not merely that this technical advice is the best available but that it warrants confidence in an extension in the activities in Slievardagh and warrants further developments there in the light of the present price of coal&mdash;even at anything from £6 to £8 a ton.  As regards the other developments envisaged under the programme which Mianraí Teoranta has drawn up I think it would be advisable, before the House is committed to this expenditure, to get from Mianraí Teoranta or from the technical experts who have examined this question a report as to the areas and the actual minerals which are available in them.</P>
    <P>My information at the moment is that in the case of at least one company which has started a few years ago and which has expanded considerably there is available a very large deposit <Col N="135" /> of a particular mineral and that it is working satisfactorily.  However, in view of the fact that these companies have had either recent or earlier surveys operated, it is significant that this company has lost so heavily and, at the same time, that the advice available to the Minister from the company and from the survey carried out by the committee of experts still suggests that we should undertake further developments. I think however we ought to be assured that there is available not merely a large deposit of coal in Slievardagh but a reasonable prospect of working it on an economic basis, even considering present inflated prices, and that also there should be a provision inserted in this Bill at a later stage to allow the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the Committee of Public Accounts to examine the operations of this company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The few remarks I wish to make on this Bill would be in a sense complementary to those made by the last speaker because, if we were to discuss the economics of mineral development here, we would get ourselves tied up with something with which we will have to deal in a Bill to which another Deputy has referred. As far as we are concerned with this particular Bill, two things strike one: first, the particular provision with regard to coal development and, secondly, the provision with regard to general mineral development. These two things have to be kept clearly separate in considering this Bill.  I propose to deal with coal development first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment I do not think we have any option.  The question as to whether that coal development is economic or otherwise is hardly a useful question at the moment, for the simple reason that we need the coal, that we must have the coal and, therefore, any coal we have must be produced. Hence, in the circumstances, in the particular case of the Slievardagh coal-mine it is necessary that the working should be continued.  If the Minister is satisfied from the information he has that it is necessary that this company <Col N="136" /> should continue the specific task of producing coal from these mines, then it must be done, and the provision in the Bill covering that point is a necessary provision.</P>
    <P>That is a particular, local, what I might call emergency item in the Bill and it does not admit of argument.  Before I leave it, however, a word about coal development here might not be out of place.  No matter what may be the potentialities of this country in coal&mdash; and you have people arguing both ways&mdash;one fact is clear, that this country is poor in easily accessible coal. In other words, the bulk of whatever coal is there will be made available only by relatively complex and extensive workings.  That fact should be realised and that fact, of course, will have a big influence on the economics of coal production here; but again, as I say, it is unnecessary to dwell on that point at the moment because, for the moment, and, it would appear, for some time in the future also, we want every bit of coal we can produce and it is the coal itself which is the wealth, not the money that it represents.  If we cannot generate the power or have the fuel that is necessary then a stock of money will be of no use to us.  For that reason we are not in a position to criticise a provision of this nature at the moment and, on the general principle of not changing horses while crossing a stream, the Minister is very wise in leaving the provision as he has it.</P>
    <P>With regard to general mineral development, on the surface, we have not got easily accessible minerals as far as one can gather from the surveys.  Some of the minerals that we have are not in positions favourable for immediate, economic mining.  The ultimate question in regard to them will be somewhat similar to the present question in regard to coal: whether our requirements are of such a nature as to make it imperative on us to have them.  If that is the position, mine them we must at all costs.  If on the other hand our needs are not imperative and we look to these minerals for export, say as a bargaining power, then all the usual economic factors come into the picture. We cannot decide either of these points until we know what we are talking <Col N="137" /> about.  A survey for minerals is necessarily a tedious and difficult task.  Ireland is not a recently discovered country. Her surface is pretty well known. As in the case of coal, we have a fair knowledge of the minerals that are available on the surface.  It is what is deep down that matters, what is not immediately accessible, what there is a chance of finding.  The discovery and the appraising of the value of such deposits is not a simple task.  There are, roughly speaking, two methods.  One is to dig to find out.  Digging takes time, labour, money and a certain amount of skill is involved in knowing where to dig.  The alternative method is to call in the aids of certain branches of physics, geophysics, and so forth. They supply an alternative method by which you can make a fair shot at what is under the surface by magnetic and electrical measurements and all that kind of thing.  That again takes time but I should imagine that the snag here, apart from the time factor, is that it takes specially trained personnel and special equipment.  The training of the personnel and the securing of equipment must be expected to take time.  So we cannot quarrel with the Minister if he cannot in a fortnight give us a complete survey.  The problem is radically and totally different from a mapping problem which can be done relatively quickly.  That should be realised.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave was doubtful about the value of the Minister's technical advisers.  I have no knowledge as to his mining advisers but I have a little information as to his advisers on the geophysical and what I might call the scientific approach to the problem, and I think Deputy Cosgrave need have no doubt about their value.  They are conservative. The very fact that we have not been hearing much about it is a point in their favour because, unfortunately, in the past this country has suffered much from those who found, say, one pebble of promising ore and made so much about it as to magnify the position out of all proportion to what was there and thus create a wrong impression.  Such people have done nearly as much harm as those who said we could not exploit our own resources at all.  It is a job to be done <Col N="138" /> thoroughly, scientifically and methodically, and in most cases no answer can be furnished until the work has been completed.</P>
    <P>We would ask the Minister, however, to ensure that these people are given facilities, as far as we can give them facilities, to do the work in a practical way.  There is no sense in having experts nominally there charged with the job if you do not make it possible for them to do the job.  Energetic steps will have to be taken to get properly trained personnel and to get proper equipment for this work.  I would ask as a corollary too that that would be looked after, and that an energetic drive be then made to complete the survey.  Considerable energy should be put into the matter.  It would be helpful to us if, say, in some limited time the House was informed as to progress. After all, if the work is being pressed energetically forward and if, ultimately, we can get within a minimum time a proper survey completed, then the fact or otherwise of interim reports is hardly important.</P>
    <P>These are the only few remarks that I have to make on the Bill which, I think, should be passed.  It has to be remembered when dealing with criticisms of past expenditure that prospecting work and research work of this nature&mdash;preliminary work&mdash;will always involve expenditure, and that the returns for it must always, in the first place, be postponed for a number of years; and secondly, that the returns will be conditional upon what is actually found.  You cannot guarantee in advance what will be found.  In case there should be recriminations and criticisms, as there have been of the old Act about mining, in future debates, let us make it quite clear that we are accepting this as exploration in so far as mineral development and exploration are concerned, and that this Bill is to provide the machinery and the power to carry out that exploration as well as the ascertainment of the knowledge requisite to develop our mineral resources, if any.  If we draw a blank, then that is nobody's fault.  It is simply so because the things are not there.  If, on the other hand, it has profitable results, then the community <Col N="139" /> and the country as a whole will be the richer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it was quite fair for Deputy Hughes to register such surprised disappointment at the revelation that the operations of Mianraí Teoranta in the production of phosphate rock and other minerals showed a loss.  Everyone here knew that they were producing these minerals at a loss.  At any time during the war years, when the company was producing these minerals and earning a loss, it was open to Deputies in the House to propose that the work should cease.  Nobody ever proposed that the work should cease.  It is hardly fair at this stage for Deputies to criticise the Government for having allowed the company to continue that work and to acquire that loss when they themselves would have strongly opposed a cessation of operations at an earlier period. I do not know how you are going to measure the loss of producing pyrites in circumstances of great difficulty and with inadequate equipment.  Pyrites are essential for the manufacture of superphosphate.  The lack of superphosphate and of other fertilisers was one of our main problems during the war.  There was a period during which we could not import pyrites from anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What then was the proper value to put upon the pyrites that we were producing for ourselves, and what would we have paid for a similar tonnage of pyrites imported from somewhere else? When, in fact, we did succeed in importing pyrites from Spain we paid fantastic prices for them, prices far in excess of the price which this company was obtaining.  The same applies as far as phosphate rock is concerned.  We were able to import some phosphate rock from Florida and other places during the war but at a very high price. The total quantity of it yielded superphosphate that was far below our needs, so that, in the effort to supplement what we were getting in, we engaged in the production of our own phosphate rock here.  In doing so, we had to have regard not to the loss on production and on the sale of it by Mianraí Teoranta <Col N="140" /> but rather to our absolute and urgent need for fertilisers.</P>
    <P>The same is true as far as coal is concerned.  This company was never allowed to charge for our coal what we are now paying for American coal of similar quality.  If the company had been allowed to charge for the coal the price which we are now paying for American coal delivered here, there would have been very little loss to record. What was the coal worth to us? That is the point of view from which the Government considered this question of loss.  We could have suspended operations.  If we had suspended operations then we would have had to do without supplies which we regarded as essential, and for which we were prepared to pay very high prices when they became available abroad.  As Deputy Davin and other Deputies pointed out, the money that was expended was expended partly upon mineral exploration which was associated with the production activities of the company.  In any event, the expenditure of that money gave valuable employment in areas where it was certainly desired.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have spoken in a manner to suggest either that they misunderstood the source of the loss or its relevance to the production of coal at Slievardagh.  The loss to which I referred represented the whole of the loss endured by the company in all its operations during the war.  It would not be correct to ascribe the whole loss to the coal produced at Slievardagh, nor is it possible to indicate in a precise way the loss per ton of coal.  At Slievardagh this company was partially engaged in development there and only partially in productive work.  Deputy Hughes quoted me as saying that the first shaft sunk by the company was in the wrong place.  That is only partially correct.  At an early stage the company came to me and put on me the responsibility of making the decision which they were facing.  They pointed out that if they developed the coal at Slievardagh in the manner of which any reputable coal-mining engineer would approve, it might be two years or longer before they would be producing coal in any quantity.  They <Col N="141" /> said that that method of development was what they should recommend as the custodians of the property for the purpose of ensuring its long-term development and economical operation in normal circumstances.  They said to me that, if we wanted coal urgently and did not care how we got it, it meant a rather unsuitable form of development at Slievardagh, and that they would have then to go about it in another way.  I gave them a direction to go after coal in the maximum quantity possible by whatever method would get it quickest, and not to have regard at that stage to the problems of long-term development.  That did mean that the methods of opening up the coal at Slievardagh and the development of the company's workings there were less suitable for economic long-term development than they might in more leisurely and more normal circumstances have adopted.  The cost of doing that must also be regarded as emergency expenditure which must be written off now that we are trying to get back to normal commercial work.</P>
    <P>In the main, however, the difficulty about giving a precise figure for loss per ton produced arises from the fact that a large part of the expenditure of the company was in exploration and development rather than in commercial exploitation and they did not keep their accounts in such a form as would enable it to segregate one form of expenditure from another.  I have explained, however, that Mianraí Teoranta remained in the coal-mining business merely because nobody would buy the mines.  We tried to sell them. I would have preferred that Mianraí Teoranta would be confined in its activities in the future to the exploration and development work for which it was originally set up.  It entered into these mining operations during the war because nobody else would do it.  When Deputy Cogan or other Deputies refer to the fact that some private firms are engaged in coal-mining activities here and making a profit out of it, whereas the State company was making a loss, the explanation is obvious.  The only mining operations which were left to the State company to do were those which private enterprise <Col N="142" /> would not touch because they were bound to make a loss, and the State went into these operations, not because it was anxious to engage in that type of enterprise, but because the products which might be won were urgently required during the war.</P>
    <P>As soon as the war ended, as soon as supplies of phosphate rock from North Africa, our normal source of supply, became available and other supplies of pyrites became procurable at a lower price, we closed down on the activities of the company in Clare and Wicklow and it continued at Slievardagh merely to facilitate us in our desire to dispose of that undertaking as a going concern. Nobody offered to buy it as a going concern and we were faced then with the necessity of making the decision whether we would close down in Slievardagh also.  In coming to a decision on that point, we had regard to two factors: one being the need for all the coal we could get and the second the prospect, based upon the expert advice available to the company, of opening up at Slievardagh more profitable and easily workable seams which would make commercial operations there in the future likely to be more successful and which, if developed, would facilitate us in our aim of disposing of the property.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes has also some misunderstanding concerning the other and main activities of Mianraí, Teoranta.  Its main activities in the future will be exploration and development work which will bring the development work in relation to any mineral resources which are located to the point at which commercial exploitation might begin.  We have in mind, however, that a commercial development should be by private enterprise. That does not mean, as Deputy Davin assumed, that we will hand over the benefit of all our development expenditure to some private company.  It means that we have developed our own property, because these mineral resources are State property, to the stage at which we can get a fair price for them from those who are prepared to lease them for development.  Certainly, the terms of the lease which would be granted to any private firm developing <Col N="143" /> the resources would be sufficient to recover our development expenditure and to provide for the State the royalty which it expects to get out of these mineral resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to answer a question of that kind because I do not know what the circumstances are likely to be, or even what the deposits are likely to be, or what the normal rate would be to develop a particular mineral in a particular area.  The amount of mineral there presumably would be limited and the development would go on until the deposit was exhausted.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes asked me for the names of the directors.  The present directors of Mianraí Teoranta are as follows: The chairman is Mr. P.S. Brady; the managing director is Mr. F.F. O'Kelly; and the other directors are: Mr. D.W. Bishop, who is the director of the geological survey; Mr. P.J. Fleming, who is associated with several mining enterprises in the country; Professor M.A. Hogan; Mr. Art Ó Briain, who has qualifications as a mining engineer; Mr. A.J. Woods, also an engineer.  The board of directors will be responsible for directing the activities of the company.  They will have at Slievardagh a mine manager and a local executive staff who will be responsible for all the normal directorial duties arising there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to enter into the more general discussion which Deputy Davin tried to initiate on the development of our coal resources generally.  There are problems in that regard, many of which were mentioned by the Deputy: the difficulty of getting a sufficient number of skilled coal-face workers; the problem of housing in the vicinity of the mines, and the procuring of machinery. But I would not think it probable that we can effect a very substantial expansion in our total coal production for some time to come, and perhaps not at all, even from the existing works.  There is an economic rate of work in any coal measure, and it is not always possible to go faster than that rate without <Col N="144" /> causing a great deal of trouble, including trouble for the workers who might be attracted into that occupation and who might be left unemployed at a later stage.  Clearly any well-devised plan for the working of further coal deposits should contemplate the production of coal at a rate which will ensure the continuance of activity in the area over a reasonable period of time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Commons indicated that he would be prepared to contemplate even a larger expenditure than the Bill provides for in the exploration of mineral resources.  The total amount provided in this Bill represents the estimated expenditure on a scheme of expansion which has been prepared by the board on the basis of expert advice obtained by it.  Deputy Cosgrave asked for the names of the expert advisers of the board in relation to its development programme.  The programme has been prepared on the technical advice of Professor Ritson, who is an eminent British mining engineer; Professor Odman, an equally eminent Swedish geologist; Professor W.R. Jones, an eminent British geologist; Mr. W. Wilson, a British mining engineer, and Mr. Andrew Pearson, a consulting engineer.</P>
    <P>Based on the expert advice obtained from these advisers, the board has prepared a programme.  That programme, based on present costs, wages and similar assumptions, will cost the amount indicated in the Bill.  They will get that amount at the rate of £85,000 per year over seven years, and they will be expected so to time their activities that they will be fully covered by the expenditure of £85,000 which they receive in the year.  If costs should fall, they may be able to do more; if costs should rise, they will have to do less; but, in any event, they will get £85,000 a year, and no more, and will be expected to have the development programme which they have drawn up completed within seven years.  In reply to Deputy de Valera, I may say that arrangements have been made and there is a section of the Bill which provides for the submission of a full report of the progress of their researches to the Dáil every year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave was, I think, inclined to make the error of assuming <Col N="145" /> that the production of coal at Slievardagh will be the company's main activity in the future.  The company is only remaining in the coal-mining business largely because of the accidental circumstances to which I refer.  It will get for the development of this commercial undertaking a further capital sum of £50,000, and no more.  I want to make that clear, because if the company cannot, in the course of a reasonable period and with the expenditure of that sum, get Slievardagh into a condition where its revenue is equal to its outgoings, it will certainly have to be abandoned.  The trouble with any mining undertaking is that it is never possible to stop the expenditure of money on exploration.  The private individual stops when his money gives out, but the State, with unlimited resources, can be tempted to keep on putting money into exploration work because, every time you go down into the ground, you find new indications which suggest that further exploration should be done in other directions.</P>
    <P>We cannot have, in this particular instance, that unlimited expenditure on development.  I say &ldquo;in this particular instance&rdquo; because coal-mining here is different from other mining activities.  It is carried on by a very large number of private firms of different sizes and it is not therefore essential that the State should pour a lot of money into exploration of one particular locality, except perhaps in abnormal times like the present.  If progress cannot be made to profitable commercial working, within the limit of the expenditure we have set ourselves, we must make up our minds that we will go no further.  We can leave it to the other privately-owned workings to carry on and provide us with such internal supplies of coal as are possible.</P>
    <P>In other cases, circumstances may be different.  The gypsum deposit in the Monaghan-Cavan area is being explored by the Geological Survey at the moment.  It has very substantial industrial possibilities and it is clearly a very valuable deposit.  There is probably no other deposit like it in Europe, and it is already the basis of very considerable industrial development <Col N="146" /> in that area and can be exploited for industrial purposes to an extent far in advance of anything that has been visualised up to now.  Therefore, I think we are fully justified in opening up that deposit and in exploring its extent and quality as intimately as possible.  The State is doing that.</P>

      <P>Mianraí Teoranta will not be in that area at all, but if, in some other locality&mdash;the mineralised area of County Wicklow, of North Tipperary or any other areas where there are prospects&mdash;the first survey shows the likelihood of a sizeable mineral deposit, then Mianraí Teoranta will go in to develop it to the stage at which it can prove the existence of substantial bodies of ore, indicate the exact composition and value of the ore, and give to private enterprise all the knowledge and information which it may require to decide whether successful commercial working is possible or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main point, however, in adverting to Deputy Cosgrave's reference to Slievardagh was to give some other information.  The expert report upon which the Slievardagh working was begun was in fact published.  At least, it was published in the sense that a copy of the report was made available in the library of the Geological Survey, open to public inspection.  It is still there.  The further development of the Slievardagh area has been directed by the engineers of Mianraí Teoranta itself and they probably know a great deal more about the deposit than any firm of consulting engineers can possibly <Col N="147" /> acquire because of their intimate associations with the working of it. The firm of engineers was a very eminent one.  I recollect that, at the time, we asked our representatives abroad to give us the name of the most eminent firm of coal-mining engineers in the world and it was on that basis that the particular firm which produced the report was chosen.</P>
    <P>The picture, therefore, that I want to give of the future activities of Mianraí Teoranta is this: It will engage in coal-mining in Tipperary indefinitely if it can put coal-mining on a profitable basis and for a limited period if it cannot.  If it can get it on a profitable basis, I think we will try again to dispose of the property to some private interest; if it cannot get it going on a profitable basis after another sum of £50,000 has been expended, we will close down.  The main work of Mianraí Teoranta in future will be this exploration and development work.  That will be done in accordance with a systematic plan, involving the continuation of activities for seven years at a certain steady pace and involving the expenditure of £85,000 a year for that period.  At the end of that seven years' period, we should have a complete picture of the mineral resources of the country which will enable us to decide to what extent we should develop them commercially now and hold them as a sort of strategic reserve against another war or to what extent they are of no value either for commercial exploitation or reserve purposes.</P>
    <P>The company has acquired losses through having been given the responsibility in the war period of producing phosphate rock, pyrites and coal, regardless of cost.  These losses are now being wiped out.  The company will start off therefore with a capital which will be represented by assets valued for what they are worth at the moment, such additional capital as may be advanced in respect of Slievardagh up to a limit of £50,000 and this right to obtain non-repayable advances of £85,000 per year for seven years. What happens at the end of seven years, the Dáil will have to decide.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> Deputy Hughes appeared to me to suggest that if the company finds workable deposits and wants to work them, it should go ahead and do so, and that the Bill should provide for that possibility. I do not think it should.  If workable deposits are located and developed to the point at which they can be worked, and if it is decided that this company or any other State organisation should work them rather than that they should be leased to private enterprise, the Dáil should have an opportunity of expressing its view on the matter.  As this Bill stands, Mianraí Teoranta could not do so. There would have to be other legislation which would enable the Dáil to decide whether it wanted the deposit worked in that way or in some other way.  I think that is as it should be. I want no ambiguity in anybody's mind as to the view of the Government.  It is that if workable deposits are located and developed to a point at which they can be exploited, they should be leased on some satisfactory basis to private concerns rather than that they should be exploited by Mianraí Teoranta.</P>

    <Title>Local Government (Superannuation) Bill, 1947&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to provide a new superannuation code for persons in the service of local authorities.  So far as these bodies themselves are concerned the provisions of the Bill are in general mandatory in respect of officers and adoptive in respect of servants.  This new code will apply to all pensionable officers entering the service of these authorities after the commencement of the Act, and it will also apply to such existing officers, being under 60 years of age, or, in the case of fire brigade officers 55 years, as may opt to accept it.  Local authorities may decide in the exercise of their powers under Section 5 to adopt Part III of the Act and in that event Part III will <Col N="149" /> apply to their servants.  Where existing servants can under permanent legislation obtain pensions at present they will have the same right of option, subject to age, as existing officers have.</P>
      <P>The main provisions relating to officers will be found in Part II of the Bill; those relating to servants will be found in Part III.  Part IV contains a number of miscellaneous ancillary provisions applicable in the main to both classes, and Part I contains the definitions and the usual preliminary and general provisions, including Section 3, according to which regulations made are to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and Sections 4 and 5, which provide for the coming into operation of Parts II and III respectively.  So far as Parts II and III are concerned it will be noted that whereas Section 4 provides that Part II shall come into operation when the Minister makes an Order to that effect, Part III only comes into operation when the local authority concerned passes the necessary resolution and fulfils the conditions prescribed by Section 5.</P>
      <P>To qualify for pension reckoned on the full period of actual service an officer must have served with diligence and fidelity.  The deliberate unauthorised absence of an officer or servant from his place of work or from his duties will operate to extinguish any period of pensionable service which may have accrued to him previous to such absence.  An established officer or an established servant who goes on strike will forfeit his previous pensionable service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To become eligible for a pension a person must be in the permanent employment of a local authority, and, with certain exceptions, he must devote the whole of his working time to the local service.  The exceptions obtain in the case of permanent officers who by reason of their office or employment are required to be medical doctors, nurses or midwives or who prior to the Local Government Act of 1919 were appointed standing solicitors to local bodies. The condition of wholetime service is likewise waived in the case of a person who prior to the passing of the Local Government Act, 1925, had been appointed <Col N="150" /> to be a compounder of medicine for the purpose of the Acts governing the relief of the poor.  With these exceptions whole-time service must be rendered in order to qualify for a pension.</P>
    <P>These in brief are the fundamental conditions upon which the Bill is based. They may be summed up in these words: Faithful, diligent, and, in general, whole-time service is requisite in order to qualify for a normal pension, while if an officer or servant goes on strike, that action will involve the loss of any previous pensionable service that he could otherwise have reckoned.</P>
    <P>The next salient feature of the proposals is the fact that a contribution will be required of new entrants whether officers or servants.  This contribution will be 5 per cent. of the annual remuneration or earnings of the person concerned.  Provision is made for a refund of contributions in certain circumstances, which as regards officers are set out in Section 30 and, as regards servants, will be found in Section 53.  With regard to the amount of the contribution proposed, I should say that it will defray not more than one-third of the aggregate cost of pensions and other allowances which will be obtainable under the Bill.  The deficiency will be met in general by the local authorities or, in the exceptional type of case to which Sections 17 or 78 apply, by the Minister for Finance and the local authority concerned.</P>
    <P>Now, not only are contributors entitled to the refund of their contributions, as I have mentioned, but under Section 31 persons who, having been established officers of a local authority, have secured the return of their contributions on relinquishing office, may, if they should again be appointed to an established post, secure the reinstatement of their previous pensionable service by repaying the contributions which were returned to them.  In this way it will be possible to recognise for pension satisfactory service with a local authority or authorities even though such service may have been interrupted.</P>
    <P>In the case of officers, the pensions and other allowances granted under the <Col N="151" /> scheme approximate to those granted to civil servants, and will take the form of a lump sum payment and an annual allowance.  The lump sum will be reckoned at the rate of 1/30th of the officer's retiring salary for each year of pensionable service but will be limited to a maximum of 1½ times that salary.  The annual allowance will be made at the rate of 1/80th for each year of pensionable service but will not, in any case, exceed one-half of the retiring salary.  This limit will not, however, apply to allowances to be granted under Section 73 to officers or servants of local authorities whose retirement may be due to injury incurred in the discharge of their duty or to certain specified dependents in the event of death from such injuries.</P>
    <P>In the case of servants, the superannuation terms are somewhat different, since in their case there is very much to be said in favour of making the annual allowance as large as possible in relation to the retiring pay.  Accordingly, servants of local authorities under the scheme will not receive a lump sum on retirement, but their pensions will be calculated at the rate of 1/60th, instead of 1/80th, of their wage on retirement, and their maximum pensions, except in cases of retirement due to injury in the discharge of duty, will be two-thirds, instead of one-half, of that wage.  The sixtieths, of course, will be multiplied by the total number of years of pensionable service.  The sections in the Bill which govern the determining of lump sums and allowances are 23 and 24 in the case of officers and 47 in the case of servants.</P>
    <P>As well as permitting the payment of allowances on retiring, the present Bill, by Sections 26 and 49, respectively, proposes to permit the payment of gratuities to the legal personal representatives of deceased established officers and servants.  As an extension of this, Sections 27 and 50 provide that where a retired officer or servant dies before the total amount received by him in the form of lump sum and annual allowances is equal to the pensionable remuneration which he was receiving at the date of his retirement, the local <Col N="152" /> authority concerned may grant to his legal personal representative such a gratuity as will make good the difference between the deceased's retiring pensionable remuneration and the total of the sum paid to him on foot of the lump sum and the annual allowance paid up to the date of death.</P>
    <P>Female officers or servants of local authorities, who retire from their employment on marriage or with the intention of getting married, and who have not less than five years' pensionable service, will be entitled under Section 28 or Section 51 of the Bill to a gratuity, calculated at the rate of one-twelfth of their pensionable remuneration multiplied by the number of years of pensionable service which they have given, subject, of course, to an over-riding maximum.</P>
    <P>Hitherto, the position of officers who may have passed from the service of a local authority to the service of the State, or vice versa, has been very unsatisfactory from the officers' point of view, in so far as pensionable service which had accrued previous to the change was forfeited, except in the special cases covered by Section 51 of the Local Government Act, 1925.  That section enabled officers of local bodies who, after the 6th December, 1922, were appointed to permanent situations in the Civil Service, the duties of which related to the same matters as the duties of the office under the local body, to have retiring allowances in respect of the local service fixed by the local body at the time when they entered the Civil Service.  No similar arrangement operated to deal with movement from the Civil Service to the local bodies and, as I have mentioned, the terms of Section 51 of the Local Government Act, 1925, made it necessary to establish a relation between the duties of the post in the local authority with the post in the Civil Service.  The Bill, in Sections 17, 78, 79, 80 and 83, contains provisions which will enable that situation to be remedied.  An officer of a local authority with not less than ten years' pensionable service who is appointed in future to an established post in the Civil Service will be entitled to reckon for the purposes of the Civil Service Superannuation Acts <Col N="153" /> his period of pensionable service with local authorities.  In the case of a civil servant becoming an officer of a local authority the consent of the Minister for Finance and the local authority must be obtained to the application of these benefits to his case.  These specific consents will not be necessary, of course, to cover past cases.</P>
    <P>Under Section 14 of the Bill, an established officer of a local authority who has moved from the service of one local authority to another will be entitled to aggregate for pension purposes his separate periods of service with the local authorities concerned. There is, however, an important reservation in this regard; if he served with another local authority for less than two years, then that service will not count for pension unless with the written sanction of the local authority concerned, and with the consent of the appropriate Minister, it was terminated by resignation.  In the debate on my Estimate, several Deputies complained of the frequency with which in latter years officers have been transferring their services from one local authority to another.  The provision which I have just mentioned should tend to discourage this, for I can assure you that, so far as the Minister for Local Government is concerned, the requisite consent will not be lightly given.</P>
    <P>Great difficulty has been experienced in framing Part III of the Bill, which contains the provisions relating to servants of local authorities.  Deputies know, of course, that, though we have established some measure of uniformity so far as pay is concerned, conditions of employment vary as between one local authority and another.  The problem was to devise a scheme which would be generally applicable to all conditions.</P>
    <P>The fundamental decision to be taken was as to the conditions which a servant of a local authority must fulfil in order to qualify for establishment. This brought me face to face with the problem of the road-workers and similar outdoor employees, whose service may be interrupted by the weather. Now, it would be nonsensical to grant pensions for merely casual services.  It <Col N="154" /> would be equally nonsensical to grant pensions to men employed on relief works out of the public bounty.  Yet it would have been invidious to debar from the benefits of the measure employees who, in general, were in fairly constant employment, but who were subject at intervals to recurring discharge and re-employment because of the nature of their work.  These workers, though not, in the strict sense of the word, permanently employed or continuously employed, are described by local custom as permanent men.  I have endeavoured to meet this difficulty, as will be seen from Section 59. (4) and a corresponding sub-section (3) in Section 38, by providing that if a servant having obtained pensionable status is employed for at least 200 days in any year, the period worked will count for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>In order to secure pensionable status, a servant of a local authority must have been in its permanent service for a continuous period of three years. When this condition has been fulfilled, his name shall be entered by the local authority concerned in its register of established servants, in pursuance of Section 36 (2) of the Bill, if the maximum number of established servants prescribed by the local authority under Section 5 has not been reached.  If during any of the three relevant years, a permanent servant of a local authority should have been temporarily absent from employment because of illness, temporary cessation of work, temporary short-time employment or other similar cause, not arising from his own act or default, he will nevertheless be entitled, under Section 57, to have his name entered on the register, provided that the aggregate of such absences does not exceed two months in any of those years.  Section 57 applies both to new entrants into the service of a local authority, and to existing servants.  Under sub-section (2) of Section 57, service on duty with the Reserve Force will count as permanent service with the local authority concerned.</P>
    <P>As will be seen from Sections 22 and 46, an officer or servant of a local authority on attaining the age of 60 years may, if he so elects, retire on <Col N="155" /> pension, provided he has not less than 20 years of pensionable local service to his credit, and has fulfilled the other conditions prescribed by the measure. In the case of officers and servants of fire brigades, the age for voluntary retirement on pension is 55.  I trust the purport of the relevant provisions in these cases will not be misunderstood. They do not compel the person concerned to retire at 60 years of age; they merely provide that, if he does wish to retire at that age, he will be entitled, having fulfilled the other essential conditions, to a retiring allowance. In fact, the normal age for compulsory retirement of pensionable officers, as fixed by Order under Section 23 of the Local Government Act, 1941, is at present 65.  Perhaps I should call attention to the fact that, under Section 58 of the Bill, the provisions of this section of the Local Government Acts will be extended to cover established servants of local authorities, so that the appropriate Minister will be empowered to fix age limits for such employees also.  Similar powers are taken under Section 77 of the Bill to fix age limits for the officers and servants of the Dublin Fever Hospital Board and the Cork Fever Hospital Board when it comes into existence. Though the general scheme of retiring allowances will be on a contributory basis, with the exceptions I have already mentioned, it is not considered necessary to create any special fund into which these contributions must be paid.  Arrangements will, however, be made as part of the ordinary accounting arrangements of the local authorities, to keep records of the income from contributions and the expenditure on superannuation.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of miscellaneous provisions dealing with what may be regarded as unusual circumstances. Thus, under Sections 68 and 84, provision is made to cover the cases of officers of vocational education committees who had previously held posts as national teachers or as secondary teachers, so that this previous teaching service might be reckoned for pension purposes; while under Section 34 the position of established officers who, prior to 1924 had given whole-time <Col N="156" /> service as teachers of Irish under the direction of the Gaelic League, is similarly dealt with.</P>
    <P>Under Section 73, power is taken to make regulations which will enable gratuities or allowances to be paid to officers or servants, whether in the pensionable class or not, who may be compelled to retire through injury caused in the actual discharge of duty and specifically attributable to the nature of such duty.  Furthermore, should an officer to whom this provision applies die within seven years after the date of his injury, and should his death be the direct result of such injury, then gratuities or allowances may be paid to his widow and children and to his mother if she has been wholly dependent on him.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of sections granting rights of appeal to established officers and established servants. The general principle of Ministerial responsibility as regards appeals is that the particular Minister concerned in questions of status shall decide appeals on failure to register the name of an officer or servant.  Appeals against the removal of a name from the register will be dealt with on the same principles.  Thus, the Minister for Agriculture will deal with appeals of this kind from officers and servants of committees of agriculture and the Minister for Education will deal with officers and servants of vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>Appeals against failures to grant lump sums or allowances or to return contributions or against the amount of lump sums, allowances or gratuities will be dealt with under Section 69 by the Minister for Local Government, who is the Minister responsible under the Bill for sanctioning lump sums, allowances and gratuities.</P>
    <P>Special provision is made in the Bill to deal with the position of officers or servants who retired after November 1st, 1946.  This will be found in Section 75.  Under this section, local authorities may increase the allowances to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister.  The justification for this provision is that the age limit has operated to retire a number of officers before the post-emergency adjustment of their pay was effected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> Provision is made under Sections 64, 65 and 71 for the cancellation, reduction or suspension of pensions in special circumstances which arise only rarely in the case of the generality of public officers, but which nevertheless have to be provided for.  In substance, these are the main provisions of the Bill in so far as they affect the officers concerned. Likewise, they affect the local authorities and the ratepayers and I should not be doing my duty if I did not point out to the House that the financial implications of a Bill of this kind are important and will, no doubt, be carefully pondered on by the representatives of the ratepayers, as well as by the officers and servants affected.  In the absence of a special review of the service of every employee, it is not possible to give precise figures, but, if all local authorities give effect to the measure, I think it is safe to assume that not more than 8,000 persons may become pensionable for the first time. This represents about two-fifths of those normally employed on road-work and such like by the local authorities. If we accept such experience as we have had as a reliable guide, we may take it that the maximum number of new pensions to be provided for under the Bill at any time will be between 1,300 and 1,400.  The additional cost of these will vary with the level of wages but I think that, in the future, so far as we can forecast, it is unlikely to rise above £100,000&mdash;a figure which will not, of course, be reached for a number of years.  The present position, if we exclude mental hospital staffs which are in a special category, having their own scheme, is that the local authorities pay out about £228,000 per annum in retiring allowances and gratuities.</P>
    <P>Eventually, therefore, under the powers conferred by the Bill, this figure may be increased by about 44 per cent. I should emphasise that, so far as each local authority is concerned, the burdens which will be imposed under the Act will depend entirely on the elected representatives of the ratepayers.  As I have already pointed out, Part III of the Bill merely gives power to such local authorities as do not already possess it to provide for the superannuation of their servants.  If a local <Col N="158" /> authority desires to avail of that power, then, in accordance with Section 5 of the Bill, it must decide by formal resolution to adopt Part III of the Act as from a specified date.  If it is intended to propose such a resolution, due notice of that intention must be given in writing to the Minister and to every member of the local authority concerned.  Furthermore, the resolution must declare the maximum number of persons who, for the purposes of the Act, may be regarded as permanent servants in the employment of the local authority.  The adoption of such resolution will not rest with the manager or the Minister; it will be a reserved function of the elected members who, before adopting it, will, naturally, consider not only the claims of their servants but the taxable capacity of their ratepayers.  I have no doubt that they will be able to come to decisions which will be equitable to both parties.  These are the main provisions of the Bill and I confidently recommend it to the acceptance of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are told that this Bill is being introduced to meet a general demand for reform of the existing superannuation law, so far as it applies to the officers of local authorities. There is no doubt that the Minister has dealt with the subject in very radical fashion.  He has made almost revolutionary changes in the existing superannuation code.  In addition to officers he has introduced a provision for the payment of pensions to a new class not hitherto covered by existing legislation.  As he rightly says, this is going to add very considerably to the financial obligations of local authorities. The Bill places the employees of local authorities in an almost identical position with that of civil servants except that the civil servant must work until he is 65 years of age before he can draw his pension, but apparently the Minister and his officers have come to the decision&mdash;for what reason I do not know&mdash;that the employee of a local authority is unable to work beyond 60 years of age.  Why there should be any discrimination between a local official and a civil <Col N="159" /> servant in that respect I do not know. The Minister offered no explanation. Perhaps he will explain when he is replying why this differentiation has been made between the employee of the local authority and the civil servant. I would be inclined to say that if the civil servant is capable of working and of giving good service to the State until he is 65 years of age, then the majority of local authority officials should be capable of giving even longer years of service to their authorities.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, this Bill should be made retrospective.  It got a first reading, I think, in April last.  Between April and October quite a number of officials must have retired from the local service.  As far as I can see, there is no provision in the Bill to cover or to provide pensions for those servants who have retired between April and October of this year.  What steps does the Minister propose to take to cover the cases of those officials?  It seems to me that their case deserves special consideration. The Dáil is not responsible for the delay in giving a second reading to this Bill and the Minister, solely, must accept that responsibility. I consider that there is a moral obligation on him to make provision for the cases I have just mentioned.  There is a levy of 5 per cent. on new officers entering the local service.  Why the Minister selected 5 per cent.  I do not know.  Why not 2 per cent., 3 per cent. or 4 per cent. rather than 5 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not 10 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>But why 5 per cent?  It seems to me that 5 per cent. is higher, for instance, than the annuity one would have to pay on an insurance policy.  It seems to me also that it is unfair that a new entrant should pay 5 per cent of a levy each year while the officer who is in just six months escapes scotfree.  I cannot understand what reason was in the Minister's mind for drawing a distinction between the beginner and the latter type of individual. In equity, I consider that there should be no distinction between the two.  The Minister, in his opening statement, did not try to justify the imposition of that particular levy.  The <Col N="160" /> same levy applies to servants to whom it is also proposed to pay pensions.  I should like the Minister, when replying, to deal in much more detail with this question of a levy and to give a reason why 5 per cent. was selected and why the beginner should pay, and why the other individuals under Section 2 should escape scotfree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are just a few more details in connection with the Bill upon which I should like the Minister to throw some further light.  Under this Bill a register must be kept of the names of officials entitled to pensions.  That register will be open to the inspection of the officers of the particular local authority as well as to members of that local authority. Further on, provision is made for the removal of names and for the restoration of names on that register, but no reason is to be assigned.  Apparently a name can be removed arbitrarily and the official responsible for that makes a note of the date on which the name is removed but there is no obligation to give any reason for the removal.  If the name is restored the procedure is almost identical.  The official puts it back and that is all about it.  If the register is to be really effective, some reason, in fairness to the local authorities and as a matter of fact to the person concerned, should briefly be given for the removal and if the name is to be subsequently restored, the reasons should also be given.  If the register is to serve any useful purpose at all, it should be kept in such a manner as to give in brief the history of the case so far as the man who has a right to a pension is concerned.  In Section 32 we have the definition of the word &ldquo;salary&rdquo;.  Under this section payments for overtime will be excluded for pension purposes as also travelling expenses and payments for acting as clerk to a local pensions committee or to a sub-committee appointed by such committee.  I can understand why payments for overtime and for travelling expenses should be excluded but I do not see how payments for clerical work done on behalf of an old age pensions committee should be excluded for pension purposes.  Payments for acting as superintendent registrar of births, deaths and marriages or as registrar of marriages are also excluded for pension <Col N="161" /> purposes.  There may be a case made for the exclusion of a registrar because after all he is entitled, I think, to claim payment for whatever certificates he issues to applicants in such cases.  The only point in connection with that is that payment for work done for an old age pensions committee should be included for pension purposes. I do not think any case can possibly be made against the right of an official to claim a pension in respect of money that he has earned for clerical work performed for that purpose.</P>
    <P>In Section 34&mdash;the Minister referred to this section in his introductory statement &mdash; an officer of a vocational committee who has worked as a teacher on behalf of Connradh na Gaeilge for a number of years and who was, presumably, paid by Connradh na Gaeilge for whatever work he did, is entitled to have those years of service recognised for pension purposes.  I have no objection to an officer making a claim but I believe this is rather introducing a principle that the Dáil cannot very well stand over.  For instance, if, let us say, an officer of a vocational education committee was appointed in the year 1941 and if in the years prior to that he worked for Connradh na Gaeilge teaching the Irish language, surely to goodness he cannot legitimately claim that because he acted in that capacity for Connradh na Gaeilge for these years he is entitled to a pension from a vocational authority or from a local authority.  This opens up a very wide field and whilst I would be inclined to give reasonable preference to any individual who performs useful work on behalf of the Irish language I strongly object to the principle.  Other officers in other spheres may make similar claims in respect of special work performed on behalf of some other organisation outside the influence or control of a local authority.  It is a very bad principle.  It would be well if the Minister would re-examine that particular section.  In fact, I suggest that this provision should be deleted entirely.  An officer of that kind should not be entitled to make any claim in respect of pension unless his work for the Irish language was done during <Col N="162" /> the period he was working for the vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>Part III covers all kinds of employees of local authorities.  How a pension scheme is going to be operated effectively and economically under that particular portion of the Bill I cannot clearly understand at the moment.  It will bring within its purview all classes of workers both casual and those who are regarded as, perhaps, permanent workers as well.  In this connection, I am thinking particularly of road workers.  A number of men are employed in the capacity of gangers who are on the permanent staffs of local authorities at present.  They will come specifically under this part of the Bill. Others are engaged on casual work&mdash; they are not continuously employed all the year round but they nevertheless have been working for local authorities for a great many years &mdash; and it is very doubtful if very many of these men will be covered by the provisions of this particular part of the Bill.  They must, for instance, have worked 200 days during the year.  They must not have engaged in any work which is subsidised or paid for by money voted by the Oireachtas.  There is one other condition which I cannot remember at the moment.  If these conditions are rigidly enforced, they will exclude the majority of men who may be regarded as casual workers for local authorities. I cannot see that any, except a negligible percentage of the so-called &ldquo;casual workers&rdquo;, will be included at all for pension purposes.  This section may have a certain propaganda value for the Fianna Fáil Party, but I do not see, so far as the unfortunate worker or labourer, or the casual worker of the local authority is concerned, that he is likely to benefit by it.  As a matter of fact all these casual workers under every local authority engage in work subsidised by money provided by the Oireachtas or some Government Department at some period of the year.  That automatically excludes them from any claim for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>There is no point in discussing every section of the Bill.  It is a measure which primarily lends itself to detailed discussion on the Committee Stage.  I <Col N="163" /> could go on making a number of points about the various sections of the Bill, but I will reserve what I have to say until the Committee Stage when we can make a detailed examination of the different sections.  Despite, however, what the Minister has said, approximately 80,000 persons will be covered by the provisions of this Bill.  I assume that the 80,000 includes officers?</P>

      <P>Judging by the schemes in the offing, it is quite likely that that figure will jump in a few years' time to 16,000 or 20,000.  According to the White Paper recently issued by the Government on Health Services it is estimated that they will cost £9,000,000 a year and half of that money is to be borne on the rates.  When these schemes are in operation it is a fair assumption that the staffs of most local authorities will have to be doubled and, perhaps, trebled.  When these schemes that the Minister has announced for the development and improvement of roads are fully implemented it is likely that they will involve a very considerable increase in the number of employees of local authorities.  I do not think the Minister's estimate of what this is going to cost is worth very much.  I believe that in a few years' time it will be doubled or trebled, or perhaps quadrupled.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that this Bill, while introducing a number of necessary amendments to the existing superannuation code, will add to the burden on the ratepayers and time alone can tell whether or not these additions to the rates will be justified. I do not accept the Minister's estimate. The Minister was far too conservative. The number of people who will be affected by this Bill will be much greater than the number the Minister mentioned and the cost to the ratepayers will be very much higher than the estimate the Minister has given us.</P>

      <P>I wish to take this opportunity to appeal to the Minister to restore the pension rights of those members of the staff of Limerick Corporation who took strike action some years ago and were deprived of their pension rights.  Some of them suffered very much and died without pensions. Some are on the sick list now.  These men never would have taken strike action if they had not been ill-advised by the chairman, who was then in very bad health and who died shortly after their return to work.  I can assure the Minister that if the pension rights of these persons are restored they will never again take strike action.  They are now advised by a sensible and wise chairman and I would appeal to the Minister to restore the pension rights.</P>

      <P>I think the majority of members of Dáil Eireann will be in agreement with me when I say that the general principles of this Bill are unquestionably sound, that running through this Bill there is an attempt to put local officials, whether they be in what is referred to as the officer class or the working class, on a definite scale for pension purposes.  For years I have wondered why, with the dovetailing of grants and the joint effort in developing services of one kind or another, there was such a dividing line between the local official and local employee and the State official and the State employee.  From the beginning of time it has been recognised that the direct employee of the State has a claim on the State at the end of his <Col N="165" /> working life for a pension for the remainder of his days.  That did not apply to the local employee.  In this Bill we have at least an attempt to include in the category of pensionable workers local officials and local employees.</P>
      <P>The Bill, in the main, is divided into two parts, one part dealing with officials, the other part dealing with workers.  I think it would have been better if the Bill had been introduced as two separate Bills because, running through this Bill we see an effort to apply a set of rules and conditions which are very easily applicable to those in the officer class whose service is, of course, permanent and continuous, to the working classes whose service is not nearly so permanent or continuous. It may be argued that it is better to do something, no matter how small, than to do nothing and that the second part of the Bill attempts to include in the scope of the pension scheme casual and permanent workers. The fact that it is linked up with the officer code of conditions militates against that objective.</P>
      <P>Those who are familiar with the conditions under which labourers of local authorities work will see when they read this Bill that it is extremely unlikely in 80 per cent. of the cases that they will ever become pensionable owing to the seasonal nature of their work and the fact that in the course of their work they very frequently have to give service on schemes subsidised out of public money.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We had an Order issued by the Government on Saturday after most people had finished their work for the week which resulted in depriving the people of the country of the services of the banking system on Monday.  Since then we have had two other Orders depriving the people in a continuing way of the services of the <Col N="166" /> bank system on Tuesday, and that is to continue until Friday.  The implication of the Government action is that that situation is going to continue&mdash; that is to say that people cannot say when their banking services will be restored. It would be interesting to examine what exactly happened on Friday and Saturday that led the Government into that particular situation. I think that what we want to do now is to face up directly to two or three points, to understand clearly what the implications of these points are as well as the necessity for seeing that the banking services are restored.</P>
      <P>For quite a long time past there have been differences apparently between the bank staffs, from the highest to the lowest, and the bank directors.  That has been simmering for some time and apparently has been before the Labour Court.  The proceedings before the Labour Court have not apparently been able to resolve these differences.  The action of the Government in issuing the Order that I speak about has been to deprive the people of all banking services until such time as these differences are completely resolved.  I think that the action of the Government in the matter is a most extraordinary one. It is proposed that the differences existing between the staffs and the directors were militating against the efficiency of the banking service.  At any rate, the community in regard to its business, its fairs, and every other aspect of commercial life had 90 or 95 per cent. of the service they required and they have no other machinery to substitute for this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know why the Government have intervened in this particular way: why, simply because differences exist between the management of the banks and the staffs, they have turned on the people and removed the service entirely from the people?  It is not necessary to elaborate on what the result has been on the machinery of fairs, of business, the payment of wages, as well as the position in which solicitors find themselves in transacting their business. All that, I am sure, is very patent to every member of the House and is now, at any rate, apparent to the Government.  I want to ask them <Col N="167" /> why they should strike at the people in this way: why, simply because a difference existed partially impairing the service, if you like, they should remove the service wholly from the people.  Many members of the Ministry have been abroad at conferences and consequently have been helped to realise how great the difficulties are that our people find themselves in, and how much greater are the difficulties that they are faced with in carrying on their rather intricate business both in regard to trade and commerce.  They surely ought to be hesitant of adding to the people's difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce told me in reply to a question today that he realises the necessity for creating the greatest possible harmony industrially and commercially here, and that he was in constant touch with employers and employees.  He implied that certain failures on the part of the Labour Court to prevent strike action had been exercising the consideration of the Government and that they were considering the matter.  Surely, if the Government had been giving any consideration to what are the causes of unrest in the country, and what is the best way of avoiding an extension of it or to avoid circumstances that would lead to a cessation of services here, they must be aware that they are not helping the situation if they by Government action intervene where there are differences and deprive the country of this particular service.</P>
    <P>Again, when the notice appeared on Saturday the people got two shocks.  I think the first shock they really got was the shock that they felt that here was the Government interfering in what amounted to a dispute and taking definitely one side, and that they were subscribing to certain theories and principles in connection with the matter. Whatever went on between the Joint Stocks Banks Committee and the Government, the Government at any rate must have seen on Monday that their first Order was that the banks were going to be closed on Monday. They were aware that the employees were going to be asked to sign an undertaking by 12 o'clock on that day <Col N="168" /> to this effect: &ldquo;I undertake to comply with such instructions of the bank in relation to my services as the due discharge of business requires.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take it that apparently the Government subscribe to the principle that it was right that the bank directors would require the employees of the banks to sign that declaration.  I think it ought to be made clear what the Government mean by subscribing to a declaration of that particular kind.  As I understand it, and as I hear it judged on, it is supposed to be contrary to man's natural rights that he would sign a contract when he cannot see what the implications of it are.  As far as signing a declaration of that particular kind is concerned, simply as a gesture in a dispute, I think that anybody who has had experience in the Ministry or as a member of a Party, or anybody with experience as a member of this House, must realise that a man cannot be expected in a matter of a dispute to sign documents of that particular kind.  I also suggest that in that statement there is the implication of a submission to conditions of employment that, say, the Dublin dockers before Jim Larkin appeared on the scene would not be required to subscribe to.  We have progressed a lot since then, but in the development of business we find now that the Government have continued the closing of the banks until Friday on the understanding &mdash; and no doubt agreeing in some way with whatever principle is involved &mdash; that if the staffs do not sign a declaration of this particular kind the banks will have no alternative save to terminate their employment.</P>
    <P>I think the House is entitled to be told what the Government contemplated when they signed the first Order for the closing on Monday.  They did it, I think, rather thoughtlessly if they thought it could stop on Monday.  They signed the other Orders rather thoughtlessly if they thought this matter could stop on Friday.  They must have some ideas in their mind as to how they would come to the assistance of the people when the bank services were stopped.  We would like to hear what these proposals and plans are.  We would like to hear what was in the mind of the Government when they <Col N="169" /> stepped into a dispute that was just in a simmering condition and agreed with the employers that conditions of this kind could be imposed at this hour of the day on employees; when they stepped in behind the employers to the extent of depriving the whole country of a particular service in order to try to help in forcing that situation.</P>
    <P>These are two very grave matters, and I raise the question to give the Government an opportunity of answering these things to-night.  This is not going to stop on Friday, if we are to judge by the Government's action and attitude in the matter.  I personally consider that the Government may have blundered into the present situation. If so, they should do everything they possibly can to see that the banks are reopened on Friday and reopened in circumstances that will assure the public that there will be no necessity for a run on the banks; that the banks will continue to be open after Friday to discharge their statutory obligations, even though the excellence of this service may be interfered with by a certain amount of dispute between the employees and the banks.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to realise the condition that they have brought the country into as a result of shutting down the banks and the extraordinary and unprecedented position into which they have brought the banking services of the country.  I ask the Government if they are going so to explain the situation to us now that we can anticipate, if the banks are not to open on Friday and to continue open, they will open on Saturday and continue open.  I ask them also to explain what is meant by getting in this particular kind of way behind the employers who, apparently, told them: &ldquo;We are going to require a particular type of declaration from our employees in reference to this very vital service and we shall dismiss them if they do not sign it?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is also one other point which deserves some consideration, namely, that the bank directors apparently carried on conversations with the Government to get them to take this action and, apparently, were utterly incompetent in whatever plans they had to try to get their staffs to understand the <Col N="170" /> undertaking that they required or to provide machinery by which that undertaking could be given, if the staffs were disposed to give it.  The whole history of the handling of this business by the bank directors since the banks were closed is a very humiliating one from the point of view of anybody interested in the proper carrying-on of any branch of our commercial business. I ask the Government for a statement on this matter so that it may be discussed for the short period that the House has to discuss it, so that we may face the situation which will arise at the end of the week with a clear knowledge of the Government's intentions in this matter and an explanation of why they acted in the way they did.</P>

      <P>This particular week and the days prior to the re-opening of the Dáil have produced a multiplicity of shocks to the public.  It was well known to every Deputy that there was a certain amount of tension between the bank directors and the staffs of the banks; that that had been going on for a considerable length of time; in fact over a period of years.  Why the Government, on the eve of the re-opening of Dáil Éireann, should utilise emergency powers given in the face of a world war in order to take sides in an industrial dispute is the main thing that has to be answered here.  I do not think it would be right at this particular point to go into the merits of the dispute. The Dáil, however, is entitled to ask the Government, who, after all, are the officers of the Dáil and are supposed to be the servants of the people, what authority, what mandate they had, in any industrial dispute to throw in the full weight of Government on one side and against the other; to throw in the full weight of Government on one side, having listened only in secret to the case put up by one side, and not having given any opportunity to the other side to state their case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have read in the papers, and we have heard over the radio, speeches delivered by the Taoiseach in Geneva and in Paris and at the Hague and elsewhere, lecturing the people of the world because they cannot compose their differences &mdash; people of a different race, different colour, different religion, <Col N="171" /> different traditions.  When he comes back here the only instrument he has for settling a comparatively unimportant dispute is the antiquated blackthorn, the big stick; trample underfoot the weaker side, make them eat humble pie, make them walk under the yoke. No industrial dispute in the history of the world was ever settled by might, by the use of the big stick.  The trouble is driven underground, only just to fester, to become cancerous, to get heated, to become greater, and to erupt with greater force at a later date.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows the might, the wealth, and the influence of the bank directors.  Everybody knows the weakness and poverty of the staff.  Everybody realises the strength and the might of government.  Some of us would like to appreciate and respect the influence, and the sense of fair play of government.  Surely before taking such action as was taken last Saturday, and which is being persisted in, an action creating a very grave national crisis, the last weapon that was available to civilisation, to Parliament and to democracy should have been used in order to restore equilibrium, to bring about peace, to remove the difficulties and misunderstandings which were there.  Mediation, arbitration, negotiation&mdash;every one of these weapons was at the Government's hand.  Every one of these weapons was being sought by the different sides in that particular dispute, but mediation, which we bleat about from European capitals, negotiation, arbitration&mdash;all these symbols which we throw out as headlines to people in foreign countries &mdash; were completely ignored and discarded when dealing with our own people.</P>
    <P>Certainly there can be no argument but that the big stick is being used in this case and the strength and weight of the big stick is being increased by the might and influence of the Government behind one side in this dispute. I do not think there is anybody who has any doubts as to what the outcome of a strike would be.  A strike is being forced through the medium of a partial lockout, through asking decent people, blood brothers of our own, to submit to conditions which everyone of us <Col N="172" /> with a grain of spunk would refuse to submit to, if it meant absolute starvation for ourselves and everyone we hold near and dear.  There is no man, no human being, with any sense of dignity, who should be asked to subscribe to the conditions which have been put up to these unfortunate officials and blessed by the weight, the influence and the patronage of Government.</P>
    <P>What can be the outcome?  Nothing but a forced strike which is in fact a lock-out.  Everybody knows there are no funds available.  Everybody knows that, within weeks, if not within days, within a short number of days, absolute destitution and actual starvation will force the unfortunate victims into submission to any set of conditions, no matter how humiliating, no matter how degrading and no matter how unreasonable. Is that a fair position to put anybody into merely because he is weak? Would the Government take such onesided action if they were dealing with any powerful trade union with a large membership and with great funds to finance a strike?  But merely because the numbers are few, because the finances are very slender and because the particular grade of society the individuals have to live in is particularly expensive in relation to the salaries paid, the Government take action and they do so without the sanction of the elected representatives of the people. They act, in fact, in hurry and panic so as to get that drastic action taken before Parliament could meet.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy asked the Minister what he thought would happen on Monday as a result of this plot, the plot between Government and bank directors to wield the big stick over the heads of the staff.  Was the Minister so very far divorced from ordinary opinion in this country, from the ordinary human reactions of ordinary people, that he thought the banks would get a speedy submission before twelve midday on Monday and did he stop to inquire, if that is not the result, what then will be the result? What is the next step? Was there any investigation, any consideration given to the ordinary man in the street, the ordinary business man, the ordinary man <Col N="173" /> depending for cash for his week's wages, the convenience of the people, the commercial life of the country, international trade and internal trade, the maintenance and continuation of trade, the fairs and markets throughout the country or the shopkeepers in remote unprotected areas, taking in cash from day to day with no strong rooms and no way of safeguarding cash and having that accumulating in lonely business places up and down the country?</P>
    <P>It was announced on the wireless last night that the Government, having been approached on behalf of the joint committees of the banks and having heard their case, agreed to make an Order legalising the closure of banks, but that they had given consideration to further steps to convenience big business interests.  It is a nice trio, the latest Irish shamrock: bank directors, the Government and big business! These are the people considered.  The little man, the ordinary man, the official working in the big machine under survey&mdash;there is no consideration for any one of these.  I have no doubt that bank directors and big business can very easily get the ear of government, but the population of this country is not made up of government, bank directors and big business.  The other odd hundreds of thousands of people require consideration.</P>
    <P>I can see nothing but humbug, cant and hollow hypocrisy in all these speeches about mediation, arbitration, negotiation.  Is the Government so bankrupt in influence that it could not initiate, sponsor or father negotiations or discussions as between the two parties to what, last week, could scarcely be dignified even by the name of an industrial dispute?  There was tension, with one side demanding certain concessions, certain alterations with regard to conditions of service, and misunderstanding with regard to those conditions of service.  Evidence was given before the Labour Court that the hours of work of these officials were only so many hours per week.  That evidence was given by the bankers in order to meet a claim for overtime pay or increased pay.  The evidence was <Col N="174" /> that their hours of duty were only so many a week.  The officials proceeded to work exactly the number of hours a week which the directors had stated were their hours of work per week and there was an accumulation of arrears; but there would have been no panic, no crisis, no grave disturbance of business if the Government had made an Order to the effect that, owing to the accumulation of the arrears of work, the banks would close every second day or two days a week, in order to clear off the arrears.  The public would then know why the banks were closed, and the panic and the dislocation which is all around us at the moment would not arise.</P>
    <P>This emergency Order legally protects the bankers, and only the bankers.  Is there nobody else in the community who requires legal protection when banks close down in a lightning manner?  What about the solicitor who has entered into a contract for sale and possession by  certain date?  What about the man who is holding £5,000, £7,000 or £9,000 belonging to another man and has lodged it in his bank and the other man demands his money?  Where is the legal protection for all these people? You could multiply that 100 times over and your emergency Act gives legal protection only to the bankers &mdash; anything but protection for the rest.</P>
    <P>Is it too late, in the middle of this week of crises, to appeal to the Government, with the immense influence that Government has, with the immense machine that Government has, with the very vast experience that Government has of negotiation, of arbitration, of ending various kinds of disputes, that, instead of wading in behind the fellow with the big stick, it will, between this and Friday, invite both parties to this dispute to meet under the chairmanship of such a person as used to be their officer for settling industrial disputes, their officer for arbitrating in all these disputes, and use its very great influence to bring about peace in a highly important and vast service which is vital to the country, to bring about peace in that service where there is anything but peace at the moment?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="175" /> In the interests of all the people, in the interests of the national and international trade of the country, the Government should make use of such machinery so as to have this dispute ended, if possible by zero hour on Friday next.  If that is not done, might I ask the Minister to give some indication to the Dáil of what he thinks will happen at midday on next Friday?  He may think that all or the majority of the officials will sign on the dotted line. Assuming that that takes place, what will be the result?&mdash;Animosity, bitterness, despair, disappointment and hatred inside the most important service in any community; a spirit of suppressed mutiny; a spirit of disillusionment, absolute disillusionment even with the working of democracy inside the State itself.  Is that a victory?  Is that a success?  Does that bring benefit to anybody?  Does it bring benefit to the Government, to the directorate of the banks, to the country?</P>
    <P>That is one thing that may happen. The other thing that may happen is a regimented refusal to sign, an organised refusal to give such an undertaking as the banks demand. What will be the result of that?  Let us assume that that is what happens on Friday.  There will be 5,000 or 6,000 dismissals, 5,000 or 6,000 distressed families, 5,000 or 6,000 evictions, Four times that number of starving children, absolute and complete dislocation of the banking services of the State.  Is it not worth anything, is it not worth any effort, is it not worth any expenditure of work to try to avoid either one thing or the other?  Is it unreasonable for any Deputy to press on the Government that its machinery of arbitration should be set in motion to-morrow morning so as to end this dispute at the earliest possible date and to suggest that both sides to the dispute will agree, while that machinery is operating, to leave the matters at issue in abeyance and to abide by the result of such arbitration?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to voice what I believe to be the grave uneasiness which exists among the ordinary people of this country as the result of the action of the bank directors and the <Col N="176" /> action of the Government in closing the banks within the past few days. The closing of the banks was sufficient in itself to cause the greatest uneasiness. The suddenness with which that was done exasperated a position which in itself and by itself was sufficiently serious.  The Government purport, in legalising the action of the bank directors in closing the banks, to have acted on the excuse or the pretence put forward by the bank directors that the work in the banks had, by reason of the action of the officials, gone into arrears, and the action of the Government was justified in law, as I understand it, by Section 2 of the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946.</P>
      <P>I have made it a rule in this House, and I have expressed it here again and again to be my rule as a Deputy, not to express any legal opinions, but I would commend to the consideration of the Government and of their legal advisers whether or not this Emergency Powers Order, which purports to legalise the action of the Government, is, in fact, quite outside the powers conferred on the Government by the Act of 1946 to which I have referred. In the course of the debate on that measure, when it was going through the House, it was pressed on the Government from all sides that powers such as were being sought to be reserved during the residue of the emergency ought to be kept within the narrowest compass, and it was agreed by the Government, as we thought in good faith, and it was accepted as such by Deputies on this side, that the powers which were being conferred on the Government by the 1946 Act would be used sparingly and only for certain very well-defined purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Emergency Powers Order under which the banks are closed purports to be made, according to the copy I have in front of me, under Section 2 of the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946.  That section, if I may put it shortly, authorises the Government to do certain things in their discretion.  In the category of those things that they can do in only one sentence can I see any justification for this Order.  The <Col N="177" /> Government is authorised to make Orders to provide for the regulation and control by or on behalf of the State of any supplies or services which are in the opinion of the Government essential to the life of the community. Deputies who are not lawyers may, perhaps, put themselves the question how the declaration of what is popularly called a bank holiday can be said to be a regulation and control by or on behalf of the Government of supplies or services which are essential to the life of the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins has indicated very briefly some of the very serious consequences which may ensue, as a result of this Order, to business people, creditors and debtors.  Payment by cheque, he says, everybody knows is not legal tender.  Have the Government power under this Supplies and Services Act &mdash; which was given to them here under the express undertaking that it would be used only for supplies and services connected with supplies essential to the life of the community &mdash;or do they consider themselves entitled under that Act, to make what they may have to make &mdash; an Emergency Powers Order declaring a moratorium in this country?</P>
    <P>I think we have reached the position where the action of the Government, in invoking that Act to stand behind the bank directors in this dispute, has caused such stirring up of public uneasiness that, whatever may be the result or the end of this particular incident and this particular controversy, confidence in the banking system will have been undermined and considerably weakened and shakened.  I am speaking now on behalf of the ordinary people, those people who have been subjected in the last few weeks to the inconvenience put upon them by the bus strike here in the City of Dublin. Added to the sufferings and hardships they have been enduring, they have now to try so to arrange their financial affairs as to fit in with the manæuvrings&mdash;they can be nothing else &mdash; by the bank directors in a dispute with their staffs.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention, and I think it would be almost improper for any <Col N="178" /> Deputy, to discuss in any way to-night, except perhaps in a passing way, the dispute which appears to be imminent between the banking staffs and the bank directors, their employers.  I have no intention of going into the merits of that dispute or of referring to it, beyond a mere passing reference in order to extract, if possible, from the Government some statement which will not be merely a statement palliating or purporting to explain what they have done but a statement which will carry conviction to the ordinary people who are suffering inconvenience and who have been caused great hardship by the action of the past few days.  It would appear, as Deputy Mulcahy, Leader of the Opposition, has pointed out, that the Government are taking sides.  We do not charge the Government with taking sides here to-night.</P>

      <P>We want to know the facts from the Government's point of view first and then we will determine, but, unless there is an explantion, it would seem that, without notice to the public&mdash;and that was one of the gravest errors perpetrated by the Government on the public in connecnection with the making of this Order &mdash;the banks were closed for one day, on the representation or excuse or justification, made publicly by the Government, that that was required because the banks' staffs were not working at sufficient pressure to enable them to fulfil the duties up to time.  Maybe the justification for the staffs in connection with that is to be found in the statement made by a bank director to the Labour Court: it may be that the bank directors took their cue from what that director said to the Labour Court.  It may be that there were arrears.  I want to know, and I think the public is entitled to know, the extent and nature of those arrears, if there were any arrears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been asserted with some authority that whatever arrears there were, if there were arrears, were not sufficient in the first place to justify the drastic action that has been taken and, secondly, that in fact since the <Col N="179" /> closing of the banks, the bank officials have not been occupied in connection with the clearing up of those arrears. The public is entitled to know the facts.  That is being asserted with authority and, until it is authoritatively denied with evidence to support the denial, it would appear that the time taken away from the public in connection with banking services by the closing of the banks is being occupied solely for the purpose of some manoeuvre by the bank directors in connection with that dispute with their officials.  The public are entitled to have that point cleared up authoritatively, with cogent evidence to satisfy them that there was justification in connection with those arrears or alleged arrears for the drastic action taken under the Supplies and Services Act of 1946, causing public uneasiness and public dislocation of business.</P>
    <P>The public are entitled to know why it was that they got no notice, why it was that the first they heard was from the newspapers or over the radio.  Why were they not told that in two or three days there would be a closing of the banks for the purpose of clearing up arrears, that there was no necessity for any alarm or for the public to be worried about the matter as it was merely a question of arrears and nothing else. That was not what happened.  First, closing took place without notice to the public.  The public, expecting that it would be merely a day to clear up arrears, remained quiet; but they were again told, without notice, that there would be further closing; and up to the moment they have been given no assurance that the same procedure will not be continued for the next three of four days or the next three or four weeks.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to complain of the procedure; we are entitled to complain that these drastic powers, which were given to the Government for one reason and one reason alone, in connection with supplies, have been used &mdash; even if they are within the letter, as to which there is the gravest doubt, of this Act of 1946 &mdash; in a way which certainly is contrary to anything ever thought of by any member of this House when the Bill was being passed and the powers <Col N="180" /> conferred upon the Government which are contained in that measure.  We are entitled to know, and the public is entitled to know, what is really behind all this.  On its surface, this is a manæuvre by the directors, backed by the Government, in the dispute with their officials.</P>
    <P>Wherever the rights or wrongs in the dispute lie, this was no way in which the public should be made parties to that dispute and sufferers from it.  The ordinary people of the country, and particularly of this City of Dublin, are being made the victims of all these disputes at present &mdash; labour disputes, whatever their nature may be or their merits may be &mdash; and now they are going to have to suffer because the directors want to teach a lesson to their staffs and bring them to heel by the exercise not merely of whatever powers they may have in their contracts with their staffs but by the invocation of those powers which ought not to have been exercised except in circumstances of grave public emergency.</P>
    <P>Where is the grave public emergency requiring the drastic action that was taken?  The public have not been told it yet.  They have been told, in so far as they have been told anything, that it was to enable the bank officials to catch up on the arrears of work which had accumulated by reason of the fact that they were not working in accordance with the hours the directors wished them to work.  For the purpose of clearing up arrears?  Where is the public emergency in that?  Where is there anything connected with that state of affairs and the emergency created by the war or war conditions? Were there, in fact, any such arrears of work?  If there were&mdash;and there appears to be the gravest doubt about that and certainly it has been asserted authoritatively that there were no such arrears &mdash; has the time during which the banks have been closed been utilised to clear up those arrears, or has it been utilised merely for the purpose of enabling the bank directors to make it clear to the public that they were doing the strong man in a labour dispute and that they were going to make it clear to their staffs that they would <Col N="181" /> be dismissed unless certain things were done?</P>
    <P>Why was it necessary to link up the so-called arrears with the closing of the banks and with the making of this Order by the Government and with the service of this notice by the bank directors on their officials?  All these matters &mdash; the arrears of work, the dispute between the bank directors and the officials, the service of the notice by the directors which they wish their employees to sign&mdash;were matters of internal arrangement between the bank directors and their employees. The public want to know why they should be made the sufferers and to find themselves in the position to suffer inconvenience while apparently the Government stands behind the bank directors in what appears to be a dispute in regard to terms of work and employment, rates of pay and conditions of service.  We are entitled to have the clearest explanation of that. We should have an explanation given now for we cannot get over the fact that this thing has been done by the Government.  I notice that the Taoiseach appears to be grinning and laughing, but it is no matter for grinning for the people who have to suffer as a result of this action of the Government.  It is as well for the people to know that this is the attitude of the Taoiseach&mdash;the Prime Minister&mdash; in this crisis.</P>

      <P>I am a bad actor but I am saying what I believe and I think I am voicing the opinion of the ordinary people &mdash; opinions expressed to me during the last few days.  I am asserting the fact here and I am asking the Government and asking the Prime Minister &mdash;when the Minister for Local Government has ceased to laugh and make cheap jibes &mdash; to repudiate the statement that the bank officials have not been utilised in the last three <Col N="182" /> days to clear off the arrears of work; to say, if there were arrears, whether their time was occupied in clearing off those arrears.  It may be that the Government made this Order on misrepresentation.  I do not know. So far as the public are concerned and so far as the information given to them is concerned they only know that the Government made the Order because the bank directors told them that there were arrears of work to be made up.  I want to know, and the public are entitled to know, if that was the only and the true reason that the special powers of the 1946 Act were invoked; the powers we never thought would be invoked when we passed the Act.  If this is the only reason why this Order was made and the special powers exercised, I want to know, and I think the public ought to know, if there is any truth in the allegation that there were arrears; and, if there were, whether the time of the officials has been exclusively occupied during the last three days in clearing them.  For it has been asserted &mdash;and again I say asserted authoritatively &mdash; that the employees have not been occupied in that, but in considering what their own personal position is going to be when the directors serve this notice next Friday or whatever time it is.</P>
      <P>But the public want to know if they are to continue to be made guinea pigs in this dispute between the bank officials and the directors, backed up by the Government in the exercise of these powers, and in circumstances in which the ordinary public were not told nor taken into the confidence of the Government as to the reasons for this drastic action being taken at the time when it was taken.</P>

      <P>If I had expected any co-operation from the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Fine Gael Party in handling an acute crisis in the lives of our people I would have been disappointed.  But, before I recommended to the Government that this Order authorising the banks to close in certain circumstances should be made, I knew perfectly well that the opportunity would be taken by members of the Opposition to foment all the trouble they could.  If <Col N="183" /> they could help to create chaotic conditions they would do so.</P>
      <P>Anybody who knows anything about modern economic life knows that the million and one transactions which many different classes of people have to transact quickly every day could not be carried out efficiently unless we had such an institution as the modern bank. Cheques have to be sent by a trader in Dublin to the ends of the earth for goods.  If he gives an order for goods he has to pay for them and the person who is going to sell them must be assured that he is going to get paid for them too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intimacy with which modern banking is bound up with the life of the people needs no elaboration.  Everybody knows it in his daily life and it is one of the first essentials to the community that it should be kept going.  If the modern commercial bank were to disappear to-morrow the State would have to set up a similar institution in order that the people could transact their work in the modern way.  They cannot go round swapping cows for barrels of wine; they cannot go round with bags of gold and they do not want to go round with bags of money.  They want to make use of the modern cheque system which enables a man in Dublin to pay a man in Belfast, in Cahirciveen, or in Timbuctoo, if he lodges in the bank the amount with which the cheque can be met.  It is absolutely essential for the modern bank to ensure that its daily transactions will be completed in a regular way; that when a liability to pay is undertaken that that liability will go through the books and that all the writing that has to be done on foot of it will be carried out regularly and faithfully.  The situation for the past seven weeks has been that the nerve centre of the modern bank in Ireland has been subject to creeping paralysis and in that event the situation is not one for the directors or the staff of the banks alone, but it is one for the Government.  The volume of legislation which has been passed to regulate banking shows that modern Government has a vital interest in modern banking. <Col N="184" /> Powers are taken in legislation to control modern banking.  If further powers were needed, or if it were in the interest of the public, it would be the duty of the Government or of a member of the Dáil to bring forward the required legislation.</P>
    <P>On last Friday my private secretary got a telephone message asking me to meet the representatives of the Irish banks.  I was unable to meet them on that afternoon but I met them on Saturday morning.  The representatives of the banks informed me that, owing to the fact that their officials had been on partial strike for seven weeks, the vital work at their headquarters had fallen into arrear.  I shall describe later the work which they told me was in arrear.  They told me, further, that this partial strike had occurred not-withstanding that the matters in dispute between them and their officials had been the subject of a prolonged hearing by the Labour Court &mdash; that the partial strike was in contravention of the Labour Court's award.  They also told me that they had learned from the papers on Thursday morning that this partial strike, which had already brought the nerve-centre of the banks to a state of semi-paralysis, was to be taken a step further, that the bank officials were to work even shorter hours than they had been working for the previous seven weeks.  They informed me that vital work was falling into arrear and that they would not be able to carry out their legal obligations to the public on that account. They stated that the work would go more and more into arrear with the shortening of the hours.  They told me that the posting and balancing of their ledgers had fallen into arrear, particularly at the nerve-centre of the banks &mdash; the headquarters.  Branches of the banks at which there are two or three men can clear up their work, except on a fair day, within a couple of hours.  We all know that.  However, many dozens of banks throughout the country could not carry on their work unless they had a centre through which to operate and get their business cleared &mdash; the headquarters.  It was at headquarters, particularly, that the work fell into arrear.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="185" /> They informed me that the statements and passbooks of customers, many of whom require those statements and passbooks supplied weekly, could not be so supplied and that their customers were complaining that they were being interfered with in their business because they were not getting those statements and passbooks as before.  They informed me that remittances from the head offices to the branches had fallen into arrear, that they were not able to keep their branches supplied.  They told me that the clearance of cheques between one bank and another had fallen into arrear, that they did not know where they were from day to day in their balances as between one another.  They stated that dealings with bills of exchange had fallen into arrear and that shipping documents and irrevocable credits for imports had fallen into arrear.  One of them described a transaction which might take place if a certain buyer here had arranged an irrevocable credit for some perishable commodity to be shipped at some port. If the credit were not available to the exporter of that perishable commodity and the commodity perished, they were liable to an action.  They told me that, in respect of that particular type of business, it was absolutely essential to be up to the minute but that they had fallen into arrear with the work.  They told me that the sending forward of coupons for bearer securities was also in arrear and that they were also in arrear in the checking of note parcels from branches.  The note parcels were being sent up and they could not handle the checking of them.  They said they were in arrear, too, in the advising of customers' credits to banks and agents, that various documentary collections were in arrear, that daily calculation of interest on accounts was in arrear, that head office returns, including supervision of overdrafts, was in arrear and that correspondence with customers and the entire filing system were in arrear.</P>
    <P>There was one other matter which they did not mention to me but which I mentioned to them.  They were in arrear in respect of certain returns they should have made to me, as Minister for Finance, through the Central <Col N="186" /> Bank.  Knowing the important function of the banks in relation to the volume of money and their important function as trustees of the people's money, since I became Minister for Finance I have watched carefully from month to month the returns of the banks.  Since this partial strike started in August the work of the banks in that respect has gone into arrear.  I was not able to carry out that vital function as Minister for Finance responsible to the people of this country.  The banks informed me that not only had this vital work fallen into arrear but that, as they were on notice that a step further was to be taken on Monday, conditions were bound to become chaotic and that if on Tuesday another half-hour was clipped off in addition to the half-hour on Monday matters would become worse still.  But even without anything happening beyond the partial strike that has been in operation since August, even without the further cut in hours taken by the bank officials on Monday, it would take them practically a week to clear up the arrears at headquarters. They informed me yesterday, in a further conference I had with them in connection with the No. 3 Order which the Government made, that numbers of their staffs at headquarters were engaged on clearing off the arrears that had accumulated during the partial strike since August.  I am perfectly well aware, as Deputy Costello is aware, that the ordinary branch manager could finish off his work in a couple of hours, and that they have not been working during this last week.  Everyone knows that. There cannot be branches unless there are roots, and the vital nerve-centre of the banking system is the Central Clearance and Accounting in the Central Headquarters.</P>
    <P>The answer then to Deputy Mulcahy is that I recommended the Government to authorise the banks to close first on Monday, then on Tuesday, and then for three days, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, because I believe it was necessary in order to avoid the chaos and the ill-consequences to the community of allowing chaos to arise in our banking system here.  It is untrue <Col N="187" /> to say that the Government interfered in order to line the pockets of the directors or the shareholders.  It is untrue to say that the Government interfered in order to put the bank officials under the yolk, as Deputy O'Higgins put it, or to starve their 20,000 children, as he put it, too.  I asked the Government to authorise the banks to close because, if the banks opened under the conditions existing, they would not be able fully to carry out their legal obligations to the community, to their depositors, to their customers and chaos would result.  I trust that the bank officials will realise the disastrous step they have taken so far as the community is concerned in trying to settle their differences with the bank directors in this particular way.  They are being given every opportunity by the State to settle them in a regular way. The Labour Court was set up.  The Labour Court went fully and carefully into the matter in dispute between the banks and the banking officials, and the Labour Court made its award and it was the officials who turned down the award.  It was the officials, without any further consultation or reference back to the Labour Court, who instituted the partial strike.  I grant you this partial strike is somewhat new, but still it is a partial strike, and they showed that the partial strike, if ignored in the first step could be taken another step.  I suppose that if the second step were ignored it could be taken a step further until, finally, the whole banking system would collapse in chaos.  Let nobody imagine that if the officials of the banks got a very big increase in remuneration it would come out of my pocket or out of the pocket of the State.  It would come out of the pockets of the community &mdash; the people who deal with the banks and the people who cover themselves for their expenses in carrying out their business which is partly due to bank charges. We all know that at the beginning of the war when the banks increased the remuneration of their officials the first thing that was done was that the bank charges were put up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>On the subject of dividends, I have the figures for them if Deputy Dillon wants them.  The average dividend of the banks in 1938 was 12.7 per cent.  In 1939 it was 11.9 per cent.  In 1940 it was 12.1 per cent. In 1941 it was 12 per cent.  In 1942 it was 11.9 per cent.  In 1943, 1944, 1945 it was 11.9 per cent.  In 1946 it was 11.8 per cent.  I am sure that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I would regard it as a grave disability to the people of this country if the banks were to take an inordinate or high increase in their dividends.  The modern banks, where they have been left without immediate public control, are trusted by the community to act as trustees.  They have vital functions to perform &mdash; the safeguarding of moneys left with them by depositors, the transfer of documents, the safeguarding of documents, arrangements for payments, and all that particular type of business.  They have a second function in that they have, through making advances or calling in loans, an effect on the volume of money.  In that regard they are public trustees, and in regard to that particular function I am the people's Inspector through the Central Bank to see that they carry out those functions in an effective manner which will help the people to transact their business and which will not in any way impede them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that, the banks being public trustees, having a public capacity, being, if you like, a public utility, the employees working for these institutions should behave in a restrained <Col N="189" /> manner whenever they have a dispute with their employers and that they should take care, seeing that they are in relation to the majority of this community very well off, or fairly well off, and have fair wages, or salaries, fair conditions of employment, short hours and fair pension terms.  They have been satisfied over a number of years to work under certain terms and conditions as to hours and surely, before they suddenly, without any agreement with the people who employ them, elect to slow down the work by partial strike and cause chaotic conditions in the people's business, they should take every step possible to see if their dispute could be threshed out in a reasonable way.  The bank officials were not going to fall down dead, the 4,000 or 5,000 of them, if they continued, as they and their forefathers continued for 100 years, to work the ordinary normal hours of banking.  I do not know who else gets home at 4.30 in the afternoon or who can work for only 20 or 30 hours a week.  At any rate, they have been working normal hours for a long number of years and it is my own personal opinion that when the banks offered, following their rejection of the Labour Court award, that if they carried on the normal hours of work that they and the forerunners of the present set of officials had been working for 100 years &mdash; that was not putting the yoke on their necks &mdash; the banks would, notwithstanding the Labour Court award, discuss with them any matter in dispute upon which the Labour Court had not adjudicated, that this was a reasonable offer for the banks to make.</P>
    <P>I hope that the bank officials, who have an important function to fulfil in the life of our community, who are respected by the people in the cities, towns and villages in which they live, will pull themselves together and not be led away by the people who are trying to get them to behave in a most irresponsible way.  I think it is not asking too much of them to ask them to agree to accept the normal working hours &mdash; and that is all they have to do &mdash;for the purpose of carrying on the community's work.</P>
    <P>I do not know what Deputy <Col N="190" /> O'Higgins, putting on his reddish or pinkish glasses, read into the undertaking, which the banks asked the officials to sign, that they would duly discharge their duties.  What does he think the bank directors are?&mdash;Highwaymen who are going to spirit off the officials into some dark wood and make them slave for 24 hours a day?  All that the bank directors asked the officials to do was, in view of the fact that they had for some weeks failed to work the normal hours that they had been working for 100 years, that they would resume the working of their normal hours and that if there were some matters in dispute beyond what was decided by the Labour Court they could get together and settle them.</P>
    <P>I regret the whole circumstances in which this particular dispute arose.  I regret particularly that the community could not get all the warning that they should have got.  The community in this regard can to a large extent help themselves.  If this strike should, unfortunately, go on beyond next Friday, there will be not only a number of people looking for money in order to pay wages and to pay for goods and services but there will be a very big number of people who will be wanting to get rid of money.  There will be cinemas, shopkeepers, various people who are paid in cash for their work or goods or services, who will want and will be glad to accept the cheque or the I.O.U. of some person they know and whom they trust, who is looking for money in order to pay wages.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins was very badly off indeed for an argument when he lit upon the accusation that the banks were going to be opened this week in order to facilitate the &ldquo;bleedin' capitarlists&rdquo;. The banks were asked by me if they could this week get their officials to meet the requirements of men who were paying wages and salaries in order that those wages and salaries should be met.  If that is something terrible in Deputy O'Higgins' eyes, it is not in mine and if the bank officials should not carry on their work I hope that the bank directors, if this trouble goes on, will be able to arrange that type of business <Col N="191" /> even after next Friday.  If they do not do it, then the State will try to do it.</P>

      <P>I said that I asked the banks to open if they could get their officials to do it for that particular line of business.  I hope that, if the bank officials do not carry on in a full way from Friday, they will be able to open partially for that business, but if they do not I trust that the community will first of all help by keeping the money that is out actively in circulation; there is more than sufficient cash in circulation amongst the people to enable the community to do this work and to do it efficiently, but not as conveniently and not as efficiently as if the banking <Col N="192" /> system were in operation.  Everybody will grant that there is no substitute for that.</P>

      <P>What I want to say is this: that, with regard to people who have wage bills to meet so that they may keep their men employed and their workers paid, if the banks fail to do that particular type of work and cannot open throughout the country, the State will do its utmost to help them and get the money to the people whose credit is good in the banks in order that they may be able to pay wages. There is another thing I want to say, and it is that the Government over a very long time gave directions to ensure that the State services would be carried on in the event of a bank strike. Of course, Deputy O'Higgins never heard anything about a bank strike. This thing all came upon him very suddenly indeed, but I happen to be aware that after the Labour Court award the bank officials took a ballot empowering their central committee to call a strike any time they liked.  Seeing that the bank officials had loaded their gun in that particular way, I thought it was time for all people who had responsibilities and big wage bills to pay to be looking out, and I gave directions that all steps that were necessary should be taken in order to ensure that old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, unemployment relief, the wages of Guards, of soldiers and of civil servants would be paid. If the bank strike were to go on this week, or if it were to go on for a month of Sundays, the State would be enabled to carry out that function.  I will conclude by saying that I sincerely trust that will not be necessary.  I sincerely trust that the banking officials will continue to earn the respect that they have earned from our community &mdash;from the people of the villages and the towns in which they serve &mdash; and that they will realise their responsibilities and will not strike this vital blow at the economic life of our people.</P>

      <P>To strip the Minister's statement of all its trimmings it boils <Col N="193" /> down to this, that the closing of the banks by Government Order was due to arrears not in the branches all over the country but in what the Minister described as the vital nerve centres of the banks.  I presume he meant the head offices in this city.  The Minister told us that it was necessary in order to clear up these arrears to close the banks of this country from Monday to Friday.  That action has definitely paralysed the whole life of the country, short as it has been in operation. Whatever uneasiness was in the public mind up to now, I know for certain that it will develop into more than uneasiness after the rather slipshod explanation which the Minister gave us.  His explanation has not convinced me that there is not something much deeper and much more sinister behind the whole thing than has been revealed to us here.  He told us that the arrears in the head offices are the cause of the whole trouble.  He also told us that he met the bank directors on last Saturday.  I want to ask him when did he consult with the Government, and it is true that certain concerns in the city were aware of the closing of the banks and had sufficient money drawn out to cover this period before the notice ever appeared in the papers that the banks would be closed on Monday last, and before the public were notified over the radio?  I also want to ask him, seeing that it was decided to close the banks by an Emergency Powers Order, why it was that when he was speaking to the directors he did not put up the simple case to them that must have hit everybody in the eye when listening to him this evening, namely, that if arrears occurred in the head offices of the banks why he did not make representations to the bank directors to employ extra staffs for the week?  Why did he not ask the bank directors to double the staff, if necessary, to clear up those arrears?  It now transpires that it will take up to next Friday to do it.</P>

The Minister's statement, I know, will be taken as a definite evasion of the whole point raised by Deputy Mulcahy.  It has caused terrific dislocation all over the country. May I give some instances?  The fair of Thurles yesterday was a fiasco. The big fair at Ballinasloe, one of the biggest fairs in the West of Ireland, serving a huge centre, was held up.</P>

      <P>The whole life of the country, despite what Fianna Fáil Deputies may shout across at me, has been paralysed.  Something more than uneasiness has been created in the public mind.  The Minister's statement to-night would not convince a child that his explanation is the correct one. He told us that because there were arrears in the head offices of the eight or nine banks in the city the whole State would be held up.  He told us that there was no other way out of it except to close the banks from Monday to Friday by issuing Emergency Powers Orders.  He has not given an assurance that the arrears will be all cleared up by Friday.  He has not told us when the banks will re-open.  He has not told us what our fate will be next week or the week after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced that the Minister was evading the whole issue put before him. I thought he would have given us a clear idea of what is taking place.  Perhaps the true state of affairs has not been put before him.  He may have given us the explanation that he got. The Minister stated that bank officials should be very good boys and should <Col N="195" /> not have precipitated a strike.  I did not hear of any bank officials going on strike.  I know they were making certain demands for better conditions.  I do not propose to go into the merits or demerits of the case; whether or not they had a sound case.</P>
    <P>One point I should like to refer to in passing is that we always respected bank officials and looked up to them. But we can never respect a class of people who are compelled to eat their lunch while working, as I see them doing in the banks in rural districts that I go into.  The Minister pointed out that the officials finished their day's work at 4.30 p.m.  I do not think it would dislocate the banking service in any branch down the country or in Dublin if officials were facilitated by being given an hour for lunch and adding on the hour from 4.30 to 5.30.  The Minister's explanation was a very poor one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <P>I hope the Deputy has been speaking to bank officials when he makes the statement that the hour should be added on in the evening.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that they have no lunch hour.  Even the lowest paid workers in the State get half an hour for lunch.  Usually workers get an hour.  If bank officials make that demand, I will certainly stand by them in that demand.  The Minister asked that the bank officials should conduct themselves in such a way as to command respect.  We can scarcely respect bank officials when we see them trying to do business with one hand and with the other trying to take tea out of a thermos flask and eat a sandwich. Surely they are entitled to something better than that if we are to respect them.  I am not at all satisfied with the explanation that the Minister gave. He has been asked a very definite pointed question by Deputy Mulcahy and by Deputy Costello.  The public are anxious to know when normal conditions will be restored.  I think it is a very mean attack by the Minister on the bank officials to say that the nervecentres <Col N="196" /> of the banks have been affected because of arrears and that that is the fault of the officials.  Surely the first thing that must strike anybody is that the cause of that is under-staffing.  If five days' work behind closed doors would clear up the arrears in the head offices in the city, surely the employment of a small extra staff would clear up the arrears and keep the machinery running through the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister may not regard the closing of the banks for five days as a very serious matter.  I wonder does he know what it means to the average country person who brings his pigs or cattle or sheep to a fair and finds that the buyers cannot transact business with them.  Plenty of people depend on one or two fairs in the year to sell their stock.  Now the banks have been closed without warning and the fairs and markets over the whole country are paralysed.  Deputies mentioned the case of people living in lonely parts of the country who will be compelled to keep in their possession fairly large sums of money which they cannot lodge in the banks.  That is one aspect of the matter.  But we must take into account the greater number whose business will be paralysed because of the closing of the banks.  The Minister has not given us any assurance on the matter.  If there is any other speaker on behalf of the Government I hope we will have an intimation as to when the banks will reopen and when things can be expected to return to normal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very carefully to the statement made by the Minister justifying the Orders which he has made for the closing of the banks during this week.  While I approached the matter with a completely open mind and refrained from participating in the debate until I heard the Minister's defence of his action, I must say that at the conclusion of the Minister's speech I was convinced that the Minister is definitely, nakedly and patently taking sides with the bank directors.  The Minister gave us a litany of work that was in arrears in the banks.  I could not help thinking that this was a nice commentary on the competent way in which the banks in this country are directed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="197" /> According to the Minister, the whole business was in a chaotic conditon very largely because of the fact that bank clerks insisted, as Deputies insist, on having a meal interval in the middle of the day.  The whole banking system of the country got into a chaotic condition because bank clerks dared to eat in the middle of the day.  The Minister gave us a list of the items which had fallen into arrears.  I suggest to the Minister that that reflects no credit on those responsible for the direction of Irish banks.</P>
    <P>What I am more interested in is the manner in which the Government approached the matter.  We were told that three Orders were made.  First there was an Order for one day's closing. Surely before that Order was made a case was made by the directors that one day's closing would suffice. When they got a one day closing, I can only assume that they got it by convincing the Minister that one day would clear up all the arrears.  Then they went back again and got another day's closing.  Finally the Government, being very pliable, issued an Order for a further three days' closing.  The directors have now got the Government on the run and they can now get closing Orders whenever they want them. First they get one for one day.  Then they get another, and then one for three days.  That is the situation in which we now find ourselves&mdash;that the bank directors can get a closing Order merely for the asking.  I think the banks have found the Government pretty soft putty in this whole business. I think the bank directors found that they could roll the Government in any way they liked.  They certainly did a fair amount of rolling with the Government. They got three closing Orders out of the Government in one week. They got them from a Government in which the Minister for Local Government is a prominent member.  He used to tell us that some of the biggest enemies of this country were to be found in the banks; that they were hand-in-hand with the Fine Gael Party at the time trying to undermine the independence of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And that was not the staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="198" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Government which gave the banks three closing Orders in the one week.  They have got a closing Order for five days out of the seven.  I want to say definitely that I was amazed by the speech made by the Minister for Finance and I do not mind telling him and saying to the House generally that I think it was an abuse of his position in the House that the Minister, the chief financial officer of the State, should get up in the Parliament and lecture the bank officials in a way in which the bank directors have so far not dared to lecture them. The Minister has been doing the work of the bank directors.  He has lectured the bank clerks, telling them to be reasonable, to be restrained and to be understanding.  That is all a long way of saying: &ldquo;Do what the directors tell you and mind your own business after that.  You are there to carry out what the directors intend you should do&rdquo;, and the Minister sees nothing wrong with that.</P>
      <P>The Minister has come very heavily into this matter.  He has put his finger on the scales on the side of the bank directors and definitely against the claims, the reasonable claims, made by the Bank Officials' Association in this matter.  I can only assume now that the Government's interest in this whole matter is tied to the interest of the bank directors, and, knowing bank directors in this country and the general record of banks in this country, I do not think it is a very healthy situation that the Government of a democratic State such as this, the Government of a State in which there are masses and not classes, should anchor itself to the economic destiny of the bank directors in a dispute of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the bank clerks have now got their lecture.  The Minister for Local Government will probably be let out next week to say that they are all Communists, that they are all led by Communists, and we will be told next week that this whole move by the bank clerks of Ireland to get a luncheon interval in the middle of the day is inspired from the caves of Moscow. Everything will be said now to give the impression that these bank clerks are <Col N="199" /> most unreasonable people, because the Minister's speech lifts the lid off the element of neutrality which ought to have been preserved by the Government in a dispute between the bank clerks and their directors.</P>
    <P>I was struck by the Minister's lecture to the bank clerks and I wondered, while he was speaking, what conception of rights the Minister thinks the bank clerks have.  While listening to the Minister, I could not get out of my mind the thought that the Minister felt that, while every other employer in this country may have to put up with disputes from time to time and while disputes arise in industry from time to time, there was one class in the community which ought to be insured against any kind of friction or dispute, the bank directors.  Disputes occur in various industries throughout the country from time to time.  Is there anything wrong with there being a dispute in a bank, any special reason why bank directors ought not to be troubled with disputes, or do they claim, and does the Government admit, that their function in the life of the country is such that they must not be troubled by disputes by mere bank clerks whose function is merely to sign the ukases which the bank directors issue to their employees for signature?</P>
    <P>One would imagine from the Minister's speech that bank clerks had no rights at all, that the mere threat of a partial strike by bank clerks was something outrageous.  Is the Minister contending that bank clerks have no right to go on strike, are not entitled to exercise their natural right to withhold their labour, or have we now got a new conception of human rights on the part of the Government that, because you work in a bank under the control of wealthy bank directors in Ireland, you sacrifice your natural right to withdraw your labour, your natural and legally admitted right to go on strike?  Bank clerks have these constitutional rights. They got these rights in the Constitution and they have the right to withdraw their labour, if they want to.  It would be regrettable if the situation reached the stage at which that had to take place, but it is one thing to <Col N="200" /> regret the occurrence of a strike and another to deny, by implication, the right of the bank clerk to withdraw his labour, because he has constitutional rights to withhold his labour and to go on strike if the circumstances of the situation justify him constitutionally in taking that course.</P>
    <P>The Minister has rendered no service whatever in this dispute.  He has thrown down the gauntlet this evening to the bank clerks, and he has done so in a way which, I am sure, will command the admiration of the bank directors.  It is not the Minister's job to win the plaudits of the bank directors. It is not the Minister's or the Government's job to do the work of the bank directors in a matter of this kind.  If the Government does not come in positively on behalf of the weaker section, namely, the bank clerks, it ought at least to hold the scales evenly.  Were they held evenly this evening?  Did anybody make any effort to put the bank clerks' case? Knowing that they had no right of reply here &mdash; and I do not claim to talk for the bank clerks officially &mdash; the Minister lectured them as to what he thought they ought to do and ought not to do and where he thought wisdom and unwisdom lay.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made this whole situation very much worse than it was. The Government have not covered themselves with any glory by the way in which the matter has been handled, and, even now, on reflection, somebody for the Government ought to intervene with a view to trying to make peace between the bank clerks and the directors.  I think there are still possibilities of getting peace made.  The issues are not so insurmountable that a settlement could not be reached and an effort ought now to be made by the Government, instead of lecturing the bank clerks, to try to bring about a peaceful solution of the difficulties which have arisen.  It will have to be brought about one day.  The dispute may go on for quite a while and tempers may rise and become frayed, but in the long run the matter will be settled, as all these disputes have to be settled one day or another.  We ought to try in a matter such as this <Col N="201" /> to use whatever good offices are at the disposal of the Government to bring about a settlement so that the banking services, such as they are, will be available for all the people in a regular and efficient way; but I do not think it is calculated to bring about harmony in the banking service or calculated to ease the tension which now exists if the bank clerks are to be lectured by the Government in a way which I say deliberately is on the side of the bank directors and against those endeavouring to improve their conditions of employment.</P>

      <P>We are told that the community is greatly inconvenienced. Of course, the community is greatly inconvenienced. As the Minister for Finance pointed out, and as everybody in the country knows, the banking system is essential to the conduct of business and to the life of the community, and, if the banking service is brought to an end or to a stoppage, surely it is the right of the Government to step in and do its best to secure that the interest of the community, which is the only interest we have at heart in this matter, is served.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="202" /> We have come into this, as a Government, not to close the banks. That is a convenient phrase, used to misrepresent the attitude of the Government. We have come into this simply to prevent confusion being worse confounded and to prevent a situation from arising in which, when this dispute is settled, the whole thing would be in such a state that it could not be remedied.  Our action might be likened to the action of the Government if, for instance, a river was overflowing its banks in the lower regions and we were asked to give permission for the sluices to be closed upstream.  Would we not be entitled to say: &ldquo;Yes, you may close the sluices upstream; there will be a certain amount of damage caused by the sudden doing of that, but it would be far less than the damage that would be created if the flooding was allowed to continue and cause destruction down at the end&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If these banks here&mdash;the commercial banks&mdash;were not allowed, under the circumstances, to be freed from their legal obligation to open doors, then the position, which was already very bad, would so deteriorate that it might be impossible for them finally to clear up the business at all.  This dispute, I hope, will end soon, and when it does end we hope the banks will be in such a position that business can be carried on.  We are told that the banks were open for business to the public.  They were nominally open, but the business at the top was so clogged up that they could not do their business and the vital services which the headquarters ought to render could not be rendered and were not being rendered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick said they should get temporary people and put them in to clear up the job.  You might as well say that the chief Departments of State could be successfully run by bringing in people off the streets while the ordinary officers were on strike.  That is all nonsense.</P>

The community well knows that the situation is being rapidly arrived at in this country, as it has been in other countries, in which, by the organisations that have developed, vital organisations dealing with vital services, one section of the community can do tremendous damage to other sections.  That has been an inevitable consequence of organisation.  Through these organisations to-day we have people who want to go to their work and cannot get there.  The ordinary conveniences which are necessary for the public are not now available.</P>

      <P>The ordinary person in the country has to depend on a variety of services that are in the nature of public utility services.  By our organisations the whole community has got into such a situation that it is possible now, by strike action on the part of any one section, to cause extreme hardship to other sections.  If the bus people strike&mdash;and the bus service is practically a public utility service&mdash;other people suffer.  If there is a labour dispute between employees and whoever may be in control, the ordinary man and woman will suffer. If there is a dispute in the gas works the ordinary persons who depend on gas to cook their food cannot have their food cooked.  If there is a strike of bakers the children of other sections of the community will suffer from want of bread.  These are facts which are known to every person in the community and anybody who is alive to the situation knows that, unless machinery is devised by which the interests of the community as a whole can be safeguarded, this system is bound inevitably to break down.</P>
      <P>The day has come when there is something else needed, to be added to the ordinary trade union organisation, some body which will be able to say, when the bakers are on strike, that their demands are unreasonable and that they ought not, since baking is a vital service, leave the children of the butchers and the rest of the people without their daily bread.  In the same way, when the butchers go on strike, who will suffer?  Is it not the children of other sections of the community&mdash;the bakers, and others?  To me, at any rate, it is necessary that some machinery be devised so that these disputes can be amicably settled.</P>

      <P>We are as a Government <Col N="207" /> interested in all disputes, necessarily so, that affect the interest of the community as a whole.  Every public utility dispute&mdash;that means now a large number of cases, on account of organisation&mdash;is of immediate interest to the Government, and the Government cannot stand by and allow in any case damage to occur which the Government may be able to prevent.  The damage that was going to result here was that arrears would accumulate to such an extent that they would become unmanageable after a time.  If notice were given and the banks were to be opened for a day, it would be all very well for business people but it would add to the mess.</P>
      <P>The community suffers in all these cases.  The time has come when some organisation will have to be devised to safeguard their interest.  We have done our best.  We know that, on the one hand, there is the interest of the community as a whole and, on the other, the interests of the private individual. We are not disputing the fact that a man may withdraw his labour.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not disputing the fact that a person may withdraw his labour, but we do say that the time has come when all sections of the community who are organised and in a position to do damage like that have a very serious responsibility to the other sections of the community and to themselves. If they do not realise that responsibility, they are going to suffer too.  In these days, the whole system that has been so far evolved of democratic control on the one hand and of trade unionism on the other is in danger and both political democracy, as we have it here, and the trade unions, if they are not alive to their responsibility, may go down in this country, as they have gone down in other countries.  The attempt to put the Government in the position that we are against the rightful claims of anybody is completely unjustified.  Each one of us may have his judgment on the merits or demerits of a particular case.  As a Government, we do not <Col N="208" /> come in in that particular way.  Our function is to do our best to safeguard the community as a whole from the results of strikes and semi-strikes.  In this case, it has been, I understand, a semi-strike, which is still more paralysing than the other kind, since a business which is open is understood generally to be capable of doing its business and has obligations to do business.  If conditions are such that these obligations cannot be properly carried out, that is still worse than a complete stoppage.  It is much better that the banks should be closed for this temporary period than that they should be open and chaos result in the end.  That has been the determining factor so far as the Government is concerned.  We are satisfied that chaos would result if the accumulation of arrears were allowed to go on and no opportunity given to the banks to clear them up.  How far they will succeed I do not know, but that is a matter which must depend upon the good will of their officials.  If the officials set out deliberately&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We had to deal with the situation as we saw it.  I have pointed out the similarity to a river overflowing its banks downstream and compared the problem before us with allowing that to continue or giving permission to close the sluices upstream. What we did was to say to the banks: &ldquo;You have legal obligations to open; you are not in a position, we are satisfied, to fulfil these obligations and, as it is by law that you are compelled to open, in the circumstances we say that you need not be bound by these particular legal obligations.&rdquo;  If the Deputy wants to think that that is siding with anybody, he is free to do so.</P>
      <P>What we were trying to do was to prevent irreparable damage being done to the whole community.  I hope that some method will be devised by which the parties to this dispute can come together and settle it.  There is one mode of settling it which some people think very simple&mdash;if you have butchers on strike, there is nothing to be done but put up the price of meat; if there are bakers on strike, put up the price of bread; the bakers and the others can manage to settle their difficulties and increase their prices. Those people say: &ldquo;If the busmen go on strike, put up the wages and settle it by increasing the bus fares to the community; if the bankers' officials go on strike, you can put on the community the extra charges which occur.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That method could be used if there were not some authority to speak in the name of the community as a whole.  It is the function of the Government to come along, as between the various sections, and say it is not in the public interest that a large section should try to compensate itself in that way.  There has been talk of the increase in the cost of living.  The increase in the cost of living will go on while a policy of that kind is continued.  I say definitely, and every person in this community knows it, that it is very easy for employers and employees or for the directors of any particular company and their staff to come to an arrangement by which a particular section will benefit at the expense of the rest of the community. It is the butchers to-day and the bakers to-morrow.  In this way we have chaos and a situation which no one can handle.</P>
      <P>As I said in the beginning, the time has come in the interest of the community&mdash;and in the interest, mind you, of the workers as well as every other section of the community&mdash;when everything possible should be done to devise some machinery by which we will not have each section of the community trying to gain at the expense of the others.  There is no absolute way under democratic conditions like ours to get a final result except under some form such as the Labour Court whose judgment will be regarded as fair and equitable and whose judgment will be accepted.  Otherwise we will have internal strife between one section and the other.  Inevitably, when the case comes up of a vital public service the Government has to come in for one purpose and for one purpose only&mdash;not to side with any one section against another, but to see as far as we can that the public services are not brought into utter confusion.</P>

      <P>I think if there was a little less heat on the part of the Taoiseach and a little more patience on the part of the Deputies we might get more headway.  I have never thought that we would have a Government interfering in this particular way with the economic life of the country, nor did I ever think that the power granted by this House to the Government would be abused in the manner in which the Government has abused the power bestowed on it under this Act.  The Taoiseach has told us that banking is an important system. That is so and I would like to know if the Minister for Finance and the Government examined closely the case made by the directors.  It is quite clear from the manner in which the case was conducted that there was no examination made either by the Minister for Finance or the Government of the proposals of the directors.  They closed for one day.  Then they closed for another and then for three days. The Government defends the closing on the grounds that it is essential and that there must be some plan by which a dispute arising in a public service can be settled.  What is the Government's plan?  First, apparently, if the bakers go on strike close the bakery for four or five days and if the butchers go on strike close their shops for four or five days and then at the end of that time ask them to sign a form.  It is the most childish performance that has ever been carried out in the country.  Does the Government expect us and the country which has been so gravely inconvenienced by the closing of the banks at such short notice, to accept that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked by constituents in the town of Longford to inquire whether some firms got notice on Friday from the banks to withdraw money to meet their requirements. There are fowl buyers and pig buyers and people like them left without money in the midlands to-day, while <Col N="212" /> there are a selected few in a position to have all the money they require because of the banks' advance information. The Government may get up in holy horror and lecture these bad boys of bank officials.  I have no brief for them.  The Minister says their fathers and their grandfathers have done this type of work for 100 years.  That is like the attitude of the Land Commission which says that what was good enough for Irishmen 100 years ago is good enough to-day.  The Minister for Finance informed us that those employees got a chance of making their case to the Labour Court.  I am reliably informed that when this point of the hour for lunch was being discussed before the Labour Court the Labour Court gave it 20 minutes and of that 20 minutes a bank director took 15, leaving the officials five minutes to make their case, and the reason they only got five minutes to make their case was that the Labour Court had got to go to lunch.  I challenge contradiction of that.</P>

      <P>I am reliably informed that that is a fact and that that is the opportunity that those officials got to make a case as to why they should get a luncheon hour.  Everybody knows that several bank officials' health is broken up as a result of going without food for considerable periods, from 8 or 8.30 in the morning until 4.30 in the evening.  There is no opportunity for the cashier to eat.  He cannot leave his desk.  The Labour Court when hearing the case could not give more than five minutes because they themselves had their luncheon hour at that particular time.  I think that is a perfect answer as to why the bank officials <Col N="213" /> are entitled to their luncheon hour.  I want the Government and the Minister to assure the House to-night that whatever the chaos in the banking system is it will be ended at once and that the banks will be open to-morrow. If they do not give us that undertaking I submit it is the duty of somebody, and if nobody else does it I will, to put down a motion for the cancellation of the Order made by the Government. It is in the interest of the banks and of the Government who have responsibilities <Col N="214" /> to the community that they should not be in the position of being charged, and with every evidence to sustain the charge, of being so biassed and prejudiced that without a moment's notice to anybody they took the action that they did in closing the banks without consideration.</P>

The reasons which governed its inclusion were the same as those which determined the inclusion of any other district in the scheduled turf area, namely, that it was in an area in which private enterprise might reasonably be expected to provide for its fuel requirements without the assistance of the production and distribution machinery set up for the non-turf areas.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether inquiry has been made into the manner in which fuel supplies are reaching Cobh and the quantities arriving there, and the prices which have to be paid; and if he will state whether he has received representations that serious difficulties exist there and threaten a serious situation in the coming winter; and if he will cause inquiries to be now made into the matter and take steps to have Cobh made a non-turf area.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to the similar question by Deputy Martin J. Corry to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as price is concerned, the retail prices of turf in Cobh have had to be adjusted, as in many other similar <Col N="43" /> centres, to allow for the general advance in production and transport costs.</P>
    <P>The difficulties to which the Deputy refers are common to many centres in the scheduled turf area, and I am not prepared to accord exceptional treatment to Cobh by including it in the non-turf area.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that agricultural and commercial interests in the town of Cashel, County Tipperary, and its neighbourhood are considerably inconvenienced by the non-reopening of the branch railway line to Cashel, and if he will cause inquiry to be made in the matter with a view to its early reopening.</P>

      <P>The rail services on this branch line were discontinued on account of shortage of fuel.  Córas Iompair Éireann coal stocks have improved but are still substantially less than at this time last year.  The demand on freight services is heaviest in the last quarter of the year and the company have to conserve their fuel supplies so that adequate services can be maintained for beet, grain and other essential commodities.  I am informed, however, that the Goolds Cross-Cashel branch will probably be reopened for beet traffic.</P>

    <P>Particulars of the duty paid on imports of articles of the above-mentioned description during the last three months of 1939 and during the years 1945 and 1946 are not available.</P>
    <P>The inability to furnish particulars of customs duty paid in respect of imports of articles of the above-mentioned description subsequent to the 30th September, 1939, is due to the fact that, as an economy measure in connection with the emergency, the compilation of statistics of customs duty by reference to official import list descriptions <Col N="86" /> was discontinued as from the 1st October 1939.  Since the latter date statistics of receipts of customs duty have been compiled by reference to tariff headings only.</P>
    <P>The articles mentioned form only portion of those chargeable with customs duty as personal clothing and wearing apparel under Tariff Reference No. 57/9 and, consequently, separate particulars of the duty paid in respect thereof are not available in the case of imports subsequent to the 30th September, 1939.</P>

      <P>In order to improve the service between Cashel and Clonmel, it is proposed to provide additional circuits on the existing pole routes between Cashel and Tipperary and between Tipperary and Clonmel.  The work will be put in hand as soon as circumstances permit but, owing to the amount of trunk construction arrears throughout the country, I am not in a position to say when the erection of the circuits can be undertaken.  The provision of a direct line on new poles between Cashel and Clonmel is not contemplated because it would not be warranted by the traffic between the two places.</P>

      <P>There are approximately 11,800 acres of land in hands of the Land Commission in County Roscommon.  This area is the undivided portion of about 70 estates which originally comprised about 29,500 acres, of which the purchase price was about £165,500.  About ? of the area on hands is bog or waste and turbary lettings are made wherever possible. The agricultural land is used for grazing, tillage and meadows, and is mostly let for these purposes.  The actual area is subject to frequent fluctuations.  There are difficulties and objections in the way of supplying information as to the location and area of each parcel on hands, but if the Deputy is concerned as regards any particular estate and will communicate with me I will see what can be done.</P>

      <P>The glass-house scheme provides for the establishment of two units, each consisting of 100 growers' glass-houses, a central plant propagating house and a central packing station, situated within as restricted an area as possible, so that working expenses may be minimised. One unit is being located in the Knock-Carraroe area of Connemara and the other in the Gortahork area of County Donegal.</P>
      <P>Details of the special poultry-house scheme are being worked out and it is hoped to have it put in operation shortly.</P>
