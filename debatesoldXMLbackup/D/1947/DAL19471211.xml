    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will consider the desirability of extending to Parliamentary Secretaries the rule which debars Minister from taking part in any business for profit; and if so, if he will have this done before the pending dissolution.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Taking part in any business for profit&rdquo; is a very wide term.  I am not aware of any such extreme rule applying here as that stated by the Deputy, nor am I aware of such being applied in any country. To lay down precise rules as to the private activities which might properly be carried on by a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary and those which should not be carried on is obviously a matter of considerable difficulty.</P>
      <P>It is for that reason, amongst others, that, on the 11th March last, I moved in the Dáil for the setting up of a Joint Committee of both Houses to examine this and related questions of importance concerning the duties and privileges of members of the Oirachteas. The motion was passed by the Dáil and has been on the Order Paper of the Seanad for a considerable time.  I have hesitated to take it the further stage because of the attitude of the Opposition when the motion was being discussed here.  It is clearly desirable, in a matter of this sort, to have the wholehearted co-operation of all Parties, but the Leader of the Opposition made it clear that the co-operation of his Party would not be forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="722" /> I think that, on the assembly of the new Dáil, the whole question should be taken up immediately as a matter of urgent importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reply, does the Taoiseach not realise that there is a definite restriction established by custom on Ministers taking active part in business concerns and does he not think that the same restriction should apply to Parliamentary Secretaries?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="723" /> I must point out, however, that the supply difficulties incidental to the maintenance of the public transport services are not confined to motor fuel, but extend to locomotives and rolling stock, rails, sleepers and many other items essential to the operation of rail services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state: (a) the total quantity of household coal imported, during the first 11 months of the present year; (b) the quantity of coal now on order, delivery of which is expected before the end of January, 1948; and (c) the quantities of household coal which it is expected will be imported, during the year 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the period referred to at (a) of the question there were no imports of household coal specifically as such, but as the American cargoes <Col N="724" /> of general purpose coal arrived the most suitable material was reserved for household use.</P>
      <P>As regards (b), the quantity of coal on order from sources other than Britain for delivery before the end of January, 1948, is 72,000 tons.  In the case of British coals, orders are placed from day to day for early delivery, but the quantity so ordered at a particular time is not communicated to my Department.</P>
      <P>As regards (c), no reliable forecast can be made at this stage of the household coal, if any, which may be imported in 1948.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that serious unemployment is likely to result from a continuation of the present shortage of cement; that schemes undertaken by local authorities, for the relief of unemployment around the Christmas period, are likely to be held up; and if he is prepared to make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have explained to the Dáil, the present production of cement is the maximum of which the existing factories are capable.  The prospects of importing cement in substantial quantities are not good.  It is, therefore, obvious that schemes of work involving the use of cement will have to be kept within the limits of the available supply.  There would be no advantage in employment in diverting cement from building and constructional operations to relief schemes. This does not mean that relief schemes cannot be undertaken but may necessitate a change in their character, and I assume that the officers of local authorities responsible for the administration of such schemes are giving consideration to this problem.</P>

      <P>The factories of Cement Limited are in full production, but demand shows signs of exceeding the amount that can be produced.  Discussions are at present proceeding with the directors of Cement Limited regarding the steps which should be taken to secure that any shortage which may occur will not interrupt work which is urgent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is that approximately 24,000 men are needed by Bord na Móna for the 1948 season. That number includes the board's requirements in connection with the county production schemes.  There are at present 1,200 men employed in the turf camps.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Information of the exact type the Deputy seeks is not available, but the following particulars may be helpful.</P>
      <P>It is estimated from the sale of supplementary insurance stamps at post offices for the 12 months ended 31st August, 1947, the latest year for which particulars are available, that the weekly average number of persons employed in the building trade was 22,394.</P>
      <P>During the insurance year which terminated on the 5th October, 1947, the number of wet-time books exchanged by workers in the building trade was 32,817.  In addition, 15,084 fresh wet-time books were issued during that period, making a total of 47,901.  It may be taken, therefore, that at least that number of workers will be engaged or available for engagement in March, 1948.  The proportion of these that will be available for the housing schemes of local authorities cannot be stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those figures are for the building trade only.  The Deputy's question refers also to construction work, and it <Col N="736" /> is assumed that the reference is to the industry known as construction of works or civil engineering.  There are no comparable figures available under that head, but particulars of the number of men, boys, women and girls insured against unemployment in those two industries, taken jointly, are given in table 112 of the <i>Statistical Abstract</i>, 1946.  Particulars of unemployment in each is given in table 111.  If later information of this type is desired, I shall arrange to make it available to the Deputy.</P>

The need for similar legislation here does not arise as our rateable valuations are already much lower than they would be if they were based on 1938 values.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part I am informed that, while the percentage increases over and above the 1938 rates which have been granted to the various groups which are remunerated from State funds vary according to the group concerned and to the amount of the former rates of pay, it is correct to say that a large proportion of those so remunerated have received new rates representing an increase of 30 per cent. above the 1938 rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the third and fourth parts of the question, it would appear that the Deputy is referring to those highlyefficient unmarried men principal teachers of national schools who formed the subject of the questions addressed by him to me on the 26th ultimo.  I must refer him to my replies to these questions to which I have nothing to add except that, in the case of men national teachers, comparisons between the 1938 and the new scales of pay and other grants must have regard to the fact that for the first time the <Col N="744" /> new scales made special provision for married men teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>

      <P>The special provision for married men which is a feature of the new scales for national teachers also appeared in the new scales for other classes of teachers, e.g., professors of preparatory colleges for the training of candidate teachers who are paid by my Department.  As a result, it is possible for a married man professor in one of these colleges to receive a higher salary than the principal of the college in which he is serving. Such a position can arise where there are separate scales for women, single men and married men, and as I indicated in the course of my replies to the questions which the Deputy addressed to me on the 26th November last relative to the new scales for national teachers, I do not admit that any anomaly in the sense of an injustice or an inequality is thereby created.  In the circumstances, I do not propose to make arrangements to alter the underlying principles of the new scales for national teachers.</P>

Only one half of the grant in respect of the daily cleaning of the school-rooms was <Col N="746" /> paid.

      <P>Some of the attendants in the museum are required by the conditions of their appointment to undertake what is called Sunday duty, and a number of other attendants who are not required to do so volunteer for this duty.  Sunday duty consists in the supervision of the collections during the period of three hours on Sunday afternoons in the portion of the museum which is open to the public; one attendant also remains in the museum, for periods of four hours at a time, on Sundays when the museum is not open to the public.  The additional payment for this Sunday duty is not reckoned on an hourly basis; an inclusive sum is paid for the period of duty (whether of three or four hours): 5/3 for an unestablished attendant, 6/9 for an established attendant, and 8/5 for the attendant in charge.</P>

Duty is at present based on a minimum <Col N="748" /> weekly attendance of 44 hours, with liability to attend up to 48 hours a week without extra remuneration.

It was rejected by the then Minister <Col N="749" /> for Justice.  I think that this decision was right and I do not propose to alter it.

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if his attention has been called to the hardships inflicted on leaseholders in county boroughs and urban districts by reason of the fact that, on the expiration of their leases, ground landlords invariably increase ground rents to a substantial extent and impose on leaseholders other burdens which are so onerous as to be unjustifiable; whether it is his intention to take steps, by legislation or otherwise, to put an end to this practice; and if <Col N="751" /> so, when he will introduce proposals for this purpose.</P>

      <P>Landlords are not free, as seems to be implied in the question, to charge any rent or impose any conditions they like upon the renewal of expiring leases.  Under Part V of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, the terms upon which reversionary leases may be granted are regulated and no landlord may arbitrarily dictate the terms of the new lease.  Whether the provisions of the 1931 Act require modification in favour of leaseholders is a difficult question upon which I am not at present prepared to commit myself. An opportunity of considering the matter in all its aspects will present itself when a Bill to amend the Act of 1931 on comprehensive lines is introduced. It has not been found possible to make the progress I had hoped for in the preparation of this Bill owing to my Department's preoccupation with more urgent matters, but I shall endeavour to secure that the Bill will be ready for introduction as early as possible next year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether any arrangements have been made for the absorption into civilian employment of persons demobilised from the Army during the past 18 months; and if so, whether he will indicate the arrangements so made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply is in a rather lengthy form and, with the permission of the Deputy and also the permission of the Chair, I propose to have it circulated in the Official Report.  Following is the reply:</P>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is yes, provided that the persons were members of the Defence Forces before the period of general demobilisation began, i.e., before 11th May, 1945.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrangements to facilitate the absorption of these men into employment were outlined in the White Paper on Demobilisation and Resettlement of Members of the Defence Forces published on the 11th May, <Col N="752" /> 1945, and may be summarised as follows:-</P>
    <P>(1)  Special competitions confined to persons who served in the Defence Forces during the emergency are held from time to time by the Civil Service Commissioners for various posts in the Civil Service.  Age concessions are granted in open written competitions for Civil Service and local authority posts.</P>
    <P>(2)  Concessions in the form of age deductions and extra marks are granted to ex-Army candidates for professional, technical or similar posts which are filled by selection board procedure in the Civil Service or under local authorities.</P>
    <P>(3)  In the filling of subordinate posts in Government Departments (such as labourers, messengers, firelighters, temporary and part-time postmen, etc.) every consideration is given to applicants with Army service.</P>
    <P>(4)  Local authorities have been requested to grant preferences to the fullest extent possible in respect of Army service in connection with local appointments other than those filled by examination or selection board procedure.</P>
    <P>(5)  Semi-State bodies and public utility companies in response to requests have undertaken to give preference in employment where possible to demobilised members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>(6)  Various appeals have been and are being made to employers to give preference in employment to demobilised ex-servicemen.  A special register of a large number of employers who are willing to accord this preference is maintained by the Department of Social Welfare and special arrangements have been made to deal with the applications from registered employers who require the services of ex-Army men.</P>
    <P>(7)  A special register of unemployed demobilised men is maintained in the Department of Social Welfare and every effort is made to aid the man so registered to obtain employment.  In this connection an industrial history card giving full particulars of the Army service and other qualifications of the <Col N="753" /> ex-serviceman is transmitted to that Department by the Army authorities.</P>
    <P>(8)  The Defence Forces Acts provide for the reinstatement of persons who were in employment when they enlisted in the Defence Forces for the duration of the emergency or when, as members of the reserve, they were called out on permanent service.  They must be reinstated if reasonably practicable in an occupation and under conditions not less favourable than those which would have been applicable if they had not enlisted or been called out on permanent service.</P>
    <P>(9)  A special section in the Department of Defence advises ex-servicemen as to the facilities obtainable and endeavours to assist them in every way practicable.</P>
    <P>(10)  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is prepared to grant facilities necessary under Emergency Powers Orders to enable demobilised men to trade in, or to obtain controlled commodities for the purpose of setting up in business.</P>
    <P>(11)  Finally, gratuities were provided on as generous a scale as possible to assist ex-members of the Defence Forces who served during the emergency in resettlement in civilian life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the reply covers the main question.  May I ask a supplementary question without having seen the reply?  Bearing in mind the fact that there is still a large number of ex-service men unemployed and that whatever schemes the Minister had in mind have clearly failed to absorb large numbers of those unemployed, will the Minister say whether his Department has under consideration any proposals for an extension of the scheme of rehabilitation in civilian employment of the large number of ex-service men who are at present unable to obtain employment?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Thomas Patridge, Bohermore, Ardmore, Ardagh, County Longford, was refused a certificate of military service because the Referee reported that he is not a person to whom the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934, applies.  An appeal against the findings of the Referee was considered in May, 1944, and in the light of the additional evidence submitted, I requested the Referee to review his report.  The Referee on review confirmed his original findings.  A further appeal was made by Mr. Patridge, but the evidence submitted by him did not warrant the reopening of his claim.</P>
      <P>Mr. Patridge applied for a service medal subsequent to the 31st December, 1946, the latest date for receipt of applications.  His claim has been noted and will be investigated when the necessary amending legislation has been enacted.</P>
      <P>Mr. Patridge is in receipt of a disability pension of 10s. 6d. per week.</P>

Will the Minister say why that person's application for a service certificate did not include the granting of a medal?  I would like to know if the Minister is further aware that on the last Military Services Pensions Estimate I was informed that an application for a military service pension of that nature also included an application for a medal and that therefore the application for the medal could not be considered late?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I can only rely on the information which has been given to me and which I presume is accurate.  Neither the Deputy nor myself could undertake to examine cases which the Referee has examined. I presume he had all the necessary evidence before him at that examination. As I pointed out in my reply, this man made an appeal which I allowed and forwarded to the Referee. That appeal was also examined and, even in respect of the additional evidence, the Referee still found the Act did not apply to him.  I take it the same would apply to the disability pension.  The disability pension is awarded by a board which consists of military and civil personnel.  There again I cannot intervene.</P>

It is a statement which I can make on oath, if necessary.  The facts are as I have stated, and surely it is the Minister's duty to see that a person unable, because of the service he rendered and the hardships he underwent, to make a case, is treated justly.  The Minister is bound to see that justice is done in a case of that type.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to a similar question which he asked in the House on the 28th November, 1945, in reply to which statistical data was circulated with the Official Report.  That data contained information relative to the various rates of special allowance granted to Mr. Meade up to the 31st October, 1946. Since that date the special allowance has been varied from the maximum rate of £91 10s. 0d. per annum (taking into consideration Mr. Meade's military service pension of £37 1s. 8d. per annum) to £5 10s. 0d. per annum, which is the appropriate rate at present. These variations have been made in relation to the changing means of the applicant in accordance with Section 7 of the Army Pensions Act, 1943.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister refers me to a reply he gave me in 1945.  This old I.R.A. man, Owen Meade, got a pension of £83 per year.  He is now a total wreck and he has the glorious sum of £5 10s. 0d. per year from a grateful Government.  Will the Minister reconsider this case?  Will he see this man Owen Meade, whom he knows personally, and will he judge from his appearance whether he can work?  Will he find out whether this man can continue to exist?  To my mind, he can only starve on an allowance of £5 10s. 0d. per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must surely understand that the special allowance to which he referred was designed to prevent any old I.R.A. man from having to enter a county home, if he has neither friends nor means and if he comes within the terms of the Act.  If, by any chance, there are certain means coming into the house&mdash;and there are means coming into this house from the <Col N="757" /> children, who are wage earners&mdash;a different position is established.  I mentioned in my reply that the changing means have meant a change in the amount he receives.  At present it would appear that quite a number of the members of this man's family, who are residing with him, assist him. Surely the Deputy does not suggest that the children of this man are not entitled to contribute something towards his upkeep and that the State should be asked to do all that?  This is a special allowance, not a reward. Owen Meade got a military service pension award for his service as an I.R.A. man and this is supplementary to that.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware that one son aged 25 years got £2 a week&mdash;not sufficient to keep himself.  Another son, aged 17 years, got 25/- a week&mdash;not sufficient to keep himself. He is badly clothed, ill-fed and his health has broken down because of the service which he has given the Government and I want the Government to see that he does not suffer as a result of it.</P>

His claim under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934, for a certificate of military service was refused because the referee reported that he is not a person to <Col N="758" /> whom the Act applies and an appeal against the finding of the referee was rejected on the ground that the evidence submitted did not warrant the reopening of the case.  Mr. Gurren was not called before the referee as the latter is not statutorily bound to hear any applicant.  Under Section 5 of the Military Service Pensions (Amendment) Act, 1945, my power to request the referee to review his report in the case has been withdrawn and the findings contained in the referee's report are now final and incapable of review.</P>

      <P>In reply to questions by the Deputy on the 13th March last I gave a full explanation of the position at Kiltarsaghaun.  In that reply I indicated that further migration from the townland could only be effected at the expense of other acutely congested townlands still awaiting relief and is, therefore, quite impracticable.  I also indicated that in the case of this townland the Land Commission had been left with no option but to proceed with a scheme for the improvement and distribution of the vacated lands without further regard to the rearrangement of the holdings.  Since my reply action has been proceeding but I am unable to say when it may be possible for the Land Commission to complete the matter.</P>
      <P>As regards the townland of Tawnynagry the question of the rearrangement of the holdings therein is noted for investigation by the Land Commission, but it is not possible at present to state when a scheme for this townland can be put on hands.

They will also <Col N="774" /> exercise all other powers vested in &ldquo;housing authorities&rdquo; by the Bill, except those reserved to county councils by this amendment.</P>

It has been reprinted since and that has upset things.  I am correcting it now.  There are, I think, a few of them in which the numbers are wrong.  This is one of them.

      <P>This amendment, Sir, is in two parts.  The first part deals with a question raised by Deputy Dockrell on the Committee Stage of <Col N="776" /> this Bill in which he raised the point that objection might be taken by some people in possession of a certain type of property to have that property described as a tenement house.  The purpose of this amendment is to substitute for the phrase &ldquo;tenement house&rdquo; the phrase &ldquo;multiple dwelling&rdquo;. I should have thought that would have been intelligible, even to some of the Deputies who have spoken here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Particularly in view of the fact, Sir, that it was at their instance the amendment was made. The next amendment is designed to meet the point made by Deputy de Valera on the Committee Stage and to convey to local authorities a statutory admonition that their permission is not to be unreasonably withheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point again, purely as a matter of draftsmanship, a &ldquo;multiple dwelling&rdquo; in Section 11 is being substituted for &ldquo;tenement house&rdquo;.  That is to meet an objection made by Deputy Dockrell.  Now, a tenement house is already defined in sub-section (3).  Do I understand that multiple dwelling will also be substituted instead of tenement in subsection (3)?  It would be a consequential amendment, but is it provided for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <P>Now, which amendment is it?  I am still in a difficulty in trying to co-relate these amendments. If &ldquo;multiple dwelling&rdquo; is substituted in Section 11 a consequential amendment is necessary in sub-section (3).  I have not examined the Act to see whether any other consequential amendment is necessary.</P>

      <P>This, as I have already said, on the Committee Stage, is a perfect &ldquo;Marie Antoinette&rdquo; approach to housing.  First of all, it is laid down specifically that people must not set their houses in tenements and that the local authorities, in certain circumstances, may tell them that they are not to do so, quite oblivious of the fact that the only reason the house is a tenement house is because the unfortunate people who are living in the sordid rooms available have nowhere else to live.  This point having been taken by our modern &ldquo;Marie Antoinette&rdquo;, his contribution is: &ldquo;Very well&rdquo;&mdash;if they have to live in a loathsome tenement at the foot of Dominick Street let us mitigate their suffering by calling it not a tenement but a &ldquo;multiple dwelling&rdquo;.  That will greatly relieve the stress of their circumstances. So long as we do not mention tenements, we do not have to worry about them.  Are we not travelling in this House along a most extraordinary road?  These two sections are designed to prevent the spread of tenement conditions into new parts of the city.</P>

But that really was not the substance of my objection, which was that, under the description &ldquo;tenement houses&rdquo;, two utterly and distinct classes of dwellings come in and can be classified as similar.  We all know what a tenement house is and what a flat is.</P>

      <P>I have said that whether the description be &ldquo;tenement house&rdquo; or &ldquo;multiple dwelling&rdquo;, whichever you like to call them, the two classes of dwellings were included under the one heading and the ordinary person has no difficulty in differentiating between these two classes of houses, namely, tenement houses and houses let in flats.  That is the sum and substance of what I am getting at. The Minister is going to a great deal of trouble and is putting local authorities to a great deal of trouble and annoyance in differentiating between certain flats that are no more tenement houses <Col N="783" /> than this House is.  The Minister invited the other evening some definition which would distinguish the two classes but I should like to remind the Minister that a tenement house occurs like a disease.  It seems just to become a tenement house.  Nobody christened it, changed the name, altered the structure or did anything like that; it just became a tenement house.  As I have said, no one in this House would have the slightest difficulty in differentiating between a tenement house and a flat.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that a flat is a place that has a closed hall door.</P>

I suppose the Oireachtas has no right to do wrong, but it does seem as if local authorities all over the country will be burdened with the task of differentiating between certain classes of dwellings.  In my opinion if the definition here were more precise and better clarified, it would enable <Col N="784" /> them to reduce their work and possibly obviate a certain amount of annoyance to people who are not tenement dwellers and who do not live in tenement houses.  That is the substance of my objection to the Minister's amendment as introduced.  He says: &ldquo;I do not care whether they are flats or tenement houses; they will have to be registered and I shall call them `multiple dwellings'.

If there is no substance in that, let the Minister state that openly and clearly, namely that dwellers' flats will have to be registered just the same as tenement houses and the local authority will have the trouble of going through whole streets composed of houses let in flats.  That is the substance of my objection.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dockrell is probably aware of what led to the introduction of this term but it does not <Col N="785" /> arise and he cannot reopen it.  We are strictly confined to the question of tenement houses.  The important point in regard to the insertion of the phrase arises really in the definition sub-section, sub-section (3) in the light of which the amendment in sub-section (1) must be read.  Clearly whatever type of house or dwelling the provisions of sub-section (1) are to apply to, it is a premises let in parts to form two or more dwellings.  After that it is a question of the name you call it.  The Minister in the original draft inserted the words &ldquo;tenement house&rdquo; which in my submission and in my view would most nearly accord with the ordinary legal phraseology and from the purely legal draftsmanship point of view, was probably the best way.  It was pointed out to the Minister in Committee&mdash;I think Deputy Dillon was not here at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It was pointed out that there was some difference, that Deputy Dockrell wished to draw a distinction between flats and tenement houses.  In that way attention was drawn to the fact that &ldquo;tenement house&rdquo; has a more localised popular meaning.  It is obviously intended that both types&mdash;in other words, any type of premises let in parts like that&mdash;have to be captured by the provisions of this section.  Therefore, if you are to keep the words &ldquo;tenement house&rdquo;, used in the popular sense, and if you want to differentiate them from flats, a term will have to be sought to include both.  I think it was better drafted as it stood but, if you want to embrace both, some phrase will have to be thought out.  I believe &ldquo;multiple dwelling&rdquo; is as good as any other.</P>
      <P>The essential point to be noted, the point of substance is that the section captures both the tenement house, as colloquially so-called, and the type of house with which we associate a tenement house together with flats; in other words, any house sub-divided between separate tenants and subtenants. Perhaps the amendment is preferable, but I do not see very much difference between them.</P>

      <P>At the request of the Chair I withdraw the remark.  I desire to draw attention to the fact that in choosing a word for the purpose of this statute which will identify the most fashionable flats in Pembroke Road with a tenement house in Dominick Street, Lower Gardiner Street or Meath Street, we have lighted upon the delicious euphemism of &ldquo;multiple dwellings&rdquo;.  It has been suggested by the Minister that he might now withdraw this amendment and revert to the words &ldquo;tenement house&rdquo;.  I am all for the Minister withdrawing his amendment.  I understood Deputy Dockrell to suggest the use of these words &ldquo;multiple dwellings&rdquo; under the impression that a distinction was being made between the luxury flat and the Dominick Street tenement room.  The Minister is now emphatic that he does not want to make any distinction, that he never did want to make any distinction but that <Col N="787" /> he thought the words &ldquo;multiple dwelling&rdquo; sounded more euphonious in the ear of Deputy Dockrell than &ldquo;tenement house&rdquo;.

      <P>I assure you I am.  The word &ldquo;tenement&rdquo; to us and to anyone who understands the city has always connoted something.  The words &ldquo;multiple dwelling&rdquo; connote nothing. You do not change bread into cake by calling bread &ldquo;cake&rdquo;; you do not change tenement houses into flats by calling them &ldquo;multiple dwellings&rdquo;.  I exhort the Minister to eschew the role of Marie Antoinette, to be a realist for a little while and to withdraw this amendment and restore to its rightful place those words of evil omen, &ldquo;tenement house&rdquo;, until such time as they cease to exist, not as a result of an obliterating statute but as a result of the provision of adequate houses for those who are festering in the tenement houses.  When that is done, there will be no need for euphemisms like multiple dwellings; tenements will be no more than a memory and the flats will be something to which no one can take exception, for which no one ought to be compelled to register at the City Hall, and which the local authority ought not to have power to prohibit. Then the necessity for these sections will disappear and any diminution of the powers of the bureaucrat to regulate them is welcome.  I want to see the day speeded when that diminution will take place.  I do not want to see the day dawn when we can still our conscience in this House by changing <Col N="788" /> the name to something the existence of which we are ashamed to admit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am discussing this question and I intend to discuss it for a considerable time.  I have watched carefully the attempts which have been made by means of a series of points of order to get the Chair to prevent me from speaking.  It is a perfectly Parliamentary expression to describe the rejoinders of the Minister as impudent.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to abolish an annual process and to substitute a triennial process.  I think that any Deputy of this House on the occasion of such a proposal is entitled to ask the Minister for reassurance that the triennial operation will prove adequate.  <i>Prima facie</i>, the fact that the Minister proposed that it should be an annual operation would suggest that when he and his experts examined this matter they made up their minds that an annual operation was necessary.  We are entitled to assume that they did not do that for fun, that they did not do it for the pure joy of poking their noses into other people's business, but that they did it because they thought that some public benefit would be gained by making it an annual operation.</P>
      <P>Now the Minister says that in deference to Deputy O'Connor's proposal he is bringing in an amendment to make it triennial.  Why?  Is the triennial proposal sufficient?  If it is, why did he propose an annual examination? Surely the Minister has a duty upon him to justify himself if he wants to amend his own proposal.  Surely it is not a justification to say that Deputy O'Connor suggested this and that, therefore, this is what we are going to do.  Justification is what I am now asking and refusal to give it is impudent.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon has been getting away with personalities.  He has raised a row because on the Committee Stage the Minister for Local Government was considerate enough to listen to arguments against having an annual inspection and for having a triennial inspection.  Because he takes notice of reasonable arguments put to him in the House and puts down an amendment, Deputy Dillon finds fault with him.  He wants this House to be conducted as a dictatorship.  Deputy Cogan asked had we heard of such a person as Hitler.  This is a democracy and this is a democratic institution.  A previous amendment was made to meet representations made in the House by Deputy Dockrell and this amendment was made to meet representations made by another Deputy, but now Deputy Dillon finds fault and says that he must have an answer.  He argued that because an annual inspection was laid down in the Bill as it was originally drafted it should not be altered.  I disagree entirely with this point of view and I hope that Ministers will continue to follow suit as the present Minister is doing in being prepared to make reasonable amendments to a Bill as a result of reasoned arguments made to support them.</P>

      <P>I think, perhaps, that I might be able to shed some light on this as I was actively involved in the discussion.  The facts are very fully set out in the reports for such Deputies as were not present on the discussion on the amendment in Committee. I, among others, urged the Minister to have the licence in force <i>sine die.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister had his arguments for the section as it stood.  Another <Col N="792" /> Deputy suggested a compromise solution. The Minister, having listened very fully to arguments from both sides of the house &mdash; and both sides of the House took part in the discussion &mdash;said he would consider the matter. He now gives a very middle-way solution. I would still like to have pushed the matter as far as I was pushing it on the first Committee Stage but the Minister had his answers to my argument. He has now tried to meet the situation.  From that point of view this amendment seems the most reasonable he could bring in to suit the case. For instance, my objection in connection with the annual licensing is largely answered by this amendment.  It also preserves some of the points the Minister himself made in support of his own draft.  No further explanation is necessary.</P>

      <P>I feel it would be unduly harsh on the owners of flats or multiple dwellings to have to go for an annual revision.  I suggest that a provision should be inserted to provide for discrimination where a dwelling would obviously not necessitate revision.  I am satisfied the Minister has gone a considerable way to meet my point by inserting &ldquo;such period not exceeding three years&rdquo;, which, of course, is a very different thing to &ldquo;twelve months after that date&rdquo;.  I presume that, in respect of what are strictly tenement houses, a regulation will be made demanding annual revision.</P>

My only objection is that there is no provision in this section to enable the Minister to make regulations. I would suggest that the Minister should strengthen the operation of this sub-section, as it would be amended by this amendment, by inserting a new sub-section giving himself <Col N="793" /> power to make regulations.  I do not like the idea that it should be left entirely to the housing authority to decide which types of multiple dwellings shall be inspected annually and which trienially.</P>

At the request of the Chair and in order to facilitate the work of the House, I pointed out that there was a considerable number of these amendments which it would not be necessary to commit.  The Chair suggested that it would be more convenient if we recommitted the Bill in respect of all the amendments so that we should not be moving in and out of Committee. I am sure the Chair will recognise that it might be necessary to go into Committee for the purpose of discussing certain amendments.  In view of the fact that the Bill has been recommitted, at the wish of the Chair, and that the Chair has full discretion to bring the debate on any one of these amendments to a close, I am asking you, Sir, to exercise your discretion in that regard and not to permit the debate on these amendments to be unnecessarily prolonged by permitting Deputies to repeat themselves or speak more than once on any amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon was not, I suppose, present during the debate on the Committee Stage of this section.  He is definitely well aware, as he has indicated himself, of the circumstances which led to this amendment. I propose to address myself to <Col N="794" /> the point which has been made by Deputy Sheldon.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to take power to make regulations under this section.  The section was introduced at the urgent request of the housing authorities in the larger boroughs, particularly in the City of Dublin.  They wanted to have power to make the annual inspection and to give a yearly permission to allow the house to be let to more than one family, for use in parts as two or more dwellings&mdash;a yearly permission.  I can meet the case which was made for the better-class flats where such an inspection would be considered by the housing authority to be unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have now all become inflamed with a great solicitude for the flat provider.  Poor darling, he is not to be upset by the necessity for an annual registration.  You would imagine that these warriors were down-trodden struggling citizens &mdash; a gang we know to have bought up a multitude of houses in this city, very largely at scrap prices.  They converted these houses into what they called flats and are now squeezing out of the unfortunate families that inhabit the flats immense wealth.  That is one class of owner we are considering.  The other class is our old friend the tenement owners.  A difficulty has been created by the lumping together of these two classes of dwellings.  The prior interest is unquestionably the most vulnerable people, and the tenement dwellers are desperately vulnerable.  If it is the Minister's policy to lump the flats and the tenements together that is his business, but if they are to be lumped together, then on his head be the inconvenience caused to flat owners.  I think the flat owner is getting quite enough out of his flats as it is without showing him any further special consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am thinking of is the tenement dweller who is paying 5/- or 6/- per week for the two-pair back because he has no where else to go.  The local authority comes in and licenses the tenement house on condition, under sub-section (2) paragraph (a), that the owner carries out repairs and reconditioning. <Col N="795" /> Now, under the Bill as introduced by the Minister, the local authority had a right to go back at the end of the year and, when that tenement owner came for his re-registration, to say: &ldquo;Show me that you carried out the repairs and the reconditioning that you undertook to carry out when we gave you the registration last January&rdquo; and, if he has not carried them out, the local authority can proceed to withhold the permission to use the house as a tenement house for the profitable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>For the profitable purpose it is intended.  What is the object of the triennial inspection?  Are not the flat owners, God knows, well enough off as it is?  Will it not be an added safeguard to the poor living in tenement houses to have an annual inspection and to have on the 1st January that threat hanging over every tenement owner?</P>

      <P>There is nothing to prevent that, but I want to make it mandatory. If you had lived long enough in this city you would know that the tenement owners of this city pull no little weight.  It has been a struggle for the past 50 years&mdash;oh, for much longer than that.  I remember hearing them talked about when I was a boy.  I was born and reared in the city.  The Deputy was not.  I have heard the problem of how to grapple with the tenement owners discussed long ago.  When you tracked the tenement owners down how often did you discover to your amazement who they were?  They were quite influential people.  If there were an option given to the local authority to examine them only once every three years, or once every year, considering some of the boys I know who own tenement property in this city, it would be a &ldquo;bould&rdquo; city manager who would refuse to exercise his discretion and give them a triennial examination instead of an annual one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I prefer the proposal made by the Minister when he introduced the Bill; that is, that there should be a mandatory annual inspection as a condition of the renewal of the licence.  The Minister alleges that he has given way on that to accommodate the flat proprietors.  The flat proprietors&mdash;what section of this community has grown richer more rapidly than the flat proprietors?  Is it not notorious that they have doubled and trebled and quadrupled their incomes in the last few years?  Why are we all so solicitous for fear the flat proprietors would be inconvenienced, upset or disturbed?  If, in defence of the tenement dweller, we made it mandatory on the licensing of property to have an annual examination I would have been very well prepared to have a distinction made in regard to what is commonly known as flats in one category, on the ground that the tenants of flats are usually fairly prosperous people well able to look after themselves, whereas the tenants of tenement rooms are usually poor people, habitually exploited and peculiarly defenceless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="797" /> If that had been practicable I would have been prepared to consent to a triennial examination of flats provided there is an annual examination of the tenement rooms.  But, if I am to choose between equating the tenement room to the flat and stipulating for the tenement rooms a mandatory annual inspection because of its aristocratic association in this Bill, and inconveniencing the poor, harassed, distressed flatowner in this city, then I elect for inconveniencing the poor, distressful flat-owner, in order to ensure that the tenement owner will be harassed, disciplined, inspected and compelled to carry out the conditions provided for in his licence; and that we shall continue to harass, control and compel him until such time as we can take appropriate measures to banish his kind for ever from our midst.  I exhort the Minister to revert to his own proposal. The House ought to know that the Minister came in here fortified with the advice of people who have been studying the housing problem in this city from the point of view of the exploited tenements.  Their preference, born of their experience, was for mandatory annual inspection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no power under this Bill to provide for a mandatory annual inspection.  There is a permission to have an annual inspection but there is no compulsion to have it.  As the Bill first came before us it was a mandatory provision that there should be an annual inspection.  Do any Deputies in this House stop to ask themselves why the Minister's advisers stipulated for that?  Was it for fun? Was it because their experience of the tenement problem lead them to believe it was necessary?  Of course it was because their experience of the tenement problem lead them to believe it was necessary.  I do not give a fiddle-de-dee for the flats.  Let the people who live in flats look after their own interests.  What concern is it of ours? Why should we interfere in their business? I do not give a fiddle-de-dee for flat owners.  What business is it of ours?  They are well able to look after <Col N="798" /> themselves.  My concern is for the tenement dweller and it is the only category of persons provided for in this euphemistic multiple dwelling which ought to concern this House.  We have no right to go round as busy-bodies poking our noses into the business of flat holders and flat renters.  Let them look after their own business.</P>

Does he not agree with me that it would be an immense boon and blessing that every tenement owner in this city should be fixed with notice that, if he wanted to go into that business, he would be faced with the knowledge that he would remain in it only so long as he retained his licence to operate the house as a tenement house, which would be renewable annually and only after inspection?

      <P>In page 7, Part II, after Section 14, line 27, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>15.&mdash;A housing authority shall have the like powers of making and enforcing by-laws respecting houses containing not more than two rooms and intended or used for occupation by members of the working classes which are occupied by not more than one family as are conferred, under Section 20 of the Housing (Ireland) Act, 1919, on the local authority of an urban district or town in the case of houses intended or used for occupation by members of the working classes which are let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family and the provisions of the said Section 20 shall have effect as if such by-laws were made under that section.</P>

      <P>16.&mdash;(1)  The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, and subject to regulations made under this section make, out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas, to any person or public utility society erecting one or more than one house, a grant not exceeding the appropriate sum specified in the Third Schedule to this Act if&mdash;</P>

      <P>(b)  such house or houses complies or comply with the rules set out in the First Schedule to the Act of 1932;</P>

    <P>(4)  The Minister may make regulations for the purposes of this section.</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill and on the Committee Stage a strong appeal was made from all quarters of the House for making the new housing grant retrospective.  This amendment provides that the grants payable to persons and public utility societies for owner occupation will apply to houses commenced on or after 1st November, 1945, but not occupied on 1st November, 1947.  I indicated that I would bring in an amendment more or less on these lines but that, in view of the great variety of cases which might have to be covered, I would not propose to give the full amount of the grants originally provided for in the Bill. This amendment accordingly proposes to give grants equivalent to 70 per cent. of the grants originally proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was one of those who appealed to the Minister to make this grant retrospective.  I do not know what the Official Report will convey, but I am not aware that the Minister said that he would give a lesser grant than was provided in the original Bill. There is one point to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention. There appears to be no provision for any improvement of the reconstruction grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the Deputy has not read the list of amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a provision for the payment of moneys for houses built before this Bill is passed.  I know it is a very popular position for all sides of the House, but nevertheless I am bound to say that I consider retrospective provisos of that kind to introduce an extremely dangerous principle.  If you are going to authorise the whole community to anticipate legislation of this House and to build houses without inspection, authorisation or anything else and then, when a Housing Act is brought in, clamour sufficiently loudly to get the provisions of the Housing <Col N="804" /> Act although they have not manifestly complied with the conditions, you are introducing a principle the end of which I think is extremely hard to foresee.  Has it ever happened before? Has this House ever passed a Housing Act which imposed certain preliminary duties on grantees before qualifying for a grant and then inserted a paragraph providing that those who anticipated the Bill and complied with none of the conditions shall get their grant retrospectively in part?</P>
      <P>Subject to that note of warning I want to renew to the Minister for Local Government a representation which I made on the Second Stage of the Bill.  If we are going to hand out public money to public utility societies, as you are going to do under this amendment, you should be certain that the public utility societies are genuine and that they will honestly serve the individuals whom they purport to serve. I therefore suggest that the Minister should at some stage for the purposes of his Bill and of the housing code generally, declare that the words &ldquo;public utility societies&rdquo; will mean societies to be scheduled by him annually as public utility societies in good standing.  I know at the present time the surveillance of public societies is the responsibility of another Minister altogether, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I venture to suggest that the approach of that Department to the public utility society problem is entirely remote from what the approach of the Minister for Local Government would be.  So far as public utility societies under the sphere of interest of the Minister for Local Government are concerned, they would be mainly of the building society character, which would exist primarily to assist people who require assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The well-established public utility societies of this country, I believe, would regard themselves as trustees with all the liabilities of trustees, morally at least, for their members. But there are societies down the country which to my knowledge have acted with grave impropriety and from which to this day grantees find an interminable difficulty in getting money.  I do not want to abolish good work.  There may be some good societies in rural <Col N="805" /> Ireland.  What I want is that the Minister would conduct an annual survey of the different utility societies and strike out of the annual schedules only such ones as he believes are not performing their duties faithfully.  I think that is a reasonable request.  I do not believe that there is a Deputy in this House who does not know that is a necessary precaution that should be taken for the protection of the grantees of housing grants down the country.  I suggest to the Minister that if he does that, he will do someing really useful to restore confidence in the minds of many people who have at present legitimate grounds for serious apprehension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing further to say except to correct one or two misapprehensions under which Deputy Dillon seems to labour.  First of all this is not creating a new precedent so far as housing finance is concerned. It does, in fact, follow the example of the 1924 Act in giving retrospective effect to certain of its provisions in relation to grants.  It is giving retrospective recognition to the fact that a great number of people who began to build houses after the 1st November, 1945, met with unexpected difficulties in trying to complete their undertakings.  I shall accept Deputy Cogan's statement that I did not precisely state how I was going to deal with the situation but I think if the Deputy reads the statement I made on the matter, as reported in column 570, he will certainly see there that I mentioned a number of considerations, including the fact that building costs in 1945 and 1946 did not show any very great increase over building costs in earlier years.  It was only, in fact, in the spring of 1947 that a sharp upward trend in building costs began to manifest itself.  No doubt my amendment was meant to be a comprehensive one to deal with the situation but it had to be designed to deal with the general average situation and not with particular cases of extreme hardship.  That was quite clear when I said that I would bring in an amendment which I thought would go far to meet that particular situation.  I added &ldquo;at least it will go <Col N="806" /> as far as I am able to go.&rdquo;  It seems to me that that was a clear indication of the fact that I was not prepared to go the whole hog and to give everybody who began to build a house after the year 1945, whether he began to build in the beginning of 1945 or in the beginning of 1946, the same consideration as was given in the Bill to those who began to build in November of this year when, in fact, the rise in building costs was substantial and undeniable.</P>
      <P>I do not want to follow Deputy Dillon into the question of public utility societies.  There is no reason to believe that public utility societies in general are dishonest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;nor were they brought into existence by the Housing Act, 1932, nor was recognition first given to them as house-building agencies in the Act of 1932.  There were specific grants for public utility societies in the Act of 1925, and there was no closer supervision exercised over public societies in the year 1925 or in the year 1931 than in the year 1932.  There is perhaps closer supervision over them now than ever there was under the régime of our predecessors. In any event, what we have to recognise is that they have performed a very useful function in providing houses for the people.  Under the Act of 1932 public utility societies, between them, have built about 16,000 dwellings, and the great majority of them have given satisfaction.  Of course, there may have been a few societies which were inefficiently managed, a few societies which were poorly administered, but I have not yet had brought to my notice, by Deputy Dillon or anybody else, a public utility society the officers of which have been guilty of fraud or any criminal misconduct.</P>

That has been the common statement of the Deputy upon every Housing Bill that I have handled. Now the Deputy has to admit that he has never brought to my notice any information which he may have in his possession which would enable me to investigate his statement and prove for myself and the House whether it was founded or unfounded.</P>

This young man, according to his inquiry, is worried whether, under the Minister's powers, the person to get the grant is the young man who ordered the house, but who did not erect it.  It says here &ldquo;erect&rdquo; and I would like to insert the words &ldquo;or ordered&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;erect&rdquo;.  This young man is not a builder, so he will not erect, but he puts his money down and ordered a <Col N="811" /> house through a builder.  He is worried whether the builder erecting the house will get the grant rather than himself. I would like to have the matter cleared up.

      <P>(c)  the person erecting the house undertakes with the housing authority that, subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by regulations made under this section, he will not sell the house and that he will let the house subject to such conditions as may be so prescribed.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="812" /> This is to meet the case of a person who owns a house which is let and to let him dispose of his interests without converting the house into an owneroccupied house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister reassure me that in covering that he is covering the point which I was attempting to make by inserting &ldquo;without the permission of the Minister and the housing authority&rdquo;?  I put that down on Committee and I was not here to move it.  I think that it would more or less cover any cases of hardship which might arise.  The difficulty would be that where there is an absolute prohibition to sell, cases of hardship might arise and even the Minister, with the best will in the world, could do nothing about it.  I think that the hardship that might arise if there was absolute prohibition to sell could be got round.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that we could frame a regulation under this section as now amended to cover cases of hardship, but I wish to make this quite clear: we desire to exclude any possibility of a house which was let to a tenant being converted into an owner-occupied house.</P>
      <P>I am quite prepared to allow a landlord to sell his interest in a house provided that the house remains a tenanted house and the main object of the regulations is to enable that to be done.  I do not say that we could not frame a regulation to deal with cases of hardship; I would like to hear further argument on the question out I am not prepared to do it on this Bill.  I think that there is something to be said for the point of view that Deputy Sheldon has put and it might encourage people to build houses if they felt that they could get rid of them if the necessity arose.  On the other hand, we are not anxious to do anything which might reduce the pool of houses for letting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister and that is why I suggest that the permission of both the Minister and the housing authority would have to be obtained.  I thought that would be a pretty sufficient safeguard and I could not imagine anyone codding both the housing authority and the Minister.  I <Col N="813" /> think that when the Minister looks into it he could frame a regulation to cover cases of severe hardship.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 9, after Section 17, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>(1)  The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, and subject to regulations made under this section make, out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachas, to any public utility society erecting one or more than one house for occupation by a person of the working classes or an agricultural labourer, a grant not exceeding the appropriate sum specified in the Sixth Schedule to this Act, if&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  erection commenced on or after the 1st day of November, 1945, and is completed on or before the 1st day of April, 1950; and,</P>
      <P>(b)  such house or houses complies or comply with the rules set forth in the First Schedule to the Act of 1932; and</P>
      <P>(c)  such house or houses was or were not occupied before the 1st day of November, 1947; and</P>
      <P>(d)  such public utility society undertakes with the Minister that such society will not sell such house or houses and will let such house or houses only at such rent and subject to such conditions as may be approved by the Minister.</P>
      <P>(2)  A housing authority shall, subject to regulations made under this section, make, to any public utility society erecting one or more than one house in respect of which a grant is made by the Minister under sub-section (1) of this section a grant in money not exceeding the appropriate sum specified in the Sixth Schedule to this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  For the purpose of making a grant under sub-section (2) of this <Col N="814" /> section a housing authority shall have the like powers of borrowing money as if the houses in respect of which the grants are made were erected by them under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts or the Labourers Acts.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Minister may make regulations for the purposes of this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with the spirit of this, I would like a little matter cleared up for the benefit of public utility societies.  Would not the Minister think it advisable to put in a period of years, 21 years if he likes? Suppose that the finances of a public utility society went a little wrong, as they have done on one or two occasions, and they wanted to raise a mortgage on the houses in order to continue their activities.  I would ask the Minister to consider how this amendment will affect the finances of public utility societies if they want to enlarge on their operations or want to raise money through a bank with the house as a security.</P>
      <P>Then you have a subscriber living in a house for a number of years who wishes to pay off what is due.  Will the Minister consider allowing him to do this if he improves his position and wishes to have his house a little cheaper for his growing family?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to relax the terms of this section in any way.  If a public utility society wants to raise additional sums I suppose that they could get the bank to lend to them on the security of the houses even if the houses were let.  If a public utility society wants to build houses for sale they can do so and get a grant under another section but not under this section.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 8.&mdash;In page 4, line 22, Section 8 (1), after the words &ldquo;local body&rdquo; the words &ldquo;county council&rdquo; inserted.</P>
      <P>During the course of the discussion in the Seanad it was suggested that a number of other interests should be represented on the Central Library Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore we agreed to provide that the Central Library Council should act as a county council in respect of Section 58 of the Local Government Act of 1925, whereby county councils may appoint as many committees as they think fit.  They may delegate certain functions to them.  This amendment is inserted with the object of securing the friendly interest and the advice of the teaching profession in general&mdash; primary teachers, secondary teachers and vocational teachers.  It would be possible under this section for the Central Council to appoint a subcommittee to which it could delegate <Col N="820" /> some of its work.  That is the purpose of this amendment and of the amendment No. 3.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £19,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1948, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Forestry (No. 13 of 1946), including certain Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>Unforeseen expenditure has arisen from the considerable increase (approximately 20 per cent.) in the wages rates of forestry labourers which took effect on the 19th May, 1947, and further unforeseen expenditure on labour under the head of Cultural Operations in sub-head (C. 2) of the Vote is being incurred in the preparation of firewood logs for sale to Fuel Importers Ltd.  It is now anticipated that, while the other labour provisions in sub-head (C. 2) will prove adequate to meet anticipated expenditure for the full year, an additional sum of £49,000 will be required for labour under the head of cultural operations.</P>
      <P>Under the arrangements made for the supply of firewood timber to Messrs. Fuel Importers, the Department is also paying the cost of freight on the firewood to Messrs.  Fuel Importers depots, and this additional heavy expenditure is chargeable to the head, cultural operations&mdash;cartage and freight.  It is anticipated that an additional £12,000 will be required under this head to met the full expenditure for the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department is also supplying to Messrs.  Fuel Importers a quantity of <Col N="823" /> firewood blocks being prepared by portable cross-cut saws, and this work will involve the expenditure on the head&mdash;preparation of firewood etc. by portable cross-cut saws&mdash;of an additional £2,000 over the original Estimate provision for labour and an additional £3,000 over the original Estimate provision for cartage.</P>
    <P>It is not anticipated that there will be any savings on other heads in sub-head (C. 2) of the Vote available to defray these additional items of expenditure and a total additional provision of £66,000 is therefore required for sub-head (C. 2).  Savings on other sub-heads will however, it is estimated, amount to £3,500 and a gross additional Vote of £62,500 is therefore necessary.</P>
    <P>Additional appropriations-in-aid can, however, be made available under the heads of &ldquo;Large Sales of Timber&rdquo;, &ldquo;Small Sales of Timber and Thinnings&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Receipts from Portable Cross-cut Saws.&rdquo;  When the main Estimate for the year was prepared it was anticipated that there would be a reduction in the abnormally high receipts from sales of large lots of commercial timber and provision was made for receipts totalling £10,000.  It is now expected that the receipts for the full year will amount to about £23,000, so that £13,000 more can be taken into account as Appropriations-in-Aid in the Supplementary Vote.</P>
    <P>Receipts from small local sales will also probably realise about £8,000 more than the original Vote provision and there will fall to be credited to the same head a sum estimated at £18,000 in respect of the partial discharge by Fuel Importers within the financial year of their liability to the Department in respect of firewood logs supplied.  A similar payment by Fuel Importers in respect of firewood blocks is estimated at £4,500 and will fall to be credited as additional receipts from portable cross-cut saws.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made accordingly in the Supplementary Estimate for additional appropriations-in-aid totalling £43,500, so that the net supplementary sum required is only £19,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31 March, 1948, for a Grant towards the cost of providing athletic grounds in the vicinity of Dublin.</P>
      <P>This Estimate is only for a token Vote. It is directed towards securing from the Dáil an approval in principle for a scheme for the encouragement of athletics in this country by way of the provision of facilities for their development.  It is introduced now and in this fashion because of representations made by the various bodies controlling athletics in the country and because of certain proposals formulated by the Dublin Corporation in relation to the provision of facilities for athletics and athletic development. The ambit of the Vote is thus a rather narrow one and may, if the opinion of the Dáil favours such commitments, be extended to cover a much wider field.  The Government's primary interest in the development of athletics is its concern for the national health and physique.  In these days when so many of our young people find their livelihood in sedentary occupations, when manual work has been replaced in great measure by the machine, there is urgent need for the provision of an opportunity for indulgence in games and athletics and for encouragement thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Team games in this country are fairly well organised and because they have a greater public appeal than track or field sports are supported by a reasonable revenue.  This revenue enables the associations concerned to do a good deal in regard to the provision of playing fields but the lack of athletic grounds suitable for track and field athletics is the main barrier to the development of this type of athletics throughout the country.  Team games are a first-class form of athletics. All athletes are for various reasons not fitted to participate in team games and because of this fact a special effort should be made to provide <Col N="825" /> facilities for field and track athletics throughout the country.  So as to prevent physical injury it is necessary that indulgence in athletics should be directed and in some measure controlled.  Any physical injury resulting from athletic participation has been brought about by the unwise efforts of untrained men.  Properly directed athletic pursuits will have an entirely beneficial physical effect and by weaning young men from the growing tendency to make the dance hall and cinema the only recreational outlet will also have a desirable effect on the character and outlook of the coming generation.</P>
    <P>The Government is naturally concerned with a widespread participation in athletics rather than with the production of a few champions of international note, but these prodigies are a natural growth in the life of a nation in which athletics is part of the average man's recreation.  Their emergence and achievements give a country-wide fillip to athletics and tend to raise the standard and widen the area of participation.  The ideal to be aimed at is the provision wherever possible throughout the country of playing fields and other sporting centres; the promotion of athletic and recreational facilities and the establishment ultimately of a national stadium in which could be held periodic national or international games.</P>
    <P>For this purpose it would be desirable to establish a national athletic council composed of persons prominent in the athletic world, acting voluntarily or for small fees, with a paid executive staff and this council should have placed at its disposal certain financial resources an annual subvention to meet its administrative expenses; further financial advances from the Exchequer to a maximum limit from which to make advances to athletic bodies for the provision of fields, equipment, etc., and a capital sum wherewith to build a national athletic stadium, which it would control, and the revenue from which would go to meet its administrative costs.  The functions of the council shall be to:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  Inquire into the existing facilities for athletic and recreational activities in Eire.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="826" /> (ii)  Direct attention to the value of such activities.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Encourage the promotion of local schemes for the promotion of further and better facilities for athletic and recreational activities.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Appoint qualified persons as organisers or instructors of athletic and recreational activities.</P>
    <P>(v)  Determine after consultation with the Minister the number, remuneration, duties and conditions of appointment of executive staff, organisers and instructors.</P>
    <P>(vi)  Make grants towards the expenses of local voluntary organisations for providing facilities for athletic and recreational activities including the provision of playing fields and other sporting centres.</P>
    <P>(vii)  Determine after consultation with the Minister in each case of an application for a grant the amount of such grant and the ratio which such grant shall bear to the total cost of the scheme proposed to be carried out with the help of such grant.</P>
    <P>(viii)  Prepare a scheme for the provision in Dublin of a national stadium.</P>
    <P>The organisation shall make rules, approved by the Minister, governing the management of, letting for athletic and recreational purposes of, and charging for admission to, the playing field and/or sporting centre.  The organisation shall furnish to the Minister annually or before an appointed date particulars of its activities during the previous year.</P>
    <P>Because the only proposals so far before the Government are related to Dublin, the possible expenditure that may have to be undertaken this year relates to these proposals.  But if the idea of athletic development is to be of any value it must relate to the whole country.  Again, the total expenditure envisaged or likely to be needed should not, for obvious reasons, come from central funds.  Any district from which demands come for facilities should be prepared to undertake a proportion of the cost.  Otherwise impossible demands would be made on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I am very anxious to get the views <Col N="827" /> of Deputies on this proposal.  I am interested in it, but these are in a great measure my own views and I would like them to be sandpapered against the views of others.  I do think that this proposal is of value.  I think that any proposal that induces enthusiasm in young people is of value to the country.  I think such a proposal is bound to have very salutary effects on the physique of our young people, and I am not unmindful of the prestige which might accrue to the nation from the development of athletes of international note in this country.  Other countries have been put on the map of the world by their athletes.  At one particular time in the history of athletics we held a very high place among other nations.  Due to the fact that facilities have been put at the disposal of athletic bodies in other countries, we no longer hold that place. Yet I do believe that we have material at all times capable of meeting the first flight of competition anywhere if properly trained.</P>
    <P>Finally, I might say that I am not concerned with trying to develop the idea of producing a handful of athletes who would compete internationally.  I am concerned with the participation generally of the young people of this country in every form of athletics.  As I said, team games are well organised and have good support and are thereby enabled to carry on under their own steam.  There is not the same popular support for field and track events.  I wish again to emphasise that many prospective athletes in the country, because of certain defects of temperament and physique, are not capable of successfully playing team games.  Men of slightly defective eyesight are not successful at team games and it would be well that we should open a door whereby they would enter into the participation of another form of athletics; that we should do as much as possible, with voluntary help also, to try to develop this side of athletics in the country for the benefit of our people and for the benefit of the nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very surprised at the Minister introducing this <Col N="828" /> proposal in the fashion he has introduced it.  This proposal in connection with athletics comes to us here in the guise of a Vote.  We have got very meagre details from the Minister; we have got no financial details.  We have just heard that a council will be set up.  Until the Minister said that he personally was very interested in this and that it was his idea, I felt that I could say a whole lot of hard things about the scheme.  We all wish, however, to see athletics encouraged in this country.  We wish to see the young men and boys encouraged to make themselves stronger and healthier.</P>
      <P>But I think it is really too much to ask the House to judge a whole scheme like this with very little in the way of details, on the basis of a £10 token Vote.  I want to be quite fair to the Minister.  I think it is a good idea but I think he should have brought in a Bill or some comprehensive measure and not just introduce this matter as an Estimate in the middle of the financial year and at the end of a Parliamentary session.  It is quite a revolutionary idea and as such, I am not afraid of it, but I should like to know what it is going to cost and what it is going to mean.  I know the Minister does not want to make athletics a professional matter.  I think that is the last idea he has in mind, but the ultimate effect, whether this scheme tends to professionalise athletics or not, will depend on the details of the scheme.  Many a man brought in a scheme of this character to find later on that his dearest wish in connection with the scheme could not be carried out.  I can see that there are a great deal of dangers in connection with this question. One of them is that we are asked to hand the Minister a blank cheque.  I do not think it is fair for him to ask that.  I think we should be given many more details before we are asked to give our approval to something which is very new and the details of which we really have not before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a bit mystified at the Minister for Lands introducing a Supplementary Estimate to provide a sum of £10 for athletics.  I must confess that nothing the Minister said has furnished the House with an explanation <Col N="829" /> as to why he has introduced an Estimate of this kind.  Whilst he talked about a commission which would be charged with administrative functions, he never told us what Minister he had in mind or to what Minister the commission would be responsible.  I hope that if there is going to be any administration by a commission in respect to athletics that we will get some further information on to what Department the commission is going to be responsible because it seems to be a crazy kind of idea to imagine that it would be responsible to the Department of Lands, no matter who may be the Minister in charge of that Department.</P>
      <P>My view of this whole matter would be related very largely to the standing and the efficiency of the Department to which this commission on athletics would be responsible.  I should like the Minister to tell us to what Minister he was referring in his opening remarks on this Estimate.  One of our difficulties in discussing an Estimate of this kind to-day, is that we have got very little information about it.  We cannot measure what it involves nor can we ascertain to what extent this commission dealing with athletics is going to face up to the problem of endeavouring to develop athletics nationally in this country.  My regret is that this idea did not fertilise in the Minister's mind three or four years ago so that the matter could have received much more detailed consideration than apparently it has received and so that the scheme could be given a canter through the public Press and an informed opinion created as to the best lines on which athletics might be promoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister's statement is deficient in so far as it does not give us anything like a broad picture of what is contemplated nor does it give us any information even as to what kind of views are at present fertilising in the minds of the Government on this matter.  However, when it comes to a matter of promoting athletics in this country, I am prepared to take almost any scheme in preference to no scheme because the position to-day is that athletics in this country are starved for want of money, starved because athletes who run at home or engage in athletics at home or in our <Col N="830" /> name abroad, have no adequate training, have practically no financial resources behind them, leave their jobs perhaps on a Monday night, get the boat that night, and try to run in England the next day against competitors who have been trained and nursed so that they can enter these contests with a minimum of discomfort and fatigue.</P>
    <P>The way in which our athletes run abroad has always been a source of admiration to me because they run under handicaps which no other country imposes on its athletes.  They run solely supported by their natural physique and their desire to do credit to themselves and the country from which they come.  We ought to end that system.  Every other country devotes generous sums of money to the encouragement of athletics, not for the purpose of creating one or two or perhaps half-a-dozen international athletes but for the improvement of physique generally in the country.  Much as we may pride ourselves on Irish physique in the past, I think nobody will deny that there has been a steady deterioration of the physique of the Irish people.  If we are ever going to recapture that splendid physique which made many of our people international athletes we have got to set about the problem of encouraging athletes in every possible way by means of State help, State direction, State encouragement and national enthusiasm for the promotion of athletics.  In that way we can help to develop not merely a better physique amongst our people at home but we can probably help to dissuade many youths from engaging in activities which lead primarily to juvenile delinquency and ultimately lead them into ways of vice and crime. I think that anything that could be done to gear up the nation to a policy of encouraging the development of athletics has everything to commend it from the point of view of developing the physique of our people, from the point of view of arresting the all too rapidly developing tendency towards juvenile delinquency and the growing crime statistics in respect of young persons.</P>
    <P>As I say, other countries have long since learned the value to the physique of their citizens and the well-being of <Col N="831" /> their country of promoting athletics. Here in this country where our people have such natural physical talent and where the need for maintaining a high standard of physique is no less than in other countries, I think we could do something by the maximum reasonable encouragement of schemes for promoting athletics in the country.  The Minister says he does not want to create one or two or half a dozen athletes of international renown. Neither does anybody else nor does anybody want to see the development of professionalism in athletics.  Even if the development of athletics here produced athletes of international renown, I think that would be all to the good of the nation, first, because it would enhance our reputation abroad, secondly, because it would ensure that our citizens will not be in the humiliating position of always being vanquished on the international athletic field, and thirdly, because the achievements in the international field of some of our athletes of renown would encourage at home the emulation of the same training and physical perfection as brought success on the international field.</P>
    <P>If I were to ask any member of the House the name of the Prime Minister of Finland, I do not believe anybody could answer me.  If I put that question to the two Ministers over there&mdash; what is the name of the Prime Minister of Finland&mdash;I do not believe they would be able to tell me.  But, if I asked the Minister for Lands if he knew Nurmi and what he was renowned for, he would promptly say: &ldquo;That is the famous Finnish runner.&rdquo;  I believe that many of the athletes which Finland sent to the international athletic field were as good to Finland as any ambassadors or trade representatives.  We ought to remember that every time an Irish flag goes up on an international field it is a beneficial reflection on this country and on the physical prowess of the representatives of this country.</P>
    <P>There is nothing more heartbreaking in Britain or on the continent than to see Irish athletes generally, halftrained and under stress and strain, doing their best to send up the Irish flag in a contest.  They are handicapped <Col N="832" /> by the absence of these facilities which enable other countries to capture many trophies.</P>
    <P>I hope that the seed sown by this Vote will fertilise rapidly and that we soon will have here an athletic organisation which will help to promote and develop athletics in the widest possible way.  But this ought not to be purely a Government-made scheme for the promotion of athletics.  I do not want to see athletics administered by a Government Department, nor do I want to see Civil Service files created about runners or other athletes, or files sent to the Department of Finance to know whether a few pounds could be spent in training a runner to compete in a given place on a given day and the Department replying: &ldquo;Is the proposed subsistence allowance not too much? Does he need to stay in that hotel and would not a boarding-house do equally as well&rdquo;?  I want that type of mentality to be taken away from the development of athletics.</P>
    <P>I want the Government to consult people of authority and standing in this matter, people with wide experience of athletics.  I want to have things planned on lines calculated to yield satisfactory results.  We can easily start off on this scheme in a gallop, but I suggest that the speed at which we travel is not half so important as the direction in which we are going.  Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that if, after the coming election, this Government will have any responsibility for implementing the scheme&mdash;I am afraid it will not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Let us be generous in the cash allocations we make and then we may expect them to give us the best scheme possible for the promotion <Col N="833" /> of athletics.  We can in that way look forward to our athletes carrying our flag to victory in the international field.  All genuinely concerned with the development of the physique of our people will aim at the establishment of the best possible scheme which will yield improved national health and a better reputation for our athletes in other countries.</P>

      <P>In introducing this Estimate and, indeed, in the Estimate itself, the Minister has given very little information as to the lines upon which he intends this scheme to proceed.  He rather disarmed the House by intimating that he was seeking to ascertain the views of the Deputies rather than to put forward anything very definite himself.</P>
      <P>It is surprising to find this scheme being laid before the House by the Minister for Lands.  It is difficult to connect the Department of Lands and the Land Commission with athletics. One would imagine, from what we know of the Department of Lands, that some from of still life or slow motion would be more in keeping with their activities&mdash;or inactivities&mdash;than athletics.  Now, it may be the Minister's experience of still life in the Land Commission that has more or less inspired him to do something for the promotion of athletics.</P>

      <P>There is another thing that might have influenced him&mdash;and it is difficult to keep forthcoming events out of every discussion here. He may have been influenced by some of his preliminary election skirmishes and he may have realised how necessary it is for politicians to be robust and athletic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have one great misgiving about this proposal and it is that we may eventually develop a Department of Athletics or a Department of Amusement or something of that kind, and everybody who aspires to take part in any outdoor games may be regimented and catalogued into a certain classification from which there is no escape. There is the danger that bureaucracy may to a large extent take control of <Col N="834" /> athletics.  That is a danger which we must guard against from the outset. Whatever we do we must preserve the independence and the integrity of the individual athlete and the athletic organisation.  We must make it clear at the outset that whatever the State does it will be only by way of a small contribution towards the total funds required by the athletic organisation. If the State sets out to finance athletics completely, I am afraid it is inevitable that the State will take complete control over all branches of athletic activities, and that would be a tragedy beyond repair.</P>
    <P>It may be a grand thing to have highly-trained, well-financed athletes competing with other nations in other countries, but if in order to secure that, we have to kill all independence and initiative in the pursuit of athletic games, I think the price we would have to pay would be too high.</P>
    <P>I have one particular objection to this particular Estimate small as it is. In this, as in all other matters, we start at the City of Dublin, like the man who goes to build a house and starts with the chimney.  I believe that the root of athletics, as of everything else, is in the rural areas and among the youth of the rural areas.</P>
    <P>I remember when the ill-fated Public Health Bill was going through the Dáil, I put down an amendment to provide for playing fields attached to all national schools.  I think that it is essential that every primary school should have some sort of playing field convenient to the building.  Very many rural parishes, villages and towns may have such a playing field, but there are a large number where a playing field is not available and where it is very difficult to secure it.  So let the State assist and help local initiative to secure them.  That would be very desirable.  I agree with the Minister that it is better not to provide a few highly-efficient athletes, but to ensure that every boy&mdash;and I suppose every girl &mdash; but certainly every boy in the country would get the opportunity of taking part in some sort of athletic game.  So many people grow up, not only in the large towns but in the rural areas, who never had <Col N="835" /> the advantage of being a member of a team or of taking part in any kind of athletic competition.  There is a duty which should devolve on all publicspirited people to do everything possible to promote this effort.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate, I think, that there is always such a tendency towards fierce competition.  Competition is desirable, but it eliminates at an early age young people who, perhaps, might be potential athletes, but who, because of their sensitiveness or for some other reason, feel that they cannot compete and never get back on the athletic field again.  Somebody should undertake to encourage people who are inclined to lie back and not take part in athletics, and this is why I welcome the State assistance to provide playing fields, ball alleys and all the other amenities to promote athletics.</P>
    <P>I could not gather very clearly from the Minister's statement what type of organisation would be set up to administer the funds.  Evidently there must be some sort of organisation, as it would be absurd, of course, if the whole matter were left to the Minister for Lands, enthusiastic and zealous as he may be, or to the enthusiasm and zeal of his successor.  Some organisation must be established to administer the funds and one of the biggest tasks will be to keep cranks out of such an organisation.</P>
    <P>There is always a tendency of people who get control of matters of this kind to impose their own little ideas, whatever they are, on the rest of the community. Some cranks would feel that football should be played in a certain way or that some form of athletics should be carried out in a certain way. Those people will endeavour, if they are let do it, to dictate to the rest of the community.  We have had an unfortunate experience with the Abbey Theatre.  You had a very fine institution going very well until the State began to provide money for it; then the cranks began to come in and dictate the way the place should be run.  It will be the same in athletics and we should be wide awake at an early hour to see that the cranks are kept in their own place.  The organisation set up to <Col N="836" /> administer the funds should be very carefully thought out and very carefully planned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the suggestion of the Minister were in any way to direct the athletic mind of this country towards internationalism, forgetting our own national development and characteristics, I would take this proposal with very serious reservations.  But I am not at all surprised that this suggestion came from the Minister for Lands, because if we go back over the athletic records of this nation we will see that some of the finest athletes, some of the finest specimens of manhood&mdash;not taking from other parts of the country&mdash;came from the areas of North Cork, South Limerick and Tipperary. They have been very conspicuous on our national athletic fields at home and abroad, and brought much renown to this nation.  From that point of view, I am not surprised that the Minister has in mind, perhaps, the development of that splendid characteristic of our nation.</P>
      <P>Also, by reason of the fact that the Land Commission, when they were dividing big estates, provided parish playing fields in some parts of the country, it is only natural that the development of tracks and playing fields should come within the Minister's sphere.</P>
      <P>What I am anxious about, however, is any centralised development of athletic sport under a centralised authority.  If that tended to direct into certain international channels the wonderful enthusiasm and splendid developments of athletics in this country, I would be inclined to look upon it with disfavour.  Still, there is a great lot in what the Minister has said. What he wants to get, to my mind, is some ideas from the members of the Dáil, so that the scheme, which is in the embryo stage, running through his mind at the moment, may be developed into something to our national advantage in the field of sport, particularly athletics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the mention of Dublin, other towns and urban areas ought to come to mind.  How did the Minister omit handball courts which, to my mind, should be in every parish, particularly in the city, so that the youngsters who <Col N="837" /> idle in street corners might find easy access to playing grounds where they might take part in games governed by rules, rather than lazily to stand at street corners or devote themselves to dances, cinemas and other indoor entertainments.</P>

      <P>Has the Deputy read the Estimate?  It does not deal with general or local activities. It has to do with the cost of providing athletic grounds in the vicinity of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am entitled to make some observations and criticisms by reason of the fact that it applies to Dublin only.  For years past I have been trying to get a handball court provided by the Cork Corporation. The Handball Association have also made requests to the corporation but have not succeeded.  When you want to devote funds to that purpose you find you are held up because there is no anxiety in that respect by those who control the public purse.  When local enthusiasm is directed into the proper channels&mdash;when it can go to Dublin and such places, as it has in the past in other fields of sport&mdash;then there may be something in the idea that would call for our enthusiasm and support. At the present time I accept the general principle but I feel that the whole idea should be examined.  Where exactly will it ultimately lead us?  We all know that an effort was made in this country by those who were not nationally minded to control athletics. They tried to develop track events and to avoid field events.  The Irish excel at field events.  Fitness is required to bring out the best in the man.  For track events cinder tracks are required which would give our athletes a basis of training which would enable them to compete in a fair way with the athletes of other countries when international competitions arise.  It is regrettable that by reason of the growth of the crowds attending Croke Park the cinder track which used to be there had to be removed.  That also applies to most of the Gaelic pitches throughout the country at the present time.  As some speakers have pointed out, athletics in the past have been the natural growth <Col N="838" /> of the physique and enthusism of the Irish race in some particular line of athletics.</P>
      <P>If we provide this stadium now instead of developing from the school playgrounds, the parish athletic clubs, and the local organisations then we are starting at the wrong end.  I would prefer, and of course the Minister's idea might work out in that direction, that some support should be given to local effort.  Suppose a Gaelic club in the country has a field from the Land Commission which needs to be banked up.  Suppose that field happens to be near a town in which there are unemployed men.  I consider that instead of paying the dole to these men that they should be employed to bank that field with say, builders' rubble, that is being thrown into dumps.  You will be told that it is a private concern, owned by the Gaelic Athletic Association or some such other club, and we cannot contribute towards men working on these fields.  Until we support local effort by the proper provision of fields and tracks we will not get very far.  The whole idea is based on local enthusiasm.  I think we have an excellent arena in the Phoenix Park and that any man interested in athletics who can take a bus to it has a wide field of operation for himself.  In consequence I would like to examine the whole matter from the very basis to see how ultimately it will develop.  Until that is done I am asking the Minister for an assurance that those who are connected in that sphere of athletics in this country will be looked after.  I know that anything the Minister brings forward is in the best national interests and also that he has in mind the bringing of the youth of the country into these open-air field activities which will be for their ultimate good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with those who say that the physique of our athletes has deteriorated.  Everything goes to prove the contrary.  In recent years our athletes upheld our name in the field of sport.  They may not be making so many records now because, since the war, life is getting harder in nearly every way day by day.  People are more inclined now to be spectators at racing and so forth rather than to indulge in activities themselves.  If <Col N="839" /> there is proper direction and development I think that the nation generally will benefit.  It is a good sign that somebody is thinking as the Minister is thinking and that there are people interested in field sports of various kinds who are helping to develop the physique of our youth by providing sports fields and so forth particularly in the rural areas.  For that we ought to be grateful to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the proposals outlined by the Minister which are a step in the right direction.  I hope they will lead to bigger things in the days to come.  As one who believes and who has often said that this country has done less than any other country in Europe for its athletes or for those using playgrounds and playing fields, I welcome the Bill.  One speaker referred to the fact that he hoped the Minister would put this into the hands of the right people.  Another speaker&mdash;I do not think he meant to criticise unduly &mdash;said that people took sides in athletics.  I hope the Minister will bring all parties together, even though they may have different views on track events or football.  I agree with the speaker who said that when our flag is raised topmost in any country in the world we at home do not care very much what form of sport is concerned; we are all inclined to cry &ldquo;Up Ireland&rdquo;.  It is very satisfying when listening-in to a football match, or any sport event to hear the cheers when Ireland scores.  Recently there was a big event in England and to those of us who listened in it almost seemed as if it were taking place in the Phoenix Park, so numerous were the cries of &ldquo;Up Ireland&rdquo;.  It is a peculiarity of other nations to judge the population of a country by their athletes.  When our athletes do well they do credit to our country.  When they go across the water or to the Continent they act almost as commercial travellers.  They are judged and judgment of our trade follows almost automatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that any money spent on athletics is money well spent.  Athletics brings out the best in young men and girls.  They must be given proper facilities <Col N="840" /> for training and proper facilities to play any game in which they wish to indulge.  I hope the Government will remember that this is public money and does not belong to any one section of the community.  It must be used to give encouragement to those who want to indulge in athletics whether it be baseball, football or soccer.  I welcome the proposal.  I think it is somewhat late, but better late than never.  I wish the Minister every success in his efforts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.M. Dockrell Mr. H.M. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a rather extraordinary Estimate because £10 will go no distance towards providing even one athletic ground.  The Minister let his fancy range.  He mentioned a stadium.  He spoke about athletics down the country but the Estimate specifically provides for athletics in the vicinity of Dublin.  There is no cinder track in Dublin on which an athlete can train.  I understand that if an athlete is going to run on cinders he must train on cinders; if he is going to run on grass he must train on grass. The Minister wants to provide something which is not available to either the cinder track or field athlete in Dublin who wants to train.</P>
      <P>I think a committee is not the proper way in which to set this in operation. Obviously, when he speaks of a cinder track in the vicinity of Dublin, the Minister must have one in his mind.  I would like him to look at the end of the road.  Practically all the athletic grounds in the vicinity of Dublin are totally inadequate at the present time. Most games depend largely on the gates they draw.  There are a number of sports in which contests cannot be staged because there is not sufficient accommodation for the general public to make the meeting a paying one.  I have not got professionalism in mind at all, but there is no body of amateurs who can hold a sports meeting and continually lose money thereon.  Practically all the clubs around Dublin have to find some subsidiary method of raising money when they want to send their representatives abroad.  Even if these representatives are not very good performers the experience gained by them is valuable.  They bring back a certain amount of expert knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this gesture but I do not <Col N="841" /> think it goes far enough.  The Minister mentioned a cinder track specifically. That would have to be laid down.  The hedge around it may have to be cut, or a wall may have to be built.  There would have to be a pavilion.  There would have to be accommodation for spectators.  There would have to be a groundsman to keep the ground in order.  That could never be done on £10.  If the Minister has something further in his mind will he tell us what it is?  Is this gesture capable of elaboration and will more money be spent from time to time?  It is no use the Minister embarking on the buying of a field in the vicinity of Dublin to discover that it is totally inadequate for its requirements.  I think the Minister must tell us what he has in mind.</P>
    <P>Has he in mind a field that would hold a crowd such as attends at Lansdowne Road or Croke Park?  I remember being at Olympic Games in Holland.  The ground there had been reclaimed.  They had built a tremendous stadium for track athletics and alongside of that had built a swimming pool.  That ground covered hundreds of acres.  Is the Minister going to provide even one decent arena for games?  The Minister should consider whether his ideas are big enough or, at any rate, are capable of being ultimately expanded so as to provide something like a national stadium for the various track athletics.  Apart from the Phoenix Park and a privatelyowned ground, I do not think there is any place where such an athletic meeting could be held.  When I was young I remember that cycling races were held at the Ballsbridge grounds.  As the Horse Show developed, however, it elbowed out athletics, just as the Croke Park cinder track runners were elbowed out by the need for accommodating a bigger crowd.  It looks as if the Minister will have to provide a place that ultimately could be used for international contests and which would accommodate an enormous crowd of spectators.  That does not mean that the ordinary athlete could not train on it every day.  Anything other than that as the ultimate goal would, in my opinion, be useless and would only prevent others from coming along and providing it.</P>

      <P>Another £100,000 does not matter the way we are going. I welcome the introduction of this Vote which I think is very essential.  The Minister for Lands is the proper person to undertake the acquisition of land for a suitable athletic arena.  As there is a section in one of the Land Acts under which he can acquire land for that purpose, the Minister for Lands is the proper person to do it. Of course, I would rather see him acquiring land down the country for other purposes, but perhaps when he gets this done he can speed up the other matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give us some information as to the composition of the committee of management because, of course, he is going to hand this over to a committee of management to run.  I should like to know whether the Gaelic Athletic Association, the Rugby Union, or what particular body of citizens will have control or will be the dominating force in the running of this particular arena. The Minister for Defence, who is, of course, a soccer player, may like one thing; the Taoiseach, as a rugby player, may want something else, and Deputy Seán McCarthy may want it for the Gaelic Athletic Association.  I do not want to see the Government split into factions over this particular Vote.  I should like to see them going down in harmony, anyway.  I should not like to see them going too far apart.  The Minister should give us some idea as to how he proposes to constitute the committee of management.  He must realise the difficulties.  The Gaelic Athletic Association, I expect, owing to their rules, cannot work in with the other two bodies, unless you get them to commit an act of national apostasy so far as they are concerned.  The <Col N="843" /> Minister should give us some indication as to who will form the committee of management.  I presume that the Department of Lands are not going to do this thing themselves, but are going to hand it over to somebody.</P>
    <P>The Olympic Games are to be held here in the course of a year or two. Is it the intention of the Minister to have this ground ready for training for these games?  If so, he will want to get busy.  I think it is a pity that the Vote was left over until now when the life of this Parliament is coming to an end.  I do not know where the Minister is going to acquire the land. As it is proposed to be for the City of Dublin, he will not want to go too far from the city.  I think he will have extreme difficulty in finding land suitable for the purpose.  I am sorry I was not here when the Minister introduced the Vote, but I presume he gave some indication of that.  So far as I am concerned and so far as this Party is concerned, the Vote has our approval.  When the detailed Estimate is brought in, however, we will want much more information than has been given.  We will require considerably more details than have been given. The putting down of a cinder track is a very slow and costly matter.  If it is to be ready for training for the Olympic Games, the matter will have to be speeded up considerably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather pleased with the general reception of the proposal in regard to the development of athletics.  Perhaps if I had been an older and more effective Parliamentary hand I would have introduced it in a more acceptable fashion but this is a token Vote and if it is accepted it does give me authority, at least, to discuss general proposals with interested parties and experts on the question of athletic development.  I think that it would be politically fatal for all of us to suggest that any proposal of this sort should be confined to Dublin.  I think the country is entitled to consideration, even much more than Dublin in matters of this sort.  But the Estimate relates, as I pointed out, to immediate proposals which are engaging the consideration of the Dublin Corporation, <Col N="844" /> and in order to co-operate with the corporation in its proposals, to try to be as helpful as possible, and with the desire that we generally have to get ahead somewhere with athletics, the Vote is being proposed.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it would be at a later stage better to do what Deputy Dockrell suggested and bring in proposals in the form of a Bill, so that there would be general definite information regarding the ideas as they have been developed, but you might call this a trial balloon. It is unprecedented in many ways.  A Bill brought into the House is generally brought in because there have been discussions on the matter outside, because public opinion has in one way or another expressed itself.  There has been no public opinion expressed in this matter and no discussion other than some tentative discussions which I have had with the various organisations controlling field and track activities.  I am not going to get into any difficulties with the Rugby Football Union, the Football Association of Ireland, or the Gaelic Athletic Association.  All these deal with team games and I think handball would be outside the ambit of our proposals here.  The provision of handball courts locally could be developed from the various grants provided for such a purpose, but no attempt has ever been made to deal with field and track athletics.  I think that it is time that we should do something about it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton spoke about Government control and Deputy Cogan referred to regimentation.  If the development of athletics is not in great measure an outcrop of enthusiasm and voluntary effort, it is of very little use. Government control should be exercised only in so far as Appropriations-in-Aid of the athletic proposals are made.  Regimentation of any kind would, I think, completely curb any development of athletics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the formation of a committee, it would naturally be nonpolitical. We must try to get people who are most informed in this matter, who have given thought and study to it and, generally, you find them amongst old athletes and old promoters of athletics.  I have discussed this <Col N="845" /> matter, not with one organisation but with all the organisations dealing with field and track athletics here, and they are very anxious that the Government should push forward with the proposal.</P>
    <P>The provision of a cinder track in Dublin is mentioned in the Vote. Deputy McCarthy is completely wrong if he thinks you can develop athletics because you have the Phoenix Park at your disposal.  The better a performance on an athletic track is, the more enthusiasm you get among the general body of athletes and you cannot have any kind of decent performance on any ordinary fields.  It is impossible to run in the Phoenix Park except in crosscountry competitions.  For the ordinary sprinter or middle-distance man, if he is to develop as a speed merchant, you must provide a proper cinder track. There is no proper cinder track in this country.  In announcements about various sports meetings, people say that they are going to have cinder tracks, but there was not one even in Croke Park because the track there was not a proper cinder track according to normal standards.  The provision of a cinder track, as Deputy Dockrell pointed out, means the provision of an enclosure, the appointment of groundsmen and the observance of proper care that the track is kept in order and properly used.  It is because we can, in association with the Dublin Corporation, get such a proposal put over in Dublin, that the Estimate comes before the House in the form in which it does.</P>
    <P>I think I may take it that the House is generally in agreement with the point of view underlying this Estimate.  I put it forward at this particular time because it does give an opportunity to members of the Dáil to consider it properly without definite commitments. If, after Deputies have considered it, and have informed themselves on the matter, the need for it arises, we can bring in a Bill giving the fullest information and drafted according to the lines which, we think, best serve the purpose.</P>
    <P>It is essential to have cinder tracks and it is essential to have coaching. <Col N="846" /> Cinder tracks and coaching are going to bring the standard of performance away beyond what it is at present and put it on the international standard, but it will not be possible to put such tracks everywhere.  It will be possible to give athletes everywhere the benefit of coaching but it should not be our aim to provide the entire amount that is needed to provide a cinder track or any sort of equipment of that sort in any particular area without a definite local contribution.</P>
    <P>If the Dáil accepts this, I shall have an opportunity of discussing it with people who are expert in regard to athletic promotion.  Having done that, at a later stage I, or whoever is in my place, will have an opportunity of putting before the House a fully informed proposal for discussion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton suggested it was not the business of the Minister for Lands to bring such a proposal before the House.  It possibly would fit in better with the Minister for Health, the Minister for Education, or even the Minister for Defence, but because I am particularly interested and associated with athletics, I have been entrusted for the moment to deal with it.  At a later stage, when we bring in a Bill, it might be wise if another Department, better suited to the development of athletics, would be put in control.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £146,500 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1948, for Pensions, Superannuation, Compensation (including Workmen's Compensation), and Additional and other Allowances and Gratuities under the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1947, and sundry other Statutes: Extra-Statutory Pensions, Allowances and <Col N="847" /> Gratuities awarded by the Minister for Finance; fees to Medical Referees and occasional fees to Doctors; etc.</P>
    <P>The need for the increased provision of £146,500 on this Vote arises mainly because of the adjustment of certain Civil Service pensions and lump sums authorised by the Superannuation Act, 1947, and of certain Garda pensions and gratuities which will fall to be made when the Garda Síochána (Pensions) Bill, 1947, becomes law.  The additional amount shown under sub-head K (Garda Síochána) includes also provision to meet the extra charges resulting from increase in amount of new Garda pensions consequent on the improvement of the Garda salary scales.</P>

That followed on previous legislation dealing <Col N="848" /> with Civil Service salaries, and this proposal regarding pensions obviously follows.  Since the salaries have been increased and the standstill Order adjustment made, it is obviously necessary, and there is no avoiding the situation, that the pensions must be adjusted accordingly.  Whatever may happen in regard to other questions of superannuation is a matter for the future, but this is something that will have to be dealt with now because it might happen that in this and in some of the other Supplementary Votes there would not be sufficient moneys available until the time this matter was taken up again, perhaps by the new Dáil.

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £12,600 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1948, for Rates and Contributions in lieu of Rates, etc., in respect of Government Property, and for Contributions towards Rates on Premises occupied by Representatives of External Governments.</P>
      <P>The additional provision of £12,600 is required because the rates in a number of rating areas proved to be higher than was anticipated when the original Estimate was being prepared.  The original provision for this service was £178,300 and the revised provision is £190,900.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister has made that point clear, that it is necessary for the Government to bring in an increased demand because of the increased rates that are being struck by the rating authorities.  When they consider the amount of the increase upon Government lands, the Government can see the amount that arises in the case of the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it this is the sum required for one year.  Imagine an increase of <Col N="849" /> £12,600 for rates alone! It is a striking piece of evidence in support of the contention that the rates are going out of all proportion to the capacity of the people to bear them.  The people are now called upon to bear this huge amount.  A number of these places are occupied by people who derive some benefit from them, and I think in those cases there should be some steps taken so that a proportion of the rates would be borne by the occupants.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister give some information as to the nature of the increases?  Are the increases due solely to the increases in the rates or are they due to additional buildings?

      <P>The Estimates are prepared in November in Government Departments and I think that they are not taken by local authorities until towards the end of the financial year. In any case the position is that 5 per cent. was taken since the Department concerned was not in a position to secure information to enable them to make a closer estimate.  The 5 per cent. was to allow for increases but the margin budgeted was insufficient.  For example, in Dublin County Borough <Col N="850" /> and Kildare where the bulk of Government property is located, there is an increase of 8 per cent. and 10 per cent. respectively.  The increase in Dublin City is £9,600, or more than three quarters.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a Supplementary* sum not exceeding £117,600 be granted to defray the Charges which will come in the course of payment during the year ending 31st day of March, 1948, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Stationery Office; for Stationery, Printing, Paper, Binding and Printed Books for the Public Service; and for sundry Miscellaneous Services, including Reports of Oireachtas Debates.</P>
      <P>The gross supplementary sum now required is £118,600 but this amount is reduced by £1,000 due to an anticipated increase on the original Estimate of receipts as Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>During the current year the Stationery Office must meet the expense of producing a further general issue of ration books as well as the issue of fuel ration books and forms for the compilation of the Register of Population, 1947, by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  In addition, long-standing requirements which have remained unfilled at administrative inconvenience require the purchase of many items of office equipment which were not procurable since the commencement of the period of the emergency but are now again available.</P>
      <P>At the same time the rates of charges to the Stationery Office for the goods and services provided for the public service very considerably exceed anticipations. Provision made for increases in the prices paid for printing to correspond with increases in wages in the printing industry is inadequate and the exceptional rise in prices for most classes of goods in the past year has upset all previous calculations.  The financial consequences of these increases in the rates of charges are all the greater because of the expansion in the volume of printing required.</P>
      <P>*A sum of £203,780 has already been granted by means of the Appropriation Act, 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="851" /> This expansion in the volume of printing has necessitated increased purchases of papers, which have advanced considerably in price since the original grant was sought.</P>
    <P>The prices of books, publications and maps have also increased and Departmental requirements entail wider purchases than was foreseen.</P>
    <P>A. Salaries, Wages and Allowances (original, £43,183; supplementary, £600) &mdash;The extra provision is required to meet expenditure on overtime in (1) distribution to Garda stations of the forms for the Register of Population, 1947, (2) the checking of ration books and (3) the checking of the claims for the retrospective increases in charges for printing mentioned in connection with other subheads.</P>
    <P>F (1) Printing, Paper and Binding for the Houses of the Oireachtas (original, £9,500; supplementary, £1,500)&mdash;Additional provision required to meet (1) balances of retrospective increases in charges for printing because of corresponding increases in wages in the printing trade and (2) increased charges, under a new contract, for current work.</P>
    <P>F (2) Oireachtas Debates (original £9,800; supplementary, £1,200)&mdash;The additional provision is necessary to meet retrospective increases in charges for printing corresponding with increases in wages in the printing trade, and the outlay on increased current work.</P>
    <P>F (4) Printing, etc., for Registration Officers under Electoral and Juries Acts (original, £30,000; supplementary, £2,000)&mdash;The provision made for increases in charges because of increases in wages is inadequate and additional provision is accordingly necessary.</P>
    <P>G Grants to Periodicals Published in Irish and Newspapers Publishing Current News in Irish (original, £3,000; <Col N="852" /> supplementary, £250)&mdash;Because of increases in the charges which promoters pay for printing it has been necessary to increase the grants in respect of certain periodicals and provision is also required to meet an increased grant in respect of one periodical (<i>Tír-na-nOg,</i> published in conjunction with <i>Our Boys</i> by the Irish Christian Brothers) which has been increased to an eight-page edition (monthly).</P>
    <P>H Printing (original, £45,000, supplementary, £47,000)&mdash;The extra provision is necessitated by (1) the costs of producing general ration books, fuel ration books and the forms for the compilation of the Census of Population, 1947, and (2) an excess over anticipations in the volume of current routine work, the rates of charges under new contracts and the amounts of retrospective increases in printing charges corresponding with increases in wages in the printing industry.</P>
    <P>I Paper (original, £75,000; supplementary, £53,500)&mdash;Prices of paper have risen very considerably during the current year and at the same time requirements have increased because of the extra printing mentioned in the note in connection with sub-head H.</P>
    <P>J Miscellaneous Office Supplies (original, £17,500; supplementary, £9,250)&mdash;The prices of office equipment have risen, generally, and many articles not available during the period of the emergency can now be procured to meet long-standing requirements which have remained unfilled at administrative inconvenience.</P>
    <P>K Binding (original, £11,000; supplementary, £2,300)&mdash;The additional provision sought to defray retrospective increases in charges corresponding with increases in wages in the industry.</P>
    <P>L Books and Maps (original, £5,000; supplementary, £1,000)&mdash;The prices of books and publications have advanced and Departmental requirements have increased.</P>
    <P>M Appropriations-in-Aid (original, £52,528; supplementary, £1,000)&mdash;It is now anticipated that the receipts from advertisements in Official Publications will exceed the sum originally estimated.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder, Sir, on the question of these ration books would I be in order in suggesting the insertion of another page in the ration book?  I would suggest that as the ration book is a sort of identity card in the country, the Minister could have an extra page inserted in the new ration book that would be collected in the general election and in local elections, so that any person who went to vote would produce his ration book and instead of only giving his number to the presiding officer, the presiding officer would mark in the book that he had voted on that particular day.  It would prevent impersonation and be of very great value to presiding officers at general and local elections.  In Switzerland the <i>Carte d'Identité</i> carries such a page so that instead of having a long register of voters' list the citizen produces his <i>Carte d'Identité</i> and it is stamped for him. It would only mean one other page and I think it would be of very great value.</P>
      <P>I presume that these increases for paper are out of our control completely, as we have to purchase it abroad.  There should be extreme care in the use of paper, and if you look at the desk here you will see that a good deal of paper could be saved. I know it is very hard, but in a time of scarcity every care should be taken in its use.</P>
      <P>I am afraid from the indications that are abroad that the estimates for printing will not be sufficient, because it appears that we will be faced with an increased burden if certain wage demands are met.  I suppose, however, like the rates, we have to give this to the Government.</P>
      <P>I presume that the cards for notifying the electors where they are to vote are included in this.  I wonder are they issued from the Stationery Office?  I do not know that they are really necessary. I think that if the ration book page was given to every person for marking by the presiding officer it would do away with that particular card.  You can take it that the candidates will make sure that every one gets the information where he is to vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be forgotten that the preparation of the White Paper on income and such statistical matters occupies a great deal of time.  It is difficult, with the present stress with regard to income, to get even the annual reports of the Department published. I have not been able to see printed the last report of my own Department, for example, although I think it is a good deal overdue.  The Minister for Health, not so long ago, referred in this House to the difficulty of getting new Old Age Pension books although that was a matter of great <Col N="855" /> urgency.  No promise can be given, therefore, as to when the Oireachtas debates are likely to be available.  I think a certain number of volumes for the emergency and post-emergency period have been circulated.  It would be quite impossible to say when the remainder will be available.  I would like to explain that the position which faced the Stationery Office during the emergency was that it was absolutely impossible to get paper from any source.  The extraordinary thing is that we were able to carry on at all having regard to the fact that ration books were issued and that a census had to be carried out on more than one occasion.  It was extraordinary that we were able to carry these very urgent public matters through fairly satisfactorily.  I am told that the cards for electors will be made available in this general election as in the past.  I do not know whether Deputy MacEoin's idea about the ration books is feasible.  Deputy Donnellan has pointed out a difficulty in relation to it, namely, that unless the presiding officer is going to hold on to the ration book until all is over on the general election day the scheme cannot be carried out.  We can hardly have that done in time for the coming struggle.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) deleted and the following sub-section substituted:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  (a)  If the Attorney-General certifies in writing that, in his opinion, a particular person or body is an authority of the class mentioned in sub-paragraph (v) of paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of this section, such person or body shall be deemed, for the purposes of the said sub-section (1), to be an authority of that class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  If the Attorney-General certifies in writing that, in his opinion, statutory instruments of a particular class (defined in such manner and by reference to such things as the Attorney-General thinks proper) are of the character <Col N="857" /> described in sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph (c) of sub-section (1) of this section, such statutory instruments shall be deemed, for the purposes of the said sub-section (1), to be statutory instruments of that character.</P>
    <P>During the passage of this Bill through the House there was some criticism about sub-section (2) of Section 2 on the ground that it might be held to be unconstitutional although Deputy MacBride was not able to say definitely that it was.  I have not been able to confirm that it was but nevertheless I am bringing in this amendment. Under the amendment the Attorney-General may certify that a particular person or body empowered to make a statutory instrument is an authority of the class mentioned in sub-paragraph (v) of Section 2 (1) (b) or that statutory instruments of a particular class are of the character described in sub-paragraph (ii) of Section 2 (1) (c).  These new provisions, apart from the fact that they may be regarded as unobjectionable on any constitutional grounds, have the positive advantage that they will enable the Attorney-General to take action without having to wait for a question to be raised.  For example, if a particular body or person considers itself not bound by the provisions of the Act or tries to evade the Act, the Attorney-General, if he considers it desirable and proper to do so, may give his certificate, and the person or body concerned must thereafter comply with the obligatory provision of the Act in regard to the printing, publishing, and so forth of its statutory instruments.  I think that is an improvement on the section as it was.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3, SUB-SECTION (3).</P>
      <P>2. In page 4, Section 3 (3), to delete paragraph (b), lines 6-9, and substitute the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>

    <P>(b) the prosecutor does not prove that, at the date of the alleged <Col N="861" /> contravention, notice of the making of the said statutory instrument had been published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>,</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to transfer to the prosecutor the onus of proof on the question whether notice of the making of a statutory instrument, to which the Act primarily applies, had been published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  We had a long debate in the Seanad on this matter and I resisted for a long time.

It was merely giving him an extra line of defence if he wished to take it.  The Seanad, however, insisted that it was putting the onus on him so I agreed in the end that the onus would be put on the prosecution as well as the other provisions.  We must take all reasonable steps to bring to the notice of the people concerned that the Order has been made.</P>

I know that it is customary to have a fairly wide discussion on an Appropriation Bill&mdash;that is, on the normal Appropriation Bill which gives statutory authority to all Votes just before the Summer recess.  This Bill is quite different in character because it merely gives statutory effect to certain Supplementary Estimates passed in recent months and which are set out in the Bill.  Departments of State do not enter into this, there being no money for them.  I am in the position that I do not know where the discussion will end.

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with fairly substantial sums, including the sums provided for in the recent Supplementary Budget, and the subsidies voted out of the sums to be raised by that Budget.  It also gives the Minister for Finance power to borrow the whole of the £6,000,000 required for the subsidies.  At this stage I would expect the Minister for Finance to give us a summary of the financial situation as it is at present and to tell what steps he intends to take to raise the £6,000,000 other than those mentioned here.  In my opinion, the Central Bank should be utilised for the establishment of the credit that we require instead of the method outlined in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also expect the Minister at this stage to say whether he is going to follow the British system of reduced rates of interest on the money borrowed or give us some indication as to the probable cost.  When introducing the Supplementary Budget, he did tell us that he did not intend to borrow; that he intended to raise all the money by direct taxation and by the imposts that he has put upon the poor man's tobacco and pint and on whiskey, motor cars, etc.  Of course, I understand that this gives him authority to borrow the money, but I think the House is entitled to get some indication as to the sum he is likely to borrow.  The Minister for Education is deputising for the Minister for Finance, <Col N="866" /> and I think he should give us much more information than he has given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have got very little information on the whole matter. As I stated on the Estimate for rates on Government property, this Bill provides for an additional £12,600 for that purpose.  Last night the Minister for Local Government said that I was wrong when I stated that the rates next year would be increased all over the country by an average of from 4/- to 6/- in the £.  I am perfectly satisfied that my information is well-founded; that next year the rates will be increased and that there will have to be a greater increase than this in the next Appropriation Bill.</P>
      <P>I suggested to-day that Standing Orders could be suspended, as we have suspended them to-night to meet the Minister for Justice, to enable the Government to bring in a one-section Bill eliminating that section from the Military Service Pensions Act.  I regret to say that the Government did not see fit to do so but, on the other hand, twitted me with the charge that I was making a crossroads election speech.  At no time in my career have I ever made the rights of my comrades the subject of a crossroads debate.  I think that those who were associated with me in recent years on the Military Services Pensions Committee attached to the Longford Brigade will testify that at no stage did I attempt to make any use of it whatever for political purposes.  I should be long sorry that anybody else should do it, and I should certainly be the last to do it myself but the Minister for Local Government saw fit to make that assertion.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not, but when a new Government comes in, it might for a considerable period forget these people who are in want now.  In this particular case, the person concerned has a disability pension of 10/6.  That is practically his sole means of support.  He is unable to work.  I assert here that he is entitled to a military service certificate and a military service pension.  I assert that the fact that he was captured prior to the 1st April, 1921, that he was imprisoned during three months of the qualifying period, in itself, without his scars or wounds, was sufficient to qualify him. That being so, the present position is that that person is left until a new Government or a new Parliament is assembled.  There are combinations in this House who if they formed a Government might not be very favourably disposed towards such a person. I, therefore, would rather that the thing were done now.  I think the maxim that you should never put off until to-morrow what can be done to-day is a good one and I think we should even sit to-morrow if necessary to enable the Government to pass that one section.  I agree that this Appropriation Bill must pass.  I am not going to detain the House on the matter, but I trust that this will be the last of these Bills this House will have to meet, that budgeting for the year will be done at the proper time and that there will be no necessity to have an Autumn Budget again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to avail of this opportunity, with your permission, Sir, to raise the subject-matter of question No. 5 yesterday relating to the continued incarceration in a British jail of certain Irish prisoners.  I want to approach this matter, not in any desire to be captiously critical, not in any desire to indulge in recriminations but, instead, to base my case on the plea that the Government should take action in this matter on humanitarian grounds.  I am not concerned in the slightest with the politics of those who are at present serving sentences in British jails.  I am not concerned to express any appreciation, either of <Col N="868" /> whatever politics they have or the methods adopted by them to achieve whatever aims they have.  That does not arise at this stage, except perhaps that it might be desirable for me to say, in order to prevent possible misunderstanding, that I do not agree, and never have agreed, with the methods which they employed to achieve whatever aims they wished to achieve. But the fundamental fact remains that these political prisoners&mdash;because, in fact, that is what they are&mdash;have now served approximately eight years in British jails in respect of the charges which were brought against them. One might well think that in the year 1947, having regard to the period through which we have passed since 1939, that the world would have become sufficiently enlightened, sufficiently broad in its understanding and sufficiently humanitarian in its outlook, to recognise that men who have served a sentence of eight years in British jails have, at all events, expiated whatever crimes may have been charged against those who are the subject of this discussion to-night.</P>
      <P>Many of these men, of course, whilst they were charged with certain offences, took no steps whatever to defend themselves.  They simply declined to plead or to bring forward any evidence in their own defence.  Out of a sense of loyalty to others they were prepared to put up with whatever sentences were imposed by the British courts of the period.  I think it is established beyond all doubt that if some of them, at least, had endeavoured to defend themselves, it would have been impossible at that period for any judge or jury in Britain to have been satisfied of the guilt of some of these men.  I think nobody will attempt to deny that the sentences imposed upon them, sentences ranging in many cases up to 20 years, were very harsh sentences indeed.  I think nobody will attempt to deny now that if men were charged with similar offences to-day, the sentences would not be nearly so severe as those imposed in 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can understand, even if one does not agree with what happened, that the sentences reflected the tension and the strain in Great Britain at that period. <Col N="869" /> I think there is very little doubt that in ordinary times the sentences would be much less severe.  The whole atmosphere, without question, added considerably to the severity of the sentences which were then imposed, but we to-day can look on this thing, not in the heat and the passion, the tension and the strain of 1939, but in the calmness of a post-war period. Times have changed considerably since 1939, not only in Great Britain but throughout the world.  Britain is now at peace and whatever dangers threatened her in 1939 have passed away.</P>
    <P>Even Britain herself, having sailed into the calm waters of peace, has released from imprisonment many of her own citizens who were guilty of sabotage, and even those British citizens who were guilty of treason were treated with less severity than the Irish prisoners who are now serving sentences at Parkhurst Prison in Britain.  Britain has, since the conclusion of hostilities, released hundreds of thousands of prisoners-of-war, and even those enemies of Britain who were engaged in the devastating air raids on undefended towns of Great Britain have been released and repatriated.  In all the upsurge which followed the conclusion of hostilities in Europe there was one class of prisoners that got no exceptional treatment and they were the Irish prisoners serving sentences, long and grossly severe sentences, in British prisons.</P>
    <P>I think nobody will contend that these Irishmen undergoing sentences are criminals.  They are not toughs, as one finds in many of the gaols in Great Britain; they are not the dregs of humanity at ebb-tide; they are men of high ideals, misguided men of high ideals who allowed their zeal for their ideals to lead them to take wrong paths and to do things which on sober reflection they must realise they had no moral authority to do and which they must realise was even unwise of them to do from the point of view of achieving whatever ideals they sought to achieve.  Those who have visited them in Parkhurst Prison have not been slow to recognise that those prisoners are men of character and their bearing and <Col N="870" /> dignity as prisoners evoked the admiration of many people of British nationality who visited them for the purpose of ascertaining the circumstances under which they were imprisoned and to obtain from them their viewpoint as to how they stood in relation to efforts to secure their release.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to members of the British Parliament who visited those men at Parkhurst and one or two were glad to indicate that in their view the continued incarceration of those men as if they were criminals was wholly unjustified in the circumstances in Great Britain during the past few years.  Members of the British Parliament have recognised that these men are not toughs; that they were not such a menace to society as the types of men who, in the main, occupy the gaols for prisoners with long sentences; that, instead, they were men actuated by high ideals wrongly guided and canalised into directions which have led them into the unfortunate position they now occupy.</P>
    <P>Even in Great Britain among enlightened, progressive-minded people of all shades of political thought there is a widespread demand for the release of these prisoners.  A motion on the subject was tabled in no less august an assembly than the British House of Lords, where the British Government was asked to take steps to release the prisoners, so satisfied were the liberal-minded people promoting that motion that the circumstances were such as to justify their liberation.  Yesterday's issue of the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> contained a letter from a person described as Brigadier Eric Dorman Smith, a former Minister of Agriculture, and, I think, he expresses the minds of average liberal-minded Englishmen when he writes to the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> in these terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In Parkhurst Prison there are still a number of young Irishmen undergoing sentences for Irish Republican Army offences in Great Britain before the recent war.  Since the war Great Britain has liberated India and Burma.  Before that liberation she pardoned Indian and other officers and men who, when on active service, deserted to the Japanese and <Col N="871" /> served in arms against her.  Surely in such circumstances the time has come to pardon these young Irishmen whose offences are far less serious.  Surely also it is the proper time for a generous measure of justice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If one can find this liberality of mind, liberality of conscience and humanitarian outlook on the part of progressive-minded people in Great Britain, is there not a greater obligation on us here, their own kith and kin, functioning in a Parliament established by the efforts, perhaps of themselves, but certainly of their own kith and kin here, to take some steps to ensure that all the influence we can bring to bear on the British Government in this matter is utilised for the purpose of securing the release of these Irish prisoners?</P>
    <P>In my view the time to review the position is long overdue and, whatever views the Taoiseach may have had because of his natural disappointment with the activities of these people in the past, I think that now, in view of the headline being set by people in Great Britain, and in view of the state of the public mind on the matter in this country among people of all shades of political thought, the Taoiseach ought no longer delay in making the necessary representations to the British Government to secure the release of these prisoners.</P>
    <P>I confess I cannot understand the attitude of the British Government in this matter.  They cannot justify the continued incarceration of these prisoners on the plea that it is necessary in order to safeguard British interests.  These prisoners are no menace to post-war Britain.  These prisoners are incapable, even if at large, of being any menace whatever to the British Government or to British interests either internal or imperial. Holding these prisoners in British gaols for a period of eight years, with no promise of an amnesty and no promise of a speedy release is, in my view, open to the interpretation that something more than Britain's safety is at the bottom of their continued detention and that there is an element of a vendetta against these prisoners which <Col N="872" /> has not been shown by the British Government to many people whose acts of sabotage and treason against Britain wrought, or were capable of wreaking, much more damage to her interests than these prisoners could have inflicted upon her.</P>
    <P>I do not want to discuss the internal affairs of Britain, or the actions of the British Government <i>vis-a-vis</i> its own citizens, although one can hardly refrain from expressing amazement that some well-known international Fascists can strut around Britain to-day while those young Irishmen must be incarcerated in a British gaol.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that I did not want to introduce any rancour into the debate <i>vis-a-vis</i> the attitude of the Government towards the prisoners.  I want instead to enlist the goodwill of the Government and the co-operation of the Government in approaching the British Government to ask them to release these unfortunate prisoners.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach talked about &ldquo;stultification&rdquo; yesterday if he were to make representations at this stage.  I would suggest to the Taoiseach that this is not an occasion for putting a premium on starchiness.  This is not an occasion for standing on punctilio. This is an occasion for making allowances for the youth of many of the prisoners; for the circumstances and atmosphere at the time they were charged with these offences in Great Britain.  He ought to recognise that these men are our own citizens and every government in the world endeavours to exercise all its powers in order to defend its own citizens and even to endeavour to secure clemency for them if these citizens cannot be defended in relation to the laws of another country.</P>
    <P>Very many men and women of influence and integrity here and in Britain want to secure the release of the prisoners and I would put it to the Taoiseach on broad humanitarian grounds, since these people who are incarcerated are our own citizens and in view of the fact that they have served eight years' imprisonment in British jails, that the Government here should now recognise that these men <Col N="873" /> have more than expiated any charges made against them, and that they should make representations to the British Government to secure their release.</P>
    <P>It was stated that one thing which would influence the British Government in respect of their release was the fear that their release might embarrass the Government here.  The Taoiseach, in his reply to Parliamentary questions yesterday, said that he desired to make it quite clear that any suggestion that this Government would be unfavourable to the exercise of clemency was without foundation.  I would like to see that put in a more definite way and I would like to see that viewpoint expressed from this angle: not that our Government were not unfavourable to clemency, but that our Government expected the British Government in the circumstances now existing to extend clemency to these prisoners and to release them all as evidence of a gesture to build a new spirit of goodwill and a new concept of cordial relations between the peoples of the two countries.  There is one thing that we can do.  We can make it clear beyond question that any suggestion of the release of these prisoners would not embarrass the Government here, by asking the British Government in an open and positive way to release these prisoners.</P>
    <P>I think in this matter that there will be nation-wide support in favour of the demand for the release of the prisoners and that this view would be reflected by members of the Taoiseach's own Party in this House on this issue this evening if they were free to express it. You have only to discuss the matter with independent citizens to realise that there is a widespread demand that the prisoners should be released.  I would suggest that the Taoiseach, in order that our position in relation to the prisoners should not be misunderstood and in order that he should give expression to the view of persons of every political shade in this country and in Great Britain, that he should now ask the British Government to release the 28 Irishmen who are still in Parkhurst Prison.  If the British Government do that, they will be <Col N="874" /> extending to these prisoners no more generous treatment than they have extended to others.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Taoiseach, as this is the last day on which this House may sit, that the Government should make the necessary representations to have these prisoners speedily released and restored to their families before Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the plea made by the Leader of the Labour Party on behalf of these men.  I would like to make it quite clear that I have no wish to make any political capital out of this matter, and I appeal to the House to treat this matter away from political issues but purely on a humanitarian basis.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach certainly knows and as the members of the House have probably read in the papers, a number of influential people in England connected with political affairs and with cultural affairs have interested themselves in the case of these prisoners. The matter has been discussed in the British House of Commons and in the British House of Lords.  I understand, as I believe the Taoiseach also understands, that one of the objections raised to the release of these men by members of the British Government&mdash;&ldquo;objection&rdquo; is too strong a word&mdash; but one of the grievances raised is that there has been no indication from the Irish Government that the release of these men would not cause embarrassment to the Irish Government.  I understand from Lord Killanin and from Mr. Eoin O'Mahony, who have both devoted their time and energy to trying to secure the release of these men in a most selfless way, that an indication from this Government here that their release would be welcomed would weigh considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to measure my words carefully and not introduce any discussion about the matter, for I feel that the less discussion there is about it the better.  I regret one or two remarks which the Taoiseach made yesterday in answer to supplementary questions. I would appeal very sincerely to the Taoiseach to give a very clear indication&mdash;if it could not be done officially it <Col N="875" /> could be done unofficially&mdash;that far from embarrassing them, the Irish Government would welcome the release of these men.  I feel that if the Taoiseach made that clear, either in this House or through the various channels open to him, then these men would be released before Christmas.</P>

      <P>If there are not any others I am prepared to speak at this stage.  If Deputy Norton were addressing the British Government, then, naturally, I would have no objection whatever to his speech.  I think I have made it as clear as it is possible to make it, that the suggestions that we are against the release of the prisoners are untrue and without any foundation whatever.  I say that not only now but I said it months ago.  I know that that is known to the British Government.  I made it equally clear yesterday that there was no question whatever of our being opposed to any clemency being extended to these prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the question of these prisoners is under review.  I know that there is a practice of review and that that practice is being carried out in this instance and that the sentences are under review.  One of the dangers of debates such as this is that, because in most cases there are two sides, when the Government is attacked it might possibly, in defending its position, be led to deal with aspects of this question which might not be at all helpful to the prisoners.  Some people think <Col N="876" /> that results are only got by talk. Results are very often got much more effectively by not talking.  I know that these sentences are being reviewed.  I believe they will be reviewed on their merits.  I believe it is known to the British Government, as it is to Deputy Norton and to anybody else who has studied the matter, that a number of these sentences undoubtedly appeared to everybody at the time to be imposed for the purpose of example.  I do not, in any way, want to prejudice any examination that may be made of these sentences.  Just as we, if there were matters of considerable importance to us under consideration, might be inclined to resent representations that might be made without due regard to our side of the question, so, I think, other Governments are likely to do that too.  In any case, for us to make formal representations is out of the question. By &ldquo;formal representations&rdquo; I mean just exactly what I say&mdash;formal representations. For the reasons&mdash;and I do not want again to go into these&mdash;that I have given already, I can only say that we have indicated quite clearly that there is no attitude on the part of this Government which would give any foundation for the statement that we would not welcome the release of these prisoners.  I think I should say no more.  My own belief is that the less that is said here by us on this particular matter the more effective will it be in securing the release of the prisoners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the House I will not be five minutes.  The Minister promised I could get in on the adjournment but, as the matter can be raised here, I wish to draw the attention of the House to the alarming position in the City of Dublin in connection with evictions from tenement houses the owners of which are anxious to get possession in order to demolish them with a view to adding to their business <Col N="877" /> concerns or to extend or to build premises that are not for the former residents of the houses.  The Minister quite recently in this House told me that the people have a remedy.  He said that the law is there for them and that he thought they are fully protected by the various Acts of the House.  I thought so, too, but every day in the week people are showing Notices to Quit to me.  Only yesterday as I was passing through the City Hall on my way to a meeting, seven women came to me and asked me if I could do anything for them to get them a room because they had been threatened with eviction from Clanbrassil Street.  I understand that their houses are wanted for business purposes and that the owners are getting these people out on the ground that these houses are old and possibly dangerous.  Because of that excuse the verdict is given in favour of the owner. The verdict is given in favour of the man who allowed that property to get into such a rotten condition that it had to be condemned or a notice put on it to put the house in order.  Time after time the sanitary authorities go into these houses and the owners continue to pay the fines.  They will not carry out the necessary repairs.  They pay the fines until such time as the Dangerous Buildings Inspector investigates. He says that the building is dangerous.  That plays right into the hands of the owner of the rotten property, who orders the people out without offering them adequate alternative accommodation or any compensation.</P>
      <P>I think we had an Act of Parliament about 1918 or 1919 which provided for adequate accommodation and compensation in that connection.  It went into disuse or it was withdrawn&mdash;I do not quite understand or follow what happened.  In York Street, in New Street, in Aungier Street, in Summerhill, in Clanbrassil Street and in Marlborough Street, there are tenement houses which the owners are anxious to acquire.  They are evicting or threatening to evict the people who live in them and who have no other place to go.  If the Minister has any doubt about people having no place to go I can show him a letter of yesterday's date in which a man says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="878" />&ldquo;I wish to state my case to you. My wife, child, and myself are stopping in the Dublin Union in separate places because after travelling the city of Dublin I cannot get a place in which to live.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It may be news to the Minister and to members of the House that in the Dublin Union to-day there are families who were evicted from their homes and who have nowhere else to go.  The corporation could not accommodate them and the old houses were falling down.  These families in the Dublin Union are becoming a matter of serious concern to the Dublin Corporation Housing Department.  The tenants of these houses, which the owners want to acquire for the purpose of making a handsome profit, would seem to have no protection.</P>
    <P>In Marlborough Street the owner has succeeded in getting out seven families. The Minister very kindly gave me advice on the matter recently, but the fact remains that the owner has got the seven families out.  The house was originally bought by him with the seven families in it for £200.  The house is now advertised in the Press for £2,500.  The owner when he bought the house appreciated that there was a business premises next door.  He is now advertising it for £2,500.  The corporation is not in a position to house those seven families because they have so many claims upon them from basement dwellers.  That brings me to the question of repairs.  Some members may say that if the houses are in bad repair why does not the corporation go in and repair them?  Will the Minister give us power to go in and repair them?  If we were given that power we could do something to ease the housing shortage until such time as we have building material available.</P>
    <P>There is another house in Marlborough Street which also contains seven families.  There is a common lodging house next door with six beds in each bedroom for which the owner charges 1/- per bed per night.  His income must average about £1,000 a year.  He served notice on the occupiers, saying that they would have to get out because he wanted to carry out repairs.  The corporation architect <Col N="879" /> gave evidence that the repairs could be done without putting the people out. The owner produced another witness who said the repairs could not be done while the people were in it and the court gave a decision in favour of the owner.</P>
    <P>I shall not detain the House but I do ask the Minister to consider the present position.  I know where his sympathy lies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that the Deputy would confine himself to the case he raised by question here about one particular house.  He dealt with that, but he also ranged over a wide area of the city.  He said that houses were acquired by the local authority as dangerous buildings for the purposes of demolition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I did not give the Minister that impression.  I had no wish to mislead him.  I said that even since I raised the question further cases have come to my notice where the owners are trying to acquire property, knock it down and sell it as a business speculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This particular man in Marlborough Street was disturbed when the matter was raised here in the House and he sent a letter to the Aliens Sections of my Department, in which he dealt with each case specificially.  I verified the cases of most of the seven families concerned. In no case was anybody evicted.  They were all provided with alternative accommodation and compensated. Some of them were anxious to get out for one reason or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the matter was raised here on a former occasion I said that it was practically impossible for an owner to evict seven families because of the operation of the Rent Restriction Act of 1946.  He might get one family out. There are certain things that the tenant may do which automatically gives power to the owner to put the tenant out.  There is also a provision to prevent undue increases in the rent. I think it is practically impossible to evict tenants now unless for non-payment <Col N="880" /> of rent or some breach of covenant.  The Rent Restriction Act is ample to safeguard the interests of all tenants.  I have been asked on occasion whether it is possible to inform tenants of these safeguards.  The Press give it ample publicity and I think that is probably the best way of informing the public.  Surely people should realise that they have certain rights.</P>

Lest there might not be time on the Adjournment for Deputy Norton and Deputy Byrne, I announced that I would allow them to raise those matters on the Appropriation Bill instead of on the Adjournment.  The matter raised by Deputy Norton would not, ordinarily, arise on this limited Appropriation Bill because it is outside its terms, but he was allowed to raise it and was quite satisfied that it was a concession.  When Deputy Norton had spoken, the Taoiseach waited to see whether any other Deputies wanted to speak and asked whether any other Deputies wished to speak on the matter.  When Deputy MacBride finished speaking, no other Deputy rose and that matter is concluded. Deputies got their opportunity and the matter is outside the scope of this Bill.</P>
