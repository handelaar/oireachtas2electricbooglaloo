    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if, in view of the serious position here arising from the scarcity of food, particularly bread, butter, sugar and meat, he will cause the proposed gifts of quantities of these foods to European countries, under the scheme for the alleviation of distress, to be cancelled until such time as production of such foods is in excess of our own requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach) Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestions contained in the Deputy's question are completely at variance with the facts.  The programme for the alleviation of distress in Europe at no time included gifts of bread, and no gifts of butter have been proposed or made since the year before last.  There is no shortage of meat in this country, and all but a small quantity of the sugar included in this year's programme was shipped before the end of October.  It was the strike at the sugar factories in the following month which necessitated the reduction of the ration to its present level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The shipment of all the other foodstuffs included in this year's relief programme, with some exceptions, such as the canned meat, was also effected before the end of last October. Arrangements for shipment have always been made with due regard to the home supply position.  This has been the invariable practice in the past, and the unworthy efforts now being made to attribute to the relief <Col N="2314" /> shipments shortages which are obviously in no sense due to them, reflect nothing but discredit on those who make them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the number of permits issued by his Department for the use of anthracite for Esse, Aga, A. and B., and other such anthracite cookers and stoves.</P>

      <P>Permits authorising the purchase of anthracite for cooking purposes during the current period have been granted in approximately 7,000 individual cases. Anthracite is not allowed for use in space-heating stoves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the serious hardships being endured by the holders of permits for anthracite coal for domestic use in cookers; that many families are dependent solely upon such cookers for domestic use, and have no substitute fuel to enable them to overcome their present difficulties; whether, in these circumstances, he will take steps to ensure the supply of a regular monthly ration of anthracite coal to authorised domestic users of anthracite; and whether, in addition, he will have the ration which obtained in January of this year restored to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the recent reduction in allowances of anthracite for thermal storage cookers has entailed some hardship.  The reduction has been made necessary by the present critical coal position and must be maintained until there has been an all-round improvement in coal supplies.</P>
      <P>Supplies of anthracite are available to provide the reduced monthly allowance.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the inadequate bus services provided, <Col N="2315" /> between 8.30 a.m. and 9 a.m. and between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. respectively, by Córas Iompair Éireann on the Churchtown, Dublin (No. 61) route; and if he will direct Córas Iompair Éireann to provide extra buses on this route during these hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that Córas Iompair Éireann could not make additional buses available on this route for the morning and evening services unless they diverted vehicles from other routes.  The company propose to provide any necessary supplementary services as soon as vehicles become available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Risteárd Ua Maolchatha</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state, in respect of each county council, the date upon which he last communicated with them reminding them that valuations should be increased in the case of persons cutting and selling turf; and if he will state the terms of such communication.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for Local Government (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for Local Government (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 4th September last my Department by circular letter requested the secretary of each county council to indicate generally the action taken on the circular letter of 11th April, 1946, relative to the revision of valuation of turf bogs or turf banks.  Where replies were not received or where they were incomplete or indefinite, reminders or further communications were issued in due course until full information was obtained as to the action taken in each county.</P>
      <P>It is perhaps well in connection with this question to remind the Deputy that in the discharge of their obligations to their ratepayers in general, it is the duty of the appropriate local authorities to ensure that all turf banks in their area on which turf is cut for sale should be duly valued.  If the local authorities concerned do not do this, then the ratepayers who do not own income-producing bogs will be bearing an undue proportion of the county charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was sent a letter in April, 1946.  I shall be glad if copies of subsequent letters could also be sent.  I suggest that it would be advisable, for the information of members of the Oireachtas generally, that copies of all circulars issued in connection with this matter should be placed in the Library.</P>

      <P>It is not usual for county councils when requesting revision of turbary valuations to distinguish between cases where turf is cut and sold and cases of letting for a rent or other valuable consideration; the normal request is for revision of the valuation without indicating the precise source of the profits.  In 1945-46 no case was reported to the Valuation Office by a county council in which it was stated that the person concerned cut and sold turf; in 1946-47 there were 203 such cases, whereof 183 were from Westmeath, 15 from Mayo, two from Roscommon and Waterford and one from Wexford.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that there is serious dissatisfaction among members of the Army and of the emergency forces because of the low percentage of service marks awarded to those men when seeking public appointments; and if so, if he will consider the desirability of increasing the percentage of such service marks in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to both parts of the question is in the negative.  I am not aware that there is dissatisfaction regarding the marks at present allowed for service in the Army and Auxiliary Defence Services.  These marks were determined by the Government after very careful consideration, and I have no evidence that they are inadequate.  I would remind the Deputy that, in addition to the grant of additional marks at open competitions, men who served in the Army during the emergency have been given several opportunities of entering the Civil Service through competitions confined to them.  Numerous appointments have been made in this way and further similar competitions are being held.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that men who gave service in the Army and in the Emergency Services have just got a bare 8 per cent in some cases and as low as 1.6 per cent. in other cases?  Is he further aware that in some cases where public appointments have been made, those who ignored the emergency services and attended to their studies have got positions which in the ordinary course might have been obtained by those who joined in the emergency services, if they had not joined these services <Col N="2321" /> but had attended to their studies?

      <P>The Deputy has mentioned, as a contribution to the problem <Col N="2327" /> which undoubtedly exists, the stoppage of the exportation of milch cows.  I dealt with that suggestion in another place and I have no reason to change my attitude towards it.  I have given the Deputy the figures for which he asked.  There has been no serious change in the cow population, but I cannot, of course, give to the Deputy or to the House any guarantee as to whether or not 2,000,000 such cattle will behave in exactly the same fashion in the matter of production as 2,000,000 cattle behaved ten years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill has been introduced principally to give effect to the amendment in Section 19, which raises the insurable limit to £400 in respect of non-manual workers. Deputies are aware that manual workers are insurable, no matter what their remuneration may be.  When the National Health Insurance Act was first brought in, in 1911, the limit was £160.  It was increased to £250 in 1920 and has remained at that figure. Owing to the increase in wages, particularly during the last few months, a number of people who were hitherto insurable have passed beyond the insurable level and I think the opinion was expressed by practically all Parties in the Dáil that we should raise that limit from £250 to some higher figure. We have inserted this figure of £400 as a reasonable figure, being somewhat related to the £250 when you take into account the increase in wages over the last few years.  I might mention here that where a person passes over the insurable limit for national health insurance, the same applies to widows and orphans and that may be even a more serious question than the question of national health insurance.  If this amendment is accepted it will apply to widows and orphans as well as to national health insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true, of course, that these people could continue their insurance on a voluntary basis but very few do that, for one reason or another.  They do not seem to think of it in time and when they do think of it the amount of arrears to be paid up is a deterrent <Col N="2330" /> and they are not inclined to go on. That is Section 19.</P>
    <P>When bringing in the Bill I thought it well to take advantage of the occasion to re-enact the provisions of Emergency Powers Order No. 381, which was passed last June, and that is dealt with in Part II of the Bill. First of all, Section 3 deals with the question of people who continued to contribute even though they were not insurable because they had passed over the limit for insurance.  Section 3 legalises their payments when they were made in good faith and really continues their cases as live cases when they come back into insurance again now with the raising of the limit.  Section 4 deals with the free period of insurance which up to this was 12 months but which is now raised to 18 months.  That is necessary because, in the interests of economy, the National Health Insurance Society issued cards recently for 12 months instead of six months and, in order to give a period over the 12 months for these cards to be returned, the insurance society would need a free period of 18 months instead of 12 months.  It will, of course, be all to the benefit of the insured person also.</P>
    <P>The remaining three sections in that part are dealing with the Army, in particular, soldiers who enlisted for the period of the emergency.  There was no such period of enlistment contemplated in the Act of 1926 in dealing with members of the Army and these sections are necessary to clear up certain points that were in doubt.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the members of the Military Forces International Arrangements Insurance Fund which was brought into being in 1923 and was established for ex-members of the British Army.  At that time the insurance societies, a number of which existed, were not inclined to take on some ex-members of the British Army because they were not very good risks. A special scheme was prepared for taking these people on and that scheme has continued up to the present.  It is proposed now to do away with the scheme because it is uneconomic to work a separate scheme by the Department <Col N="2331" /> for the sake of a few thousand members.  The whole thing is being transferred to the insurance society. No member of the fund will lose in any way by reason of this merger.  There are a number of clauses there but they have the effect only of transferring these people over and giving them the same rights they had in the fund. There is also a provision with regard to keeping certain accounts, so that if some of these people go back again to Great Britain it will be possible to send the history of the case, as they will be eligible for insurance on the other side.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with persons who are in receipt of pensions from the British Government in respect of disablement arising out of the recent war.  There are two clauses there, one which deals with men who have got a pension who are members of the forces, and the other, which deals with men or women who have got a pension who are not members of the forces.  In the case of members of the forces, where they got a full pension for 100 per cent. disability, they do not get sickness allowance here.  Where they got what was not a full pension, in fact, less than the national health insurance would amount to here, they would get the sickness allowance on this side.  In the case of civilians who got compensation for injury, coming back here from Great Britain, they would be treated exactly as persons who had been compensated under the Workmen's Compensation Act, that is, that if the allowance was less than the allowance given for health insurance on this side, they would get the difference between what they were in receipt of and what would be now 22/6 a week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then he would get the difference between that and what he would be entitled to here on sickness benefit.  Part V contains two or three provisions.  The first is Section 17 which makes a change in the method of payment by the Exchequer into the National Health Insurance Fund.  As Deputies are aware, the ordinary payment up to this was two-ninths.  There was considerable difficulty in the administration of this supplementary payment of 50 per cent. extra on national health insurance payments. We had to bring this clause in in order to make it legal for the society to pay out the supplementary allowance along with the 15/- that they had been paying up to this.  The fund will not be injured in any way by this clause.  The fund will receive the two-ninths that it would have received if this supplementary allowance had not been given and it will receive in addition to that the 50 per cent. allowance, but it was necessary to legalise the payment in this way.</P>

This supplementary allowance will be paid by the <Col N="2333" /> National Health Insurance Society but will be all drawn from the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister uses the phrase in Section 17, &ldquo;such sum as in the opinion of the Minister and of the Minister for Finance will be payable,&rdquo; etc., that really means the figures the Minister has just quoted and not capricious figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would take a very elaborate Bill to set out all the little details and this is the simplest way of doing it.</P>

      <P>I want to assure the Dáil that the fund will not suffer.  The fund will receive the two-ninths that it would receive on the ordinary payment and it will also receive all the supplementary payments, whatever they may be, from the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The next clause deals with the investment of funds.  Deputies will remember that last year a Bill was brought here by the Minister for Finance to enable him to invest funds that were in, I think, the Post Office Savings Bank, in certain ways.  I mean, otherwise than in trustee funds.  They could be invested in certain ways for Exchequer purposes, and so on, and this is to bring the National Health Insurance Fund into line with that provision.  I have already dealt with Section 19, which was the principal cause of this Bill being brought in and that is to raise the limit over which people must be insured, that is over which non-manual workers must be insured, from £250 to £400 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as this Bill goes, I would like to welcome it. It is certainly not before its time, and whilst I do not agree that Section 19, or rather the scheme which Section 19 is set up to implement, goes as far as I think it should go not only to give present-day real values to paid workers but to give those who are claiming sickness benefit some chance of recovering their health&mdash;while it does not live up to what I think it should in that respect&mdash;I welcome it as far as it goes and particlarly as we have been <Col N="2334" /> assured by the Minister that this is merely a step towards a further and a fuller scheme.  I do not want to open up a wide general discussion on national health on this Bill.  I realise that it is rather limited in its application, but I want to take advantage of it to suggest to the Minister, this being one of our largest social services and one of our most important social services, that the sooner he gets down to work on the scheme as a whole the better.  The whole machinery under which national health insurance is operated in this country, apart altogether from the amounts of benefits, is completely wrong.  I could go into several aspects: I do not want to do it.  The whole system of medical certification in relation to national health insurance is notoriously wrong and has been for years, probably since the inception of this scheme, and no attempt has been made to deal with it and apparently no attempt is going to be made to deal with it.  The question of malingering has never been faced up to and I doubt if it ever will.  I mention those two matters particularly because, of course, they have a greater bearing on the financial position of the National Health Insurance Society and its ability to pay more than the statutory benefit than any other factors which, so far as I know, enter into its operation.  However, I do not want to develop the matter, but I am mentioning it now, Sir, to the Minister in the hope that he will tackle this matter in the way in which it should be tackled, in a realistic manner, and that he will give the House an opportunity fairly early of going into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now with regard to the Bill before us at the moment, I welcome this increase from £250 to £400.  It is really, of course, no increase, having regard to the real value of the figures; if anything, I suppose one would be inclined to say that the £400, the new figure fixed, is really lower than the actual £250 which we had there all the time.  So far as I understand the Minister's immediate proposals, I would like if he would tell us when concluding when it is proposed that these new rates will come into operation.  The <Col N="2335" /> intention is to increase existing sickness benefit by 50 per cent. and to increase disablement benefit by 100 per cent.  There may be some variations between men and women, boys and girls, and so on, but that roughly is the scheme.  This of course is only touching the fringe of this national health insurance problem and much less the question of national health itself.  So far as the section dealing with the extension from 12 to 18 months for keeping people in insurance is concerned, I think that that action will be welcomed. We have had innumerable cases, particularly over the past ten or 15 years, of workers who had been contributing to this fund from the beginning of the scheme and who, through no fault of their own, were completely at the loss of their entire contributions over a long period of years.  The Minister may say to me that legally they were entitled to keep their contributions alive.  That is so, but those men in the circumstances in which they were very often did not advert to that and I think I can say, as one who knows a little about it anyway, that in the majority of cases&mdash;I am not criticising the society on this point because so far as I know both since and before unification they did their best to enlighten the members in this regard &mdash;but I think I would be safe in saying that a very considerable number of members were ignored on that principal safeguard which was there for them.  I do not want to take up the time of the House any longer.  As I say, there is a lot I could say and a lot I would like to say on this whole matter but I am afraid the Bill does not give us that opportunity now.  However I hope that the Minister, as I have already said, will give us an opportunity of going into this matter fully and not only tighten up the machinery but, I hope, make a complete and radical change in the whole national health insurance machine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as it goes this is a very useful Bill.  It in no way restricts any of the existing provisions in the national health insurance legislation and in some respects it extends <Col N="2336" /> the scope of our existing legislation in very useful directions.  To that extent, I welcome the Bill but, like Deputy Morrissey, I realise at once that even when we have passed this Bill our whole code of national health insurance legislation is still in a very unsatisfactory state.  I have said before, and I do not think it can be repeated too often, that what we call national health insurance legislation is neither national in its concept nor helpful in its scope and, in fact, provides no adequate insurance at all, having regard to the proposals which confront the breadwinner.  He has got to rely on what one can only describe as the miserable allowances which are paid under existing national health insurance legislation.</P>
      <P>I do not want, on a Bill of this kind, to travel over the whole domain of our existing national health insurance legislation.  I think, as soon as the Minister gets down to the question of having that legislation examined, for example, in the sympathetic and comprehensive way undertaken by his Lordship, the Most Rev. Dr. Dignan, the sooner we are likely to evolve legislation of a kind calculated to make a tangible contribution to the provision of real insurance against disability and ill health in this country.  I think it is rather a good omen that our national health insurance legislation of the future is to be under the control of the present Minister for Health and Social Services. So long as it was the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health one felt that he would always be obliged to justify that unseemly dispute in which he was involved with his Lordship, Most Rev. Dr. Dignan.</P>

I am hopeful that the new Minister will apply himself diligently to an examination of the whole problem of national health insurance with a view to evolving a much better scheme than we have at the present time.  The Minister must know that to offer persons the small sums payable at the present time under the National Health Insurance Acts and expect them to be able to provide for themselves and their wives and children on what is ofttimes less than 25 per cent. of the wages they were earning when in employment is not making any substantial contribution to alleviating the economic plight of a family when the bread-winner is unfortunately stricken with illness.  Furthermore, to imagine that we help to provide in that way a remedy for the ills of a family so circumstanced by making available weekly benefits on a very inadequate scale, whilst in fact making no effort whatever to treat the sick contributor, is a complete and utter mockery of all proper steps in national health insurance legislation.  What happens at present when the insured contributor reports sick?  He draws national health insurance benefit and he gets well the best way he can.</P>

I do suggest that when we have an amendment of the national health insurance code it provides us here with an opportunity seldom afforded to the House for a general review of the whole system of national health insurance. Since that will subsequently be dealt with in a comprehensive way I think it would be desirable that we should not now be choked down by a ruling which would create a precedent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We very rarely have a National Health Insurance Bill introduced in this House.  There is one section of the Bill which I particularly <Col N="2339" /> welcome and that is Section 19.  The purpose of that section is to extend the salary ceiling for the non-manual class from £250 to £400 per annum. At the present time those who are employed by way of manual labour are insured for national health insurance purposes no matter what their earnings are.  In the case of the non-manual worker, he ceases to be insurable under the Acts when his remuneration exceeds £250 per annum.  I have asked questions in this House on a number of occasions as to raising the ceiling from £250 per annum.  I suggested to the Minister on one occasion&mdash;or rather to his predecessor&mdash; that the ceiling should be raised to £500 per annum.  I still think £400 is too low a ceiling.  If you can allow a manual worker to be insurable when he earns at a rate of £500 per annum there seems no reason why a non-manual worker should not be insurable compulsorily when his remuneration does not exceed £500 per annum.  I think the Minister should realise that under present circumstances non-manual workers, whose remuneration exceeds £400 per annum, should not be deprived of the benefits of the National Health Insurance Acts and more particularly of the cover for widows' and orphans' pension purposes. You cannot qualify for widows' and orphans' pension benefit unless you have already got cover under the National Health Insurance Acts.  I strongly urge upon the Minister, therefore, that he should amend Section 19 by substituting £500 per annum for £400 per annum.  On the Committee Stage of this Bill I propose to move an amendment to that effect, but I would like to have from the Minister now an assurance that an amendment in those terms will be welcomed by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should, as far as possible, provide cover for the non-manual worker in respect of widows' and orphans' pension benefits.  We cannot do that adequately if we fix a low ceiling of £400 as income for the purpose of insurability.  It must be remembered, too, that when we talk of £400 per annum it is not £400 per annum salary but £400 per annum from all sources. <Col N="2340" /> It has been held in numerous court cases that any kind of payment whatsoever apart from salary, either in cash or in kind, can be assessed for the purpose of ascertaining the income of a person in respect of his insurability under the National Health Insurance Acts.  I hope that the Minister will see his way to extend the scope of the Bill by raising the ceiling to £500 per annum.</P>
    <P>I would like at this stage to get from the Minister some clarification of the provision of voluntary contributors under the existing National Health and Widows' and Orphans' Insurance Acts. Take the case, for instance, of a person who is being paid at the rate of £240 per annum and who jumps from £240 to £260 per annum.  That person ceases to be liable for compulsory insurance and that person can become a voluntary contributor when the free insurance year has expired.  If he becomes a voluntary contributor he is liable to pay his own portion of national health insurance contributions in order to keep himself a live member for national health insurance purposes and for widows' and orphans' pension purposes.</P>
    <P>A considerable number of persons, who were originally compulsorily insurable under the National Health Insurance and the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, elected to become voluntary contributors when the rate of remuneration exceeded £250 per annum and they are at present paying the total contribution.  What is their position to be in respect of this Bill: Can they continue as voluntary contributors? Will they be compelled to continue as voluntary contributors, or will the voluntary character of their membership of the National Health Insurance Society cease and will they become compulsory contributors for the purpose of this Bill?  It is a matter which affects quite a number of voluntary contributors, and I would like the Minister to clarify that position.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter, and that is the position of the staff of the National Health Insurance Society. Some time ago, and again as late as yesterday, claims by the staff for an <Col N="2341" /> increase in remuneration have been before the Labour Court.  The plea put up by the society is that the staff in question can only be paid out of what is known as the administration fund and the society contends that the administration fund is not sufficient to enable it to grant to the staff the reasonable increase in wages which the staff are seeking.  It is quite clear, therefore, that unless the staff of the National Health Insurance Society are to be compelled to accept wage increases which bear no reasonable comparison to the ratio of increases granted to outside workers, something will have to be done with the administration fund; in other words, the State will have to come to the assistance of the society by stepping up its proportion of the grant which it makes for the administration of the National Health Insurance Acts.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot contemplate with any complacency a situation in which the staff of the society are compelled to work for rates of wages which are abnormally low compared with the ratio of increases granted to other workers in recent months.  I should like to hear from the Minister that he proposes to put the society in a position in which it will have at its disposal an administration fund capable of granting to the staff the reasonable wage increases which they are seeking.</P>

      <P>It is not that our address was not well known to the Government Departments.  I am <Col N="2342" /> rather surprised that the new Minister for Health and for Social Welfare is following in the steps of his predecessor, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health&mdash;that is, in bits and scraps.  One would have expected that he would scrap the whole insurance scheme and start off on a fresh foundation by introducing something worthwhile, something that we could understand.  We did think when the new Department was separated from the old Department of Local Government and Public Health that something worthwhile would be started, that something of a practical nature would be done as far as public health is concerned.</P>
      <P>I have not been the recipient of health insurance benefit in this country, but I was on one occasion in Great Britain after I came out of hospital, where I spent a considerable time.  The system there then was reasonably good in comparison with the system that operated here.  For instance, an unemployed man who went to the labour exchange to register for employment was unable to have his card stamped because of the fact that he was unemployed.  But he brought his health insurance card and had it franked; he was not losing any ground through being unemployed; he was keeping his health insurance card up to scratch.  If he became sick and was unable to accept work if it was available, he was disqualified automatically as an unemployed recipient and, therefore, he would have to fall back on health assistance.  Having to do that, and being unemployed, he would find his health insurance card was not stamped to date.  In Great Britain they had a system of presenting the health insurance card and having it franked, and it was always stamped to date.  I understand that does not apply here and it is not included even in this Bill. I see no provision whereby a man who becomes unemployed will be able to keep his health card stamped to date unless he does it out of his own pocket, and not many of them can do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not regard as adequate the amount of benefit which a person will receive, even under the increases the Minister is prepared to give.  The Minister must recognise that a man <Col N="2343" /> who is unemployed may have the responsibility of maintaining a wife and family and a man in that position was unable to do so under the meagre allowance granted up to this.  That is one thing we expected from the Minister, that he would take care that the allowances granted would be sufficient to provide for the maintenance of a man and his dependent wife and family. I think the Minister will have to admit that he could not expect that any man will derive much benefit even under this Bill.  I think he will admit that the amount allowed will not be sufficient to maintain even the man himself, not to mind his dependents.</P>
    <P>This Bill makes no allowance for free medical treatment.  If I am correct in that assumption, a sick person will have to pay for medical advice and medical attendance.  How could the poor people be expected to do it?  The Minister's Department must be well aware that in Great Britain for at least 15 years they have had a free medical service for men and women.  That system was not everything it should be, but at least it was a help.  The amount allowed for a doctor and for medicine was insufficient.  The medicine was not everything it should be, because the doctor was not allowed enough remuneration to permit him to give the best type of medicine for whatever disease or ailment the patient might be suffering from.  Here we have no allowances at all.  This is a country which is divided between two Governments, and if the health services in one part of the State, that part which is cut off from our Government, are so much in advance of those here, I do not think it is any encouragement to the people who are living in that other part of the country to come in under our Government.</P>

      <P>It is a very long way, but one hears so many statements that are obviously insincere on this question that they force one to refer to it even though it is irrelevant.  The <Col N="2344" /> fact remains that we were all looking forward to what was going to come out of the new Minister's hat.  If this is the beginning&mdash;and you always expect the beginning to be good, however you end up&mdash;I am afraid that there will be many disappointed people.  Deputy Norton's remarks, of course, have been curtailed within the limits of the Bill, but the Labour Party in particular, who represent industrial workers and the largest percentage of insured persons, should, I think, request the Minister to withdraw the Bill and introduce a new Bill, starting from scratch.  Let him go about it decently and introduce something more in keeping with the reforms advocated by Dr. Dignan in relation to social services and public health.</P>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey spoke about malingering but I think that is a matter that is hardly worth consideration, when one thinks of the many other aspects which should be considered.  I think the number of men and women who, for the purpose of getting a few miserable shillings from the National Health Insurance Society, pretend that they are ill when they are not ill are very small and represent a very small percentage of the total number of insured persons.  I think we should be more concerned about the small allowances which insured persons will receive and also about the fact that these allowances will be insufficient to enable married men to maintain themselves and their families.  There is also the fact that no provision has been made to assist men to keep their cards stamped for national health insurance purposes during the periods of unemployment.  We expected a good deal more from the man who is taking over the responsibility for this Department and who has himself some medical knowledge.  I think I can safely say that we are disappointed as a whole with this Bill.</P>

      <P>It has been suggested that the Minister should have introduced a comprehensive Bill at the present time.  I must say that I would be rather afraid in that event to see the type of Bill that the Minister might introduce, when we consider the type of Health Bill which we had before us a short time ago, a Bill which must necessarily impinge on the whole situation in regard to national health insurance. When we consider that we are waiting now for a new Health Bill, I feel that the Government should give a greater amount of consideration to the views put forward in regard to the Health Bill before they embark on any comprehensive measure in relation to national health insurance.  The Minister is doing just one simple thing by this Bill&mdash;he is increasing the amount of benefits that are being paid under the National Health Insurance Acts and under the widows' and orphans' pension scheme.  He is doing that without increasing contributions and is providing for these increases by a State grant.  I think that these are the lines upon which we should like the Minister to act at the present time because in the first place it is urgent that these payments should be increased.  We could afford to wait to see a more comprehensive scheme, if we were sure that the real distress that exists at present is being relieved but the real distress is not being relieved by the Minister's proposal.  At the present time a man who is ill and who may have a family gets 15/- a week.  Under this Bill he will get 22/6 a week.  In these circumstances, a man who has a wife and family will be dependent on home assistance to supply the balance necessary for the maintenance of himself and his wife and family.  I feel that considerably more consideration should have been given to the circumstances of married people.  I suggest to the Minister that the increase to be given in the case of a person who is married, as this is an emergency measure, should be greater than the increase given to an unmarried person.  I would <Col N="2346" /> also suggest that the benefits in the case of a married insured person should at least be doubled.  The Minister is providing an increase of 50 per cent. for an unmarried person and seeing that a married person has considerably more responsibility I think that the benefit in his case should be doubled.</P>
      <P>This Bill maintains the national health insurance scheme as a contributory scheme and for that reason I do not think that any scheme such as that suggested by Dr. Dignan is prejudiced in any way by the passage of this Bill.  I do say of course that the whole national health insurance scheme is still left in the ugly atmosphere of the poor law system in which it has been for a long time.  It is a very tragic thing that our national health insurance scheme should continue to lie for so long in the shadow of the poor law.  This Bill will still leave it in the shadow of the poor law but we are not prejudicing our attitude with regard to the future by accepting the provisions of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton suggests that the limit of £400, as the insurable ceiling should be raised to £500.  I saw&mdash;I think it was in the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash;a statement that this measure will bring 61,000 more people under the national health insurance scheme.  I do not know whether that refers to people who slipped out of it because of the £250 ceiling, but I read it to mean that it would bring in under the scheme 61,000 people who had not been bound by the scheme before.  If that is so, while for some reasons one might welcome a raising of the ceiling from £400 to £500, I do not think it ought to be raised £500. My first reaction is that it ought, but my second is that is ought not, because I do not think that, until we know the general line of approach of the Minister to a comprehensive national health insurance scheme, we ought to drag more people into insurability at present.  This Bill will give a considerable amount of extra work to the national health insurance staff, and I think it would be complicating the work for the National Health Insurance Society and bringing into a scheme, which we might perhaps afterwards consider to be unsatisfactory, a <Col N="2347" /> number of new people.  I think the Bill goes far enough in raising the ceiling to £400.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton raised the matter of the staff and the Minister, particularly when we consider his two Departments, should take a fairly wide view of the greater part of our social problems connected with health and all that arises from lack of health, whether on the economic or the social side.  He must know that nothing has been more conducive to a serious health problem here than the lack of wages. Deputy Norton referred to the position of the staff in their appearance before the Labour Court, and I ask the Minister to take special notice of the fact that the Labour Court, in recommending the staff to accept the proposals the society have put before them for an increase in pay, had to make a declaration to this effect:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the new scales for the lower grades of the society's staff are compared with the salaries at present paid to the two lowest general grades in the Civil Service, it will be seen that the society's proposed rates are substantially lower than the Civil Service standard.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The lower grades in the Civil Service are the more numerous and the lower grades in the National Health Insurance Society are the more numerous, too, but when one hears of any class of wages being substantially lower than the lowest Civil Service standard, one would think that any Minister ought to sit up and see what exactly is involved.  The court went on to declare that the society is not in a position to deal with the matter directly, that is, by reducing benefits.  They have not sufficient funds in hands to pay their staff, the ordinary clerical staff, even an amount as high as the lowest grades in the Civil Service.  The court stated further:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The court believes that a reduction of additional benefits would be generally regarded as undesirable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think we would all regard it as undesirable.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The alternative of an increase in contributions was a matter beyond <Col N="2348" /> the competence of the court and the society, but it appeared to the court to be one which should not be omitted from consideration by the responsible authorities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think any increase in contributions should be considered at the moment&mdash;again until a general scheme is involved&mdash;but I do consider that, if the condition of people who are contributors to the national health insurance scheme have to be taken into consideration and additional moneys granted because of the lowering of the purchasing power of money to-day, the same should apply to staffs whose payment is substantially lower than the lowest grades of the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The maximum wage of one of the lowest grades, the most numerous, in the national health insurance staff was £2 12s. od. per week before the war. A bonus of 15/- was given during the war, and now the Labour Court advise them to accept an additional 2/-.  I do not know where the National Health Insurance Society management got the idea of an increase of 2/- per week, unless they got it from people who are offering increases to turf workers, but an increase of 15/-, plus 2/- over the 1939 standard on a wage of 52/- is an increase of about 33 per cent. on a total remuneration pre-war which was lower than the lowest Civil Service wage.  A wage of 52/- per week is £135 per year.  In the case of the Civil Service, where civil servants on the 1939 scale had a total remuneration of £135 per year, they got, in the recent increases, an increase of 53 per cent. Those in the Civil Service who got an increase of 33 per cent. were persons whose total remuneration in 1939 was approximately £684 per year.  The society are offering their staff to-day a percentage increase on a very low rate, which is the percentage increase given to civil servants who were in receipt of £684 per year.</P>
    <P>I submit to the Minister that when one takes into account the very low total remuneration the staff were receiving in 1939, they would be receiving less than justice if they got the percentage increase which the better paid civil servants got when, on their particular scale, they got an <Col N="2349" /> increase of 53 per cent.  The Minister is only building up a national health insurance scheme on a staff which can scarcely keep them in health if their wages are substantially lower, over a large number of them, than those of the lowest grades in the Civil Service. A considerable amount of work will be thrown on the society as a result of this Bill and I do not think that, in present circumstances, the Minister can ask the staff to take on a considerable amount of new work without treating them, in relation to increases in wages, at least as well as the Civil Service has been treated.  The original basis on which national health insurance benefit payments were made, I think, was related to the agricultural labourers' wages at that particular time and it was suggested that if the insurance scheme planned for any more it would mean that certain people would get as much under national health insurance as they would get if they were working in agriculture.  As strong as has been the pressure of the Department of Local Government in keeping down road workers' wages in order to keep down agricultural labourers' wages, they have risen substantially above the benefits that are being paid under the national health insurance scheme now, and I consider that, particularly in the case of married people, the Minister should make a definite increase in his proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as I understand the Bill, having read the excellent explanatory memorandum&mdash; the first of its kind coming from the particular Department&mdash;the purpose is to raise the limit of remuneration for insurance purposes and to make the necessary provision for interim supplementary payments.  On all sides of the House, disappointment will be expressed that this form of approach has been found necessary at this stage to a very important social question, that is, that the Minister has found it necessary to introduce it here in a piecemeal fashion.  His answer to that will naturally be that so far as his Department are concerned they did not have the necessary time to examine the position as a whole.  I can recall <Col N="2350" /> a debate in this House 12 months ago on this very subject and the various systems and schemes of social insurance that were referred to and, in particular, the scheme outlined by Most Reverend Dr. Dignan.  There was an indication at that time by representatives of the Government that the problem as a whole was being seriously examined. I do not think the two positions are reconcilable.  If the Minister and his Department now claim that they need time to examine this important matter, the question arises, what has been done during the last 12 months?  It is only fair to the Minister personally to say that probably he would be justified in claiming the indulgence of the House on the plea that he has not had the necessary time.  This piecemeal approach is entirely unsatisfactory and the House would be glad to get a picture of the scheme as a whole at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>I want to join in the appeal that has been made by Deputy Norton, particularly in relation to the section of employees that are now limited by a ceiling of £400, that is, those who are termed non-manual workers.  On the introduction of the Bill in 1911, the figure fixed was £160.  That was altered in 1918 to £250 and there has been no change up to the present.  The Minister will appreciate that there is an upward trend so far as clerical workers are concerned and that the figure of £400 does not represent the position accurately.  It would appear as if the intention of the Minister may be defeated if he retains an arbitrary figure of £400.  A range of workers, clerical workers particularly, will be found outside the £400 limit, and in order to have a comprehensive scheme that will be attractive, I strongly urge that the figure should be altered to £500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other criticism of the Bill I have to offer is in relation to Section 17.  I suggest that Section 17 contains a complete departure from Parliamentary practice.  The framework of the scheme has been very clearly defined in relation to its upkeep by contributions from insured persons and by a State grant.  That has been on the basis of seven-ninths to two-ninths. <Col N="2351" /> In Section 17 the Minister introduces a completely new departure so far as the House is concerned.  The words &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo; govern that particular section.  That is entirely unsatisfactory.  Granting that the Minister finds it necessary at the present time to get some form of adjustment to enable him to make his interim supplementary payment, I suggest that the House would not be wise in giving the Minister permission to alter the provision in the way he seeks.  The society at any and every stage should be in a position to say on what basis its finances will be constructed in the future.  They will not be able to do it under Section 17 as at present drafted.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputies who submitted that it would be very much better if we had a comprehensive scheme dealing with all these social services.  I think Deputy Mulcahy was the only one who had some doubt about that.  But, I explained here last week that I do not think it is possible to have a comprehensive scheme dealing with all these social services within 12 months.  I thought it would be unfair not to bring in this temporary relief to certain people and to wait until the 12 months are up.  What I had in mind in regard to a comprehensive scheme is that we should try to insure people against sickness, unemployment, old age, perhaps insure widows in the same scheme and perhaps also in the same scheme to insure them against the burden of a large family.  I mean by a comprehensive scheme that we should have if possible one stamp to deal with all these things, one inspector or agent dealing with the insured person, one card at head office giving all the information that is necessary about the insured person and, in that way, to have a unified scheme administered by the same people.  That will take a long time to prepare.  In regard to the point put forward by Deputy O'Sullivan, it is true that certain officers of the Department have been examining this, off and on, for a long time past but it will take a long time to get a scheme like that into proper order, to get, first of all, a White Paper <Col N="2352" /> for examination by Deputies, followed by the necessary legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to mention that.  That would be the comprehensive scheme as far as social services are concerned.  I think health would have to be separate because in the social services scheme we are dealing with people who are on a certain income and it is a contributory scheme we have in mind when we talk of insurance but health must be applied to everybody who cannot afford to pay for the services themselves, that is, it must be applied to people who are not insurable because they are not earning money as well as to people who are insurable, who are earning money. Therefore, I think the health service must be taken as a separate thing and that any health service must apply all round.</P>
      <P>I am just giving those views.  I should not like to be tied too rigidly to them because, as we examine this matter, we may have to change our minds somewhat.  I am just trying to give the Dáil some idea of the magnitude of the job.  Even in other countries where they did this thing they took some time to prepare the scheme and they took a very long time to put the scheme into operation.  We hope we may be at least as quick as other countries in having our scheme in operation from the time we start out to prepare it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were a few minor points raised.  At least they were not stressed.  Deputy Morrissey talked of the malingering that is going on.  Of course, there is no doubt that if we had a scheme that could be worked honestly by everybody, the contributions could be lower or the benefits could be higher than when you have a scheme where there is a certain amount of malingering.  These are matters that we must deal with as far as we possibly can in preparing the scheme. Deputy Norton asked whether a person who had been a voluntary contributor, his income for some time past having been over £250, would become a com- <Col N="2353" /> pulsory contributor now.  Any non-manual worker whose remuneration at the moment is between £250 and £400 will become a compulsory contributor if this Bill is passed as it stands.</P>

A person who was in excepted employment in the past for the purpose of the National Health Insurance Act was, therefore, insured under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act. But when he earned more than £250 a year, to keep his widows' and orphans' pensions' contributions alive he would have to become a voluntary contributor under the National Health Insurance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There are a few other points.  Section 17 was raised by Deputy O'Sullivan.  I explained it already but perhaps Deputy O'Sullivan did not follow me.  First of all, if we had given the supplementary benefit, it would have to be raised by contributions, and in the proportion as laid down in the original Act&mdash;so much from the employer, so much from the employee and so much from the State.  We do not want to do that at the moment.  We prefer to wait for a comprehensive Act before changing contributions and so on.  I was very much in favour of letting the Exchequer pay the total amount of the supplementary grant pending the comprehensive scheme.  We could, of course, give the necessary assurances legally by bringing in a very long Act, but we mean to work this clause in the following way: the State will continue to contribute the two-ninths that they would have contributed to the ordinary benefits that were there already, and, in addition, the State will contribute all the supplementary amount, whatever it may be, so that the fund will not be a penny worse off at the end of this coming financial year as a result of the supplementary allowances being paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The State will bear the full supplementary amount?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>You will follow the same mathematical procedure as in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is the position. Some Deputies have referred to the question of staff.  I have not gone into the question of staff.  I suppose I will have to go into it naturally before long. Deputy Cafferky made a remark that the allowance was not sufficient to maintain a man and his wife and his family.  I know it does not and I do not think we will ever be able to provide an allowance for sickness and unemployment that will be sufficient to keep a man and his wife and family. These social services were designed, in the first place, to help a man in time of difficulty, when he is sick or unemployed, but I do not think that in any <Col N="2356" /> country they have ever attempted to give a person as much as he would earn if he was in good health.  We may, as I said here before, try to improve those benefits, but I have no hope that we will ever improve them to the extent that Dáil Deputies will generally agree that they are sufficient to keep a man and his wife and family.</P>
      <P>With regard to the number that is brought in, it is estimated&mdash;we must admit that we are not too sure of the number&mdash;that it will bring in about 30,000 people, not 60,000 as Deputy Mulcahy mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Some will be brought back.  They were there already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister says &ldquo;brought back&rdquo; does he mean brought back after having been forced out as a result of increased wages under the emergency conditions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of increased wages.  One other point was mentioned by Deputy Cafferky.  He talked about the superiority of the English scheme as compared with ours.  That superiority is more apparent than real.  I have often noticed that we are very much inclined here to take the good points of a scheme we hear of in another country and take the bad points of a scheme we know of in our own country and compare the good points of the scheme we hear about with the bad points of the scheme we know about.  I suppose if we were fundamentally patriotic we should take it the other way round.  It is true that if a person is drawing unemployment insurance in England he gets his national health cards franked.  He gets some credit for them but, in order to revive his national health insurance, he must pay practically all the arrears when he goes back to work again.  Now, the same principle applies here but in the reverse direction.  What we do here is, when a man is unemployed we do not frank his card but we accept from him a contribution in lieu of arrears and we revive his national health insurance when he goes back to work.  We do not ask for the full amount of the arrears from such a person going back into <Col N="2357" /> work but the system works out much the same in this country as in England except that we do it in the opposite way.</P>
      <P>The only other point that was raised was this matter of the ceiling of £400. Some of the Deputies would like to see that raised.  On the Second Reading of the Bill I made a calculation as to what the average increase in a man's wage would be during the last six or seven years in relation to a salary of £5 a week in an office.  Taking the average I found that it would not bring him exactly to £400 a year, but it would be something very close to that and so I took the round figure of £400. What I am really trying to do under this Bill is to re-establish the position that existed in 1939 as far as possible. It is quite understandable that some Deputies may say that in 1939 the position was not what it should be and that we should take this opportunity of making a change now.  The Dáil, of course, can do what it likes but I would prefer myself not to make any unnecessary change in contributions or in the age governing insurability until we are ready to bring in a comprehensive scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any real difficulty in making the £400 ceiling £500?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, of course, no difficulty at all but I am merely giving the House my reason for taking £400.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, the calculation is not reliable but it might perhaps be something in the region of 15,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister appreciate the very considerable benefit it would be to the non-manual worker earning up to £500 a year if he was able to insure for widows' and orphans' pension purposes and thus make provision for widows and orphans for whom he is not able to make any adequate provision at the moment out of his existing salary?  Is it right that we, when we have an opportunity such as this, should neglect <Col N="2358" /> to make provision for that class?  I think Deputy Morrissey on the Fine Gael benches advocated an extension of the limit beyond £400.  A similar advocacy has been advanced from these benches.  Some of the Government Party have shown the same preference for raising it to £500.  As ordinary Deputies are in a difficulty in moving a precise amendment of this kind because of its relation to a charge on public funds would the Minister accept responsibility at this stage and introduce an amendment on the Committee Stage raising the level from £400 to £500?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must admit it did not strike me that the Deputy would be prohibited from moving an amendment of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not resist the amendment if all Parties in the House thought it was advisable.  I would like to put this to the Deputy: I think there is a distinct advantage, and possibly an inducement, to a person in receipt of £400 to £500 from the pensions point of view, but I am not so sure as to the sickness benefit.  I do not think the person in receipt of £9 a week is going to be attracted by a sickness benefit of 22/6 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the point of view of the person who can see very clearly but cannot see very far and I am afraid there are a lot of people in that category in this particular salary earning group.  I am equally sure that if their wives and children were consulted this would be carried by an overwhelming majority.  It is a choice between the wisdom of the man and the wisdom of his unprovided for wife and children.  I take the side of the wife and children.  It is easy for the man to say the prospect does not attract him.  Whilst he is earning he can manage to pay but once he is dead his widow and children have to depend on anyone on whom they can depend for help.  I want the Minister to come in on the side of the widow and the potential orphans even though he may <Col N="2359" /> appear to be in some difficulty in doing that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put these considerations to the Minister.  I do <Col N="2360" /> not say my experience in this respect is unique.  I think it is the experience of many Deputies in this House.  I, in the course of my activities, deal with various kinds of cases.  One thing that appals me is to see a man who can maintain himself and his wife and his family all right so long as he is working and living, leaving his wife and children without any adequate provision when he dies, very largely because he is not able to make such provision, the household demands being what they are&mdash;always hoping he will survive until his family are reared and educated and go into employment.  But very often he is fallible in his hopes in that respect, with the result that if he dies his widow and orphans, deprived of his income and with no adequate insurance, are left to fend in any way they can.  I have seen people, very respectable people while the breadwinner was alive, simply hawking their case from one charitable organisation to another, having been shocked into destitution by the bread-winner's death, hoping to get some relief here and there, wherever they can.  I am sure the Minister could have these things verified by consultation with any charitable organisations.</P>
      <P>My main concern in this matter is for the widows and orphans.  If the husband does not regard the health side as a good bargain, it should be some consolation to him to know that he pays that price in order to cover his widow and children in the event of his death.  It need not be a bad bargain for him on the health side; it may not be attractive, but it need not be a bad bargain.  It is some provision whereby the widow and children can be covered, the widow and children getting an automatic right to a contributory pension in the same way as if the husband had insured for industrial insurance purposes.  The insured person under the Widows and Orphans Pensions Act can get a cover for widows and orphans pensions purposes at a premium which no outside insurance company would accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment, therefore, is to help these people to <Col N="2361" /> make provision for widows and orphans.  I cannot see why the Minister would decline to do it; to bring in these people will mean bringing in good economic units for insurance purposes, not uneconomic units for widows and orphans pension purposes.  I know many people who would be glad to be insured for widows and orphans pensions, but they would be beyond the £400 limit.  I urge the Minister to make provision for them by making them compulsorily insurable.  I know that the widows and orphans will be glad if the Minister accepts this and I appeal to him to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection to the proposal is that we are dealing with a Bill, all stages of which quite unexpectedly we are asked to take to-day.  We are asked to take in a number of people, maybe 10,000, according to the Minister, or it may be 15,000&mdash;he does not know which&mdash;in addition to the 30,000 who are brought in under the Bill.  We are asked to take them and fix them with responsibility for coming in under a National Health Insurance Bill.  My first reaction was that it would be a good thing to do it, but my second impression was that here we have a measure raising the amount of benefits that will be given to certain people who are in under the scheme already and holding under the scheme people who would be pushed out simply because of an increase in wages and we are doing that without any indication as to what principles the Minister will proceed under in the future.  The Minister indicated that he was going to proceed in a way that perhaps would be satisfactory, although I do not quite understand the impact of the new health code on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ought not, without some chance of consideration, to be asked to extend the level of wages from £400 to £500 and bring in an additional class of people here at five minutes past five, this evening.  This Bill will go to the Seanad and, perhaps, between this and the time the Minister deals with it in the Seanad, he will have consultation with somebody concerned; we, too, may be able to have an opportunity <Col N="2362" /> of considering it among ourselves. Then, if the Minister thinks it well to introduce an amendment in the Seanad raising the £400 to £500, we will have an opportunity of discussing that when the Bill comes back here again.  It is an unreasonable thing to ask us now to take such an important decision.  It is unreasonable to ask even for all stages of the Bill, because we understood we were going to deal only with the Second Stage.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Chair will interpret this note which I got from the Ceann Comhairle some 20 minutes ago?  I want to see what my rights are as a member.  The Ceann Comhairle writes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Re amendments.  See Standing Order 104 (1).  To increase the remuneration limit for insurability&mdash; Section 19 of this Bill&mdash;from £400 to £500 would involve a charge on the Exchequer.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a definite communication that I cannot move an amendment.  It <Col N="2363" /> is a reference to a Standing Order.  I suggest that an amendment to increase the ceiling from £400 to £500 does not impose any charge on the Exchequer. While in respect of everybody you bring in there would be a State subsidy towards benefits in administration, there is no definite increase in the charge on the Exchequer itself by increasing £400 to £500 and the State might well not pay any additional contributions in respect of administration in connection with that plan.  What interpretation am I to put on this mere quotation of Standing Order 104 (1), which conveys no decision to me beyond a quotation of a Standing Order with which I am already familiar?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is largely covered by the National Health Insurance Bill which we have already discussed, but in certain respects it is necessary to have separate legislation. Part I of the Bill is principally concerned with definitions.  Sections 4,5 and 6 of Part II deal with exempted classes, that is persons who are liable for widows' and orphans' pensions but who are not liable for national health insurance.  It deals with persons who continued in good faith to pay contributions although they were above the insurable limit and the free period is extended from 12 months to 18 months. This Part of the Bill also deals with soldiers who had been exempted persons and afterwards joined the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 relates to people who went to work in England during the emergency and whose period might have gone beyond the free period.  Their period was extended as far as widows' and orphans' pensions were concerned, and it is now proposed to <Col N="2365" /> extend it further up to a date to be decided by an Order to be made by the Minister.  A man might go to England and have lost any benefit due to him before he would come into benefit on the English side.  If he died in the interim period, his wife would get no pension, either on this side or on the other side.  It was rather an unfortunate position but the present proposal will keep such men in benefit until they come into benefit on the other side.  A widow, however, who gets a pension from the British side will not get it on this side.  It makes their position more secure.  I do not think it is going to take very much from the fund but it will cover some very hard cases.  The only other matter dealt with in the Bill is the investment of funds.  They are to be dealt with on the same basis as the National Health Insurance Fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very long involved table but I can give a few examples.  We are removing the food vouchers and giving 2/6 instead and then bringing the allowance up to 50 per cent. above the 1939 figure, to the nearest unit.  We do not take half-pennies and pennies into account.  For instance, a widow who was getting 10/- in 1939 will get 15/- now.  A widow with one child who was getting 15/- will now get 22/6 while a widow who was getting 18/- will now get 27/-. These are some of the simple cases but there are some very involved cases. All I can say is that in no case are we giving less than 50 per cent. over the 1939 figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the provisions of Section 7, which remove a very great hardship on citizens who left the country, but the section still leaves unredressed a glaring hardship to which I should like the Minister to advert, if possible, in this Bill.  I refer to the case of people who do not leave the country, who work all their life here in industrial employment, who contribute during all these years to the Insurance Fund and who retire at the age of 65.  They cease to be insured persons on retirement and when they die their widows are not entitled to pensions.  I have been dealing recently with the case of a man who, for 32 years, was employed by the Great Southern Railways Company and during all that time stamped his card. On his death his widow was left completely without any pension.  She happened to have no family.  She was a woman of 65 years, and she had neither a contributory nor a non-contributory pension.  Surely the Minister should make some provision to cover cases of that kind.  Would it not be equitable to make a provision that the widow of a man who had contributed to the Insurance Fund for a specific number of years should on his death be entitled to a pension?  Take the case of that man, who had paid 32 years' contributions.  Should not the State morally and in all equity be obliged to pay a pension to that widow?  That is not an isolated case I hear a clamour, time after time, from ex-railway employees in regard to such cases.  These men, having worked for years and retired at the age of 65, find at the end of 12 months that they cease to be insured persons.  They are then in the same position as if they were never insured.  I should like the Minister to insert some provision in the Bill to cover that point, namely, that a period of insurance of 12, 15 or 20 years, irrespective of when death occurs, should qualify the widow of an insured person for a pension.  There would be nothing unjust, inequitable or unfair about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the case mentioned by Deputy Keyes?  A case was referred to me a few days ago of a widow who was not entitled to a contributory pension because there was some lapsing in the matter of the stamping of the card and who was not entitled to a non-contributory pension because she was under 55 years.  That is the present position, and all I can promise Deputy Keyes is that, in our comprehensive scheme, we will try to cover cases of the kind, but it may not be possible to cover every case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister interpret Section 4 for me?  I take it that it has no other meaning than to cover a person in excepted employment, where contributions were irregularly paid, but nevertheless paid in good faith?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried, so far as I could, to do so.  The law relates to contributory pensions, for which cards must be in order and so on.  If the cards are not stamped up to the proper date, the widow is not entitled to a contributory pension.  If she has no children and is under a certain age&mdash;I think, 55 years&mdash;she is not entitled to a non-contributory pension and, therefore, she gets nothing.  We certainly will have all cases of that kind considered when going into the matter in full.</P>

      <P>There is not much to add to what I said on the First Reading of this Bill as to why the Bill is being brought in.  I simply repeat that the main purpose of bringing it in is to prevent these funds being frittered away in legal costs.  As most members of the Dáil will know, these funds belonged originally to the Sinn Féin organisation when that organisation represented, in a way in which perhaps no organisation since has represented, the views of the Irish people Following the division of opinion which arose after the signing of the Treaty in 1921, the then treasurers, on legal advice, lodged these moneys in court in 1924. There had been meetings of the governing body of the organisation in 1922. There was an Ard-Fheis in February and another in May, but no disposition of the funds was made at these meetings, because at neither of the meetings was the organisation, in fact, dissolved. The funds have been in court since 1924 and the original sum of £8,000 or £9,000 has now increased to about £24,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the period following 1924, efforts were made to get some sort of agreement between the groups into which the old organisation had divided as to how the funds might be used. Strong efforts were being made to try to get the funds applied for the purpose of restoring the Irish language, of helping the language movement, as being one of the objects which the <Col N="2369" /> original organisation had, and which the various groups into which the old organisation ultimately broke up continued to have, but these efforts were not successful.  No effort was made to get the funds from the courts during the period in which the treasurers of the former organisation, Eamonn Duggan and Mrs. Wyse Power, were alive.  Eamonn Duggan died in 1936 and Mrs. Wyse Power, co-treasurer, died in January, 1941.  On her death, her executor and personal representative, Judge Wyse Power, was anxious, if possible, to have the funds disposed of.  He had an interview with me and a plan was suggested which is not very far different from the plan that is suggested in the Bill for the disposition of the funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Judge Wyse Power. Personally, I always felt that there was a danger of moneys being distributed in a manner of this sort not always being able to be used to the best advantage.  I was aware, however, that there were a number of cases of persons who had directly suffered as a result of the national effort who could not get directly any help from the State.  As a rule, the State has to make laws of a general character and there are many cases that cannot be dealt with in a general way because if you attempted to deal with them in a general way, by a general description, you would bring in a whole host of persons to whom it is not necessary to give the help that is intended.  Therefore, no matter what the State does, you have organisations like the St. Vincent de Paul Society and other organisations which have practical work to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was satisfied that if you put up a board of trustees to administer these funds for the benefit of needy persons who are suffering as a result of their activities in the national movement, individual cases could be examined as such, provided that you have the right board and the right attitude of mind in dealing with these things, so that only those that were really needy would be dealt with.  Finally, the whole <Col N="2370" /> question was: can you get a board that will give the necessary time and attention to the matter and have the wisdom and understanding to deal properly with it?  I suggested that Judge Power should see, not merely me but the other members of the old Sinn Féin organisation who were still alive, the standing committee and the office board, and find out from them what their views were, as they would know the circumstances in which the funds had been collected and could be regarded as people who would have a complete knowledge of the nature of the moneys in the trust, and would be, I thought, fairly representative of the groups into which the old organisation had been broken up.  He did that and, with one exception, he found that of those who were then alive&mdash;that would be the autumn of 1941&mdash;various members were prepared at least to come to a meeting and they were not unsympathetic with the scheme he had outlined.  There was one exception.  There was a question of trying to get that exception to agree also, and I think there was a fair chance of success.  When, however, the fact that legislation was contemplated got mooted abroad, the existing Sinn Féin organisation took action in the courts.</P>
    <P>They served a plenary summons on Judge Wyse Power and on the Attorney-General. The moment that was done there was no question of going on with the legislation.  I thought, very well, let the courts deal with that. That was in the early part of 1942. But no action had been taken further than serving the plenary summons&mdash; no steps were taken to bring the matter to trial&mdash;until 1945.  The plenary summons was issued in January, 1942, and on the 21st November, 1945, an order was secured by the defendants in the High Court giving the plaintiffs a month in which to serve notice of trial.  So that from 1942 to 1945 nothing had been done until the notice of trial was served on December 19th, 1945, by the plaintiffs.  In October, 1946, Judge Overend fixed November 26th for the hearing.  So, you had all these years passing by and very little being done, and being done <Col N="2371" /> only when the defendants pressed for action.  Meantime, money was being spent in preparing for the trial.  On November 11th, 1946, an application was made by the plaintiffs for an order directing papers to be transferred to another solicitor other than the one that had been employed up to that time.  Apparently the solicitor who had been acting for the plaintiffs up to that time refused to transfer the papers which he had and on which he held, I think, a lien for his costs.  The order was refused and on November 29th an adjournment was applied for by the plaintiffs to enable them to appeal to the Supreme Court against the refusal of the order.  At that stage it seemed to me and to the Government that there was going to be interminable legal action of various kinds, motions of all sorts, and that the end would be that whatever funds were there, or the greater part of them, would be frittered away.  Already, as I have said, we understand a considerable sum has been spent in preparing the case for trial and in costs, and there is no deterrent, when you have trust funds of that sort and when it is possible for those who have apparently an interest in these funds to make applications and to go to all lengths to defend them &mdash;there is no restraint on the steps that they would take, because they hope ultimately to get their expenses out of the funds.</P>
    <P>These are the circumstances under which this Bill was prepared finally and introduced.  As far as the Bill is concerned, its main purpose, as you can see by looking at it, is to stay the pending action, to dismiss the case and to hand over the moneys to a board of trustees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes, to pay the costs that have been incurred so far, and to hand the remainder of the moneys over to the trustees.  Now the question is how we should get a body of trustees.  If, of course, we could get agreement on the board we would have most of the difficulties solved. The question is how we are to get <Col N="2372" /> that agreement.  Personally, I would be prepared to submit to the Government names of a board that we might get agreement upon if that were possible. I would be very glad to get, for example, from members of the Opposition who were associated with this movement, some names that they might give, if the scheme is approved, of people who would be useful as members of that board.  The chief difficulty, I think, would be in getting a satisfactory board.  It is proposed here that the appointments would be made by the Government and that the chairman would be the Chief Justice or a judge whom he might select.  I think the purpose of the rest of the Bill is apparent to anybody who reads it carefully. The board will consist of the chairman and six ordinary members. The chairman, as I have indicated, is to be the Chief Justice or somebody whom he may nominate.  The appointment or removal of the six ordinary members would be by the Government. The procedure of the board would be the usual procedure&mdash;the chairman having a casting vote.  The trustees would be a body corporate with a seal.  They would have the power to appoint such officers as they might require for the carrying out of their work.  All the moneys would be in one fund and from that fund payments would be made to the qualified persons.</P>

It is really <Col N="2373" /> a benevolent fund for the benefit of those who have suffered and who are in needy circumstances as a result of the national struggle.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been some estimates, but I would not like to mention any figure until I have got something more definite than I have got.  What is provided for here, as you see, is, in the case of Judge Power, the costs between solicitor and client and, in the case of the others, party-and-party costs.  I am afraid the lawyers will have to determine the exact difference between solicitor-and-client and party-and-party costs.  I believe that, in the case of party-and-party costs, there are costs which would not be allowed; for example, costs incurred through excessive caution&mdash;looking up and preparing documents and so on, which might turn out useful but which would not be regarded as necessary.  All the costs will be taxed.  The costs to be paid are those incurred up to 11th March.  Fair notice was given on that day by the introduction of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to those to whom the moneys might be paid, "qualified persons" would be those who are in needy circumstances and who had belonged to any one of the forces, namely, Oglaigh na hÉireann, the Irish Volunteers, the Irish Citizen Army, Fianna Éireann, the Hibernian Rifles and Cumann na mBan.  Payments could be made to any person in needy circumstances who, as a member of the forces, that is, one of those which I have enumerated, gave service in the national cause at any time during the critical period, that is, from the 1st April, 1916, until the 11th July, 1921. A needy person who himself or herself gave service and also a person in needy circumstances arising directly or indirectly out of his efforts in support of the activities of the forces would be eligible.  Any people not members of the forces but who are in needy circumstances arising directly or indirectly <Col N="2374" /> out of the efforts to support them would also be eligible.  There have been such cases, and it has not been possible to deal with them by any legislation enacted so far.  Other eligible classes would include persons in needy circumstances who are or were dependents of persons in the categories I have referred to.  In all cases, any person to be eligible for a grant from this fund must be in needy circumstances and must have been associated in some way, either directly or indirectly, with the effort to secure our independence.</P>
    <P>The board has power to accept real or personal property.  If anybody wishes to make gifts, the Board of Trustees can accept such gifts, and, if a gift takes the form of land, then the board will be required to convert it into money, and the net proceeds will be paid to the credit of the fund.</P>
    <P>Finally, when the purpose for which the board has been set up is achieved, the board naturally will be dissolved.  I do not think that there is anything further I can add at this stage by way of explanation.  I am not in a position to state what the exact amount of the costs incurred will be, but I have been told that they will be fairly substantial. The figure mentioned to me &mdash;I cannot stand over it because I have not seen the details of it myself &mdash;is somewhere in the region of £4,000 to £5,000&mdash;probably £5,000.</P>

      <P>Although I have no immediate interest in this matter, on what the Taoiseach has said so far I would be inclined to oppose it.  This is not, of course, a Bill to amend the Constitution; neither is it a piece of legislation brought in under emergency powers.  Therefore, so far as any person thinks he has a right under the Constitution, further actions can develop in contesting this matter.  While the Bill in all its sections does provide that after the passing of this Act all further proceedings in the pending action before the court shall be stayed, it is all very well to say that.  But that may be challenged and there may be costs, and considerable costs, involved in such a challenge.  I am sure the Government has been advised on that <Col N="2375" /> point.  I do not suppose they have been advised that this can be broken on any Constitutional issue, as otherwise it would not be proceeded with.  One may have expectations of not having an action brought on a Constitutional issue but it is not always possible to prevent such an action being brought and there may be costs incurred in that direction and those costs will have to be balanced against possible expenditure under this.</P>
      <P>This is an entirely new procedure. I do not think we have ever before in the history of the Dáil done anything like this.  There have been occasions when legislation was passed through this House and subsequent proceedings founded on it where the Dáil occasionally stepped in and legislated retrospectively to prevent people having a right of action.  But that occurred altogether in circumstances in which the Dáil itself had given the right of action and then decided that there would be abuses.  The Dáil, therefore, intervened to stop such abuses and to start afresh at a particular time.  The Dáil, of course, always has power to amend by legislation anything that was legislated on previously, where court proceedings have indicated that the courts have not read into the legislation what was supposed to be the intention of the people who passed it here.  This matter is now before the courts and is awaiting judgment.  It would be impudent to say that the people who made a defence in this action did not do so properly.  We are dealing here now with a matter in which the funds are actually in court and we are doing it&mdash;and here I am taking the Taoiseach's explanation&mdash; simply for the purpose of avoiding costs.  But there are many estates that come into court for administration where the costs run up to alarming proportions and where moneys that ought to go to the beneficiaries are distributed amongst those who benefit out of the court proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This will be quoted as a precedent no matter what may be said about the exceptional circumstances.  It is an unusual step.  It is, as I said, unique in the history of the Dáil.  Let it be understood <Col N="2376" /> that we are interfering in a situation not brought about in connection with any legislation in this House. Nevertheless, we are doing something completely and entirely apart from anything we have ever done before.  We are told that the justification for it is to avoid costs.  I would like the House to understand&mdash;and here I am open to correction because I am only speaking from such information as is current in legal circles&mdash;that this action has been several times before the courts and certain matters have been talked about and the information one gets is not always precise or accurate.  The Taoiseach, no doubt, is precisely informed in this matter and will correct me if I misstate anything.  I understand that round about 1942 an action was brought in the courts.  Nothing was done until 1945.  There is a procedure open to the courts known as "getting an action dismissed for want of prosecution." That action was instituted and I understand that it now stands adjourned, because there has cut across it this trouble in connection with solicitors.  One solicitor was in charge of the proceedings up to a certain point.  Another was then introduced and a motion was brought to get from the first solicitor in the case the documents which he had or else permission to investigate the documents so that copies might be available.  A decision was given in the particular matter of the solicitor that he should not hand over the documents. That is now the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Court.  The application to have the action dismissed for want of prosecution is still pending.  The Master may dismiss the action.  I do not suppose it will stop there, but a judge may certainly dismiss and there the whole thing ends.</P>
    <P>Now, certain costs have been incurred up to that point by the Attorney-General on behalf of the State.  These will be paid in any event and we know out of what funds they will come.  We do not help the matter by this Bill except we put the costs of the Attorney-General on to this fund instead of discharging them as heretofore out of the taxpayers' money.  There is a third party in this case and costs are being incurred in <Col N="2377" /> that respect also.  These should be recouped and these will be recouped and will come out of the fund in the end.  As far as the plaintiffs are concerned there is a possible action on the point of being dismissed for want of prosecution in which event they will get no costs.  We propose now to give them their costs out of this fund.  In other words if there is a charge properly brought that funds have been frittered away in legal expenses we are actually paying people who, if their action is wrong would not in the normal course get anything and we are paying them for having frittered away the funds up to this.  If this Bill does not go through the matter is still <i>sub judice</i> but it can be said on behalf of the people involved that they either have a claim or they have not.  If they have not a claim they lose their action and they will pay their own costs as well as being saddled with the costs of the other parties, if those can be recouped from them.  If they have a case then they win and they will get these funds or some compromise decision will be come to, but they will certainly be recouped their costs in which case the State will have to bear the costs of the Attorney-General. That is quite a proper procedure.</P>
    <P>What do we know about the action? What have we been told about the action?  Will any argument be brought forward here to-night as an attractive argument to entitle us to think that these people are entirely without cause of action?  So far as anything that has been said by the Taoiseach is concerned, when he speaks of frittered away funds, I think his use of the word "fritter" means that there has been imposed on these funds quite unnecessary expense.  If that is so, it is a partial judgment on his side that the plaintiffs have no cause of action.  We have established courts and independent judges to deal with that sort of matter, and why should we come in at this point to say that there is no cause of action, and that this matter should be dealt with in the way suggested in this measure?</P>
    <P>Even on the question of costs, I would like to get other calculations <Col N="2378" /> than those the Taoiseach has given us as to the amount of costs incurred so far, and not merely that, but I would like to have some idea of how these alleged costs are distributed between the parties.  The only costs we ought to be concerned with are the costs of the plaintiffs.  If they have no cause of action the position is clear, but if they have a cause of action we are depriving them by doing what we are asked to do here.  Do not let it be thought that the funds will be saved costs.</P>
    <P>The information I have may not be accurate, but my information is that there are two pleas on which the defendants&mdash;that is, the State in this case&mdash;rely.  The first is that the organisation was defunct prior to the date upon which the funds were lodged in court, and that was early in 1924.  That is the main plea, that the organisation was defunct, but it is well known, and nobody knows it better than the Taoiseach, that there were people parading themselves as heads of this organisation up to 1926 and the Taoiseach was one of them.  How can he stand over a plea, in a defence to the action, that the organisation was defunct in 1924, when it is on record that he was associated with it later? I think he claimed to be president of it up to some date in March or possibly late in July of 1926.</P>
    <P>The second plea on which I understand the State relies is that the present plaintiffs, who claim to be the successors of the Sinn Féin organisation, include amongst the means for obtaining their objective, means which may be unlawful.  That plea could be entered against a most innocent association: it is put no further than "may" or "might be".  First of all, it is pleaded that the organisation was defunct and, secondly, whether defunct or not, it may have to use unlawful means to achieve its objective.  I would not like to try to forecast the decision of a court on a plea couched in such terms, but these are the two chief pleas made against these people.</P>
    <P>When I look at the measure, if we do get it passed, I wonder will many people be pleased to read Section 13 in 1947?  Section 13 deals with the use of <Col N="2379" /> these particular funds if and when they get into the hands of the board.  It is rather a scandalous matter that in 1947 we should be calmly considering that there may be, 30 years after the event, people who are in needy circumstances and who can trace those needy circumstances to services they rendered between Easter Week in 1916 and the date of the Truce.  Apparently it is thought that there are some such people.  It is a very saddening reflection that there may be a group of people needy in their circumstances because of their general affiliation, so to speak, to what are called the Forces here.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, on an interruption, indicated his view that the odd £24,000 will not last long.  He believes that there are quite a number of people who, in 1947, are in needy circumstances arising out of help they gave from 1916 to 1921.  It is sad to think that there are.  I thought we had made provision in various pieces of legislation for people affected in that way.  If it is found there are numbers of needy people, this is scarcely the way to deal with them.  We should approach the matter in a much more generous way, a way entirely divorced from these funds.  I would have thought that we might see that any need arising out of those events would be dealt with in a better way by Acts of Parliament and not in this manner.</P>
    <P>I should imagine that the whole background, the whole atmosphere of the Sinn Féin movement, would be better fulfilled if something in the nature of cultural use were made of this money.  If there are needy people, coincident with what we do with those funds something should be done on a bigger scale than what is proposed with the £24,000.</P>
    <P>Finally, I do not know what reality there may be in this matter, but it is asserted in legal circles that there will be quite a number of important witnesses, including the Taoiseach himself, who would have to appear in court if this matter were threshed out, that the events round about 1916 and, indeed, from 1906 onwards, would have to be <Col N="2380" /> considered, and the matter of the life or death of this organisation would have to be considered by an independent judicial body.  I do not see why people would refuse to go near the courts or would not be anxious to make an appearance there to shed light on that particular historical matter.</P>
    <P>I cannot conceive the Taoiseach coming here and asking us to destroy an action when, as I am informed, the chief points in defence are the two I mentioned, including the peculiar one of unlawful means being used in achieving the objectives of this group who call themselves the Sinn Féin organisation. It is odd that the Taoiseach would stand on the plea as regards the organisation being defunct on a particular date.  Why should we enter upon this particular course of breaking in between litigants and the justice we have promised these people in open court?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the slightest doubt that there is something behind this Bill moved by the Taoiseach that he wants to cloak and cover up.  He tells us that in February, 1924, Sinn Féin was defunct, that that organisation went out of existence, and we find that a year afterwards he was an important individual in that organisation&mdash;as far back as 19th of March, 1925, he associated himself with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One wonders why the Taoiseach comes along now with this Bill.  The Taoiseach knows quite well that the Sinn Féin organisation is still in existence. Probably the reason why he says it is defunct is that he would like it to be so, as it does not happen to be so suitable to him to-day as it was in those days.  In this part of the House anyhow, we think that this Bill is nothing short of highway robbery.  These funds were collected by the Sinn Féin organisation for the use of that organisation and the passage of this Bill represents an invasion of the private rights of individuals and the private rights of an organisation.  We are doing something that some day may lead us very far in another direction.  There may be nothing to stop the Government later on bringing in a Bill to deprive any organisation <Col N="2381" /> or association of its finances, just by saying that it is defunct.  Everybody knows that is not the case with the Sinn Féin organisation.  It is defunct in the Taoiseach's mind, because it is not the use to him he thinks it should be, or that he expected it would be.  I join with him in one statement he made, namely, in that in which he said that the Sinn Féin organisation was the greatest organisation that ever represented our people. Perhaps the time may come when those of our people who still stand by Sinn Féin&mdash;although some of us may differ from them in one way or another&mdash; maybe the greatest and truest representatives of our people as was Sinn Féin of old.</P>
    <P>When again we come to consider the section of the Bill which makes reference to a period of 30 years ago and to the fact that some of our people who made sacrifices then and who are still alive, are needy, it is laughable to think that they were not in any way compensated up to now for the work which they did from 1916 up to 1921.  It is laughable, particularly, in view of the fact that Fianna Fáil always boasted of what they did for people who made sacrifices in that period.  It is laughable to think, that after such a long period, there are such needy people who require to be compensated in some way.  Surely if there are such people, this House and this country is big-hearted enough to help them if need be?  Of course it is only another cute move on the part of the Taoiseach, to present that side of the picture for the popularity it may bring him.  It will be said that these people got nothing in the past, but now they are going to have some provision made for them by the Taoiseach.  It will be a very popular move and probably will catch a lot of votes.</P>
    <P>We hear many statements to the effect that there should be no interference with the courts.  What is this but interfering with the courts?  This is a Bill that is actually interfering with the courts, belittling the judges, almost saying that lawyers and the people who administer the law are a crowd of robbers and that the danger is that if the matter is allowed to go <Col N="2382" /> into the courts, they will take all these funds.  I am sure that the people who represent Sinn Féin at present are able to make their case and they would not be so foolish as to institute proceedings but for the fact that they have a case.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Taoiseach is terribly worried when he realises that he himself will probably have to go before these courts.  If he does, I hope that he will not state that the Sinn Féin organisation became defunct in 1924, because we find him taking a very important part in it in March, 1925.  So far as we are concerned, we shall oppose this confiscation or attempted confiscation, because we believe it is nothing else.  We believe that it is belittling the courts and that, in short, it is nothing but highway robbery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not very much concerned with the issues which are involved in the cases which are at present before the courts but this House is now being asked to pass a Bill which is unique in character.  Not merely does it possess that distinction, but it is a most unusual approach to a problem which seems to be one not for this House at all but for the courts which were established to deal with issues of this kind.  Frankly, I am of opinion that it is a most unfair Bill. I think it is more the product of haste and bad temper than the product of statesmanship.  Here we have a situation, according to the Taoiseach, in which an action was instituted against the Attorney-General in 1942.  There was then a good deal of soft-pedalling until 1945.  In 1945 it looked as if the court machinery was beginning to move.  The Taoiseach complained that between 1942 and 1945 nothing was done in the matter of moving the legal machinery.  That annoyed him in respect of that period, and when we come to 1945, he got annoyed because the machinery was then going to move and because he said there would be interminable actions and motions before the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having got a close association with this whole business&mdash;probably the kind of association that is too close to escape being one of the important witnesses <Col N="2383" /> in the case&mdash;the Taoiseach felt that the best way to get over all these difficulties&mdash;both the slow-motion legal process and the quick-motion legal process&mdash;was to say that he was afraid of too much litigation which would fritter away these moneys.  The plea that this is a desire to avoid frittering away money leaves me cold, and I am sure it leaves most members of the House cold.  If the plaintiffs have any case&mdash;I do not know whether they have or not, and I do not care&mdash;they should be entitled to go to court and make their case.  If, well and good, they win the case, then they should get all that follows from that win.  If they lose their case, they should be made to pay the costs involved in bringing a case that had no substance whatever, but here is a case actually before the courts in respect of these funds and the Taoiseach's Government is involved inasmuch as the writ is served against the Attorney-General.  Not liking to see this money frittered away the Taoiseach steps in and says that the plaintiffs should be stopped in the courts and that judgment should be given for the Attorney-General instead of giving the courts an opportunity to try the issue, which was just the purpose for which we set up the courts and gave them a unique independence.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is worried that these moneys are being frittered away. Recently, we have had a racket between a Parliamentary Secretary and a political supporter of his, and nobody can complain that this House did not fritter away money in the way in which it paid the costs of these two people.  Because these people decided to have their case dealt with by means of a special tribunal, the country gets the privilege of frittering away some thousands of pounds in paying the legal expenses of these two gentlemen.  Within a month of our voting these people their legal costs, the Taoiseach comes here and expects people to get worried about the frittering away of money through legal processes.</P>
    <P>Every citizen in this country has a right to go to the courts if he feels he has a grievance.  He has a right to expect the court to hear the case and <Col N="2384" /> determine the merits.  As I say, I am not concerned with the issues involved in this case, but I am concerned with preserving the right of an individual or an organisation to go into open court and say: &ldquo;Here is my case and here are my arguments in support of it.  Let an independent body of people try the issues involved and pass judgment on the merits." I am opposed to this Bill because it is nothing short of tyranny in a Cabinet or a Government, whatever its political complexion, being given the right to decide by a Parliamentary majority when a case is a good case and when a case is a bad case.  That is not the function of a Government or a Cabinet.  When a Government gets to the stage that it usurps the powers which properly belong to the courts, that Government is degenerating into a tyranny.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has made a very bad blunder in attempting to impose upon Parliament the obligation to decide this issue.  This issue is clearly one which ought not to be decided by Parliament. This Parliament consists of politicians, of members of various political Parties.  A political Party has taken its case to the court&mdash;a political Party different from the other political Parties here.  Why should we, as members of political Parties, try the merits of this dispute?  If there is any body in the world which is not equipped to try the issues in this matter, it is this House because, as members of various Parties, we naturally tend to have different and varied interests.  But instead of allowing courts, skilled in weighing evidence and renowned for their impartiality, to decide an issue of this kind, the Taoiseach says: &ldquo;No; impartial courts are no use.  They are not satisfactory in cases of this kind. They fritter away money.  Instead, we will bring it into the highly contentious chamber of a politically-elected Parliament and ask that Parliament to decide whether in fact these disputed moneys belong to any political organisation or not."</P>
    <P>I have never accused the Taoiseach of any want of astuteness&mdash;my main complaint against him is that he has a superabundance of it&mdash;but, on an occasion like this, the Taoiseach has <Col N="2385" /> made a political move on which I do not think he can congratulate himself. I have no interest in the Sinn Féin organisation at all and I have no interest in some of their actions or their approach to problems; but I think they are entitled to a fair deal.  That organisation and everybody else who keeps the law is entitled to expect that the law courts of the country will pronounce judgment independently on the merits of any claim which they bring to the courts.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says that the money may be frittered away.  Next week, the Taoiseach may tell the teachers' organisation that financing a strike is frittering money away, too, and therefore want to protect the funds of the organisation from being frittered away by passing a Bill, with the assistance of a Parliamentary majority, preventing the organisation from doing what it has as much legal right to do as the Sinn Féin organisation has, namely, to act in accordance with the law and to expect that the law as it exists will be administered and will not be amended to suit the manipulations of anybody who wants, for the time being, to alter the law.  The employees of the Electricity Supply Board, or railwaymen, engaged in an industrial dispute, may be told that the Government does not like the industrial dispute, that it does not like the strike, that it considers it undesirable to have a strike, and that, if the strike is undesirable they are frittering money away in financing it and therefore will ask the Legislature here to pass a Bill preventing the trade union from doing what it has a legal right to do, namely, to finance a lawful strike, by telling the organisation which goes to the courts: "You can go there all right, but we will prevent the court from hearing your case." That is what we are doing under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The worst feature of the Bill is the way in which it is proposed to spend this money.  The approach could probably not be worse in a country such as this.  As Deputy McGilligan pointed out, in 1947, 26 years after the last date on which persons could have sustained the losses referred to by the Taoiseach as entitling him to make an application <Col N="2386" /> for assistance under the Bill, we may still have people in need, people who claim that, notwithstanding the losses they suffered and the hardships they endured then, the 26 following years have not sufficed to redeem them economically from the plight which was then visited upon them.  If we owe a debt to these people, if anybody, because of serving the national interest, because of his participation in the fight for freedom, suffered any loss, is not the honest and obvious thing to do to ascertain the number of people affected and to assess their claims for compensation in whatever realm we propose to compensate them and, having ascertained the extent of their need and the extent of their losses, come to the House and say that these people lost in the national struggle and ask the Legislature to pass a Bill designed to compensate them in any way in which we think compensation necessary or desirable?</P>
    <P>Is there any difficulty in doing that? Is not that the obvious and manly way of doing it?  Is it not the honest way? Instead, what is offered to these people?  They are being told now: "The State will give you nothing; the State can give you nothing.  The Legislature is too lazy to pass a Bill to set up a separate fund from which you can be compensated.  Instead, the Legislature will get its hands on the funds of the Sinn Féin organisation and set up a trust fund and you can then appeal, with your national background and national record, for financial assistance from these moneys which will be taken from the control of the courts and from any right by the Sinn Féin organisation to their possession." I do not know any better way of insulting the possible applicants for financial assistance than to say to them: "Notwithstanding all our foreign investments, notwithstanding the fact that the national income has gone up in the past seven years from £150,000,000 to £250,000,000, we still have nothing for you.  You will get nothing, no matter how needy you are.  We will pass no Bill for you and create no fund for you, but we will confiscate these funds at present in the possession of the courts and create a fund and let you get what you can out of it." At most, <Col N="2387" /> it is capable of giving 240 people £100 each and that is the end of it.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, the end of something more.  It is the end of any fair conception of the right of a citizen to have his case tried by the courts, and that is what I am concerned with.  It seems to me to be an especially undesirable course for the Government to embark upon.  If, after conferences with affected bodies, you cannot get them to do what you want, and if, in the long run, they go to the courts and that displeases you, you short-circuit them by coming to the Legislature and getting a Bill passed to deprive people of what is a constitutional right.  It would not surprise me if these folk could get the Supreme Court to declare the unconstitutionality of this Bill, and I hope the Supreme Court will do so if it is tested in that way, because the sooner the Government realises that they ought not to be able to ride rough-shod over the constitutional rights of citizens merely because they do not like the citizens or the actions on which they embark, the better for constitutional government in this country.</P>
    <P>I am completely unimpressed by the Taoiseach's case in favour of this Bill. I see no reason in the world why the Government should intervene in a matter of this kind.  Let the courts decide who owns the £24,000.  When the first 240 have got £100 each, that is the end of it.  I cannot understand why the Government insists on obtruding itself into the issue before the courts.  I am not impressed by the proposal to establish a trust fund endowed with this relatively insignificant sum of money to try to satisfy the demands that would be made on it by the many people who might qualify as eligible applicants for relief from the trust fund.  The Government might have let the courts decide the whole issue.  If the Taoiseach had come in with a Bill to say to the courts: "You will have to decide the issue in the next 12 months or we will find some machinery to decide it,&rdquo; I could understand that approach, to make the courts decide and to make those concerned have the issue decided, but to say to the courts specially created for determining such <Col N="2388" /> issues: "We will not let you decide it," seems to be a complete reversal of our normal legal process.</P>
    <P>I have no interest in the Sinn Féin organisation whatever, no interest in its policy, no interest in its methods. I do not think they make sense in 1947, but I am interested in seeing that every citizen and every organisation gets a fair hunt before the courts and that the machinery of the courts and the machinery of the Constitution will not be doctored for the purpose of preventing a litigant, whether it be an individual or an organisation, getting what he thinks are his rights under the law and under the Constitution.  This Bill leaves me cold.  I do not think it is the product of anything but haste and bad temper and it is because I believe it is the product of haste and bad temper and not of statesmanship that I do not propose to vote for it.</P>

      <P>In this matter I am entirely in agreement with the Deputies who have spoken.  I was frankly amazed when the Taoiseach put forward, as the one argument for this Bill, that the funds would be frittered away.  That is what the Taoiseach's speech could be reduced to.  I know that the ordinary citizen feels very little sympathy with the frittering away of money in litigation.  Personally, I know nothing whatsoever about Sinn Féin, have no interest in the organisation and, like the previous speaker, I have no sympathy or agreement with its aims.</P>

      <P>This matter must be judged distinct from the organisation or the money concerned. There is a trustee fund to which certain people claim they have a right. In the normal course the court decides whether the appellants have the right which they claim.  It is a very dangerous precedent and a very wrong action on the part of any legislative assembly to cut across the ordinary processes of the law.  We have set up courts in this country for the purpose of deciding these matters.</P>
      <P>As I see it, the one purpose of this Bill is to take the matter out of the hands of the courts and to decide it here; in other words, to usurp the functions of the courts which we have established, and which we, in this Assembly, profess to respect.  We back them up with all the force of law and eventually of the Garda, the Army, and so on.  The Taoiseach has put forward no clear reason why the ordinary course of the law should be interfered with.  I feel very strongly on this matter.  Our civic and national existence rests ultimately on the sanctity of the courts and the authority of the law and we are here, in this legislative Assembly, deliberately cutting across it.  That is the essence of what we are doing.  It is tantamount to saying to the courts: "Your processes are too long, too expensive and, in order to save this money, we will debate the matter in our Assembly and will come to a decision, the decision which is embodied in this Bill." We are doing very wrong.  If we were concerning ourselves to-day with trying to alter the law so that frittering of trustee funds would be made impossible or very difficult, we would be doing something of a constructive nature that, eventually would be to the benefit of this country, but in this Bill we are tearing down the very institutions which we of all people should wish upheld and strengthened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, in considering this matter we should leave out of account the money concerned and the association involved and what the decision of the <Col N="2390" /> courts may be.  We do not know whether the organisation would win or lose in the courts, but we are making certain that a matter pending before the courts will be decided in a certain way.  That, I think, as the Leader of the Labour Party said, is not statesmanship. It is not statesmanship, and it is not proper legislation either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, I would like to enter into this discussion, and I would hardly ask anybody's leave to do so.  It seems that it is the custom here lately that unless one was a member of Sinn Féin in some way or other one is not an Irishman and one is not entitled to raise his voice in this House.  I think, as an ordinary representative of the people of this country, that it is our duty to interfere here in debate and not to allow ourselves to be threatened by certain remarks that have been made here in regard to Deputy Dockrell.  I was never in the Sinn Féin movement, but I am just as good an Irishman as Deputy Hilliard, and I believe it is as good for a man to live in his country as to die for it.  That is my idea of an Irishman.  I was one of those who always had a great respect for the law and I object to this Bill on the ground that it is taking away the liberty of the individual, the God-given right which we enjoy under the Constitution under which he lives, and if people are foolish enough, to use the Taoiseach's words, to fritter away money in useless legislation or legal actions, that is their own work and that is their own business, and I do not think it ought to be the duty of any Government to interfere one way or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember a dispute which arose when this Parliament in this part of the country had been set up.  It was between the Irish Rifle Club and a club that was started in the Twenty-six Counties.  The case went to law and because of the fact that it still retained its original title, the court decided in favour of that particular club &mdash;the Irish Rifle Club, I think it was&mdash; because its members were domiciled at that particular time in the Twenty-six Counties.  There was no such a thing as introducing a Bill to prevent those people from claiming rights which <Col N="2391" /> they thought they possessed under the aricles of association which governed the rules of that club at that time, in such a manner as these Sinn Féin funds, which I thought had been disposed of years and years ago. It happens now that the people who carried on that movement lay claim to these funds as being the men who are entitled to them, as being the men who kept to the original organisation. Now I am not going to twit the Taoiseach or my friend, Deputy Hilliard, as to why they deserted from that organisation but what I am considering is if they held on to the organisation and observed its rules, even if they were only two&mdash;after all one or two good men are worth 1,000 men running here and there according as occasion demands and as it suits their interests.  But give me the man who, through weal or woe, sticks to one opinion whether he be in a minority or not, who faces the rifle and the revolver as I did in defence of the opinions I held then and still own.  I maintain that if those men were loyal to that organisation&mdash;I have disagreed with them but I have the greatest respect for any man who stands loyal to anyone he believes in though it may not be fashionable now&mdash;they are entitled to lay claim to anything to which they believe they have a right.</P>
    <P>I believe that these funds should go to that organisation, no matter how they may use them.  It is only a matter of £8,000, as far as I know.  With the interest accruing on that £8,000 it stands at the moment in the region of £24,000 and the Taoiseach proposes in this Bill to divide that measly sum between Óglaigh na hÉireann, the Irish Citizen Army, the Irish Republican Army, the Hibernian Rifles and others. I am surprised that the word "Hibernian" comes into it because, according to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, there are a lot of men here, and I am one of them, who were no good to anyone.  I think we were only a lot of traitors in those years! It is wonderful how history repeats itself.  But what can this £24,000 do amongst all those sections?  Another more pertinent question I would like to put to the Taoiseach who is <Col N="2392" /> going to set up a board, consisting of the Chief Justice and several other members is this: Who is going to pay the costs that will be entailed in the work of that board?  I am of the opinion that when this board is set up there will be thousands of applications coming in from people all over the country.  These applications will have to be filed.  It is not the Chief Justice who will do that, nor is it any member of the board.  There will be a staff of clerks there.  Who is going to pay the cost?  Will it come out of the £24,000 and, if so, what will be left for those people who are supposed to benefit? Again, the Taoiseach might state, in his reply, what is the total amount incurred by way of costs as between the members, the trustees of this branch and the Sinn Féin organisation? As far as I understand, Mr. Wyse Power and Mr. Duggan incurred certain costs, costs as between client and solicitor.</P>
    <P>The other party to the action have already incurred those costs.  We do not do things in the cheapest way here judging by the way national taxation has gone up, but I say honestly, looking at this question from a non-Party point of view and from the point of view of a man who respects the law, that every man should be entitled to go into the courts of this country and have his case settled.  That is the issue, the only issue, that is at stake here, so far as I am personally concerned. Like other speakers, I have no interest in the parties to this action. I held certain views during all those years and stood by them through thick and thin, as I do here to-day, but at the same time I am broadminded enough to recognise the fact that these men, after they have been loyal to this organisation, are entitled to these funds and on that score I am opposing this Bill.  But I oppose it above all for the reason that I do not believe in legislation of this kind.  Legislation of a restrictive nature has been introduced into this Dáil for the last few years and it has always been strongly opposed by the Parties occupying the benches on this side of the House and by public opinion.  But this is going a step further.  This is even worse than <Col N="2393" /> restrictive legislation.  This is a Bill to prevent a man from going to the courts at all, if those in power think that it would not be right for him to do so.  It is not their opinion which should count but the opinion of the people affected and I am honestly of that opinion.  I cannot understand how the Taoiseach and the members of his Executive came to agree to the introduction of this Bill at all, especially in view of the controversy that it is going to create all over the country.</P>
    <P>It is certainly not going to make for good fellowship or good feeling as between members of an organisation that stood solidly together in the olden days.  It is certainly not going to make for good fellowship or good feeling as between members of an organisation who stood solidly together in those far off days.  The Taoiseach himself, as I am well aware, used that organisation from '22 to '32 and it was very useful to him then.  It supported him through thick and thin and was the means of getting the Fianna Fáil Party into power in 1932 and again in 1933.  Seemingly it is now of no further use and the time has come when it must be prevented from making any further trouble.  This would seem to be a master stroke on the part of the Taoiseach.  An organisation is all very fine while it supports him.  When it ceases to support him then it must go.  It seems now that the Sinn Féin organisation must go through the medium of this Bill and any power of resistance which they might offer will be taken away from them.  I think this Bill is a bad Bill.  It is going to set up a very dangerous precedent inasmuch as it is a fundamental interference with the rights which every man has under the Constitution.</P>

      <P>This controversial period has become quite a nuisance in this House.  Quips fly across the floor when we are trying to legislate.  The <Col N="2394" /> business of this House is to legislate. The business of the court is to interpret that legislation.  It seems to me that this Bill is being introduced to usurp the functions of the court.</P>
      <P>I have no interest in or no knowledge of Sinn Féin or the Sinn Féin movement. The policy of my Party is good enough for me without interesting myself in another one.  I think the arguments put forward here to-day by the Opposition should be sufficient to induce the Taoiseach&mdash;it may perhaps sound fantastic&mdash;to withdraw this Bill. It would certainly be a precedent if he did withdraw it and I am sure he has no other intention than to have his steam-rolling majority crush it through both Houses.</P>
      <P>The court has not decided apparently that the Sinn Féin movement is defunct.  The Taoiseach and his Cabinet have decided that the movement is defunct and they propose under this Bill to appropriate the funds.  I think more time was spent by the Taoiseach in telling us how these funds were to be distributed than in offering us any real reason for the introduction of this particular measure.  I admired the speech of Deputy Coburn when he pointed out how ridiculous it would be to go to such trouble for the distribution of a sum of £20,000.  I think that was a very sensible approach.  Seemingly this is going to entail a lot of clerical work in its distribution and we have been led to believe the final sum will be in the region of £20,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a reflection on the Government's policy in their treatment of the men who suffered hardships back before 1921.  The list we have before us of the people who would be deserving of some assistance is also a reflection on the Government's policy on the treatment of the men who took part in the fight for our freedom.  I am of the opinion too that the introduction of this Bill is a reflection on our courts and on the legal profession.  The Opposition has not criticised the legal profession or the courts but I think the Taoiseach was not very wise in his phraseology when he alleged that part of the £24,000 was being frittered away.  We are bound to ask ourselves <Col N="2395" /> what is the meaning of the expression &ldquo;frittered away.&rdquo; Is it possible that these delays have been engincered so that more and bigger fees will be paid out of this £24,000?  I think if we adopted Deputy Norton's suggestion and made an order to the court that unless this case were decided within a certain time the House would take action that would meet the matter.  I do not think it is right to come in here and ask the representatives of the people here to proclaim by their acceptance of this Bill that Sinn Féin is now defunct and that the funds of that organisation should be appropriated by the State and distributed to certain people.  I think that is an audacious proposal and it is certainly one not worthy either of the Taoiseach or of his Cabinet.</P>
    <P>We shall naturally oppose this Bill. I wonder what views the members of the Taoiseach's own Party have on this matter.  I certainly am not satisfied with his explanation.  I came in here specially to hear him because I was not conversant with Sinn Féin or with its activities.  His statement was not at all satisfactory from my point of view. Having listened to the speeches of the Opposition I believe now that the functions of the court are being usurped. The court has not yet decided that the Sinn Féin organisation is defunct. Naturally I draw my own conclusions and I shall oppose the Bill.  It is a precedent.  The same line of action can and may be taken towards other organisations.  If the Taoiseach or the Government think that any particular trade union is engaged in what they consider to be a futile strike and frittering away the funds of its members they can then by the introduction of a Bill of this kind appropriate the funds of that trade union on the mere assertion that they were not being used properly or that they were being frittered away.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Taoiseach himself had, to put it mildly, a particular interest in Sinn Féin prior to 1926. It has also been alleged&mdash;and I am sure that the Taoiseach will deal with this in his reply&mdash;that he was a member of that organisation in <Col N="2396" /> the year 1926.  He has said himself&mdash; he will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that this organisation became defunct in 1924.</P>

      <P>In moving that the debate be adjourned, may I make a suggestion? The Taoiseach has had it indicated to him, from every part of the House, that every Party in the House is opposed to this Bill and opposed to interfering with the court.  I opposed this Bill technically when it was introduced on First Reading, and I oppose it now.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider, between now and the time when we will resume the discussion to-morrow, whether he will not withdraw the Bill and allow the action in the court to finish itself.  If the action in the court finishes itself, we might then be able to come to a conclusion that no court decision can ever decide what should be or <Col N="2397" /> what could be done with these funds, and then it might become a matter for discussion among the leaders of the different Parties what we would suggest by way of legislation for the disposal of these funds.</P>
      <P>I make that proposal to the Taoiseach so that he may consider it between now and to-morrow.  I ask him to realise that every Party in the House is against this measure and we might consider it our responsibility in relation to the institutions of the State to move, under Article 26 or Article 27 of the Constitution, in order to ensure that, even if this Bill is passed by a Party majority through the Oireachtas, to ask the President to consider his functions and responsibilities in relation to whether he should or should not sign this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Dáil do now adjourn.&rdquo; The House is aware that I received to-day notice from the Leader of the Opposition inviting me to make a statement on the present position regarding tillage.  I may assume that members of the House and of the general public need no words from me to bring home to them the gravity of the situation that confronts us all.  We have passed the middle of March and we find ourselves in the position that there is, roughly, somewhat in excess of 2,000,000 acres of land to be ploughed if we are to reach the tillage achievement of last year.  In any discussion that we have here.  I invite members of the House to apply themselves to what we can do, what the Government can do, how the public can assist, and how local authorities <Col N="2398" /> can co-operate, in bringing whatever encouragement and assistance it is possible to bring to the agricultural community, to the farmers and farm labourers, in tackling this problem, assuming that, with the help of God, the weather is now about to take up.</P>
      <P>There was no public discussion on this matter up to quite recently, and, in a way, I think the idea has been spread that I and the Department of Agriculture, and indeed the Government as a whole, have been neglectful in not treating this position more seriously. Having regard to the weather, to the fact that for the past two months the rain, frost, snow and sleet have been hitting the farmers and those who are working on the land, it would not, to my mind, be much encouragement to have all types of public discussion as to what the farmer could do when he finds himself in the circumstances I have outlined, circumstances of which everyone is aware.  In the Department we have been asking ourselves for weeks, in the event of the Almighty God deciding to give us better weather, what we could do, what forces we could release and organise, in order to come to his assistance immediately on the farmer being able to make a start.</P>
      <P>When I saw some of the suggestions and the criticisms that made their appearance during the past few days, I asked myself was it stupidity on our part that we could not see that there was lurking there a means by which we could come to the farmer's rescue and so enable him to give us the tillage acreage we require.  Recently, I met a number of representatives of county committees of agriculture; I also met a number of farmers; in fact, I met everybody who asked to see me and from whom I thought I could get advice&mdash;people whom I thought would have ideas different from my own as to the manner in which this huge problem might be tackled.</P>
      <P>I must confess that, as a result of these discussions with men actively engaged in agriculture, I have satisfied myself that it was not stupidity on our part, but that it was clearly a matter of having brought home forcibly to me the severity of the limitations imposed on us all in helping in this crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2399" /> Everyone knows that before you sow you must plough, and in order to plough you must have tractors, machinery, horses and the men to handle them.  In this country we have about 7,000 tractors equipped with all the attachments necessary to cultivate the land.  In addition, we have horses and the other agricultural implements that our farmers possess.  All these things would have enabled us to handle the tillage problem without any difficulty, but, as the country well knows, the tractors have been idle, the horses have had to remain in their stables and the men have also been idle.  We have now to ask ourselves what we can do, in the limited time at our disposal, in order that the fullest use may be made of the machinery and the men available to ensure a good harvest.</P>
    <P>In addition to those tractors which I have mentioned, there are also a number of industrial tractors.  I am not in a position to say exactly what that number is but some weeks ago instructions were issued to the outdoor staff &mdash;tillage inspectors and others in my Department&mdash;to go around and to make a census of these tractors, to see where they are, who owns them and the purposes for which they are being used and as well as that to find out to what extent they are suitable for tillage operations.  Some weeks ago we also made contact with the Department of Industry and Commerce and we asked them to see to it that kerosene and petrol would be ready at hand in the event of the weather conditions improving, so that there would be no hold-up whatever in this work.  We have also asked the tractor owners themselves to put themselves in possession of at least two weeks' supply so that there could be no possible danger of there being any tractors that would not be fully utilised.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are also aware, permits were issued to those tractor owners for the months of January, February and March which enabled them to get kerosene that could not be used by them in tractors at that time.  We have asked the Department of Industry and Commerce to validate these permits. They are also issuing permits for the <Col N="2400" /> month of April at once so that the farmers who are in possession of these machines will be able to get their kerosene not only for the present period but for the months in which they were not able to engage in the work for which these permits were intended.</P>
    <P>Complaints were made some time ago as to the attitude of Corás Iompair Éireann in the matter of the transport of agricultural machinery and parts. We have been in contact with that organisation and we have got from them an assurance that these implements and parts will in future get a high priority.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made to me that a number of private owners of tractors, people who had tractors for their own use and who might not have these tractors fully occupied, should be called upon to make these machines available to their neighbours and to ensure that they would have a much greater output of work than in the normal course they would be called upon to produce.  I must say that while I should like to find some means by which effect would be given to that suggestion I leave it to members of the House, if they can think of any way in which the owners of these machines could be induced voluntarily to take that course.  I should be very glad to hear of any suggestions in regard to that matter.  It seems to me that in this matter we must depend on appealing to those farmers who find themselves in that position, to co-operate to the fullest extent with their neighbours, to assist their neighbours, and, within reason, to make these tractors available for work in addition to that which they will be called on to perform on the owners' farms.  That is what we have been doing for some time past in relation to the tractor position.</P>
    <P>I cannot think of any other steps we could take in order to make the fullest use of the machinery that is in the country.  The way in which we have endeavoured to go about that task is to get into contact with the committees of agriculture.  We have asked the committees of agriculture to take up this work of locating machinery and co-ordinating all these efforts inside their <Col N="2401" /> area&mdash;co-ordinating all the efforts not only of their own staff and our outdoor staff but, as well, the staffs that are being released on the instructions of the Department of Local Government by county councils.</P>
    <P>We have asked the secretaries of county committees of agriculture and chief agricultural officers to make themselves responsible for the co-ordination of effort inside their areas so that those industrial tractors to which I have referred will be located, that the owners will be approached and invited to make the tractors available for work on the land.  We have asked them to find out where these tractors are most required and, having found out these things, to give effect to our general recommendations. We have also asked that organisation to make itself responsible for the compilation of a register of men who would be technically suited and who possess the technical knowledge that would enable them to drive and manipulate a tractor.  We have to be careful of that because many of the private owners who will be asked to hand over their machines for this all-important effort, will naturally want to feel that the men into whose hands they are being put will be men, so far as the supervisory organisation can determine it, to whom these machines can be safely entrusted.</P>
    <P>We have given some thought to the fact that even if we had a large number, which unfortunately we have not, of such industrial tractors, they would not be fitted with the necessary equipment to enable them to engage in the tillage drive.  We think, seeing that the number is so small and that the season is so advanced, that these tractors could be used by a farmer who might have his own tractor working ploughing while these could be used for sowing.  That is, I think, the only purpose to which this particular type of tractor can be applied.  I believe that there will be ample work to keep the limited number that will be found to be there fully engaged in other tillage operations, and to Deputies who would ask me how these tractors are to be used, since they are not fully equipped to engage in agricultural work, that is the only reply I can make.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2402" /> That is the general picture of the instructions we have issued to the secretaries and agricultural officers in the different counties and I want all the officials&mdash;our own officials who are engaged on outdoor work and county councils who have agreed to offer their services and to release their casual workers&mdash;to realise that it is the chief agricultural officer or secretary of the county committee of agriculture who should co-ordinate all the effort in the different counties, and it is to him that all these other officials should look for guidance and direction as to the way in which the work is to be done and as to the type of work to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested to me, too, that some effort should be made to organise local committees in the different towns and villages for the purpose of assisting in this drive.  I can only say that the time at our disposal is limited and the time it would take for these officials to go out and undertake that task would be fairly substantial. My advice to all these well-intentioned people and all those in the towns and cities, and especially in the towns and villages, who are anxious to co-operate in this desperate situation, is to form a small committee of their own and notify the chief agricultural officer or secretary of the county committee of what they have done, and that such committee should then proceed to an examination of the problems as they understand them in their own immediate locality and to set about trying to devise some means by which they can be of assistance to the people who will be engaged night and day in working on the land when weather permits.</P>
    <P>What can such a committee do?  What assistance can such committee give? The extent to which such a committee can offer assistance in the initial stages of this drive, in my view, is in organising in their town or village whatever transport may be available.  If a farmer wants to get a load of artificial manure or wants to get some seeds delivered over a distance of two, three, four, five or six miles, they would compile a list of such farmers, from whom they would receive requests as to their requirements and where these requirements were to be obtained, and would <Col N="2403" /> organise whatever transport was there so that these manures and seeds might be delivered to the farmer at his home and so to relieve him of the necessity of taking out his horse or tractor on a good day and setting off to the town for them.  That is one fairly important contribution which such a committee could make.  There may be other ways in which local committees, if brought into existence, could help, but it is for them, with their local knowledge, to discuss these matters.  If they can see something which I at the moment cannot see, they would be there to execute whatever plan they might decide upon as another step in the direction of bringing further help to the farmers.</P>
    <P>I am dealing now with the ploughing and sowing of the land and I am coming to the planting of the potato crop. In the ploughing of the land and sowing of the seed, of the wheat, oats, barley and beet, I cannot see to what considerable extent other than that to which I have referred, the manpower outside those employed in the industry could be brought to bear on the agricultural problem as it now exists. There might be, when we come to the planting of the potato crop, a further contribution which could be made through good organisation and the provision of the type of labour that was made available during the harvest period, but it would, as I said at the outset, be entirely inaccurate, in my view, to compare the harvest position with the position which exists now. Everyone here, and especially those who are associated with the land, will realise that if on a harvest day, ten, 15, 20 or 30 men present themselves with their hands in their pockets to a farmer in a field, during a good hour or two they can be of enormous value to him, but, faced with the present position, if a farmer is presented with ten, 15 or 20 men, there is very little use he can make of them.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the lengths to which we can go to assist him are confined to the points I have mentioned&mdash; so far as the local organisation is concerned, to see to it that it is not necessary for him to leave the field for the purpose of getting his seeds or manures, <Col N="2404" /> and in certain areas it might be possible to give him some help in the spreading of manures and the dropping of seed potatoes.</P>
    <P>If there are Deputies who have ideas other than, or in addition to those I have mentioned, I shall naturally be very anxious to hear them.  I invite, seeing that the weather, I hope, is going to take up, all these people, if they are anxious to take part, as, I am sure, everybody must be, in this campaign, not to wait but to organise their little committees and examine the farmers' problems with their own local knowledge and to bring whatever assistance they can to him within the next five or six weeks.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly there is a number of people in those cities and towns and villages who would be anxious to do everything in their power and who would be prepared to make a substantial sacrifice.  I have been wondering if such committees, since they cannot be called upon to the extent to which we would be glad to call upon them, if it were possible, would take it on themselves, as an indication of their appreciation of the dangers to which we are exposed, to hire or rent, say, ten, 12, 15, 20 or whatever number of acres the population of the particular locality would justify and to plant potatoes.</P>
    <P>While it might not make any great contribution to the amount of food we require, at least it could be regarded as a very useful gesture on their part if, in the locality, they could collect subscriptions from traders and people who are fairly well off, for the purpose of renting a certain amount of land, on which they could employ whatever surplus labour or free labour that is available.  That would be a very useful work especially in view of the fact that we cannot avail of the services that they would be very keen to offer to the farming community.  I am merely throwing that out as a suggestion to them. The planting of the potato crop is not the most urgent.  It is certainly not the least important.  There is ample time during which these committees, if brought into existence, could apply themselves to that task.  I say they <Col N="2405" /> could not direct their energies to a more useful type of work.</P>
    <P>When dealing with that matter, I should like to refer to another aspect of the case, that is, the attitude of certain people towards those plot-holders for whom local authorities, for the past number of years, have made land available for cultivation.  Long before the emergency in which we now find ourselves arose, I must confess that I was terribly disappointed because of the attitude of some of those people towards the efforts that were being made on their behalf by the local authorities.  I do not think the word &ldquo;disappointed&rdquo; accurately expresses my feeling in the matter.</P>
    <P>Members of this House are aware that for years past it has been the policy of local authorities to provide plots of ground for the unemployed at a nominal rent, that seeds, implements and spraying materials have been provided free of charge, that all the necessary instruction, co-operation and guidance that could be offered by the officials of my Department have been given to them freely.  When members of the House consider the figures for the past few years they will agree that the word &ldquo;disappointed&rdquo; is far too mild.  I do not understand the mentality that will refuse to take advantage of the facilities given through this scheme.  It is well that it should be brought home to those people who are unable to find work and who are being provided with an amount that, having regard to all other matters, is not very large, but which is being provided by the taxpaper and who are being asked to till a plot of ground that is provided for them on the conditions which I have mentioned, that they have displayed indifference as revealed by the figures I have before me.</P>
    <P>The number of allotments that were taken up by the unemployed in 1939 was 5,059; in 1940, 8,990; in 1941, 21,387; 1942, 23,512; 1943, 20,181; 1944, 18,028; 1945, 16,088; 1946, 13,855.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Each of these plots would be about one-eighth of an acre.  Plots <Col N="2406" /> are also provided for employed persons by local authorities but they are provided under different conditions.  The employed person has to pay for the plot and to provide out of his own resources the seeds, manures and equipment that are necessary.  The strange part is that the figures for that class show a contrary trend.  In 1939 the number of such plots tilled was 500; in 1940, 900; 1941, 9,208; 1942, 12,000; 1943, 12,196; 1944, 12,000; 1945, 12,150; 1946, 11,970&mdash; showing that in so far as this particular class was concerned, of persons who, I assume, had not very much time for the purpose of cultivating a plot, the figures have been consistently the same since 1942.</P>
      <P>I want to say to the unemployed, that I can quite understand that if a man is looking for work, there may be certain circumstances by which he might not be free to take a plot with any certainty that he will be able to work it, but that these figures are a great reflection on them.  Within the last two or three years I have met a number of these people.  I have asked them questions in regard to this matter.  I have tried to find out from them the reason for their failure.  I have asked them had they any appreciation of what they were expecting the farming community and the farm workers to do for them, did they think it fair to stand idly by and fritter away their time while these plots were there derelict, while they were looking to the farmers and to the workers to provide them and their families with food in the awful times through which we are passing?  I want to bring home to every one of those people that they are far indeed from discharging their responsibility to their families and that they have very little regard to the enormous task that is confronting every section of the community by this particular type of behaviour.  As far as I am personally concerned, if I could go further than that, I would be very glad to do so in order to ensure that they would display an entirely different type of attitude, not only for the purpose of relieving the rest of the community but of bringing home to them that they have responsibilities and that they must discharge them.</P>

      <P>I have given you that outline of this problem that we all see. I invited the members of the House, in my opening remarks, to apply themselves to this problem and the means which we have for dealing with it, and, within those limits, to give me whatever advice has occurred to their minds as to further steps that may be taken in order to help those on whom the major portion of this task must fall. The farmers are perfectly conscious of the enormous responsibility that weighs upon them at this moment.  The farmers have been searching the sky; they have been watching the heavens, and looking to Almighty God to send them a break in the weather to enable them to get on with the job.  Nobody knows the position better than the farmer.  To a great extent we are limited in coming to his assistance, and, to my mind, we are not going to help him, we are not going to please him, we are not going to do the whole community any good by in any way painting the picture that there has been any failure to appreciate the enormity of what confronts them.  I believe myself that the farmer is fully conscious of the dangers to which he and all of us are exposed by this terrible position.  I believe that he will work to the last and not only that, but his workers also will do everything in their power in order to meet this crisis in the few weeks that are at his disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say also that we must encourage him, we must encourage him in the direction of refusing to be guided by dates, dates that were important to him in the past.  We must encourage him to say: &ldquo;Well, the season has been bad, it was impossible to plough, it was impossible to sow, but this was the result of the Almighty's decision.&rdquo; If, when the weather takes up, the ploughing is late, and it is late for sowing wheat and planting our potatoes, we must encourage him to take a chance, to take a gamble, and to depend on Almighty God Who has put us in this position, to give us a summer which, if the seed is planted, even late, will correct that <Col N="2408" /> whole position and relieve us from the danger that threatens us.  Every member of this House, every member of a local authority, every individual, clergymen of all denominations, and all those whose voice and whose word and whose influence count should, as I say, encourage the farmer to carry on the planting season far beyond that which he would in the past regard as a safe mark.  I believe that he will look upon it and I believe he will be entitled to look upon it and I believe that we would all look upon it in this way: that the Almighty God Who has prevented us from getting on with this work will see to it that we will get the weather to ripen the crop if it is planted late and that we will have the ability and the energy to save it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>This country in the past has faced critical emergencies with faith and courage and determination. The gravity of our present position is without parallel and we want all three qualities to ensure that we can face up to that grave situation and deal with it effectively and efficiently.  The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations Organisation have informed the world that they anticipate a harvest in Europe below last year and that as regards the North American position, while the crop may be good, it is unlikely that there will be an increase in exports.  The gravity of our position is definitely influenced by the general world position.  Last year we grew 20,000 acres less of wheat because of the tendency towards the exhaustion of fertility here during the emergency. That reduction in acreage was brought about and it actually resulted in a reduction of 92,000 tons delivered to the stores.  We have at the moment representatives attending a cereal conference in London and they are asking for something like 300,000 tons to tide us over the present year.  The fact is that in the present year our supplies for July, August and September are still doubtful, so that we must be fully awake to the danger.  The Minister has outlined the position.  On this, the 19th day of March, in a normal year, the major part of all our cereals would be in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2409" /> The position to-day is that our tillage land is completely saturated with water. About 10 per cent. of our ploughing has been done&mdash;somewhere between 10 to 15 per cent.&mdash;and a small quantity of our winter wheat has been put in. The picture is extremely gloomy and the whole situation is fraught with grave danger.  It will require a tremendous national effort to make our future even moderately secure.</P>
    <P>We must, I think, thank the daily Press of our country for focussing public attention on the gravity of the present situation.  I think the House must appreciate too that Deputy General Mulcahy asked for an opportunity to have this matter fully discussed here.  There is one thing we must do.  We must at all costs avoid panic.  We must plan constructively and we must plan intelligently to grapple with this emergency in the most efficient and effective way.  There is this much consolation to be taken&mdash;one does not measure the seasons of the year by the clock.  Spring has not begun in this country at all yet.  Nature cannot be coerced.  If the farmer goes out to-day to his potato pit and examines it he will find that the seeds have not struck.  In a normal year they would be growing out through the pit.  That demonstrates quite clearly that this year nature has not yet begun to assert herself.  I am not particularly alarmed about the lateness of the season because there are extraordinary compensations in nature.</P>
    <P>Because of these extraordinary compensations I am convinced that with a sound faith in the mercy of God and despite all the hardships which we have suffered in recent weeks we shall achieve some compensation in the weeks to come.  We may have a vigorous germination and we may have a very vigorous growth.  That will make good our apparent losses at the present moment.  We would appear, in my opinion, to have lost faith in the goodness of God.</P>
    <P>Throwing our minds back to the harvest period last year and to the problems with which we were then beset, when there was danger that we might lose the entire harvest, surely we ought to have now confidence in the goodness <Col N="2410" /> of God's mercy for having brought us safely through those perilous days.  We overcame our difficulties then.  We shall overcome our difficulties again but we must do our job and we must do it well and efficiently.  There is no necessity to get panicky about this. We must have, as every farmer in this country has, a philosophical outlook. I said last week in this House that the farmer is an extraordinary optimist. Some Deputies may think that he is a pessimist.  As a matter of fact, to live on the land and to win something from nature, you must be endowed with a philosophical outlook and you must be an optimist all the time.  That is deeply ingrained in our farming community. For weeks past the farming community has been waiting very calmly and very patiently.  They are anxious but in their anxiety they are preparing their equipment and waiting calmly until the soil is fit.  They will not touch it until it is fit.  Then and not until then will they get on with the job.</P>
    <P>The Minister has quite rightly said that this is not a problem of man-power. Last harvest it was a problem of man-power.  To-day it is a problem of equipment and skilled labour and the use of the equipment available to us to its maximum capacity.  It is there that the Minister and his Department and the county committees can come in to organise and ensure that we use the equipment we have to its utmost limit.</P>
    <P>On the majority of farms where you have tractor equipment, there is only one tractor driver.  Now at the present time tractors cannot be used, and I think that the time should be utilised in training a second man everywhere to handle a tractor so that he can take over from the chief operator at any moment.  That can be done.  The Minister told us that we have 7,000 tractors. I made inquiries about that this evening in the Minister's Department and I was given the information immediately. I made inquiries first in the kerosene section of the Department of Industry and Commerce and I was told there that they could not give me the information.  I would have expected that the information would have been <Col N="2411" /> readily available from that particular section.</P>
    <P>We cannot be as casual about this as the Minister has been, because it is going to be a very long job.  Taking a figure of 650,000 acres of wheat, that is slightly over what we produced last year.  Ten to 15 per cent. has been ploughed&mdash;roughly, 75,000 acres&mdash;and is now under winter wheat.  That leaves us 500,000 acres to be ploughed and cultivated for wheat alone.  Now, the immediate problem is to get in the wheat crop.  The main potato crop is not a pressing problem and we have plenty of time to deal with that.</P>
    <P>We have 7,000 tractors.  We have 500 industrial, county, and Army tractors. That gives us 7,500 tractors.  They can be put into operation immediately but it is not enough to say that we shall operate them as long as possible. Every tractor in the country ought to be equipped now with lighting sets. There are motor cars lying idle with lighting equipment and that equipment could be turned over and used.  We must plan that the maximum number will operate up to 24 hours per day when the weather becomes suitable. Taking 7,000 tractors and night and day operations it is doubtful whether you will achieve five acres in the 24 hours for each tractor.  On that basis it would take three days to plough 100,000 acres.  Horse ploughs will plough one-third&mdash;a figure which I think myself is too high&mdash;and that gives us 33,000 acres.  In three days we will plough 133,000 acres.  On that basis it will take two and a half weeks to plough 500,000 acres for the wheat crop and we have then the cultivation and preparation of the seed bed.  I would prefer a smaller acreage properly done rather than a big acreage done in a haphazard way.</P>
    <P>The Minister spent quite a considerable time talking about plot holders. Plot holders&mdash;2,000 acres! Our problem is infinitely bigger than that.  We cannot waste time talking about plot holders.  We must concentrate on the big issue.  We must organise our equipment and the available man-power during the next few days to keep our <Col N="2412" /> machines going.  I do not agree with the Minister that industrial tractors cannot be used.</P>
    <P>The industrial tractors are almost identical and there is no essential difference between them and agricultural tractors.  Any tractor can be utilised for ploughing but you must remember that there are not enough ploughs to be harnessed to every tractor; at the same time, if there are not enough ploughs to be harnessed to every tractor, you can have the tractors going on with the cultivation&mdash;harrowing and so on.  I believe there are plenty of old cars in this country which, if they were yoked up now, would be quite capable of pulling an ordinary zig-zag harrow for the final cultivation of the seed bed.  These are the problems to which the local organisations must give their attention.  The Minister has quite rightly said that in order to ensure that both tractors and horses will be kept full time in the fields, the delivery of seeds and manures must be undertaken by people other than farmers so that all seeds and manures will reach the farmer from the centres of distribution in good time and the farmer need have no worry on that score.  He will place his order. All orders for seed wheat ought to be placed now, so that in districts where shortages occur they can be corrected on the books.  The farmers should be instructed to place their orders immediately.</P>
    <P>There may be some people so utterly selfish that they do not appreciate the duty they owe the community. There may be some people like those to whom the Minister referred, private owners who are not prepared to allow their tractors off their own land.  The situation is so critical and dangerous that that must not be permitted.  If there was an Army problem, the Army would take over and would not ask permission; they would immediately acquire any equipment they wanted. The situation is even more dangerous than that now and I do not hesitate to say that if the Minister wants compulsory powers in that connection, he must have them.  No tractor must he allowed to remain idle.  If the work on <Col N="2413" /> the farm of the individual who owns the tractor is completed, then the tractor must go elsewhere in order to help in this national work.</P>
    <P>Britain was compelled to do that during the emergency.  No tractor was allowed to remain idle.  All the equipment was kept going until the job was done.  There is this difference between the British agricultural community and ourselves.  We know the expansion of agriculture that was achieved in England. They delivered the goods because they had the organisation, the technical advice and the leadership essential for that tremendous drive. Our efforts never measured up to theirs because we had not a national organisation behind the farmers.  We relied on the individual effort of the farmer to produce the goods and he was not able to do it on his own.</P>
    <P>I suggested here some years ago that we should utilise our county committees of agriculture in the same way as the British utilised their county war agricultural committees.  Our county committees were futile, almost worthless, because they were not equipped with the power, the finance and the necessary equipment.  We are going to rely on that machinery now, machinery that was not fully equipped with the power necessary to secure maximum production during the emergency. Is it not a pity that those centres of organisation in each county were not utilised as they should have been to effect maximum production?</P>
    <P>This question of organisation is a local one.  You can use agricultural equipment only in a limited way in a district.  The problems are purely local.  If you are to ensure that you use equipment to its maximum capacity you must depend on local communities. I do not want a lot of people standing about or getting into motor cars to run round the country.  That is not necessary. We want the different districts to be conversant with the amount of equipment there that can be brought into operation and with the amount of old machinery that can be converted into useful agricultural implements. For instance, old cars were used during the emergency and they can be used again.  The Minister should <Col N="2414" /> appeal to every garage in the country and to any people who own strong old cars that could be utilised for the purpose of cultivating the land, for harrowing and other purposes.</P>
    <P>So far as the seed is concerned, the Minister should insist that before seed leaves the store it must be properly dressed.  I have a letter from a farmer in my Kildare constituency telling me that he received a communication from a Dublin seed merchant to the effect that he could not dress the seed because he had not sufficient current to operate the machine.  If there is not current available the machine could be operated by hand or by means of a petrol engine.  The merchants should ensure that the seed is dressed with a mercurial dressing.  If it is not properly dressed in the stores it may not be dressed at all and then we will have the inevitable fungoid and other diseases.  This humbug about electricity should not be offered as an excuse. The only thing we want from the urban centres is that the people there will co-operate in the delivery of seeds and manures and that they will ensure that the seeds are ready for sowing when they arrive on the farm.</P>
    <P>Another important thing is that tractor drivers and people familiar with farm machinery who have left the land &mdash; and there are some engaged in industrial work &mdash; should be released immediately for agricultural work.  Many such men skilled in the use of tractors and ploughs should be released immediately so that they can return to the land.  I do not want the Minister to think I am trying to make use of this critical situation.</P>
    <P>The Government would be extremely wise if they adjusted more favourably the price of wheat.  The Taoiseach will appreciate that Mr. Tom Williams, the British Minister, undertook for the British farming community that there would be a favourable adjustment in regard to wheat because of the losses sustained last harvest.  We can measure our losses here by the reduction in the amount of wheat delivered to the stores and mills &mdash; 92,000 tons.  That is what the agricultural community silently suffered last year through the <Col N="2415" /> bad harvest, and a favourable adjustment in prices now would have a tremendous psychological effect and would stimulate the agricultural community to maximum effort.</P>
    <P>There ought to be available from this onwards a meteorological report for the benefit of agriculturists.  The Minister indicated that there might be some chance of fine weather.  It is brightening up a bit.  We should have for the next few weeks a meteorological report so that the farmer can plan against whatever weather conditions are expected.</P>
    <P>On the question of the tillage quota, and especially the wheat quota, there are a number of farmers who feel that there ought to be an adjustment, but I am very reluctant to make any suggestion. I think we must stand over what has been prescribed.  Possibly later on in the season, if it is thought necessary to have a wheat adjustment in late districts and especially on land at a high altitude, where there might be danger of the crop not ripening, that matter might be considered.</P>
    <P>At present there is a target set and we ought to plan to go as near as possible to that target.  I feel that there is more equipment than is actually on paper, so far as the Department of Industry and Commerce is concerned, lying round the country that could be harnessed and brought into use.  Above all, the Minister must have an organisation in the country that is effective and that will ensure that every possible piece of equipment that is available will be utilised.  In this emergency, we are depending on leadership by the Minister. The Minister must give the lead to the country in this effort.  That leadership must permeate from the Minister down to the county committees and the county committees must give the lead in each county.  If the Minister will do his best, as I am sure he will, to build up the organisation that is necessary through the county committees of agriculture, I am sure that we can rely on the agricultural community to do their best in the emergency that is upon us.  The men on the land never hesitated to work long hours.  I am quite satisfied that the <Col N="2416" /> rural community are quite prepared to put in long hours now and to keep at the job consistently until that job is done.  All we want is faith in the goodness of God and courage to face the job, and I believe we shall succeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>We all realise the gravity of the situation which presents itself to agricultural Ireland at the moment.  We realise also that the Minister is not to blame for the emergency in which we find ourselves.  Anybody who would be inclined to blame the Minister for the problem that is now presented would be unjust.  As he stated in his opening remarks that he was hoping to hear from different sides of the House practical suggestions that might be put forward to deal with the present position, I should like to make a few suggestions.  All farmers are aware that tillage work is at least two months late.  We have now passed beyond the middle of March and there is not as much work done up to the present as would have been done at Christmas time in a normal year. I should like to put forward some suggestions which I had intended to make more than two weeks ago in connection with the motion which I put down in conjunction with Deputy Cogan.  That motion has not yet been discussed and I understand that I am quite in order in referring to it in the debate which is now taking place.  The motion is of such importance that I suggest the debate upon it should have taken place before now.  I shall deal with it in detail as I was prepared a week ago to put forward these suggestions if I had been given an opportunity.  This is the scheme which I suggested should be operated to cope with the tillage drive:</P>
      <P>(1)  Suspend meetings of the Dáil until 7th May so as to let rural Deputies co-operate with local authorities, tillage inspectors, fuel oil distributors, garage proprietors, etc., in their areas so as to speed up tillage operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Earmark all suitable equipment such as tractors held by county councils, road authorities, manufacturers, golf and race clubs and all such clubs likely to have such machinery, also <Col N="2417" /> such equipment held by Córas Iompair Éireann and private owners. Replacements to be supplied from the Department of Defence with all available lorries so that, as far as possible, no inconvenience is caused, particularly in transport, transport being so important to such tillage drive in the conveyance of machinery, manures, seeds, etc.  Military lorries to replace tractors for builders and, of course, no interruption in fuel transport.</P>
    <P>(3)  Local Garda to co-operate with Deputies, county committees of agriculture and tillage inspectors in making a check of suitable implements held by traders and hardware merchants engaged in the sale of such machinery with no interruption in deliveries of such implements already purchased and needed by farmers.</P>
    <P>(4)  Department of Agriculture to give authority to county committees of agriculture to purchase equipment, if not otherwise available, such as ploughs and harrows for use with tractors placed at their disposal by the aforementioned councils, clubs, etc.  Machinery so purchased to be resold after tillage drive, the Department to stand any financial loss in such purchase and sale.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be fair to ask the local ratepayers to contribute towards the cost of this campaign.  I suggest further:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(5)  Immediate release of men from the Defence Forces or any employment of any kind who are able to operate tractors for the period of tillage operations.</P>
    <P>(6)  All machinery to be hired to farmers and others engaged in tillage at a reasonable price to cover cost of work, wages, etc., and possibly part cost of machinery so acquired, so that the public will not have to meet all the cost of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Should the Minister desire, I can give him some information on this aspect of the scheme as I have experience of hiring for a number of years.</P>
    <P>(7)  Day and night shifts to be arranged with drivers with alternative shifts between drivers so that <Col N="2418" /> both drivers will have to do night shifts.</P>
    <P>Tractors will have to be kept at full pressure, working 24 hours on the job. I suggest that help should be provided for the drivers, particularly the drivers on the night shift.  If the local parish councils are organised they could arrange for such help so that somebody would be at hand to provide the driver, if necessary, with spare parts or oil. That can be easily arranged by the local committee.</P>
    <P>(8)  Full co-operation by oil distributing companies and arrangement with local garages to store oil in petrol tanks.</P>
    <P>(9)  Garage proprietors to give priority to repairs of tractors during tillage drive period.  Telephone priority to be made available to Deputies, tillage inspectors and garage proprietors, in business connected with the tillage drive, particularly business dealing with the allocation of petrol to seed and manure merchants to speed up deliveries.</P>
    <P>(10)  Córas Iompair Éireann and all haulage companies to give priority to delivery of agricultural machinery and parts.  Manufacturers and dealers to co-operate in like manner so as to eliminate any delay.</P>
    <P>(11)  Reorganisation of parish councils for labour to help in the sowing of potatoes, also to provide help for tractor drivers and night shifts and providing food, oil and spare parts, etc., during the night.</P>
    <P>(12)  Extension of repayment periods for men who got loans from the Agricultural Credit Corporation for the purchase of machinery for tillage purposes such as tractors, ploughs, etc.</P>
    <P>Last, but not least, there should be an increase in the bread, butter, tea and sugar rations, particularly for drivers and workers directly engaged in the agricultural programme.  That is of major importance, and I am sure that the Minister, in co-operation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, will be only too happy to deal with it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2419" /> As the Minister said, at the outset, the county committees are very responsible bodies and I am glad to say that they co-operated to the fullest during the harvest period.  I suggest that if all Deputies work in conjunction with the secretaries of the county committees and the tillage inspectors, a very useful organisation for the allocation of machinery to particular districts can be built up.  That is also very important.  Deputies from rural areas are conversant with the affairs in their own districts and can help to a very great extent in getting machinery properly placed and placed to the best advantage.  With regard to the hiring of machinery, let it be clearly and distinctly understood that the Department or the county committees are not placing machinery at the disposal of people for nothing, because many of us may be inclined to try to get something for nothing. For that reason, I suggest that a special hiring charge be fixed.  In ordinary circumstances, people would be quite satisfied to hire the machinery, and I see no reason why, when such machinery is placed at their disposal, they should not pay a reasonable hiring price, per acre or per day, in order to cover the cost of purchase, the cost of oil and of wages to drivers on night and day shifts, as well as the cost of delivery of oil.</P>
    <P>In connection with the provision of fuel oil, due to the scarcity of petrol for a long number of years, a number of garage pumps are to-day idle and where, formerly, two or three pumps were available at a garage, there is only one working to-day.  I suggest that the distributing companies fill all such tanks to capacity, so that tractor owners can fill up at the pumps, provided, of course, they have the necessary permits to purchase oil.  I suggest, further, that where tractors are provided, barrels should also be provided in order to ensure that a supply of oil will always be ready for the tractors. Furthermore, I suggest that, through the local committees, the people who have machinery on hire co-operate to the full in the delivery of oil to the farmers from the depots.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2420" /> In connection with the delivery of oil, I am inclined to think that there is something wrong.  I am afraid there is a certain amount of competition between two companies &mdash; and maybe more than two&mdash;operating to-day.  We see in the Press from time to time that certain areas and districts have been without a supply of oil for long periods, and I am inclined to think that what is responsible for that position is that competing companies tend to concentrate on particular localities, leaving other localities without supplies.  Let us hope that, in dealing with this situation, nothing of that sort will creep in.  The Minister and the Minister for Industry and Commerce should get in touch with the companies and see to it that there is no undue delay because of competition in that respect.</P>
    <P>I hope that every man will co-operate to the full in this tillage drive. This is not a time for Party politics. This is a matter of national importance. The Minister cannot be blamed by anybody.  I do not care what suggestions are made &mdash; the bad weather, the flooding, and so on, is the work of Providence, and we can only hope that, with the help of God, we will get good weather and the co-operation of all concerned in a decent, honest effort to save the nation's food supply.</P>

      <P>Is maith an rud an spriod náisiúntach ceart a bhreathnú in san Tí seo anocht.  It is a good thing to see this matter approached in such a national way. As representing one of the most fertile constituencies, a constituency which is the biggest producer of cereals in the country, the constituency of Meath and Westmeath, I may be permitted to say a few things on this matter.  The first thing I should like to say is that one tillage defaulter in County Meath is of more consequence to the nation in this crisis than 100 or 200 defaulters in Connemara, West Donegal, Kerry or West Cork.  These statistics which are thrown out to show that only so many defaulted &mdash; 3 or 4 per cent. &mdash; prove nothing.  If I own 500 acres of the richest land in Europe, in County Meath, and if I default, my crime is greater than that of all the tillage defaulters in Connemara.  There should <Col N="2421" /> be full co-operation by every side of the House, now that the crisis has been brought home to us, in making these men toe the line and do their duty and see that human beings live, instead of bullocks.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes referred to the county committees of agriculture, what they did and did not do and what similar bodies did in England.  I have read again and again the English agricultural journals and I have read the English Press.  The English committees of agriculture co-operated with the Government during the whole crisis and they fined and they confiscated for refusal to carry out tillage, and it was not fines of half a crown they imposed for such offences.  They were substantial fines, and if we have the spirit in which everybody will say: &ldquo;Hear, hear,&rdquo; to such action, we are going to achieve something.</P>
      <P>Deputy Heskin referred to the delivery of oil, t.v.o., kerosene and every fuel in connection with agricultural machinery.  This is not directly within the Minister's province, but I suggest that he and the Government look into the position minutely.  For the last fortnight, I have been told, with regard to the non-delivery of kerosene in North Meath and Westmeath, in the Oldcastle area, my own area, where the paraffin for December had not been delivered up to last night, that the lorries were engaged in delivering t.v.o.  Three tractor owners in my own vicinity up to Saturday night last had not received a pint of t.v.o. and, if that obtains also in Waterford, it must obtain all over the country and it should be looked into.  I was led to believe &mdash; I was in touch with the companies to-day &mdash; that every tractor was filled up with spirit and ready to go ahead.  From the knowledge I have, I do not believe that is a fact and the position in that regard should be looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Heskin also referred to the telephone service.  In the harvest drive, in the end of September and the first week of October, there was no cause for complaint of the telephone service.  Priority was given to calls in connection with the harvest.  Then we <Col N="2422" /> lapsed into the old come-day-go-a-day-God-send-Sunday system.  There should be a speeding-up of the telephone service in connection with the spring work.  We should not have to wait three-quarters of an hour to get a call to Mullingar, a distance of 13 miles.  If a service could be given last September whereby we could get a call in three to five minutes for a distance of 20 miles, it should be possible to have the same service now for the important business of sowing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes referred to plot holders and brushed them aside as being of no consequence.  They are of great consequence.  Everything counts in this campaign.  We know that the potato crop is the most vital crop after wheat.  In the recent crisis caused by the blizzard the village where I live was snowed up for a week and we were very glad to have potatoes and those who had plots during the war and who gave them up last year would be very glad to have them back again.  If we fail in growing sufficient wheat, if the elements are against us, if in spite of our best efforts we do not get the yield we expect, we should be able to fall back on the potato crop.</P>
    <P>Everyone who grows a rood or half a rood of potatoes is helping in the national effort.  Therefore, everything possible should be done by county committees of agriculture and the much abused parish councils.  If you take all the parish councils that operated successfully and calculate the amount of potatoes grown it represents no small factor in our food supply.  These parish councils should be got going again and they should encourage everybody who formally took plots to take them again and to grow potatoes and thus increase the amount of food in the national pool.</P>
    <P>There should be no qualms about doing Sunday work.  The tractors should plough Sunday and Monday.  I know that the industrious farmer, who is patriotic in outlook, will himself or through his men use the tractor Sunday and Monday but the man whom I referred to as trying to evade his responsibilities will stay at home and bless himself because it is the Sabbath day. The same man who will herd 1,000 <Col N="2423" /> cattle and herd 1,000 sheep will get suddenly religious in this crisis.  Such hypocrisy should not be allowed to exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>In the matter of encouraging the farmer to cultivate his land, the Minister has the support of this Party.  However, he knows that I come from a county where it is not necessary to encourage the farmer to cultivate his land, where it has been the practice for many years to cultivate the land and that the people there depend to a greater or lesser degree on the land.  I am sure the Minister's predecessor will tell him that there were no prosecutions for failure to comply with tillage regulations in County Mayo and the greater part of Connaught.  One would gather from Deputy Hughes and other Deputies that farming is a very complicated affair.  It is complicated because, as Deputy Kennedy, who has left the House, pointed out, the man with 500 acres who fails to comply with the regulations does more harm than the man with 50 acres or 30 acres who fails to comply.</P>
      <P>The 17th March has passed.  It is the belief in Connaught and in County Mayo that if you have not begun by the 17th of March you are facing a late spring and a late sowing.  That is why to-day the future does not appear very happy.  The rural population in Ireland is so sparse and the farms are so large that the farming community is faced with a dilemma in that they have not sufficient time to prepare. Given reasonably good weather in November, December, January and February, they would be able to deal with the situation but in an emergency such as this, when only three weeks are left, the wheat and corn may not be ripened in time to get the sun in the long days.  We are facing a crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can well understand Deputy Kennedy making the point that the failure of the farmer with 500 acres in the most fertile part of Ireland, Westmeath and the Midlands, is a national tragedy. He should be punished.  There would be no need for punishment, because there would be no failure, if that man <Col N="2424" /> had 50 acres instead of 500 and if there were ten farmers where there is only one.  Those ten would be able to face the situation with resolute determination and, given reasonably good weather, would succeed where the man with the 500 acres may fail owing to various causes such as shortage of oil, shortage of labour and machinery.  The man that counts in Ireland and the man that should count is the man with two horses and a plough, the man that can say to John Brown and to Pat Jones: &ldquo;We will co-operate; we will work your horse and my horse every second day, and we will seed 20 acres.&rdquo; That is the really valuable farmer. But, as to that, my colleague and I were sentenced a short time ago because we advocated that, because we know the importance of it and because we know that if the rural population were established in this country there would be no necessity for the Emergency Powers Orders, no necessity for large fines, no necessity for imprisonment for men failing in their duty. Unless God were absolutely unkind to us in the matter of weather, we would succeed in fulfilling our duty and in returning the necessary quota and more than the necessary quota.</P>
    <P>The Minister, coming from Cavan, knows the importance of the small farmer.  He is a small farmer himself I discovered that when he was made Minister a few weeks ago in the publication of his life story and the part he has played in agriculture.  One would know by the reasonable attitude with which he has faced the House, and the reasonable way in which he has put the case to the House, that he is a practical type of farmer and understands the difficulties.</P>
    <P>There is no use, of course, in pointing out now that mistakes have been made that cannot be righted at the moment.  All I want to say is that we wish the farmer with the 500 acres good luck and that we hope he will succeed in overcoming the crisis.  Let us hope that he will feed those who have not 500 acres and who if they had one-eighth of it would be able to meet the difficulties.  Let us give the 500-acre farmer every encouragement because we who have not got that land and who <Col N="2425" /> are dependent upon him to feed us, would be only doing ourselves harm and would be doing damage to the community if we did not encourage him and tell him that any assistance possible will be given.  If the Minister has any influence with his colleague in the Department of Lands, let him insist on getting as many as possible on the land with a reasonable holding of 50 acres and then when another war comes and a crisis arises there will be no need for emergencies, no need for fines, no need for the introduction of emergency laws to force the farmer to till his land.  You will have the right men there who will do it and who will produce the necessary food without assistance from anyone or any industrial organisation.  We are with the Minister and with every Deputy in this House so far as assistance to the farmer is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The country is now facing a national problem different from any we have faced in the past and one which will require the utmost co-operation, not merely on the part of the farmers and farm workers, but on the part of all those who are in a position to assist.  I think, for that reason, that the publicity recently given in the <i>Irish Independent</i> and other newspapers is welcome if it focuses attention on the serious situation and if it evokes from everyone the maximum possible effort.  While the situation is serious and while the season is now, taking normal seasons in comparison with the present into consideration, far advanced, nevertheless panic measures should not be adopted and no excitement should stampede either farmers or any others into precipitate action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say that while nature has been unkind this year and while the weather has so far prevented anything but a very small percentage of farm work being done, comparing other seasons and other years it is reasonable to expect that while, according to the calendar, we are now late with sowing and with tillage work, nature will compensate, and it would be unwise to take the ordinary calendar as a guide to the period within which either wheat or any other crops <Col N="2426" /> should be sown.  Nevertheless we ought to realise that every possible effort should be made to ensure that the maximum amount of work will be done immediately the weather improves.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I want briefly to urge on the Minister the necessity of securing, by compulsion if necessary, that all tractors other than those already on the land be made available and that, in addition, personnel skilled in the working of tractors be made available or encouraged to make themselves available to farmers in different localities.  It ought to be possible to secure from the Department of Industry and Commerce and from the particulars there a full account of the tractors available and I think, with the exception of any of those not registered for traction oil at the moment, it ought not be necessary to obtain a survey from officials from the county committees of agriculture. Full particulars surely are available to the Department of Industry and Commerce of those tractors used in industrial concerns or used for purposes other than agriculture and, for that reason, it should be possible to provide, if necessary, straight away, tractors in areas where they are not at present available.</P>
    <P>In saying that, I think that everyone in the country realises that there can be no objection, and no opposition should be supported to compulsory measures being operated in cases where people fail to make their tractors available. Every encouragement should be given to employees and to employers to provide themselves and their employees who are skilled in the work of these tractors with work in areas where there is either a shortage of labour or a shortage of tractors.</P>
    <P>Some people considered the harvest situation last year and compared it with the present spring work.  I think it is right to say that with certain minor similarities there is no comparison between spring work and harvest work.  The man-power problem was definitely present last harvest and many people unskilled in farm work rendered valuable assistance, and may in the future do so again.  At the present <Col N="2427" /> time unless a person is skilled in the management of a tractor or skilled in ordinary farm operations, ploughing or tillage work, or has knowledge of the ordinary farm operations necessary to sow either cereals or potato crops he would cause the farmer more annoyance than assistance and, for that reason, no encouragement should be given to those who wish to enlist the aid of unskilled volunteers for spring work.  The particular type of voluntary labour which could be of assistance and which should be made available are people who are traction-engine drivers or Army personnel who come from rural areas and who formerly had experience of agricultural work.  Every effort should be made to ensure that the maximum number of these people be made available either by releasing them from the Army or by requesting employers or the people themselves concerned to volunteer for the work.  I think it is a reasonable assumption that a tractor will plough five acres a day and that we have 7,000 or 8,000 tractors.  It is obvious that it will take a week to plough 200,000 acres and, at that rate, it will take anything from two and a half to three weeks to complete the 600,000 acres necessary to cultivate that land for wheat.  We will, in addition, have to cultivate land for potatoes and other cereal crops, and I would like the Minister to consider the possibilities that Deputy Hughes suggests to secure personnel who are in a position to work at night and work late in the evening to volunteer for that sort of work and to make available tractors and equipment.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to horses. It is obvious that a horse can do only a limited amount of work every day. Of course one horse may do slightly more or less than another, but the greatest problem at the moment is to utilise the tractors and all personnel available who are in a position to work tractors.  In dealing with that, I think anything that has been said here cannot impress sufficiently on the Minister or his Department the situation which has developed in certain parts of the country where at the present time <Col N="2428" /> there is a great shortage of kerosene and traction fuel oil.  Whoever is responsible, whether it is the oil distributing companies or not, it is essential the moment the weather clears, if work is to be undertaken at the maximum possible rate, that the deficiency be made up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's interest.  The only other comment I have to make is that the utmost co-operation is essential and that any encouragement that can be given by those in a position to do so will be given.  It would be unwise, however, if a large scale effort were made to mobilise unskilled labour.  Spring sowing and cultivation are entirely different from harvesting operations.  While many people unacquainted with the work rendered valuable assistance during the harvesting operations, I do not think it would be wise to avail of unskilled labour now.  All assistance that can be given to facilitate farmers in the transport of seeds, in the transport of manure and in the transport, if necessary, of machinery must be given and must be provided.  Anything which in any way tends to provoke <Col N="2429" /> panic amongst the farmers or farm workers would not be in the national interest.  We must first of all wait for the good weather.  We can pray and hope that that weather will come.  Until the weather does improve, unless we take these essential precautions, we will not be in a position when the weather takes up to engage in a full and proper utilisation of the available equipment and the available manpower in order to provide for our own needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to take up the time of the House.  Everybody who heard the Minister's statement tonight must agree that both the Minister and his Department are fully alive to the situation.  I would like to pay tribute to Deputy Heskin for his contribution to this debate.  I support his suggestion that the first step to take is to suspend the sittings of this House until May so that the rural Deputies can go home and see that the machinery which is available is properly used, and act as a spearhead for the work in every area.  I think that is the first essential.</P>
      <P>The Minister invited some comment about kerosene and t.v.o.  I came up here three weeks ago in connection with the shortage of petrol in Cork City.  I had another job of work to do in connection with the shortage of t.v.o. in Cork City.  My tractor at that time had been lying idle for five days. I was told by the Department of Industry and Commerce that it was the fault of the distributing companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I went to the distributing companies. I found that there was plenty of kerosene in Dublin &mdash; where nobody wanted it&mdash;and none in Cork.  When I had finished with them they were able to despatch a rail tanker to Cork that night.  Surely, if they were able to despatch it so quickly then, there was nothing to prevent them despatching it prior to that.  I was told there was plenty of kerosene in Dublin.  There <Col N="2430" /> was nothing to prevent them sending it to Cork five days earlier.  Quite definitely the distributing companies have fallen down on their job.</P>
    <P>I agree, too, with Deputy Heskin that there should be power to get the machinery.  When the machinery is available the farmers should be charged for it.  We want nothing free from anybody.  It would be thrown in our faces for the rest of our lives.  Let the machinery be organised and made available and let the farmers pay for it and any labour they get.  This is not the time to settle the price of wheat, or anything else.  That can be done when the harvest is over.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that something more than machinery is required.  Potatoes have to be seeded and manure has to be put in and spread for those potatoes.  That is work that can be done by unskilled labour.  I would suggest to the Minister that as many as possible of the Army personnel should be made available for that purpose, divided into units of four.  The farmer should be made aware that they are available, and the farmers can pay them for their labour.  I found that the Army were exceptionally good workers.  We have heard too many gibes at the farmer who would not boil a kettle of water for the volunteers who went out last harvest.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the experience is of other people in relation to machinery during the last harvest.  But I had one experience myself and it was quite enough for me.  I wanted a trailer for a tractor to enable me to get in one and a half times as much wheat again.  I went to two of the largest companies in Cork.  They had trailers and they were making any amount of noise about the help they were sending out, but they had no trailer to spare.  I suppose they were afraid some of the paint might get knocked off.</P>
    <P>When I failed there I went to the monopoly transport company in this State &mdash; Córas Iompair Eireann.  They would not give me a trailer.  They would give me a tractor and a trailer and a driver.  I wanted only a trailer. <Col N="2431" /> They would not give me a trailer by itself. They would not give me the trailer unless I took the tractor and they would not give me the tractor unless I took the man with it.  I did without them.  I do not know whether the same difficulty will crop up now in relation to machinery.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that in the case of the small holding of 45 to 50 acres the ploughman is also the man who spreads the manure and who goes around with a bucket and an apron afterwards and spreads the seed.  Now, that is somewhere where the ploughman could be kept going all the time provided he is told that help will be made available to him in the local military barracks so that he will have men for a couple of days to spread his manure and sow his seed.  That is work that he can very well do.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should make it clear to the farmer who is applying for the help that he has to pay that man his day's wages, that there is no question of free labour attaching to this job.  When all this is over, next harvest we will be presenting the Minister with the bill and we do not want to be told about the free labour we got.  The machinery used on the land should be charged for and the labour should be paid.  There was too much advantage taken of free labour, in some instances, during the last harvest drive.  It was given to men who did not deserve it.  There were some farmers who did not deserve it, but they were few and far between; all the same, there were a few there.  We heard a lot of yarns about men going out to help the farmers.  In one case they met the farmer and his wife and two sons driving out the boreen to attend the races.</P>
    <P>The situation is serious enough.  We are, roughly, two months late and we have to get three months' work into one.  The way to do that is by conserving our skilled labour.  Let the ploughmen be kept busy ploughing and let them not be taken off to draw out manure and spread it.  We must provide men to spread the manure for the <Col N="2432" /> farmer and to sow the potatoes and let others be kept closing the drills.</P>
    <P>When we look for kerosene we are told there is plenty in Dublin.  But there is none in Cork nor in other places where it is wanted.  The Minister should get in touch with the distributing companies and wake them up.  I gave them a wakening up some three weeks ago but they may have forgotten that.  A rough handling might do some of them a little good.  When the seed arrives in Dublin it should be sent to Cork and to various other depôts as quickly as possible.  We cannot afford to have any hold-up now.  The proper place for rural Deputies is in the country during the next few weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the position is very serious, but, as Deputy Hughes said, nature may bring things right.  As Deputy Corry says, we shall have to do three months' work in one and for that purpose we need organisation. The suggestion was made that all the parish committees that we had working during the emergency should be asked to co-operate.  Every individual in the country who can participate in the work of cultivating the land should do so.  As other Deputies have pointed out, there are many acres to be ploughed and we shall have to work night and day.</P>
      <P>What we chiefly require is a good supply of tractor drivers.  I have one man who is fit to drive a tractor, but he would not be able to work night and day.  We want squads of tractor drivers prepared to work in all parts of the country.  They might be placed at the disposal of the tillage inspectors and in that way all the tractors could be kept going.  Whoever has a tractor, when he has finished ploughing his own land, should allow it to be shifted where there is need for it in the locality.  Wherever there is a cultivator, it should not be allowed to remain idle.  There should be such organisation that these things will be kept going all the time.  The Minister should fix a charge for tractor ploughing because there will be some poor people squelched otherwise.  The man with the tractor might be inclined to go where he will get the best price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2433" /> There should be a fair price fixed for tractor ploughing, for disc harrowing and for cultivating.  If a farmer lends his plough, his cultivator or his disc harrow he should be allowed to charge for it.  I might lend my disc harrow or tractor or cultivator and it might not be used as carefully as I would use it.  There are numbers of people who give £70 or £80 or £100 for these machines and they might not be prepared to allow a man from the Army to use it.  He might run it out the gate when it might be eight inches too wide for the gate and it might leave half of its machinery behind. In such circumstances the farmer will think twice about lending this type of machinery.</P>
    <P>If a farmer's machine is broken, he should get compensation for it.  People think a lot about their machines.  They have put all their earnings into the purchase of them, they expect they will last half a lifetime, and they do not want them worn out too soon.  The Minister should fix a price for the use of this machinery right away.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes referred to the price of wheat.  I think the Minister would be well advised to increase the price and not, as Deputy Corry says, wait until next harvest.  Farmers got a hard knock over last winter's wheat.  They had no return because of bad weather conditions.  It is costing between £3 and £4 a barrel to import wheat.  The Minister would be well advised to give the farmer an increased price for wheat and it will help a lot.  We should not be afraid of costs now, because we are up against an emergency.  The same thing will happen as in the case of logs during the fuel emergency.  You would not have had an emergency if you fixed the price two or three months ago.</P>
    <P>Every man must be paid for what he does, and the farmers are getting a raw deal.  We saw the raw deal the farm labourers got over the bread.  It was only when it was dragged out of the Government that the men were allowed a good ration of bread, men who walk three or four miles to produce the raw material for the bread. Two or three of my men have to walk three miles to work and they told me <Col N="2434" /> that unless they were properly treated in the matter of rations they would not help in the sowing.  Provision must be made for rations of bread for the extra men the farmers will engage on the land.</P>
    <P>With proper co-operation we will get over this emergency.  The Government will have to assist in every way.  I was disappointed by the Minister's speech. He asked the farmers to co-operate, but they must be compensated if they do so.  It is not that we are looking for much out of the emergency&mdash;I do not want that spirit at all.  The farmers must be paid in a reasonable way. Deputy Corry says that could be fixed after the harvest, but I suggest that it should be done now, and in order to encourage men to do their best, the price should be increased right away. I voted against increasing the price of wheat in this House before as I thought it was not necessary to increase it, but I see now that the cost of production has increased enormously and the farmers got such a heart-break last year and the land is so run out, that they cannot exist unless an adequate return is given to them.  We on this side of the House are anxious to do everything we can to help because we know that the emergency is very serious.  I suggest that an extra ration of bread should be given to the farmers who will have to employ extra men.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I should like to mention in which the question of money is also involved. There are farmers who, within the next fortnight, will each have three and four store cattle fit to sell.  They were dependent on these cattle to provide the money to pay rates.  They do not want any charity from the Minister for Agriculture but they would like him to ask the Minister for Local Government to extend the time within which the rate collection must be closed to the middle of May or to the 1st of May at least.  That would help farmers who may not have sufficient money to buy seeds at present.  As I say, it is not asking for charity; it is merely asking an extension of the time for a month or six weeks.  Under present conditions, every rate collector must close his accounts <Col N="2435" /> on the 31st March.  At present there is a poor price for store cattle owing to the coal situation and the abnormal weather in England.  People reading the papers may think that cattle are fetching very high prices. Beef is making a very good price but the ordinary farmer who has a few store cattle to sell has to part with them at a price which is £3 or £4 less per head than he would get if there were a rail service.  It is only people who are compelled to sell who are selling under present conditions.  Although it may be out of order to say so in this debate, Córas Iompair Éireann are robbing them.  It is a terrible thing to say that it costs £2 per head to bring cattle from Ballinasloe to Navan, whereas it costs only 6/- per head on rail.</P>
    <P>What is chiefly needed is to organise a supply of tractors which is available and to have in every town a squad of men who are fit to drive tractors.  The owner of a tractor has usually only one man to drive it and if the tractor is to be kept working for 24 hours he must be enabled to get another driver.</P>
    <P>The Minister made some reference to plot-holders.  I do not wish to dwell on the matter at any great length. There was, no doubt, some good reason for giving plots only to unemployed, but our experience in Westmeath is that many of the unemployed will not work these plots and that it is only waste of time giving them plots.  Why not give plots to hard-working employed men, men who are working on the railways, for instance, who will go out and work these plots after their day's work? Plots should be provided on land the owners of which are not able to till it themselves.  There is a certain amount of land in Westmeath in the possession of people who have not the where-withal or who are not in a position to till it.  I know an auctioneer in Westmeath who has some land of that type on his books for letting for tillage.  It would cost as much as £2 per acre for tilling it and the people who own that land are not in a position to deal with it.  Such land should be earmarked to be given out in plots to railwaymen and others employed in towns.  We on this side of the House undertake to do <Col N="2436" /> everything to assist the Minister in this tillage drive.  We only want a fair crack of the whip.  We want a lead from the Minister and I am sure he will give it to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Government and Deputies of all Parties are fully alive to the very urgent importance of the matter before the House, the matter of ensuring that in the next few weeks the nation's food supply will be put into the land.  Three weeks ago Deputy Heskin and I put down the following motion:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That in view of the exceptionally backward condition of farm work due to the abnormal weather conditions and the grave danger that it will not be possible to get wheat and other essential crops sown at the proper time, Dáil Eireann is of opinion that the Government should take immediate and drastic steps to divert to agriculture, from other industries and occupations, additional labour and tractors, and that tractor equipment and fuel oil be made available in sufficient quantities for an intensive national tillage effort.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We repeatedly applied for Government time to have that motion debated but our application was turned down.  I should like the Minister to explain to the House why that application was turned down.  That motion is still on the Order Paper although the subject matter of the motion is being debated to-night.  I do not know what becomes of the motion now.  It will probably remain on the Order Paper until reached.  I hope that by the time it is reached, the emergency will be over. I hope that, if by any chance, the motion will not be reached until this time 12 months, there will not then be any need to discuss it.  I hope we shall never experience such a series of calamities as we have experienced during the past six or seven months in agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that many Deputies have stressed the fact that the situation is not hopeless.  There is a great danger facing the country but the situation is not absolutely lost.  It may be that, having regard to the kind of wintry weather we have being experiencing up <Col N="2437" /> to the present, some spring weather will come during the months of April and May and that all crops will eventually be sown in time.  But we cannot afford to be complacent.  I do not think that either the Minister or his admirers are complacent but in the difficult situation that faces us the Minister might have been more inspiring.  He might have been more eloquent.  He might have treated us to some Churchillian phrases but I think that nobody can doubt that the Minister is sincere in his realisation that the situation is dangerous and in his anxiety to take all possible measures to overcome the dangers that face us.</P>
    <P>I, without hesitation, enthusiastically endorse the 14 points that were put before the House by Deputy Heskin. Each point was carefully thought out over the past few weeks while we were expecting that our motion would be taken.  Each of these points is constructive and I am glad that many of these have been already supported by other Deputies.  It is particularly important, in the first place, that every tractor which is not engaged in agriculture should be diverted to agriculture, that an appeal should be made to owners of such tractors to utilise them for agricultural purposes and that, in the last resort, compulsory measures should be adopted if necessary.  In addition to existing tractors there is also the possibility of using large numbers of improvised tractors.</P>
    <P>Tractors made from converted motor lorries and converted cars of high power will all be useful, not perhaps for ploughing, but the cultivation of land.  In the early years of the war, I knew of a farmer who cultivated'a considerable amount of land with a motor hearse&mdash;I need not mention that the hearse was unoccupied&mdash;and the cultivation was done quite efficiently.  Any high-powered car or other vehicle is capable of drawing disc harrows and so on, provided it is geared for the purpose. That is one example of the improvisation which can be adopted, and it is the spirit of improvisation, the will to improvise, which has saved many nations in the past and which will save this nation in this emergency &mdash;the determination of all our people, <Col N="2438" /> no matter what their occupations, to lend a hand and to co-operate so far as possible.</P>
    <P>I am in entire agreement with the suggestion that local committees should be formed and that parish councils should be reorganised.  The people of each local area should be called upon to come together and see what they can do in their respective areas.  When the people of a parish come together, they can find out how many tractors are available in the parish and how many tractors or improvised tractors can be made available.</P>
    <P>They can also find out what amount of additional labour can be harnessed in that parish and, what is most important, what particular farmers in the parish are very backward, what farmers are experiencing extreme difficulty in overcoming the difficulties of the sowing operation.  We must remember that there are every kind and condition of people owning land.  There is the farm&mdash;not the very big farm to which Deputy Cafferky referred&mdash;of 30 to 60 acres, owned by aged people who are, by reason of physical incapacity, unable to grapple efficiently with their work.</P>
    <P>The local committee can help out these people and that is what we want &mdash;local organised effort and enthus iasm.  Let us not rely too much upon Departmental officials.  The officials of the Department of Agriculture have always been, and will always be, the wettest of wet blankets that can damp down local and national enthusiasm. Let us, instead, issue an appeal, first, to the clergy of all denominations in each parish.  This is a Christian country, and it is the Christian duty of all to co-operate.  Let us ask the clergy to call their people in and see what they can do in their own areas. There is an immense amount of work which local organised effort can undertake and carry to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>A number of statements were made here to the effect that unskilled manual labour is practically no use in regard to spring work.  I do not entirely accept that.  Skilled labour is the more important, but there is an immense <Col N="2439" /> amount of work which can be done, even in the spring time, by the unskilled worker.  Practically all the potatoes in this country are at present in pits in the fields.  They have not begun to grow, as some Deputies pointed out, owing to a change in the weather, but they have in a great many cases begun to decay, and one job which unskilled labour could do is to get these potatoes sorted out and see that none goes to waste.  In a rush time like this, there is often waste in the potato crop in hauling it together too quickly and carrying it away from the fields in order to get work done.  That is the first operation which unskilled labour can undertake.</P>
    <P>Then there is the planting of potatoes, in which unskilled labour can assist to a great extent, and there is also all the work in connection with the distribution and spreading of artificial and farmyard manures.  So far as artificial manure is spread by hand, it can be done with labour which is not very highly skilled and, so far as farmyard manure is concerned, its carting and filling can all be done by unskilled labour.  Then, in winter, there are weeds on land&mdash;scutch, and so on&mdash;which will show up and which have to be carried off, and here again unskilled labour can give very great assistance.</P>
    <P>Let us not despise any form of help that can be given in this emergency. Let us seek all the skilled labour we can get and all the mechanical aids we can get, but let us not despise the man who is willing to work and to help, but who has not a very high degree of skill.  Let us not despise the humble plotholder who can also give assistance sin a small way.  It is not alone the amount of food the plotholder will produce but the psychological effect of having everybody in the towns, outside the agricultural industry, helping which will be of immense value.</P>
    <P>There is one final point to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention. In view of the fact that, despite all our efforts, sowing will be late, particularly in regard to wheat and other cereal crops, a big effort should be made to <Col N="2440" /> secure all the nitrogenous manures the Minister and his officials can lay hands on.  If a little smuggling is necessary to get it into the country, it should be encouraged, because nothing would be more helpful to offset the lateness of the sowing of wheat than a dressing of nitrogenous manure in May or early June.  That is an urgent matter which should receive attention.  Another is that something should be done to provide increased rations for those engaged in farm work.  It is a difficult matter, but some effort should be made to ensure that the additional labour employed on the land will be provided for in the matter of bread, sugar and other necessaries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Minister and the Deputies of all other Parties in the appeal now being made to every able-bodied patriotic citizen to join the national army, the real national army, which must save the people from what appears to be the most disastrous period in the memory of anybody inside or outside this House Every one of us, when we read our letters every week, find that from time to time we are requested to support applications from citizens, men and women, for permits and passports to carry them to another country to which they are induced to go by the understanding that they will get higher rates of wages or better conditions than at home.  With a little knowledge of the conditions prevailing in the neighbouring nation, I want to warn these people&mdash;and some must have found out their mistake by now&mdash;that when they go over there, they will find that the conditions are not as good as they thought they were before going over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are induced to go by the temptation of higher wages and better conditions and they find themselves in a country where they may get higher wages but where they pay a much higher rate of income-tax and where food is rationed to a far greater extent than it is here.  I invite those of them who may read my words to regard it as their patriotic duty, in the delicate and difficult position of this country, to remain here for the present, to cancel their application for permits and passports <Col N="2441" /> and to give a helping hand to the farmers and others to produce the food and fuel that will be so urgently needed in the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>I also join with those Deputies and with the Minister&mdash;I am sure he shares their view&mdash;in asking that parish councils that worked so efficiently during the period of the last war should be reorganised, and at once.  I suggest that the parish priest and the parson of every parish in the country should be invited, without delay, to convene a meeting of their parishioners during the next week, if possible, for the purpose of reorganising those parish councils on a representative basis.  If that job is left to the local leader of the Fianna Fáil Party or the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party or the Clann na Talmhan Party it will be regarded with suspicion.  I say with great respect that the parish priest and the parson would be able to do that job better in existing circumstances than anybody else.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will make that appeal and, if he does appeal to the parish priest and the parson of each parish to convene such a meeting for the purpose mentioned, in the course of the next week or so, I am sure a really representative parish council can be formed composed of people who will do their job and help the people of the parish to go along the right lines.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fagan said the farmers must be paid for their work.  I do not want to repeat that in the case of the agricultural labourers but I am sure the Minister for Agriculture more than anybody else will realise that agricultural labourers who have to rely upon their labour to support themselves and their dependents, cannot live on fresh air. The farmer can last longer on fresh air and the food he produces in his own farm than the agricultural labourer who has to rely upon a weekly cash wage for the purpose of buying the necessary commodities from the local shopkeeper.</P>
    <P>I said here a week ago, speaking on the Vote on Account that, if necessary, this Government should subsidise the farmers for the purpose of providing <Col N="2442" /> decent rates of wages for the agricultural labourer, but I am not now making that a condition for the support that should be given by every able-bodied citizen in the present real emergency.</P>
    <P>I was amazed during the past few weeks to find appeals in letters from blacksmiths, and yesterday two blacksmiths residing in Laoighis-Offaly came to the city for the purpose of trying to persuade the Department of Industry and Commerce to provide coal or coke or whatever other fuel would be most useful to blacksmiths for the purpose of repairing agricultural machinery lying in blacksmiths' shops.</P>
    <P>That is not an isolated case.  I know of a number of such cases in my constituency during the past few months and I suggest to the Minister for Agriculture that he should have an immediate conversation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce or with the Departmental officials responsible, for the purpose of having these applications sanctioned and the necessary fuel allowances provided without any further delay so that the tractors, harrows and ploughs that are lying in their shops can be repaired.  The farmer cannot plough his land if his plough is lying in the blacksmith's shop and the blacksmith cannot carry out the necessary repairs unless he gets the fuel allowances.  I am sure that personal representations by the Minister to whoever is responsible in the Department of Industry and Commerce will result in the matter being rectified immediately.  The blacksmith should be placed number one on the priority list wherever such work has to be carried out, if the labourer and ploughman are to be put in a position to do their work.</P>
    <P>It is not an occasion for using a lot of words but, generally speaking, I feel that this Party, like every other Party and group in the House, feel bound, whether we like or dislike the Government or the policy of the Government, in a critical period of this kind, to say that we are behind the Government in every step they take for the purpose of providing our citizens with food and fuel during the next few years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P. Burke (County Dublin) Mr. P. Burke (County Dublin)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke (County Dublin)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very nice to hear the patriotic remarks of all Deputies and to have their co-operation in a very severe emergency. The practical way of dealing with the matter would be to ask the county committees of agriculture to increase their staff and to zone areas, to put a man in charge of each area, to co-ordinate the tractors in the area and to see that there would be fuel oil available so that no farmer would have his tractor idle for any time.  That can easily be done.  No matter what you may do by voluntary effort, the way to get the thing done in a practical fashion is by paying the man to do the job.  From my experience of county committees of agriculture and the officers of the Department of Agriculture I know that they are a very efficient body and that they do their job well when they get down to it.</P>
      <P>We have heard a good deal of discussion about voluntary effort.  At this particular period volunteers are out of the question unless the county secretary of agriculture could come into the picture here and could take a list of men in towns and cities who would be of some use to the farmer, and put them on a priority list and pay them when they go out to work.  The best way of recruiting would be through the county committee of agriculture in each county.</P>
      <P>There has been some disparagement of plotholders.  In this national drive there should be no disparagement of anyone who is able to do anything. Plotholders should be encouraged by every means possible.  If there are 50 or 60 parishes in each county and if each parish had only ten acres in plots it would mean at least 2,000 acres.  That can be easily carried out if the proper parish committee is elected in each area.  I have the honour and pleasure to belong to a parish council that had 20 acres in plots during the emergency, and have them still.  If the small parish that I am living in can do that, other parishes can do the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I have heard in the House to-night has been very encouraging. The Minister gave a very fine lead.  It is up to all parish committees and local committees throughout the country to <Col N="2444" /> co-operate in every way possible and to get the staff of the county committees of agriculture increased.  They are a very efficient body and if the staff is increased and if areas are zoned you will get somewhere.  You will know where a tractor is and you will know whether a farmer has oil for his tractor or not and in that way you will be able to help out.  The man that is in charge of the area will know that a particular farmer wants help and will be able to provide it, if the secretary of the county committee of agriculture has made a list of available men.  These men, of course, should be paid for their work.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is necessary that anybody who can supply a tractor owner with lights so that he could operate it at night should do so.  That has been done in my constituency and I should like to see more of it done. By a general spirit of co-operation we should be able to help.  During the last harvest the campaign was on a voluntary basis.  It was not to help any particular section of the community. It was to help the nation on the whole to save us from bread rationing that, unfortunately, we have to bear at the moment.</P>
    <P>Voluntary labour was looked for for one thing only and that was to save the nation as a whole and to save the food of the nation and, again, no praise can be too high for those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had many useful observations here to-day which I hope will help our people.  However, I was very dismayed to hear from a responsible Deputy on the far side of the House the statement that no man should have qualms of conscience about breaking the Sabbath and that he should break it consistently.  That statement should not come from a Catholic Parliament.  I deplore that statement.  The greatest curse of the country is breaking the Sabbath.  We have six working days and nights and we ought at least to give one day to God and I am satisfied that the cause of all the ills here and throughout the world is the breaking of the Sabbath and I hope that Deputy Kennedy will not make such an ignorant statement <Col N="2445" /> as that here again.  The job ahead is a big one and I am satisfied that it will be met and overcome not so much by the hand of man as by the hand of God: those who trust in God are never let down.</P>
      <P>My friend from Cork, Deputy Corry, made a very vigorous statement that the Dáil must close down immediately. I hope that the Dáil will be kept open all this time because the last person the farmer wants to see down the country is a T.D.  His job is here and keep him here.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kennedy spoke of Meath and Westmeath.  There was a huge amount of waste of good grain and wheat, particularly throughout Meath and Westmeath.  That should not have been the case.  It was not the fault of the big landowners but of the amount of work they had to do.  I am satisfied that there were hundreds and hundreds of acres of good wheat lost in many areas over the last few years because those men tried to cultivate 200 or 300 acres of tillage at a time when they were not able to do 50 acres.  It is the bounden duty of the Department of Agriculture and the State to step in and allot the extra division that a man has.  They should not be setting those vast areas of land to those people because they are not able to cope with it. In the British days&mdash;I was young then &mdash;I remember that they had auctions of all those big estates and they allotted five, six, seven and ten acres at a reasonable price to farmers who were able to work them, and I do not believe that there was a barrel of wheat lost. I know of barrels of wheat lost because our men were not able to reach it. That should not be allowed to happen. Any man with a large tract of land should not try to do what he is not able to do.  They had too much work on hands and they lost too much grain. I am satisfied that if the small farmer who had not enough work on his own land could have worked some of these extra acres we would have more wheat in our coffers to-day.  I am not against any man doing all he can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important item is the labour problem.  I would say to Deputy Davin and to those who have responsibility for labour to see that we have no <Col N="2446" /> lightning strikes.  There is no earthly reason for a lightning strike.  Our nation is in an emergency and our country is suffering deplorably.  I do not believe there is any reason in the world for a lightning strike.  We must save the people from starvation.  I believe the labourer will get a reasonable wage and that the farmer will pay him all he can&mdash;he will give anything to save the crop.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I want to talk about, and that is the dole.  Cut out the dole.  Let a man either work or starve.  We have too many of these men who want dole after dole.  At present there is work for every man in this country.  No man should be idle. Why should a man say: &ldquo;I have no work&rdquo;?  There is work for him and if he does not want it let him starve. Nobody but the sick and infirm should get State money at the moment.  The dole has been the curse of our country over the last ten to 15 years.  I would say this also to the committees of agriculture&mdash;see that the cottage plots throughout the country are tilled and fully tilled.  In four or five towns I have come across of late I am satisfied that 50 per cent. of the plots have not had a spade put in them.  These plots should not be left idle.  I implore the Minister to see that every effort is made to have these plots worked and well worked, because if they were worked as they should be there would be a good living for many of the people whose plots are idle to-day.  If the owners cannot work them they should be given to their nearest neighbour.</P>
    <P>I would not be hard in the case of a widow or infirm man but I have no excuse for a big hefty workman.  It is most important because it is disgusting and hateful for a farmer to look across and see an untilled patch at a cottage lying idle.  I think it is disgraceful &mdash; especially in County Meath where there is such good land. I want to see those cottiers sowing potatoes and cabbage and those things which are very essential for their own health and I think we would have a far more healthy rural population if those people would do more spade work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2447" /> I would appeal to the Minister also to see that there is a definite price fixed for tractors per day.  Let it be a fixed price so that we who employ the tractors can know what we have to pay and that we have a court to bring them to if we are overcharged. There is no need for panic.  The job will be done and it will be well done. If we do our duty and stop working on the Sabbath&mdash;even if it is a fine Sabbath&mdash;I am satisfied that God will reward us with a long summer and a good harvest.  Working on the Sabbath has brought a curse upon this country.  The present situation should make us realise that there is One above who rules.  I never want to hear again in this House statements made by Deputies that we must break the Sabbath and break it again and again and I hope that we shall never hear a statement of that kind made in this country again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put a few points before the Minister.  Even if the weather clears up in the morning, as I hope it will, it will still be rather late for the wheat crop and it is doubtful if we will succeed in getting the necessary acreage sown.  There is a long time yet for the potato crop and I hope that a tremendous effort will be made to increase as far as possible the acreage under potatoes so that any deficiency in wheat can be made up for in that direction.  These two crops go hand in hand.</P>
      <P>No man can accuse the Minister of not doing his duty and he has told the House to-night that the farmers fully realise their responsibilities.  I was profoundly glad to hear him make that statement.</P>
      <P>I would like if something could be done to make artificial manures available for the grass lands.  The grass lands have deteriorated particularly in the past few years and during our recent harsh winter weather.  The result is that the yield of butter and milk will be very low.  They are also essential foods and I think a certain amount of artificial manures should be made available, particularly in the dairying districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2448" /> Deputy Davin referred to the coal for blacksmiths.  That is an important matter and in my part of the country they complain that they cannot even get a limited quantity for shoeing horses.  I am sure the Minister will look into that.</P>
    <P>I was very much impressed with Deputy Kennedy's statement that one defaulter in Meath contributes more to the subsequent loss suffered than any other defaulter in the country.  Deputy Kennedy was quite right in that statement. In Meath there is a lot of rich land capable of producing an enormous crop.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the future there will be greater co-operation between the Department of Lands and the Department of Agriculture.  I think such co-operation is vitally essential.  If there were closer co-operation between the two Departments, the tillage position would not be so serious now.  The Department of Agriculture should urge on the Land Commission to settle more families on the land.  With more people on the land, the necessity for compulsory tillage will not be so grave because the more people you have on the land the greater the food production.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say that down in my part of the country, in North Galway, there are some tractors there which are used only for threshing. The farms are so small there is hardly any ploughing.  Those tractors are idle at the present time and it might be possible for the Minister to make arrangements to have them availed of in other parts of the country.  It is a pity they should be left idle in this grave emergency, and I am sure the people would be only too glad to give their services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the time is so short I shall not be able to make all the points I wished to make.  One very important aspect of this whole matter &mdash;and it is perhaps the root of the whole problem&mdash;is that we are told here we must get at least 650,000 acres of wheat sown.  I want to get an assurance from the Minister now in regard to this.  That is our target.  I <Col N="2449" /> do not think I would be wrong in saying that at the present moment there cannot be more than roughly 50,000 acres of winter wheat.  That means that we have a deficiency of 600,000 acres of spring wheat to meet. I am afraid that we have nothing like sufficient seed&mdash;good quality spring seed&mdash;in this country to sow 600,000 acres.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the variety is concerned, 90 per cent. of it will be practically of the one variety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I am glad to accept the Minister's assurance. So far as the later varieties of spring wheat are concerned, the quantity available is very small.  It does not give a good yield.  My mind has been relieved by the Minister's assurance and I must admit I am pleasantly surprised to know that we have that immense quantity of good spring seed available to grow 600,000 acres, if we can get that much cultivated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to support those who made the point&mdash;and I have some little experience in this matter&mdash;that one of the best pieces of practical help you can give to the farmer is to have his seed and manures available at his door. The county committees of agriculture can do very little as they are presently constituted.  The seed merchants with the co-operation of Córas Iompair Éireann can do an immense amount. The seed merchants know every farmer in their locality and they know almost to a stone the seed wheat that he requires and the amount of manure and fertiliser available.  I think the Minister should get his officials to get in touch with the various seed merchants and I know that he will find them only <Col N="2450" /> too willing to give very valuable assistance in that way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes made the point that it is absolutely essential to have seed wheat dressed.  I entirely agree with that.  Unless there is immediate contact now between the seed assemblers, the seed distributors, the county committees of agriculture and the farmers, the farmers will be held up in their work when they are ready to sow, because the seed will not be ready and available for them.  As somebody said, we shall have to do three months' work in one month.</P>
    <P>Many of the seed distributors have not the storage capacity in which to store sufficient seed to put out in a month what should be put out in two or three months.  This is a very important point.  So far as the great bulk of the seed wheat is concerned, it is drawn from a central area in this country, but we depend on Córas Iompair Eireann by rail and road to convey that seed wheat from where it is assembled and treated to the various merchants in the towns and villages and at the cross-roads and if Córas Iompair Éireann falls down on this job it ought to be called to reckoning.  Transport will be one of the most vital of our links and I am afraid it will be the weakest link in this chain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased with the way in which this debate has been conducted.  Deputy Heskin suggested that the Dáil should adjourn until 7th May.  I think that suggestion was supported by Deputy Corry, but Deputy Giles seemed to think otherwise.  I was afraid that something might be said in the course of the debate that, instead of assisting us in this crisis, might do harm, and it was a great pleasure to me to find that every word spoken in the debate was entirely appropriate and helpful to the position in which we find ourselves.  I was glad also to note that the lines upon which we in the Department have been acting met with general approval.  I listened carefully to every speaker and, with the exception of a few minor points, I think our activities and the survey I gave here of the directions in which the <Col N="2451" /> officials in my Department have been moving for some weeks, seem to have met with the approval of Deputies.</P>
      <P>As I said at the opening of the debate, maybe I do not understand the farmer's mind, but I felt that to talk about various things at a time when the weather conditions were such that he could only look out on his holding, would prove a source of irritation to him rather than a source of encouragement. I imagine, however, that it will prove of enormous benefit to the farmer, when he starts his work of cultivation and when weather conditions improve, to realise that public enthusiasm has been aroused and, even though you cannot call in man-power, as has been admitted here, to assist him, the fact remains that behind his every effort is a volume of goodwill that will be of enormous value to him in surmounting his difficulties.</P>
      <P>I was very pleased with the words of encouragement spoken to the farmers by Deputy Hughes.  He expressed my thoughts exactly, and that line was supported by other Deputies.  Like Deputy Giles, who followed on the same lines, I have a belief that if the Almighty intervenes in making it impossible for work to be undertaken at a particular time, He will, late and all as it may appear to be, and hopeless as the position may seem, alter the position.  I have sufficient confidence in the Almighty to believe that.  That is, as Deputy Hughes said, if we have courage&mdash;I believe we have&mdash;and if we show that courage by taking advantage of every fine hour and every fine day when these come along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a grand thing to observe that, however much we may differ in debates across the floor of this House as to the manner in which this important section of the community is being treated in the matter of prices and otherwise, we can meet and discuss this crisis in the way in which we have done it, forgetting all the bitter debates, if I may so call them, and displaying a magnificent degree of co-operation such as has been shown here to-day.  Those of us who come from the land, who belong <Col N="2452" /> to the land, who have our roots in it and who understand the responsibilities associated with ownership of land in a time like this; those of us who know the history of our farmers, the history of our fathers, and the struggle they had in the past, in times that were more difficult and more dangerous than these, would certainly feel it very much if on this occasion we in this Assembly failed to discharge our responsibilities to other sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the farmers in this country are fully alive to their duties. Not only that, but I believe, too, that their workers, who have been on the pay-roll all those weeks and who understand fully how impossible it was to make any contribution commensurate with the amounts they received in wages from the farmers, will appreciate all these factors when the good days come and that they will not spare themselves in order that the job will be done properly.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Hughes that in spite of what might be said to the contrary, there is safety in the fact that there is no sign of growth yet, late and all as it is now.  I saw oats sown on the 5th May and I saw the crop harvested and it was the best yield one would want when sowing at any time or in any circumstances.  I should like to remind Deputy Donnellan that those who make that approach now will be quite safe in regarding practically the whole of the next month&mdash;in fact, the whole of next month&mdash;as a safe period in which to sow wheat.  We must set a good example and offer words of encouragement to the farmers; we must even encourage them to gamble in the sowing of the seed, because of the importance of this problem and because of the disaster that would result if landowners were to fail in this task.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might refer to a few points which were not included in my original survey.  We have, as I stated, made a survey of the industrial tractors position.  It is not, from the point of view of numbers, as I thought I had conveyed, by any means <Col N="2453" /> encouraging.  I have in mind the type of tractor owner to whom Deputy Donnellan refers.  There are such owners in my own county, where the conditions are not very much different from those in that part of County Galway from which the Deputy comes.  I have, too, met representatives of the county committee of agriculture in Meath.  They were very quickly off the mark and they reminded me that such tractors were likely to be found in my own county and that they were getting after these.</P>
      <P>It was also suggested that there should be some board or other organisation to deal with this matter. Deputies will remember that I indicated in my opening statement that I was placing on the shoulders of the secretary of the county committee of agriculture or of the C.A.O., as the case may be, the responsibility for co-ordinating the activities of the officials of my own Department and of the inspectors in the different counties, as well as those of whatever officials are being made available through the county councils.  I take it that these outdoor officials of mine will have areas to look after and the secretary of the county committee or the C.A.O., as the case may be, will be able to see to what extent it will be necessary to interfere with those areas and divide them up still further, so far as he may be enabled to do so by reason of having other people put under his control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion was made that every tractor owner should be asked to train additional drivers.  I know some of them and I believe that tractor owners are already doing that.  They may not be all doing it, but certainly those of them who intend working for hire will see to it that the tractor is kept going full blast.  I know also that a number of tractor owners are endeavouring to equip their machines with lighting sets.  We, for some time, through our tillage inspectors, have been advising and encouraging them to do so.  We shall not only give them advice and encouragement but we propose to give whatever further assistance we can in order that they may have their <Col N="2454" /> machines equipped with lighting sets. Anything that we can do in that direction will be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister ask every garage owner in the country to make available any sort of lighting equipment he has for tractors employed in this work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall consider that. As I said, we have asked tractor owners to do their best to equip the tractors with lighting sets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Some mention was made of complaints as to the availability of oil.  Complaints have also been made as to the way in which blacksmiths are being treated in regard to coal supplies.  Strange to say, we have got no complaints under the latter heading.  I think we did get a letter to-day from a blacksmith complaining about coal allocation.  If such complaints come to the notice of Deputies, I would ask them to make us aware of them as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no responsibility for that.  The blacksmith generally knows the point of view of my Department on this matter.  It has been the custom for blacksmiths in the past to write to us when they find themselves in difficulties.  I should be surprised if they were suddenly to decide to ignore us because we have given them an enormous amount of assistance in the past in regard to this matter.  If there are any such difficulties, I would invite Deputies and blacksmiths to let us know how they are faring and we shall come to their assistance with the greatest possible speed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

If such cases do exist, then let us have the particulars and we shall follow out the matter to the end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I was invited by, I think, Deputy Heskin, Deputy Giles and others, to fix a price for tractor work.  I have given some consideration to that matter.  I have turned over in my mind, not so much the practicability of fixing a price as the practicability of enforcing it, and, if it seemed to be impracticable, the advisability of making any Order.  I do not know what other Deputies may think about this matter but having turned it over in my mind and having asked some other people what they thought about it&mdash;I know the dangers that exist and the temptations there are when farmers hire these tractors&mdash;I should not like to make an Order unless there is a reasonable chance of our being able to enforce it.  So far, I have not been able to get any evidence that would lead to the conclusion that it could be enforced.  It would be a very desirable thing to do but I am inclined to think that since it would not be possible to enforce such an Order it might be unwise to make it. I am prepared, however, to give the matter further consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The desirability of increasing the rations of rural workers has been mentioned, and the accusation has been made by Deputy Fagan that the additional allowance of bread to farm workers who have to travel a certain distance was dragged out of the Government. That is an unfair kind of statement to make, because it is not true.  Not only are there administrative <Col N="2456" /> difficulties, as one of the Deputies who advised this course seemed to realise, but, in all this matter of increasing rations, there is also the consideration that the commodity must be there before the ration can be increased.  If bread and flour were available in unlimited quantities, there would be no necessity at all for a rationing scheme.</P>
    <P>For some time back, before it was found possible to give this increased ration to certain types of workers, I was very interested in the problem and had been urging this course, but, at the same time, I, speaking on behalf of the rural workers, was not being refused because somebody in the Department of Industry and Commerce, from the Minister down, was anxious to refuse or to deny the fullest co-operation.  There were all these administrative difficulties, and not only were there administrative difficulties but there was the other difficulty of having a sufficient quantity available to enable the ration to be increased. It is all very well to make these suggestions, but it is not fair to follow them with the accusation that there was any dragging of such a concession for such an important group of workers from the Department responsible for dealing with the difficult task.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes asked me to consider the possibility of having a forecast of weather conditions for farmers, so that they could plan ahead.  I am afraid that the forecasts I have listened to for the past five or six weeks would not encourage me to become too enthusiastic about that as a contribution to a solution of the farmers' difficulties, but possibly they will be more reliable in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There was not very much variety in the weather for the past five or six weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There certainly was not. I think it was Deputy Hughes who commented upon the unimportance of the plotholder question to which I referred at some length.  It seems as if a number of other Deputies did not share his point of view.  I agree with the Deputy who emphasised the psychological importance of the cultivation of these plots.  There is nothing more <Col N="2457" /> vexatious to a farmer or farm worker than to think he has to put in this effort for people who will not take the opportunities provided for them to help themselves.  He does not mind putting this effort into the provision of food for people who are otherwise engaged, but he certainly resents having to put in all this effort to provide food for people who are being supplied with free land, free seed, free equipment and free advice and being paid a certain sum of money because they unfortunately find themselves unemployed and who will not use their hands and these opportunities which are being thrown at their feet in order to relieve the farmer of having them included amongst those for whom he must make provision.  I agree with Deputy Hughes that from the point of view of the area involved it is not an important matter, but it has, as other Deputies have pointed out, a psychological effect on the farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not an immediate problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>They should be getting at it now and should be taking up their plots.  While the ultimate total result of the effort might not mean a very substantial contribution to our food requirements, there is the fact that our farmers and farm workers will see that others are doing their level best to utilise all the spare time they have and are losing no opportunity to provide for themselves in such a way as to obviate the necessity of their becoming a burden on the national pool.  While, in the matter of area, they are not important, they have, as I have said and as other Deputies seem to think, an importance above and beyond the area of land involved or the amount of food that will come from the effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All I have to say now is that, when Deputies suggest that they should be released from their work here in order to take up co-ordinating activities in their constituencies, I have full confidence in the secretaries and C.A.O.s in the different counties.  I have full <Col N="2458" /> confidence in the ability of my own officials and the officials of the county councils to co-ordinate and to bring into one pool whatever plant is available and to find out where that plant is most required and to get the technical assistance to put that plant in motion.  I appeal to these officials to throw into this effort every ounce of energy they have, and, like other Deputies, I appeal also to the parish priests, the parsons and all those who have influence with the public and who can bring about the greatest possible degree of co-operation amongst all the sections outside the farming community, so that, while these people may not be able to make any very formidable contribution to the relief or the assistance of the farmer in this great effort he is called on to make, the farmer will at least feel that he has their blessing and their goodwill and that, to the extent to which they can help him, they will do so.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased indeed with the general tone of this discussion and very satisfied that the feeling of confidence to which expression has been given&mdash;confidence in ourselves, in our farmers and their workers and in all those vitally concerned&mdash;is not misplaced. I think they have the fullest possible appreciation of the enormous dangers to which we are exposed as a nation and of the importance of their throwing into this effort every ounce of the best that is in them.</P>

      <P>The Minister has directed his mind to the unemployed and the plots, and I should like to know in that connection whether, in view of the rather disastrous effect the heavy programme which will fall to be done in the spring will have on the turf position, the Government are turning their mind to whether the unemployed would not be much better employed in relation to the spring turf campaign rather than in relation to plots, because the present situation will react very unfavourably on the turf programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

      <P>I should be glad if the Minister could make some regulation or Order by which, when a tractor goes out of order and is put into a <Col N="2460" /> garage for repairs, and when the owner may perhaps not be in a position to pay for those repairs as quickly or as handsomely as the owner of a big car, those repairs will get preference and the tractor will be made available for work within 24 hours.</P>
