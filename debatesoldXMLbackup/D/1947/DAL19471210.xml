      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, having regard to the bad weather at present prevailing, and the unsettled outlook for the next few months, he will postpone the dissolution of the Dáil until the latter half of March, 1948, or even later, when more favourable conditions may be expected, with greater likelihood of a heavy poll.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the weather may prevent a large number of our people from voting if the election is held early in the year, in view of the fact that in other elections certain numbers of our people did not have an opportunity to record their vote because of lack of travelling facilities and through working away from their home towns, and in view of the fact that next year will be a leap year and we will have an extra day, will the Taoiseach consider declaring the polling day a public holiday?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he is in a position to indicate the reasons which motivated India to oppose the admission of this State to membership of the United Nations Organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach) Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite wrong to suggest that India opposed the admission of Ireland to membership of the United Nations Organisation.  I welcome the opportunity of saying this because I know from the communications I have received from the Indian Government, and from the leader of the Indian delegation at the assembly, that they are as anxious as we are that any misunderstanding that exists in regard to this matter should be removed.</P>
      <P>What happened was that, at the recent Assembly of the United Nations, the Australian and some other delegations proposed resolutions asking the Security Council to reconsider a number of applications for membership, including that of Ireland, and the Indian delegation voted against these resolutions on the ground that some of their clauses were contrary to the Assembly's Rules of Procedure and to the recommendations of a procedural committee of which the leader of the Indian delegation had been chairman. In the course of her speech explaining her opposition to the resolution, the Indian delegate said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is for this purely procedural reason that the Indian delegation, in spite of their very definite opinion in favour of the admission of countries like Éire and Transjordan, voted against all the resolutions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In a later discussion on the same subject, Mrs. Pandit expressed regret that Ireland had not been recommended for admission to the United Nations and said that Ireland was</P>
      <P>&ldquo;not only a peace-loving country but a freedom-loving country, eminently fitted for membership of the United Nations&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is, therefore, that, far from opposing the admission of this country to the United Nations, the delegates of India went out of their way, both at <Col N="585" /> the recent Assembly and on other occasions, to express friendship and goodwill towards this country, and I want to take the opportunity of assuring our Indian friends that these feelings are cordially reciprocated by us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if his attention was called to the announcement of the British Minister of Labour to the effect that, in certain circumstances, he reserves the right to direct citizens of this country resident in Great Britain to work considered essential to the national interests of Great Britain; whether he is aware that the Minister concerned purports to take this action in pursuance of an agreement made with the High Commissioner in London; whether, in fact, an agreement of this nature was made with the approval of the Government; and if so, whether a copy of the agreement will be laid on the Table of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he is aware that the British Minister of Labour reserves the right, in certain circumstances, to direct to employment Irish citizens resident in Britain; if so, if he will state when this arrangement was arrived at; and if he is satisfied that it safeguards the welfare of Irish people working in Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the Ceann Comhairle's permission, I propose to take Questions 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the statement of the British Minister of Labour that he reserves the right, in certain circumstances, to direct the employment of Irish citizens in Britain in the same way as he directs the employment of British citizens or persons of other nationalities registered in that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were not consulted about the making of the recent Order and there was no agreement or discussion with the British authorities in regard to it. My information is, however, that the arrangement made at the beginning of the war as regards the liability of Irish citizens in Britain to conscription will <Col N="586" /> apply to the new Order in the same way as it applied to the previous Control of Engagement Orders, so that any Irish citizen in Britain who is not prepared to accept direction under the new Order is free to return to this country if he so wishes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he is now prepared to make representations to the British Government to secure the release of Irish prisoners who are undergoing sentences in British prisons in connection with political offences; and whether he will urge the British Government to grant an amnesty to these prisoners before Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he is prepared to indicate to the British Government that he will welcome any gesture of clemency which might be made in relation to the 28 Irish prisoners serving terms of imprisonment in Britain since 1938.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>My information is that sentences of this kind are reviewed from time to time and that a number of the cases referred to are actually at present under consideration.</P>
      <P>As I have already made it quite clear, any suggestion that this Government would be unfavourable to the exercise of clemency in these cases is without any foundation.  The British Government are aware of this.  It must be obvious, however, for the reasons I have already stated in the Dáil, that formal representations could not be made by us without complete stultification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach not aware of the fact that the British Government have released their own citizens and the citizens of other countries who openly encouraged Britain's enemies during the war and, bearing that fact in mind, and having regard to the further fact that these prisoners have now served sentences of <Col N="587" /> seven and eight years, will he not, on the approach of Christmas, on humanitarian grounds, formally ask the British Government to release these prisoners and let them come home to their native land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated to the Deputy that I cannot formally, without complete stultification, make such representations.  I have already informed him that the British Government is aware of the views that we have in this matter and I can do nothing further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to do nothing further while 20 Irish prisoners continue to lie helpless in British jails? Will the Irish Government not make representations for their release on humanitarian grounds after they have been imprisoned for seven or eight years?  No other Government in the world would act like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Any other Government in the world would find itself in the same position.  We made very earnest representations on behalf of our prisoners and then the same organisation attacked our own State. We had to deal drastically with it in order to save our own State and we were precluded by that fact from making the representations which Deputy Norton wants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce: (i) if it is the policy of Bord na Móna to take over small bog allotments from small farmers who were and are depending solely for a livelihood on the sale of saved turf from such; (ii) if he is aware that Bord na Móna have already entered on the bog, containing about six acres, of William Ward, Shraharoagh, Louisburgh, County Mayo, while there are large tracts of other bogs in the area the owners of which would gladly offer same to the board; (iii) that Mr. Ward is mainly depending on the income from this bog; and if he will ensure that this does not occur again.</P>

      <P>It is not the policy of Bord na Móna to acquire turbary from smallholders who depend for a livelihood on the sale of turf and special precautions are taken by the board to avoid any such interference.  The bog referred to by the Deputy has been vested in the Mayo County Council acting on behalf of the board, but it has been made clear to the owner that it is not the board's intention to utilise his bog for production of turf or to interfere in any way with his turf-cutting operations.  The purpose of the arrangement is merely to provide access to an adjoining bog on which the board intends to operate.  The position has been explained to the owner who has stated that he has no objection to this procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that, at the moment, coal stocks have accumulated in Cork City beyond the capacity of local consumers to absorb them; and if he will permit some supplies of such coal to be allocated to domestic users in Cork County turf areas, such as Kinsale, Youghal, Cobh, Passage, etc., which are over 30 miles from the nearest bog and where turf and timber are very difficult to obtain at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As Cork and Dublin are the only ports capable of accommodating the American coal boats, the accumulation of considerable coal stocks at each of these centres was unavoidable.  These stocks are, however, for general consumption and were not intended for local consumption only.</P>
      <P>With regard to the latter part of the question, the fuel requirements of all parts of the country are being kept under constant review in the light of the available supplies of coal, turf and firewood, and the Deputy may rest assured that the interests of the various sections of the community are borne in mind in connection with the utilisation of the available stocks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether his attention has been called to the unusually high prices charged in Dublin for potatoes; whether it is apprehended that there will be a shortage, in 1948, of potatoes suitable for human use; and whether he will state what steps are being or will be taken to ensure that an ample supply of potatoes will be maintained and that any attempt to divert supplies to the black-market will be frustrated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply to a question about potato supplies given by me in Dáil Éireann on the 20th November last.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the prices which are being charged in Dublin for potatoes are higher than the prices which obtained at the corresponding period last year.  The position regarding supplies and prices is being kept under constant review and steps will be taken to control prices if circumstances justify that course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, he will recall that on previous occasions it was necessary to <Col N="591" /> take steps towards the end of the year in order to safeguard supplies for the following spring.  In view of the fact that in the main sources of supply for the Dublin market there is a reduced crop, would it not be necessary to take steps earlier?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The question has been considered to take action as in previous years against a possible scarcity in the spring.  There has been a reduced yield of potatoes this year but the proportion sold is very small and there need not be anxiety, I think, concerning supplies for human consumption, subject to the price being maintained at a level sufficient to attract the producers.</P>

The companies have submitted figures to me showing the results of their motor insurance business and as these figures justify the increased rates proposed I do not intend to have recourse to the powers conferred on me by Section 107 of the Insurance Act, 1936.</P>

    <P>As regards the progress being made towards providing the houses required, the present position is as follows:</P>
    <P>Enniscorthy Urban District: An Order for the compulsory acquisition of 19¼ acres of land at Bellefield was confirmed without modification in <Col N="599" /> April, 1947, and revised layout and house plans together with specifications for the erection of 103 houses were approved on 30th August last.  It is understood that the quantity surveyor is now engaged in drawing the bills of quantities and that advertisements for tenders will be published next month.</P>
    <P>Gorey Town: Lay-out and house plans for the erection of 36 houses have been approved.  It is understood that the preparation of the bills of quantities is at present in progress and when this has been completed tenders will be invited.</P>
    <P>New Ross Urban District: Only one tender was received in response to an advertisement published in December, 1946, for the erection of 49 houses at Charleton Hill.  This was not in accordance with the specification and could not be accepted.  On the suggestion of the council the county manager interviewed local contractors but only one tender was received.  This also was rejected on the recommendation of the architect who at the same time advised the council as to the desirability of having bills of quantities prepared with a view to securing competitive tenders.  It is understood the bills of quantities are now being drawn.</P>
    <P>Wexford Borough: A scheme for the erection of 16 houses on the corporation's site at Slippery Green is at present in progress.  The corporation recently advertised a contract for the erection of a further 74 houses on the same site but no tenders were received.  Bills of quantities are, it is understood, now nearly completed and it is anticipated that tenders will be invited early in January.</P>
    <P>Rural Areas: In the rural areas of Wexford County plans for two types of cottage have been approved.  Tenders for the erection of 68 cottages have been advertised but so far it has only been found possible to arrange for the erection of 39.  They are distributed in the following rural areas:</P>

      <P>Killarney Urban District Council have for a number of years struck a rate of 2½d. in the £ for the purposes of tourist development. The yield of that rate is approximately £107 annually.  In each of the financial years 1933-34 to 1945-46, inclusive, the Urban District Council paid the sum of £75 to the Irish Tourist Association. In the year 1946-47, the sum paid was £100.  In the current year I understand that the full amount raised, namely, £107, will be paid to the Irish Tourist Association.</P>
      <P>It will be seen that for some years the council raised more by the rate than was paid to the association.  This appeared to have been done in the expectation that they would be allowed to spend the difference directly themselves either in increasing the attractions of Killarney or paying the expenses of a tourist canvasser. Their proposals, however, were not sanctioned and consequently the unexpended balances each year were lodged to the credit of the council's funds.  This practice, I understand, has been brought to an end and in future all moneys raised for tourist purposes will be paid to the association.</P>

      <P>It is anticipated that the field-work of the nutritional investigators and the clinical examinations, which are being undertaken by a medical officer, will both be completed by the end of next year.  In the City of Dublin the survey is now advanced and it may be possible to publish the results much sooner. The statistical analysis of the returns received so far is proceeding but I cannot say with any certainty when this work will be completed in respect of the survey as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ten nutritional investigators are at present carrying out the dietary survey. A temporary medical inspector and a nurse are engaged on the clinical survey of school-children and certain other groups of the population which is being conducted as an integral part of the nutrition survey.  The work of this staff is being carried out under the general direction and supervision of a <Col N="603" /> senior medical inspector of my Department.</P>
    <P>The total expenditure on the survey up to 30th November, 1947, was £7,966 14s. 4d.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the negative.</P>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy on 15th October last in reply to a similar question, the Additional Benefits Scheme approved by me under the National Health Insurance Acts provided for an expenditure on dental benefits within a limit of £131,000 a year.  The negotiations which were in progress between the National Health Insurance Society and the dental associations when I replied to that question ended on 7th November with an offer by the society which, I am informed, represented a substantial advance on the scale of fees previously payable and on an earlier offer.  The associations referred the matter to a ballot of their members and I understand that the society was informed yesterday that the offer had been rejected.</P>
      <P>The society has not yet had an opportunity of considering the position arising from that rejection and if, as may be the case, it feels that the offer represents the limit of the concession it should make in the interests of restoring the service for its members, the delay in bringing a scheme into operation may be protracted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister is aware of the hardships suffered by insured contributors because dental benefit is not available.  I take it also that he is aware of the consequential drain on the funds of the society by reason of the fact that benefit is not available to members of the society. In these circumstances would the Minister consider at this stage representing <Col N="604" /> jointly to the society and to the dentists' associations that, pending a settlement of the dispute on fees, the society should continue to provide the dental treatment and the dentists should undertake to execute the necessary treatment on the understanding that whatever arrangement is arrived at would be applied retrospectively to cover such treatment afforded during the period of the dispute &mdash; in other words, to take the insured contributors out of the arena of the dispute?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister accepts that this dispute will ultimately be settled.  Why, in the meantime, must the insured contributor suffer? Are the dental associations, on the one hand, and the society, on the other hand, not sufficiently alive to an appreciation of their mutual responsibility in the matter of providing insured contributors with dental treatment? Whatever settlement is arrived at about the fees could be applied retrospectively to such treatment as is now afforded.  Surely that is not an unreasonable request?  Will the Minister try to pilot it through these contending parties?</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply, which occupied 37 columns of the Official Report, to a question on similar lines which he addressed to me on the 23rd October, 1946.  I am not prepared to give instructions for the compilation after such a relatively short interval of the elaborate particulars supplied on that occasion as I do not consider that the information afforded would warrant the entirely disproportionate expenditure of time and labour entailed.</P>
      <P>The general practice governing the retirement of civil servants when they attain 65 years of age is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In no circumstances is any officer obliged to remain in service if he wishes to retire.  Established civil servants are exceptionally retained only if their retirement involves serious disservice to the public interest, and the period of their retention is strictly limited to the time within which suitable alternative arrangements can be made to provide for their replacement.  In very exceptional cases where retirement involves serious financial hardship retention is agreed to for a restricted period.  Unestablished civil servants are treated more leniently but satisfactory evidence of hardship must be produced before retention is authorised.</P>

    <P>The increase in the figures from 1941 onwards is due partly to the reduction in the margin of exemption from corporation profits tax from £5,000 to £2,500 and partly to the increased profits of companies, which brought into the charge concerns not formerly liable to the tax.</P>

      <P>No decision has been made as to the setting up of a forestry consultative committee under Section 10 of the Forestry Act, 1946.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a previous question I stated on the 9th October last that the delay in bringing the Act into force was due to unforeseen difficulties in the drafting of the necessary statutory and other forms.  Progress in that connection has been made in the meantime and it is hoped that the Act will be <Col N="612" /> brought into operation in the next few months.</P>
    <P>At the time the Forestry Act, 1946, was passed it was anticipated that conditions affecting the supply of materials essential to tree planting would shortly improve to such an extent as would render the replanting conditions of the Act more readily enforceable. That anticipation has not been fulfilled and, while the provision of supplies is now somewhat better, it is not yet as satisfactory as my Department would wish before commencing generally to enforce the replanting conditions of the new Act.</P>

      <P>Our grievance against the British Ministry of Food last year was that they were placing us in the same category as other countries in relation to our turkeys.  After a complaint on our part they proceeded to mend their hand to some extent.  This <Col N="614" /> year my main responsibility was to secure for the producers here parity with the British producer in so far as price is concerned.  Having secured that, the British Ministry of Food made the suggestion that we should agree to send our turkeys through their organisation.  If I wanted to take up the attitude of members of the Opposition who would like to have their cake and eat it, I could make their case, but I think that attitude would be unreasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to extend the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1946, for another year.  The House will remember that the Act was originally intended to apply only to two years and would cease to have effect on the 31st March next unless, of course, it were continued by further legislation. The Act of 1946 was passed following on an announcement by the Minister for Finance that he intended to provide an additional £1,000,000 towards the relief of rates on agricultural land.  In doing this, of course, he was merely continuing the general policy of this Government in relation to agriculture.  I think that it can be said that one of the outstanding characteristics of the Fianna Fáil Administration has been the continuous sympathy and practical help which it has manifested and given to the farmer to enable him to meet his obligations to the local authorities.  In the first Budget, which I had the responsibility of introducing when Minister for Finance, the grant towards the relief of agricultural land was substantially increased and was maintained at approximately that increased figure by successive enactments, so that it stood at the figure of £1,861,000 until the close of 1945-46.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Budget of the year 1946, as I have indicated, the grant in relief was increased by no less than £1,000,000 <Col N="624" /> until it stood at £2,900,157.  Not only was the grant so substantially increased but a new system of distributing it and of determining it was introduced. The system of distribution was not new in principle because in preceding years we had the grant divided into three parts, consisting of a primary allowance, a supplementary allowance and an employment allowance.  These features, though substantially modified and improved, were retained by the Act of 1946 but perhaps the most farreaching innovation which was made under that Act was definitely to relate the amount of the grant to the total amount of the rates which, but for the grant, would be leviable on agricultural land.  For the first time, we had introduced the principal of a proportionate contribution from the State.  Under this scheme of proportionate contributions, the first allowance, called the primary allowance, was fixed and granted on land valuations not exceeding £20 and the first £20 of higher valuations, at a rate equivalent to three-fifths of the general rate.  The second allowance, or supplementary allowance as it is called, was given on the land valuation of holdings above £20 and was equivalent to one-fifth of the general rate. To these two allowances there was added an employment allowance for each man at work, and this employment allowance was fixed at the rate of 10/- in the £ on the valuation above £20 and was limited to £6 10s. Od. for each man.  It will be understood, therefore, that the grant, in so far as the first two allowances were concerned&mdash; that is, the primary and supplementary allowances &mdash; varied, as I have already indicated, with the amount of the rate.</P>
    <P>In the year of its introduction&mdash;that is, the year which began on 1st April, 1946&mdash;the amount of the grant was £2,900,157.  The primary allowances&mdash; that is, the allowances on the holdings up to £20 in valuation and the first £20 of the larger holdings &mdash; absorbed £1,830,000, the supplementary allowances took £470,000, and the employment allowances £600,000.  It is not possible to give exact figures for the amount which will be required to meet the State's obligations under the Bill <Col N="625" /> for the current year, but it has been estimated that over £3,175,000 will be required and this will be distributed in the following way: The primary allowances will take £2,036,000, the supplementary allowances will take £514,000, and the employment allowances, £615,000.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill before the House is to provide that no change will be made this year in the existing system of grants.  That will be done under Section 2, which applies the Act of 1946 to the financial year ending on the 31st March, 1949.  The effect is to preserve the three allowances on the same basis as before.</P>
    <P>Section 3 advances the latest date for the receipt of applications for employment allowances to the 15th October, 1948, instead of the 1st January, 1949, which is the date prescribed in subsection (3) of Section 7 of the 1946 Act. This change is made for the purpose of expediting the submission of employment claims so as to facilitate earlier estimates of the cost to the State.  The date fixed gives ample time to all claimants and, indeed, much longer than was allowed under the Act of 1939.</P>
    <P>I think I may remind the House that the present provision for the relief of rates upon agricultural land is so generous that it is almost five times the grant originally made under the Local Government Act of 1898.  I may further emphasise that, notwithstanding the very generous increase of £1,049,000 which was made in the grant by the Bill of 1946, farmers this year have enjoyed a further substantial increase in a grant of no less than over £250,000 for the current year.  It is the main purpose of the Bill to ensure that this system which, no doubt, has been of great help to our agriculturists during the past two years, will be continued during the coming year.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for recommending it to the House.  It is merely an indication of the general solicitude which the Fianna Fáil Administration has always manifested for the position of the farmers and it is a practical expression of concern for their welfare which certainly did not emanate from our predecessors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has gone to a lot of trouble to stress the generosity of this gift that he is providing in a particular way for agriculturists. He completely overlooks this fact, that our farmers' raw material, land, is taxed heavily.  Our neighbours in Great Britain and Northern Ireland years ago saw that it was improper and unwise to continue to tax agricultural land.  The land in Great Britain and Northern Ireland has carried no tax for a number of years.  The generosity the Minister is boasting about, tested on the basis of what is happening around us, is not so generous at all.</P>
      <P>The Minister is continuing this from year to year.  He knows it must be made a permanent feature so far as the relief of rates on land is concerned. If the Minister looks at what is happening in rural Ireland he will realise that production is falling and our young people are leaving the land.  If the Minister is left in the position that he has to bear further responsibility, he must face the fact that agricultural land cannot bear the rate that is imposed upon it.  He knows very well that next year there will be a substantial increase in the poor rate. Will that be thrown back on the raw material of our main industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If whatever benefits accrue to this country as a result of the London talks put us in the position that we have to sell our produce side by side with the farmers of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, then some attention must be paid to the conditions under which our people produce on the land.  Those conditions will have to be improved if our people are to compete on terms at least as advantageous as those enjoyed by the people in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  The Minister as a northerner knows that the land in the north has not carried rates for years. There is no need for him to stress his generosity.  He is rather reluctantly continuing this measure for the coming year.  The Minister is now beginning to realise that it must continue, not merely this year, but for the future. The land in this country cannot bear, and the people working and utilising <Col N="627" /> the land for the benefit of the community cannot afford, to carry the tax burden imposed upon it at the present time.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister must know that production in Great Britain and Northern Ireland rose by 70 per cent. during the war.  It was admitted in a Budget Statement by a colleague of his that ours fell by 10 per cent.  That is what this generous Government did for the main industry, and by their generosity bestowed on the main industry, the Government persisted in putting this charge on agricultural land which is not carried in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I submit, Sir, that not merely should this relief be continued this year, but the position of the rates in the coming year should be anticipated and the rates for next year should be borne by the State.  The Minister is not facing up to his responsibilities at all by allowing a very substantial increase in the rates to be thrown back on the primary industry, in conditions where production is stagnant or has actually fallen.  There has been a sharp fall this year and more and more people are leaving the land.  In circumstances of that sort it is ludicrous for the Minister to boast of his generosity, because it is not generosity.  The time has come when this House must realise that it is bad policy to tax the most important raw material in this country.  The Minister is still continuing to tax this raw material and I challenge him to point out raw material of any other industry which is taxed before it is used.</P>
    <P>Our people have this disability in comparison with their neighbours in Great Britain and Northern Ireland: their raw material is taxed while their neighbours' is not taxed and I want to draw the Minister's attention to this important aspect of the problem and to make the observation that this provision is not enough in the circumstances under which we are living.  If we are to raise production, then the raw material of our primary industry must be relieved of tax burdens of this sort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister burst into a wild song of praise of the Fianna Fáil Party for its generosity towards the farmer.  I am sure that the farmers if they hear of or read that song will be thrilled.</P>
      <P>I remember in 1928 attending a conference of farmers convened by the late Deputy Belton at which attention was drawn to the fact that agricultural land in Great Britain and Northern Ireland had been derated and a demand was made that the then Government should apply a similar just measure to this country.  Agitation was made by farmers for that demand, but before their agitation had got very far under way, the farmers' meek and gentle voices were drowned completely by the loud and strident voices of Fianna Fáil agitators who were demanding that rates on agricultural land should be completely abolished and promising that if only they got into power there would be no more rates on agricultural land and the rate collector would no longer be seen in rural Ireland.  Now, after 15 years of office &mdash;15 years during which this demand for justice by farmers has been opposed, spurned and denied&mdash;the Minister comes into this House and talks of the generosity of the Fianna Fáil Party to the farmers.</P>
      <P>If we want to consider this question impartially, we have to compare the farmers' position here with the position in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. In Northern Ireland the farmers are exempt from rates on their land and agricultural buildings also.  In addition to that, the farmers receive a bonus upon land under cultivation, a substantial subsidy in respect of ploughed up lea, a substantial subsidy on every acre of wheat and a substantial subsidy on every acre of potatoes. In addition to that, the all-round average in prices in Northern Ireland is substantially higher than it is here. Then in face of all that the Minister comes in here to tell us how generous Fianna Fáil has been towards the farmers.  I think that the Minister should come in here in sack-cloth and ashes to apologise to the farmers for the way he has robbed them during his period of office as a member of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="629" /> I drew attention, on a number of occasions, to the inequity and the injustice of the present system of rating as between agriculture and other occupations in this country.  We know that the national income has been estimated and calculated and at the present time the farmers, or the agricultural community, are reputed to earn 35 per cent. of the national income, but the rateable valuation of agriculture is nearer to 75 per cent. of the total rateable valuation of the country.  Surely if the rateable valuation bore any relation to income, the rateable valuation of agriculture should be 35 per cent. of the total rateable valuation of the country. But in this matter there has been no sense of justice, no sense of fair play, no guiding principles at all based on justice, but simply a desire on the part of the Government to fleece the farmers.  They desire at the same time, however, to come here annually with small grants, claiming that those grants which only partially offset the injustice of the rating system, are gifts and generous gifts to the farmers.  This agricultural grant is not a gift to agriculture. It is an attempt, and an inadequate attempt, to remedy the grave injustice of our rating system to which I have referred.  In the first place, the present system of valuation is unfair to agriculture, and in the second place, as Deputy Hughes pointed out, it is wrong to tax agriculture as an industry at all.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion the Minister brought in a Bill which was only alive for two years, and now he brings in a Bill to extend that Act for a further year.  I would like to know does the Minister consider that type of legislation to be either legislatively or administratively efficient.  Is it desirable, or does it make for efficiency in local services, that those who plan and manage local services should always be wondering what kind of grants they are going to get in the coming year?  Is it desirable from the point of view of efficiency to have this state of continual uncertainty in regard to agricultural grants?  Is it not time that this state of affairs were ended and ended once and for all?  Is it not time an equitable system were introduced which would be fair to agriculture and to all other <Col N="630" /> sections of the community?  There is no justification for this type of muddling and amending from year to year.  Let us decide once and for all on the policy of the Minister for Agriculture in regard to direct taxation and introduce a permanent system of legislation to that effect.</P>
    <P>When this employment grant was first announced the Minister for Finance told us that its purpose was to offset a coming increase in agricultural wages.  The employment grant amounts to £6 10s. Od. for each man employed on a farm.  Since that amount was introduced agricultural wages have increased on an average about 10/- per week, that is, £26 per year.  Thus the farmer, as a result of the paternal activities of our generous Government, receives a benefit of £6 10s. Od. per year but pays, in increased wages, £26. That does not seem to conform with the Minister's idea that the Government is solicitous for the farmer.  It is merely a further proof of the uncertainty and the muddled-headedness of the Government in regard to local taxation.</P>
    <P>A little more than two years ago this Party introduced a motion and submitted it to Dáil Eireann to the effect that a system of derating should be introduced.  That would have had the effect of derating every agricultural holding on which there was a reasonable amount of employment or on which a reasonable number of members of the family were being maintained. The Minister at that time&mdash;I think it was the Minister for Finance who performed the operation of pole-axing that particular motion&mdash;said that the motion would cost £2,000,000 and that if he had £2,000,000, which he claimed he had not in the Exchequer at the time, he would not apply 1/- of it towards the relief of rates.  Within three months of the making of that wild statement he was forced to come into Dáil Éireann with a Budget providing £1,000,000 for the reduction of agricultural rates.  That shows how the mind of Fianna Fáil operates.  They have no sense of justice or fair play.  They have no sense of right or wrong.  They have no guiding principles whatever.  They are guided by expediency&mdash;by the reports which come to them from their watch-dogs in <Col N="631" /> the various constituencies.  They change their policy from day to day according as is necessary in order to capture votes.  That is not the way to deal with agricultural industry in the first place and with local authorities in the second place and it does not make for increased efficiency.  The sooner we have a Government with the courage to plan boldly on the lines of justice and fair play rather than on expediency the sooner we will have a more efficient local government and a more prosperous and productive agricultural industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to an anomaly which I do not believe the framers of the Act intended.  It affects a number of labouring men in my constituency. In the case of two, at least, it affects men who have been in the one employment for the past 20 years, one as a ploughman and the other as a general man.  They purchased a cow to supply the family with milk.  They purchased a paddock convenient to the residence. The paddock had a rateable valuation of £5.  These men, after 20 years' constant employment, lost their jobs on the grounds that their employer would not be allowed the grant because they had now become rated occupiers.  The employer had no alternative and the men were dismissed.  The unfortunate part of the story is that they could not register for work on the roads as they had never before been unemployed. Their names were not on the unemployment register and, in addition, they were now rated occupiers with a valuation of £5.  I feel sure it was never the spirit of the Act to penalise thrifty men.  In this case the valuation of the field was only £5 and the men were thrifty.  I am sure that the Minister, before he makes the Act permanent, will rectify this matter and give the county manager power to make an allowance in such cases, so that the employer will get the full allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We hear so many peculiar statements on the eve of a general election that they are rather amusing. They remind me of the time when I was sitting where Deputy Hughes is now <Col N="632" /> sitting.  At that time the Cumann na nGaedheal Government afforded £500,000 per year for relief of agricultural rates.  When I proposed £1,000,000 for that purpose all of Deputy Hughes' chums voted against it.  At that time it was considered outrageous to look for £1,000,000 for the relief of agricultural rates.  We hear a lot about the position of the Northern Ireland farmer.  His annuities were always held in Northern Ireland but he paid the full annuity and not half of it.  He paid every damn farthing.  The English farmer affords no comparison, largely because he is only a serf.  He has no ownership of his land.  He could be kicked out of his farm after 12 months and another man put in his place.  As soon as we held the annuities here, in spite of the efforts of Deputy Hughes and of his friends, we proceeded immediately to reduce the annuities of the whole lot by 50 per cent. as compared with your Northern Ireland farmer who is paying 100 per cent. at the present time.  I admit that our rates are jumping up all the time and will go on jumping up for some time to come.  The main reason for the increase is because of the introduction of numerous social services.  Against the £500,000 provided by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government we are providing over £3,000,000.  That is a pretty hefty jump.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Cogan talks about the Minister for Finance saying that this was to be offset against increased wages, I wonder does Deputy Cogan or any other Deputy really accept that?  When Deputy Hughes and I went down to see General Costello in order to get an increase in the price of beet because of the increased wages paid to farm labourers and the increased costs of production generally, and when we got an increase of 10/- a ton last year and an increase <Col N="633" /> of 8/- to 12/- this year to offset the increase in wages and the 20 per cent. increase in freightage by Córas Iompair Eireann, we never contended that the Minister for Finance was giving this £6 10s. Od. as an argument that we should not get such an increase.  That argument was not advanced against us.</P>
      <P>I know that one will get any amount of promises at the present time.  It is not so very long ago since the Opposition made a whole lot of promises on the eve of a general election.  It was said that while Fianna Fáil promised only half the annuities, Deputy Cosgrave and his Party would get the whole annuities.  But the people judged on actions.  It is all very well for people to make promises which they know they will never fulfil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputies will stop interrupting we shall get along fine. The total letting valuation is £120.  The supplementary is one-fifth of the total valuation and the grant amounts to £6 10s. Od. per man.  The total cost comes to £3,455,000.  That is a pretty hefty bill.  Despite this relief rates are still going up, just as everything else is going up, by leaps and bounds. Social services have to be provided. Deputy Cogan introduced a number of side-lines and side issues in this matter. We heard nothing from him about the other agricultural reliefs or the other provisions that are being made for agriculture.  We heard nothing from him about the rural improvements schemes.  We heard nothing from him <Col N="634" /> about the farm improvements schemes. I am wondering how many of those would apply in Great Britain.  Recently in my constituency we had 300 or 400 acres of land flooded.  We were able to relieve all the farmers on those lands under a rural improvements scheme. Out of a cost of £750 for the scheme 22 farmers paid only £115 between them. If the farmers in Deputy Cogan's and Deputy Hughes' constituencies are not getting the benefit of those reliefs then the Deputies are not doing their job. I am not responsible for that.  I am not responsible for Deputy Hughes being too lazy to do his work in his own constituency.  As a matter of fact, judging by the way Deputies talk, one could only conclude that they have no knowledge of these reliefs.  I represent as many farmers as any Deputy in this House.  In a couple of months' time we will get their votes again because the farmers will vote for solid work.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister has met this matter very fairly.  I am glad to see that he is continuing the employment grant, which to my mind is one of the most fundamental.  Under that scheme, the farmer receives the grant not only for the men he hires but also for his sons over the age of 18 who are working on the land with him.  If I had my way, instead of giving a first and second relief, I would give the whole lot in employment schemes.  I think it would work out to greater advantage. I had no intention of speaking here to-day but when I heard the argument advanced by Deputy Hughes and Deputy Cogan I felt I had to intervene in the debate.</P>

      <P>I must admit that I am at your mercy, Sir, and at the mercy of the Minister in regard to the particular plea which I propose to make.  I shall try to relate that plea to this particular Bill and, of course, to the original Act itself.  There are a certain number of farmers in a particular area down in County Wexford known as the Mackamore area and in another area known as the Bridgetown area.  These farmers have been sorely tried during the past two years.  They made representations to the Minister for Agriculture and the Department for some sort <Col N="635" /> of State aid and up to the present they have not succeeded, inasmuch as the Minister found that within the powers of the Department they could not do anything to give the relief asked for. I am therefore trying on the Second Stage of this Bill to see if the Minister for Local Government could do anything to aid these farmers.  For the last two years these areas have been subjected to severe flooding.</P>

      <P>I am looking for relief of rates.  I am trying to make a special case for these people.  While I admit that this concerns the whole of the Twenty-Six Counties, I am asking the Minister to be a little more generous to these people in my constituency. He may think that unreasonable but, as they are my constituents, I am prepared to look for what I can get for them.  These particular areas in Wexford have been subjected to very heavy flooding during the past two years. The soil has retained the water for a very long time and for two years the land has been incapable of producing anything from what was sown in it. These farmers suffered severe losses owing to the Compulsory Tillage Order. They were forced to till a certain amount of land and they did that in accordance with the requirements of the Department of Agriculture but found that they could not harvest what they had sown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By no means the least of their difficulties is the high valuation of their land.  These farmers would submit that there is no relation between the valuation and the productivity of the land there.  I should like to make a plea to the Minister therefore to give consideration <Col N="636" /> to the case of these farmers under this Bill and the original Act and try to give them a little more relief than is provided for in this Bill.  It may seem an unreasonable request but if the particular cases were examined I think it would be found that the farmers in these areas have suffered very severe losses.  In a large number of cases, the farmers found that they were not able to pay for the seeds which they purchased on credit in the spring.  They find that they possibly will not be able to engage in sowing to any appreciable extent in the coming spring.  If anything could be done for them by way of relief in their rates through a contribution from the State it would be very desirable.  It would help them to get back on their feet and do something to make up for the losses they incurred in the last two or three seasons.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy Corry, I could not help wondering if the Minister was praying to be spared the attention of his friends.  I think Deputy Corry very successfully drew attention to every weakness in the Minister's policy as compared with the policy in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  He referred to the fact that Fianna Fáil had halved the annuities whereas farmers in Northern Ireland have to pay the whole of their annuities.  He carefully left out the fact, however, that farmers in Northern Ireland have not to pay any rates on agricultural land or buildings.  Therefore, I think it is not wise to draw too much attention to the position of farmers in Eire as compared with the position of farmers in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out that it is a very weak argument to start <Col N="637" /> talking about how well off we are here and in respect of that I could not help smiling when the Minister began by talking about an outstanding characteristic of this Administration being the care they had taken of the agricultural community, especially as shown by their actions in regard to rates.  The necessity for this increased relief for rates on agricultural land is due to the way in which the present Administration, particularly the present Minister, have increased the burden on the ratepayers. Deputy Corry stated that it is due in some degree to social services. But, when the Government are bringing in social services, they are not bound to put the burden on the shoulders of the ratepayers.</P>
      <P>The Minister stressed that in the first year the grant for the relief of rates came to so much and the next year it went up by £250,000.  The only reason for the increase is the increase in the rates struck.  It is not an extra contribution that the State is making willingly.  It is not an increased rate of benefit that the Minister is making. Any increases in this grant under the 1946 Act and under this Bill are due entirely to the increases in the rates struck.  These increases are very largely due to the tendency on the part of the Government to pass on to the shoulders of the ratepayers a burden which ought to be borne by the State. The Minister will come out with his usual argument about property owners. When you go into a district of small farmers and look at some of the property owners there, it is more than doubtful that they will be able to bear these added burdens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I got this Bill my feelings were rather mixed with regard to it.  On the one hand, I was relieved to know that we were not going back to the provisions of the 1939 Act.  On the other hand, I was considerably disappointed that some more considered policy had not been arrived at.  I appreciate, of course, that the trend of political events has speeded up the Minister's programme considerably in the last couple of months.  But the Minister has had two years in which to consider what is to be his outlook on the question of relieving rates on <Col N="638" /> agricultural land.  It is not a very fair argument to say that it is only in the last couple of months that he has had time to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>This Bill is now being rushed as a sort of patchwork measure on the 1946 Act.  That is all the present Bill amounts to.  The Minister is merely extending the provisions of the 1946 Act for another year because an election is on and there is not time to bring in a more considered measure. We appreciate the necessity for that, now that the time is so short, but the Minister should not have allowed himself to be placed at such a disadvantage. This is a matter to which he should have attended much earlier.  It is not so long ago since a number of questions were asked in the House regarding the Minister's intention.  I asked some of these questions myself and Deputy Cogan put some other questions.  At that time the Minister had no information to give but suddenly at the last moment this Bill is rushed before the House.  I would have hoped that the experience gained in the administration of the 1946 Act would have shown the Minister some directions in which he might have improved on the provisions of that Act.</P>
    <P>Speaking broadly, when we consider that this is a type of relief which should be continued, I am in a fair amount of agreement with the method adopted so far as the allowance on valuations not exceeding £20, and on the first £20 of higher valuations is concerned and also as regards the supplementary allowance on valuations above £20. Unlike Deputy Corry, I do not like the employment grant at all.  Deputy Cogan was perfectly correct when he said that the Minister for Finance in introducing the Budget which led to the 1946 Act, merely intended to give some relief in rates to offset the amounts which the farmers had to provide to meet the increased agricultural wages.  Agricultural wages have since that date been further considerably increased.  The Minister apparently does not intend to follow that trend, as he has left the allowance at the same rate as that fixed in 1946.  I think he might very well have been a little more generous.  Wages have gone up <Col N="639" /> in the meantime and the Minister should have introduced an increased employment allowance.  As I say, I do not like the employment allowance.  It is either not operative in helping employment at all, or it operates in a rather harsh way on many farmers. Personally I do not think it operates to help employment at all.  I do not see that any one will employ an extra man for any length of time in the year in order to get £6 10s. 0d. when wages are 50/- a week.  The allowance is not equivalent to even three weeks' wages. If a man employs a labourer for about ten months in the year, he is certainly not going to give him employment for an extra two months for the sake of getting £6 10s. 0d.  I would have preferred to have seen a more generous provision for the primary and secondary allowances.  The secondary allowance, for instance, might have been increased from one fifth to two fifths.</P>
    <P>To my mind that would have given just as much encouragement to farmers to employ labour and it would have obviated a great deal of the work which falls on the local authorities under the present system&mdash;a great deal of checking by Guards and by rate collectors to ascertain whether certain men were really in employment for 12 months.  I have seen so many cases of hardship cropping up in connection with the employment allowance that I think it would have been much better if it had been abolished and the money saved in that way diverted towards giving increased relief under the secondary allowance.  The Minister must be aware from the many appeals that have come before him of the hardships arising out of borderline cases.  You have, for instance, the case of a man becoming ill and being away from his employment and, owing to local scarcity of labour, for a month or so no one could be put in his place.  The employer in that case lost the allowance of £6 10s. 0d.  That is the sort of thing that should be avoided because it discriminates against unfortunate individuals.</P>
    <P>With regard to Section 3, I must say that I am in full agreement with the Minister in bringing in this amendment. <Col N="640" /> The Minister may remember that he met me on this matter on the 1946 Bill and granted extra time within which application might be made, because of the lag in time from the date of the Budget to the date on which the Bill was actually introduced.  Many men did not appreciate the necessity for getting in their applications in time and at the time I think I pointed out to the Minister that there was no necessity to continue that long period into the subsequent year.  I am glad that he has now shortened it because it has had an unfortunate effect on the finances of local authorities as the Minister is aware.  It delays the payment of the agricultural grant by the State to the local authorities.  The result is that the local authorities' current overdraft is swollen and the unfortunate ratepayers have to contribute a bit more by way of interest on the overdraft.</P>
    <P>As I have said I am prepared to welcome the Bill.  It is certainly better than going back to the 1939 Act, but I think the Minister allowed rather too much time to slip before making provision for some improvement in the 1946 Act.  I would have much preferred to see a more considered measure but having regard to the circumstances and the pressure of time, I do not see there was any alternative open to the Minister other than to introduce this Bill. If, however, there is not time to consider a more elaborate measure that might have removed certain small hardships, it is very much better that this Bill should be brought in to extend the operations of the 1946 Act rather than that we should have to go back to the 1939 Act.</P>

      <P>Is it not proposed to provide certain advantages to <Col N="641" /> those who pay rates on agricultural land?  The farmers have been looking to the Deputies in the various constituencies to obtain some relief for them in the matter of rates because of the disastrous season through which they passed last year.  What is the Minister going to do in these cases? The farmers are not able to pay rates on these high valuations, particularly in the two areas referred to by Deputy Corish, Bridgetown and Macamores. There was a meeting held no later than last Saturday in the cinema in Gorey, and the farmers of that area asked us to do something for them.  I do not see anything in this Bill that will help them.  I do not mind Deputy Corry's remarks in regard to the benefits which this Government is supposed to have given to the farmers.  I remember the time when Deputy Corry's Party sat on this side of the House.  I remember reading some of their propaganda at that time in which they represented the last Leader of the Opposition Party as stepping over the Irish Sea with a bag of annuities on his back.  We were told at that time that the annuities would be remitted, but they were only halved.  Deputy Corry spoke of the substantial grants that were to be given to farmers, but I know many farmers in my constituency who would not touch these grants because the conditions laid down were that they would have to put up so much money themselves.  The help given in that way was damn little.  To my mind, if some measure is not brought in to help all sections of the farmers, they will soon be in a deplorable plight.  Deputy Sheldon referred to the £6 10s. 0d. allowance if a farmer keeps a man in his place for 12 months. What relief is that?  None whatever. In the majority of places the farmers are not able to keep men.  They have to dismiss them, and they certainly could not keep them for 12 months in order to get that great concession of £6 10s. 0d. that some Deputies speak about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a question down last week about the land annuities.  There was supposed to be some agreement clearing off all annuities.  The answer I got <Col N="642" /> was that this question is one that has been urged before now.</P>

      <P>He got in what he wanted to say about the annuities.  I am not a farmer but, being in this House since 1943, I have had as many calls from the farming community as I had from labourers or other people in my constituency.  Deputy Allen is not here to defend the farmers or to say what he thinks of the people of whom I am speaking.  He, as a farmer, would be in a better position to put his views before the Minister.  If there is not some special grant to relieve the people in the Macamores and other centres, then these people will not be able to complete their tillage requirements. What with flood water and bad land, these people have enough to contend with.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider the high valuations on land that is not fit to grow crops.  That is what they asked public representatives to do &mdash; to explain their position to the Minister. We hope to meet him in the very near future and we will give him some idea of the conditions under which those people have to exist.  I suggest that now, when legislation is going through the House, something should be done for them.  If there is nothing in the legislation on this subject, we will be told later on that it is not possible to find a remedy and that we cannot revoke an Act.  I suggest that the Minister should in some special way do something for these people.</P>

      <P>Everybody, but particularly the farming community, will welcome any relief by way of reducing the ever-increasing burden that is placed <Col N="643" /> on the shoulders of rural ratepayers. This Bill, because it brings a certain amount of relief, is welcome, but I suggest it is not going far enough.  There should be other ways whereby we can help the unfortunate ratepayers.  It is a well-known fact that legislation time and again has its repercussions on the ordinary ratepayers.  It is the earnest wish of elected representatives in every county to exercise to the full the social services provided by the Government, but it must be remembered that, when we try to put our social service programme into operation, we are consistently increasing the burdens on our people.</P>
      <P>Housing is one of the burdens that the ratepayer has to bear.  Housing is a very essential thing for our rural population and house building is not going as rapidly as we would wish.  I suggest that the revenue derived from the Hospitals Sweepstakes, instead of being applied to the erection of elaborate hospitals, should be placed at the disposal of the local authorities to enable them to provide adequate housing for our people.</P>

The Minister must bear in mind that our mental hospitals are also a crushing burden. For many years applications have been made to increase the maintenance grant of the patients, yet in spite of the fact that the cost of maintenance is all the time increasing the Minister has never come to the rescue.  He should favourably consider that aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take into consideration the cost of maintaining public highways.  It has been suggested for years that that cost should be borne by State funds. It is well known that the traffic using our roads to-day is much too heavy. When they were constructed, those roads were never intended to carry such heavy transport.  I submit that those roads should now be maintained out of State funds.  There is an <Col N="644" /> employment allowance of £6 10s. 0d. provided in this Bill.  Take our womenfolk&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree that the relief brought about is welcome, but I suggest that the relief should be greater, and that under the employment headings, where an allowance is made for a man, an allowance should also be made for a woman, for the farmer's wife, the farmer's daughter and the farmer's girl.  We all know very well the part which they play in increasing production in the country and they should have first consideration under this particular heading.  I hope that the Minister will take particular notice of that.  The farmer's wife, the farmer's daughter play a more important part in increasing production in this country than any other individual, while little is thought of them in town or country.  They are up at 4 o'clock in the morning and they are the people who tend to increase production by 100 per cent.  They are the mainstay of the whole economy of the State and should have first consideration under this Bill.  It is about time that they were mentioned in this House and that somebody made a plea that they should come within the scope of these Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not got much more to say except that I welcome the Bill, but I would like to tell the Minister how further relief could be brought about. People in the cities seem to think that farmers are spoon fed all the time but that is not true.  In England and across the Border they are getting relief and subsidies that go to reduce the cost of production.  Something must be done in the near future to reduce the ever-increasing burden on the farmer and I consider that anything above a rate of <Col N="645" /> 7/6 in the £ should be paid out of State funds, because the burden on the agricultural community is unbearable.</P>

      <P>As has been said, the continuation of this Bill for another year is a considerable help to the agricultural community.  When we consider that increased agricultural production is essential for the economic welfare of the country, the Government, even at this late stage, should have taken steps to increase that production and to induce, help and assist the farmers to achieve that objective.</P>
      <P>The burden of local rates on the agricultural community has assumed alarming proportions and, if my information is correct, the rates will be up next year in every county from 4/- to 6/- in the £.  This Bill, while it gives a good deal of assistance, will be very little use when that burden is imposed.</P>

I would be glad if the Minister would check up again before saying that my statement is incorrect. I would advise him to inquire back to his Department after listening to what I have to say.  I assert, notwithstanding what the Minister said, that in many counties the rates will be increased from 4/- to 6/- in the £.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The month of March when the rates are struck will tell us, and meanwhile I assert that this is not sufficient to meet the increased burden.  However, whether it is or not the Government has made an agreement with Britain by which it is expected that production will be increased in this country.  We are expected to be as good as, if not better than, the farmers in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, but they &mdash; as has been pointed out &mdash; are free from rates on agricultural lands and agricultural <Col N="646" /> buildings.  Although we have the land annuities no longer, it is a fact that owing to the increase in the rates, and notwithstanding this relief, the burden of the rates is now higher than when we had the full land annuities plus the rates of that time.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that you have C.I.E. running buses on the roads, that you have commercial lorries, hackney cars and private cars, the road tax paid by these vehicle owners is sufficient to relieve the local bodies of all responsibility for the maintenance of roads and that money should be put to the relief of the rates.</P>
      <P>I know that the Bill is the matter before the House, but these are just a few points on it.  In regard to the grant for the relief of the rates, other Deputies referred to hardships and Deputy Heskin pointed out that women employees should be taken into account.  I think that they should and I would urge that to the Minister.</P>
      <P>But there is another type of what might be called border case, where a farmer has two farms, each in a different county.  He is resident in this county and does all his tillage here but because there are no permanent employees in the adjoining county he gets no relief from the rates except the primary allowance.  If he divides his employees and has, say, two in this county and two in that, rather than four or five or six in this county and none in that, he gets no relief except the primary relief, although all the tillage for both farms is in this county. That farmer is suffering from a disability, because in accordance with the tillage requirements he does all the tillage for both farms in one county and he is allowed to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where land was flooded over the past two or three years the Minister should exempt that land from rates for that is one method by which relief can be given.  It is a hardship on a farmer to see his lands flooded for two-thirds of the year and to pay rates on it though it is of no value to him.  I do not know whether it would be necessary to put down an amendment to the Bill to cover that or not, or whether the Minister could do it by statutory Order as I am not fully <i>au fait</i> with that particular matter.  If it is essential the Bill <Col N="647" /> should be amended in order to exempt that sort of land, I think it should be done in order to help that particular type of farmer.  Even the £6 10s. 0d. grant for the worker is a help.  I do not accept the view expressed here that it is not an encouragement to employment.  I say that it is.  I would like to see more of it, thereby making it a greater encouragement to employment. A greater allowance should be made where men are engaged over the winter period and where more men could be taken on to do drainage and sewerage work and so forth.  It should not be necessary to have the employment for the whole year.  If the Minister cannot do that by regulation, and if it is necessary to amend the Statute, that amendment should be put down. I would be glad if the Minister would say whether he can do so by Order under the existing law.</P>
    <P>The Minister boasted about the policy of the Government in assisting agriculture.  Surely he does not expect us to take that statement seriously. Agriculture in this country has suffered more from this administration than it ever suffered from any Government in the world.  It is a well-known fact that the agricultural community, even under the recent agreement, are still suffering the £5 a head penal tariff, as it were, of the economic war.  The fertilisers were stopped from coming in, or a tariff was put on them.</P>

      <P>May I submit respectfully to the Chair that when the Minister, in introducing a Bill, makes a certain assertion or by implication asserts something, surely we are entitled to make reference to it?  In deference to the Chair, and being anxious to meet the Minister in his desire to get through the public business and to let him go to the country as quickly as possible, I will facilitate him and trust that on the Appropriation Bill and on the motion for the adjournment we will be able to discuss the merits of the Government's policy on agriculture.</P>

      <P>I suppose most Deputies feel that this is a nice warm atmosphere for a few pre-election speeches and that, compared with the raw air outside, the environment here is much healthier.  Having said so much, I want to refer to a point raised by Deputy Everett, namely, the case of a person who owns land over £5 in valuation working for a farmer.  It is an important point.  If a farmer is not entitled to the grant when he employs a small landholder the position should be altered in the Bill.  In Leinster, many agricultural workers own farms.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if it would be practicable to help farmers who are now suffering as a result of floods. I have seen many in the last few months, particularly in the last month, in County Waterford.  These farmers are forced to pay large rents and, as a result of flooding, they cannot go on with the sowing of crops or meet their commitments as far as rates and so forth are concerned.  Realising as I do that the Minister feels that he and his Government have done a lot to help the farmers in the past, I would urge upon him that there are many farmers now who cannot meet their liabilities. We may disagree or agree with the Minister as we think fit, but we all agree that at the present time farmers are struggling.  Owing to the high cost of living, they cannot meet their ordinary liabilities at the end of the quarter or of the year.  The farmers in County Waterford, in particular, are most anxious to come under some heading for exceptional treatment so far as rates and annuities are concerned.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about the women and the other people who work with them.  I would stress that point also.</P>

      <P>I want to remind the Minister of the hardy annual.  I want to remind him of the unfortunate agricultural holders within borough boundaries who get no assistance by way of agricultural grant.  It is a great injustice to them having regard to the fact that, owing to the development of the internal combustion engine, farmers 40 and 50 miles from the borough boundary are placed in exactly the same favourable position as the farmers within the borough boundaries. I have in mind a dozen such cases. They have to face a full urban rate of 22/6 in the £ and they get no <Col N="650" /> assistance whatever.  I wonder what the farmers in the agricultural districts would say if they had to face a rate of 22/6 in the £ without getting any assistance whatever from the agricultural grant.  That is an anomaly which I appeal to the Minister to consider. I know he cannot deal with it on this occasion, but he should make provision for it next year, at all events.</P>

      <P>I am amazed at the ingenuity of Deputies in raising matters upon this very narrow Bill&mdash; matters relating to the fundamental principles of the Act.  I submit that the House had to consider whether or not we were going to prolong the Act for another year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a very narrow issue and I must say that, ingenious and all as I might have been if I were in opposition, I would not have had the effrontery, the audacity or the hardihood to range over the wide field which some of the Deputies have traversed in this House to-day.  Deputy MacEoin, Deputy Heskin, Deputy Sheldon and every Deputy in this House knows that there is no possibility of amending this Bill in the fundamental way they propose. It is a case of either &ldquo;take the Bill or leave it.&rdquo;  If we do not get it to-day we may not get it at all because the Parliamentary programme is, as I have said, overladen.  The Deputies are champing at the bit anxious to get a start in the electoral race &mdash; even those who have very little chance of finishing it &mdash; and for that reason I think it is about time they were getting their feet in the saddle and donning their colours for the start off.  We are all anxious to dispose of this business. We can make some allowance for the electioneering attitude adopted by some Deputies, but we must get down to hard facts.  Deputy Hughes quite occasionally advances ludicrous arguments in this House; I never heard a more ludicrous argument against a Bill than the argument he advanced to-day. He alleged that the Government was taxing raw material.  He called land raw material.  There is no tax on land as such in this country.  There is a rate levied upon the occupier of land in relation to the property he owns or occupies because that property <Col N="651" /> is taken as a rough measure of his income and his ability to contribute to the cost of local services.  Rates are, if you like, assessed by reference to the land a man occupies and the rates are levied upon him in the same way as income-tax is levied and assessed in reference to the income which an individual enjoys.  It is quite misleading to say that the Government is taxing land.  It is still more misleading to say that the Government is taxing the raw material of the farmer.  It is dishonest to describe land as raw material in an attempt to bolster up a specious argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the first time the Deputy has used this argument <Col N="652" /> here.  He said we are taxing the farmer's raw material.  Land is not raw material.  Land, like buildings and other fixed assets, is a means of production. These fixed assets are rated. Railways are rated and canals are rated.  On Deputy Hughes' conception as to what constitutes raw material these could as aptly be called raw material as land.  They are not raw material any more than land is. Raw material is something which is taken in a raw unfinished state, worked upon, fashioned and finished and then sold to the consumer who eats it, or wears it, or uses it as a tool or instrument of production, or even as a luxury or as an amenity.  That is not the case with land.  Deputy Hughes plants his wheat and his beet every year but when he harvests his crop and sells it does he sell his farm with it?  Of course he does not.  His crop goes but his land remains in his possession, not as raw material &mdash; as Deputy Hughes would like the ignorant to believe &mdash; but as an instrument of production.  I hope that we shall hear no more of this suggestion that we are taxing the farmer's raw material.  One might as well say that when a motor car is taxed one is taxing the hackney driver's raw material. When Córas Iompair Éireann pay a road tax, assessed by reference to their buses and rolling stock, one might as well say that we are taxing their raw material.  We are not.  Even Deputy Hughes ought to know that. He does know it, of course.  It is the Deputy's particular technique to try to mislead those who are more ignorant than he is and we, therefore, get this type of dishonest argument trotted out by the Deputy here and, no doubt, repeated down the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having dealt with that point now, I want to deal with one or two others. Deputy Sheldon suggested that he does not like the employment allowance. That may be Deputy Sheldon's particular view but the employment allowance, on the other hand, seems to be very popular with the great majority of the Deputies in the House and with the great majority of the farmers throughout the country.  It is not meant to indemnify the farmer for the cost of employing people unnecessarily. It is meant as a gesture and as an inducement <Col N="653" /> which will turn the scale between keeping a man in employment and doing without him.  It is assumed, of course, that when a man is kept in employment the farmer will find something profitable and useful for him to do and to that extent the employment allowance will contribute to increased production and more efficient production.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheldon also suggested that there was a tendency for the Government to transfer to the ratepayers an increase in proportion to the cost of the public services.  In so far as these services are primarily for local benefit and for the advantage of the local community, surely the local community should shoulder the first responsibility for them.  If we are going to have sanitary services, if we are going to have good roads, if we are going to have good houses, if we are going to provide proper hospitals for a locality, surely the first obligation to meet the cost of these things must necessarily repose upon the local community.  You cannot expect that people in other parts of the country who will not derive immediate benefit from these things should bear the cost of them.  Let each man in his own place bear his fair share of the cost of these services from which he derives the first benefit.  That is the whole principle upon which the cost of community services can be apportioned as between the local community and the people as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the point made by Deputy Sheldon and, to some extent, by Deputy Heskin. Deputy Heskin wanted us to divert the proceeds of the sweepstakes from their proper course to that of relieving the local authority of the obligation of providing some part of the cost of housing their people.  Of course if we did that we would have only two choices before us: either to do without hospitals or to compel the local authority to build hospitals unaided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Or to get them to run a sweepstake themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be very like taking in one another's washing. Deputy Heskin wanted not merely to divert the proceeds of the hospital sweepstakes from the purpose for which these sweepstakes were initiated to that of relieving the local authority of the modest obligation which at present exists upon them to provide proper housing for the local community, but also to transfer the burden of maintaining the roads from the local authority to the State. Deputy MacEoin followed on the same lines.  As a matter of fact, the road users, through the Road Fund and through the Exchequer, are already bearing a very considerable proportion of the cost of maintaining the roads of this country.  At present the Road Fund is being utilised to the fullest extent of its revenues to assist the local authorities in maintaining the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Heskin also stated that the whole burden of maintaining mental hospitals should be transferred to the central authority.  I think the first <Col N="655" /> obligation of looking after its own sick and infirm must rest on the local community. That is the fundamental principle upon which the whole of the local social services have been built up&mdash; that it is the duty of a person to look after, first of all, the members of his own family and then to assist, to the extent to which his resources will permit, in looking after those of his neighbours who are in need of social assistance. It is only when the capacity of the local community to do those things is exceeded that the people as a whole, through the State, can properly be brought in.</P>
    <P>What would be the position of Deputy Heskin and the other Deputies who have been urging that these obligations should be transferred from the local authority to the State if in fact this thing were done?  Surely they would not expect that they would be permitted to run these concerns; that they would be permitted any longer to have any say in the management or administration of housing or hospitals or of the maintenance of the roads. Inevitably, the first consequence would be the wiping out of the local authorities. I do not think that would be a good thing.  But those who have made these suggestions must be prepared to accept the consequences of them.  That would be one of the first consequences. There would be no need to have local authorities here, because they would not take any part in providing the cost of these services and, therefore, they would have no right to be represented in their administration.</P>
    <P>The next thing is that there would be a considerable increase in the rates of taxation which would be necessary in order to maintain these services.  In present circumstances, that increase could only be met from one source. Inevitably, it would have to be met by increasing indirect taxation, by transferring the present burdens from property and land on to the back of the general body of the community in the form, as I have said, of indirect taxation, which tends to be regressive taxation, with the consequence that the poor under that dispensation would pay a greater proportion of the costs of <Col N="656" /> the public services and particularly of the local services than they do at the present time.  That is in fact what the representatives of the land owners in this assembly have been advocating when they say to us &mdash; as Deputy Heskin, Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Cogan did &mdash;&ldquo;Transfer the cost of roads, hospitals and mental hospitals to the State&rdquo;.  They must know that in present circumstances these costs could not be met out of the proceeds of direct taxation, that the increase would have to be provided for by means of taxes on food, taxes again upon beverages, taxes upon what is now described by the Opposition as a luxury, tobacco, and taxes upon amusements.</P>

      <P>The purpose of moving this amendment is to try to provide for the position which exists at present in regard to the officers and servants of the Dublin Fire Brigade.  I understand that in the case of an officer or servant of the brigade who is compelled to retire after ten years' service through physical inability to continue in his employment, the corporation has power to give certain added years' service.  In the section as it stands it is proposed, of course, to give added years of service when the officer has completed 20 years and in respect of service in excess of 20 years, in fact, to double the allowance.  Our submission would be that the provision which would apply in respect of the case which would arise under Section 23, sub-section (2), paragraph 3, under which an officer who has become incapable of performing his duties by reason of permanent infirmity of mind or body and has not less than ten years of pensionable service, should apply to officers of the Dublin Fire Brigade, so that added years could be granted if the local authority felt that course justified, subject, of course, to the sanction of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unable to accept this amendment as I think the proposals contained in the Bill are very generous.  The basis taken in the Bill is that which is conceded to officers and servants who have the charge and care of patients under the Mental Care and Treatment Bill of 1945.  It is the usual concession for posts necessitating early retirement.  The position is that if a fire brigade officer enters the service at 21, and retires at 55 he will get full pension, that is forty-eightieths. A person who enters at 20 and retires <Col N="658" /> at 50 on any of the usual grounds of retirement such as ill-health and who has not been removed from office for any cause such as misconduct or unfitness would also be entitled to the full pension.  I think that, in justice, we cannot go any further than we have already done in the Bill and I suggest the Deputy should not press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I admit the force of the Minister's argument in relation to the actual terms of the Bill but, in so far as the Bill has been recommitted, would he not consider the position in relation particularly to officers in the service of the fire brigade, owing to the nature of their employment, its strenuous character, their exposure to physical exhaustion and the inclemency of the weather, which has a particular effect on their health?  If my information is correct, it has been the practice of the Dublin Corporation where a retirement takes place through ill-health after completion of ten years' service, to give certain added years' service.  Would the Minister consider the possibility of dealing with this particular matter on its limited scale rather than on the broader scale suggested in the amendment?  I appreciate that our amendment applies rather widely, but if the Minister would be prepared to allow the Corporation to give added years in the particular cases which I have mentioned it would meet us.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  An explanatory memorandum has been circulated with the Bill which will help Deputies to understand its provisions.  The laws of all countries relating to patents, designs and trade marks provide for certain periods of time within which application must be made or fees must be paid in order to obtain and maintain the protection of the law.  If these times are not observed, applications for protection are refused or existing rights become void.  In addition, the protection afforded is only operative in the country in which it is given and inventors, manufacturers and traders are obliged to seek protection in any other countries in which they are interested.  Accordingly, not only our own nationals but also foreigners are concerned in the settlement of the legal consequences that may follow from the non-observance of these periods of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to the war, with its repercussions on the economic life of every country, many of our own nationals and foreigners who had industrial property rights were unable to comply with the necessary requirements within the stipulated times.  The Governments of the various countries took different steps to meet that position. Some from the outset prolonged the stipulated times; others, on the contrary, took no action.  With the return of peace it became necessary for the various countries to find a solution of these difficulties.  The International Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property is the instrument of the International Union which comprises 43 countries, including this country. Through the Swiss Government, a conference was convened for the purpose of finding a uniform solution for the problem and to conclude an agreement. That conference was held at Neuchatel in February last and it was attended by delegates from 27 countries; five other countries were represented by <Col N="660" /> observers.  The agreement drawn up at the conference was signed by the representatives of 24 States and two further States have since adhered to it.  At the conference the observers from the United States and Canada indicated they would recommend their Governments to sign the agreement.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to implement the agreement and is confined to the stipulations of the agreement.  The passage of the Bill is a matter of urgency, since most of the periods provided for in the agreement will expire on 30th June, 1948.  Accordingly, only a little time remains within which interested parties may avail of the benefits of the agreement.  That is why it is desirable to have it passed in the present session.</P>

      <P>I want to raise a very small point on this section.  I take it this means that a patentee may restore his patent, when it has lapsed through non-payment of fees, by the payment of the appropriate amount.  I want to make a case to the Minister. I do not suppose it will occur very often and possibly he may say that it will never happen.  A patent might, as far as this country is concerned &mdash; and remember this country is considered very small beer by people who have patent rights on manufacturing certain things &mdash; have lapsed here and somebody might have started to manufacture some article which was covered by the patent.  I am not suggesting that a person, when he had made his peace with the Government Department over his patent rights, should not get his patent back again, but what I do not <Col N="661" /> think he should be allowed to do is this, that he should then be allowed to go for someone who has infringed the patent, retrospectively.  If the Minister could assure me on that point, I would feel quite certain it was all right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That hits at the principle of the whole thing.  If a person gets a patent in consequence of having disclosed an invention, then so long as that patent is valid nobody can operate the invention here unless under licence from the patentee.  In so far as the patent may have lapsed through the non-fulfilment of the obligations of the Act, such as the payment of fees, arising out of the war, then the purpose of the international convention is to restore the patent rights where, in the opinion of the controller, the non-payment of the fees was due to circumstances arising out of the war.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not answered the point I am making.  The patentee's patent in this country may have lapsed through a variety of circumstances.  If somebody finds that out and starts to manufacture some article covered by that patent and then the person comes back and makes his peace with the Patent Office, that person should not, in my opinion, be penalised for something that was not patented in this country when he was manufacturing it.</P>

      <P>In Section 4 we are dealing only with the question of the non-payment of fees.  There is in Section 11 a safeguard for a person who has undertaken in good faith the exploitation of an invention in the circumstances mentioned by the Deputy.  The section provides that he may continue to do so notwithstanding the grant of patent for an invention or the registration of a design pursuant to an application made by virtue of Section 2, or the restoration of a patent for the invention under Section 4.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) (for the Minister for Justice)</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this Bill, a Chinn Comhairle, I would like to say that a serious situation has arisen as regards premises held by the Commissioners of Public Works on short term tenancies or leases as Garda Síochána stations.  There are approximately 200 stations held on yearly tenancies terminable for the most part on three to six months' notice by the landlord.  There are also over 40 stations held on leases with less than three years to run.  The big increase in the letting and sale values of house property has given rise to demands by landlords of station premises for higher rents or recovery of possession.  In most of these cases the demands have been settled by negotiation.  In a few cases where the station could not be closed and no alternative accommodation was available, rents which were undoubtedly exorbitant had to be agreed to.  The remaining cases are those in which negotiations have failed completely, and there is every likelihood that the number of such cases will grow.  In their negotiations the Commissioners of Public Works did not exclude the question of purchase where the station building seemed suitable for buying.</P>
      <P>A few of the particularly difficult cases have been solved by commandeering the premises under the powers conferred by Article 38 of the Emergency Powers Order, 1939, as continued by the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946.  But it is felt that the problem should be dealt with directly and specifically &mdash; hence this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The acquisition of sites for new stations is another aspect of the problem of providing accommodation for the Garda Síochána.  Occasionally, for one reason or another the Commissioners of Public Works find it very hard to procure a site for a station. They do not like to seek powers of compulsory acquisition and still less would <Col N="663" /> they like to invoke the powers, if granted.  They are satisfied, however, that, in existing conditions, and especially having regard to the extensive building programme for new Garda stations, the grant of such powers to them might serve a useful purpose, if only as a background to negotiations with an unreasonable party, or as an aid to overcoming defects in title which sometimes prevent the acquisition of suitable property.</P>
    <P>The need for building houses for married members of the Garda Síochána was forced on the Department's notice over 12 years ago.  The difficulties of married men in finding accommodation when transferred to new centres were then serious enough but during the last five years they have become extreme.  The Garda administrative machine is badly hampered by the position and, during the emergency, it was decided that a scheme for building houses for married members at all centres where they were considered necessary should be prepared and that the work, which would be spread over a number of years, should be put in hands as soon as circumstances permitted after the emergency.  One big obstacle to the smooth progress of the scheme will, as in the case of new stations, be the acquisition of sites. The opportunity presented by the introduction of this Bill has been taken to provide for the compulsory acquisition of sites where necessary.</P>
    <P>I think that these are the main points in connection with the Bill.  I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  I have no objection to the remaining stages being taken now.</P>

      <P>I do not think that that is correct.  When the State acquires property or sites, the general provision in default of agreement with the owner with regard to compensation is that the matter is referred to an independent arbitrator and if the Deputy looks at Section 2, sub-section (3), he will see that an Order under this section may incorporate any of the provisions of the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, and the Land Clauses Act, so far as they are not inconsistent with the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.  They will be used appropriately to secure final arbitration in these questions of compensation. I do not know whether the Deputy thinks it necessary to go to the court, having regard to the fact that the method of arbitration is precisely similar in these cases as where the Government or the local authority acquire land for public purposes.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Health Services (Financial Provisions) Bill, 1947&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  When the Health Bill was under discussion in the Dáil earlier during the year Deputies were anxious about the cost of that Bill.  I was not, at the time, in a position to discuss that item because the White Paper had not proceeded far enough to give me authority to make a definite statement. By the time the Bill had reached the Seanad I was in a position to do so.  I told the Seanad on that occasion that, as far as the health services were concerned, there would be no extra cost on the local authority for some years to come.  The idea I had in mind at that time was that we would stabilise the cost of health services for each local authority and that the extra cost would be paid by the State until we had reached a stage where the local authority and the State would be paying half and half and, after that, they would continue to go fifty-fifty in the cost of the health services.  I also made clear, and I want to repeat now, that that arrangement does not include capital costs such as building hospitals and so forth.  As Deputies will realise, the capital cost of building a hospital or institution is met to a very substantial extent by moneys from the <Col N="666" /> Hospitals Trust Fund.  In fact, they are getting better terms on the capital expenditure than they would actually be getting on the health services.  This Bill is brought forward to implement what was mentioned during the debate in the Seanad.  A memorandum was circulated with this Bill.  It explains some rather intricate details into which I need not go very fully now except to give a very broad outline of what the Bill means.</P>
      <P>The Bill is designed to ensure that the rating authorities will not be required to meet, in the year 1948-49 and subsequent years, any expenditure on health services greater than the amount met from local rates in the present year.  This is to be done by fixing a standard expenditure, which will be the expenditure borne by all local authorities in the appropriate county or county borough in the present financial year.  Some health services are still administered by urban authorities, port sanitary authorities, and so forth.  We also have the case that mental hospital costs are sometimes administered by a joint committee. The total costs of health services for the county or the county borough will be taken.  Then the receipts will be deducted &mdash; say, payments by patients or may be from land attached to the mental hospital, and so forth.  We will then get what is called a standard expenditure for the year. It will be impossible, of course, to fix that for some months to come until the accounts for the year 1947-1948 are audited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 goes on to lay down the obligation on the State of paying the health expenditure over and above that paid by the local authority until the State is paying as much as the local authority.  After that they pay an equal share.  Sections 5 to 8 deal with grants of various kinds that are paid at the moment.  These grants are being abolished just for the sake of simplicity. There are various grants such as the local taxation grants &mdash; the estate duty grant and the licence duty grant&mdash; and so forth.  It is as well that they should be taken away and that a lump sum be given to each county or county borough.  These various grants arose <Col N="667" /> haphazardly.  I think the first was in 1888.  There was another in 1898.  In recent times we have had quite a number of them, such as the free milk grant, maternity and child welfare grant, tuberculosis grant, venereal disease grant, and a grant for school medical services.  These will all be removed under this Bill and a lump sum paid over, whatever it may be, as laid down in this Bill.  In itself that will save a good deal of clerical work in working out the various amounts. These amounts were based on certain items of expenditure.  For instance, from the licence duty grant, which was established in 1898, certain payments were made in respect of salaries of sanitary authorities and towards the maintenance of mental hospital patients.</P>
    <P>The next grant, the estate duty grant, was given in respect of public assistance services.  It is evident from the title of the others what their purposes were &mdash; the free milk grant, etc. There had to be a certain calculation on each of these.  The simplest thing is to give whatever is due in one lump sum.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that the estate duty grant will not be payable in future to the Guarantee Fund.  Up to this it was part of the Guarantee Fund. It has not now the original meaning. Hitherto, in case the annuities were not paid a deduction could be made from the grant for the county.  The Guarantee Fund is quite sound without this because part of the agricultural grant goes into the Guarantee Fund amounting this year, I think, to something like £1,870,000.  The taking away of this small estate grant of something like £150,000 is not going to lead the Guarantee Fund to bankruptcy or anything like that.  The Bill, if enacted, will not add to the cost of the health services of a county for some time to come.  At the present time 16 per cent. of the total cost of the health services is paid by the State and 84 per cent. by the local authorities.  That percentage will vary gradually from year to year until the two percentages come to be equal, that is, 50 per cent. each.  This Bill is not implementing any part of the White Paper <Col N="668" /> except the financial provisions which were dealt with in that Paper.  Even if the other provisions of the White Paper are not proceeded with for some time to come &mdash; I have no reason for saying they will not, but suppose they are not &mdash; this Bill is necessary to save the local authorities from increased expenditure under the various provisions of the Health Act which was passed some time ago.  That is the only part of the White Paper implemented so far, namely, the part dealing with finance. Now, there are members here who are also members of local authorities.  They know that about this time of the year local authorities have to prepare their estimates for the coming year and it is important that they should know where and how they stand.  The new expenditure on health is a fairly big item for local authorities and that is why I was anxious to get this Bill brought to the Dáil so that the principle of it could be decided in order to enable the local authorities to proceed with their estimates in the knowledge that they need not budget for more in the coming year for health services than they have spent in 1947-48.</P>
    <P>I ask the Dáil, therefore, to give this Bill a Second Reading, in the belief that it should be acceptable to everybody in the House and on the plea of urgency, in order to enable the local authorities to proceed with their estimates.  If the Bill is accepted in principle I do not think it will need much detailed discussion in regard to amendments or anything of that kind.</P>

      <P>On the Money Resolution, I would like to point out that while you are intending to provide a substantial increase by way of State grant, which we all welcome, at the same time there is a big expenditure contemplated here.  I think it is desirable that every section of the community should contribute to health services.  The Minister knows, because of his experience of our main industry, that that industry contributes by far the biggest amount.  I think the aim should be to provide more State assistance than the 50 per cent. specified. The tendency is to throw too great a burden on the agricultural industry.  I suggest to the Minister that his concern should be to ensure that all sections of the community make a fair contribution.  People in receipt of big salaries will not, and do not, contribute an equitable amount as compared with the people living on the land.</P>

In eight or nine years' time, if we are here, we will then ask the local authorities to bear the cost and when they reach that stage it will be time enough to discuss the matter. As regards relieving the agricultural community, I think that should be dealt with under the agricultural grant. <Col N="670" /> That grant, by the way, is fairly substantial now.  It is something over £3,000,000 this year.</P>

      <P>That relates to Section 21, which provides for the addition of years to the pensionable local service of established officers in certain eventualities and they are set out as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  he is removed from his office for a cause other than misconduct or unfitness,</P>
      <P>(b)  his office is abolished, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  his position has, in the opinion of the appropriate Minister, been materially altered to his detriment by changes in its conditions made without reasonable cause and he resigns his office with <Col N="672" /> the consent of the appropriate Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These particular words are causing a certain amount of anxiety on our side of the House, more particularly when we recall that an almost similar phrase was incorporated in the Transport Bill of 1944 and over which a battle royal was fought in this House for hours, which was eventually resolved in the Seanad when the Minister, in fact, did give way.  I can well understand the mind of the Minister when making provision for an individual if his position is altered owing to &ldquo;changes in its conditions made without reasonable cause&rdquo;, but the very reverse can apply as well.  Supposing a man was in a particular position and that improved methods of working were introduced; then because of the restrictive character of this particular sub-section his position is not covered.  It is because of that we are anxious that the section should be left in its broadest form and that as wide an interpretation as possible should be given to it, particularly as it is possible, in certain eventualities, that improved methods of working or ancillary conditions of that kind could be introduced to justify a change and the change is not covered in this particular section.  It is to that point that we advert now.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I could not accept that amendment, because it seems to me that, if I were to do that, then I would have to accept the position that, if the conditions of service were altered to the detriment of a person in any way, he would have the right to retire.  I should be putting that person almost in the position of an Article X officer, a position which has been very greatly resented by a great many people.  It seems to me then a case of accepting the clause as it stands and relying upon the local authority and, eventually perhaps, the Minister to act with ordinary justice and decency or striking out paragraph (c) altogether.  We could not put ourselves in a position that, if there is any material alteration in the conditions of service, a person is entitled to retire on pension and have years added.  I <Col N="673" /> am afraid you would have to put in that saver, because there may be changes perhaps in the situation of the officers, minor changes in hours, perhaps instituted even by a Government statute.  I think that we could not possibly accept the clause with that saver deleted.</P>

      <P>I would be satisfied if the Minister would have a look at this before the Bill goes through finally, so that the legislation in this Bill might be in line with the Transport Bill.  As a matter of fact, you will find that the plea I am making is on all-fours with the discussion which took place then and the conditions are more or less similar.  It does not necessarily arise that the man would have to retire or that the services would be denuded immediately because of an alteration of conditions.  There is a provision in the Transport Bill under which compensation might be paid if a man has to accept, say, a lower category because of the change in conditions. We think that there is a good deal in this and, if the Minister would like to have another look at it, we are prepared to withdraw the amendment at this stage.</P>

      <P>I would rather that we should dispose of this.  I would not like to leave the Deputy under the impression that I can reconsider my attitude in relation to this matter.  The fact is that this is not a new principle which we are importing here.  We find these words in the Local Government Act of 1925, Section 44 and also in Section 8 of the Act of 1919.  In fact the comparison here is not between what is in the Transport Bill and what are the conditions in the Civil Service. There is a much greater similarity. As it stands, this clause is a remarkable concession.  We are giving a person the right to claim added years and, in the light of that, I shall have to stand on the only saver we have, that an officer could not take undue advantage of paragraph (c).</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="674" /> In page 11, lines 13 to 18, inclusive, to delete paragraph (b).</P>
    <P>We regard this Bill as a useful Bill so far as its broad provisions are concerned and it is because of that we are concerned that it will contain no section or sub-section which may be subsequently regarded as a blemish on its general set-up.  We feel, however, that if this particular sub-section remains it will be a blemish on the whole Bill, and it will be rather a pity that that should be so.  I refer particularly to the term &ldquo;with diligence and fidelity&rdquo;.  I take it the Minister has taken that from the Civil Service superannuation code and I am prepared to say that he may have justification in certain particular cases, so far as he is concerned, in bringing in a paragraph of that particular kind.</P>
    <P>There may be some instances in local services where certain individuals are a cause of trouble to the manager, but I suggest that they are very few in numbers and they might be dealt with in the ordinary course of discipline, in so far as it is operated between the manager and the staff rather than that a sub-section giving such wide and arbitrary powers as are suggested here to the local manager, should be incorporated in the Bill.  It may be argued that the system works satisfactorily in the Civil Service.  No doubt it does, but there is no analogy between conditions in the Civil Service and those in the department of a local service. In the Civil Service, the individual affected would be assured that his case would go through a certain number of channels whereas the individual in the local service is very close to his local manager.  Human nature being what it is, you might have a manager who might perhaps have a &ldquo;set&rdquo; on a particular individual.  Instead of employing the ordinary disciplinary code throughout that man's service, he might wait until the eve of his retirement to notify him that he was unsatisfactory and that he proposed to report accordingly to the Minister.  I say that it is unthinkable that an instrument of torture of that particular type should be allowed to hang over the head of the average official for the whole of his service.  It is unthinkable that an <Col N="675" /> officer of a local authority should feel that perhaps at the last moment of his official life, when perhaps for one reason or another the value of his services might be diminishing, a provision of that kind might be operated to his prejudice, not by a manager who is acquainted with his whole service but by one who had come newly into the service and who did not understand the full value of the man's earlier services. This section could be used in a very arbitrary manner by a manager of that type.</P>
    <P>The Minister will say that there is a right of appeal.  I am bound to say that that is so.  An appeal in that case would not be taken lightly and would be dealt with in a just and fair way, I am sure, but as I say, the general principle is something for which we cannot stand.  The individual should not be made to feel that there is only one barrier between him and possible victimisation.  In my opinion it would not make for good service because the individual concerned would not know from day to day how he stood.  I suggest, therefore, that while I can appreciate that this sub-section would relate only to a small number of individuals, the action of the Minister in introducing it for the service as a whole is not justified.  I should be very glad if, in the interests of getting a good measure of co-operation in the working of the measure, he would see his way to withdraw it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan has made a case in regard to the difficulties facing an officer who may find on the eve of his retirement that his pension and lump sum prospects are prejudiced by the production of an adverse report of a superior officer.  These difficulties are increased when it comes to the case of ordinary servants and workers.  One of the most common experiences of a trade union official is the type of case where, a small incident having arisen regarding a particular worker, one is faced with an apparent record of unsatisfactory conduct extending over a considerable period of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Immediately the question is asked whether the existence of that record should now hold against the working <Col N="676" /> man if these incidents have not been the subject of inquiry and if the working man has not been afforded an opportunity of hearing the charges and making his defence and of having the matter satisfactorily cleared up to the extent of having it decided whether the charges should stand or be withdrawn. Unfortunately, the practice has developed of having a record built up in which you have a series of complaints accruing over a period of years of which the workman himself would have no knowledge.  Sometimes he was not even spoken to at the time he was alleged to be guilty of the objectionable conduct.  A note was merely made by a supervisory officer that on such an occasion such and such a thing took place.  Years afterwards when the record comes to be examined the worker is expected to be able to meet and stand up to these particular charges in connection with the service in which he is engaged.  Normally we might argue in theory that if an employee, whether he be an officer or other servant, remains in the employment of a local authority for such a period of years as would qualify him under Section 23 for a retiring allowance, then <i>ipso facto</i> his service must have been satisfactory and that if he were not diligent and faithful in his service, the onus for continuing him in its employment rests on his superior officers.  Possibly that is not a satisfactory approach to the question but I think the approach in the Bill is even less desirable because in the first place there is no provision whereby his record as a diligent and faithful officer is noted for the period of his service and whereby he is made aware of the creation of a record which is going to be held satisfactory or, on the other hand, unsatisfactory.  It is this kind of retrospective decision that is most open to objection.</P>
    <P>When we come to relate Section 23 to Section 26, if the local authority decide he has not served in such office with satisfaction and has not been diligent and faithful, we find that they can reduce the lump sum allowed and they are bound to make that reduction to the extent of not less than 50 per cent.  Once they have decided that he <Col N="677" /> has not measured up completely to requirements, the actual extent of the punishment is fixed but it bears no relation to the actual extent of his unsatisfactory conduct or his lack of diligent and faithful service.  That seems to me to be most arbitrary and it involves a penalty which can be exceptionally severe.  If we take the case of an officer who was diligent and faithful in so far as average requirements are concerned but who might not be completely satisfactory, there might be a feeling, that while he would not be entitled to the full lump sum allowance, at least the measure of reduction should not be to the extent of 50 per cent.  Yet the Bill, as it now stands, binds the local authority to make a reduction to that extent.  I feel, if it is necessary to require that compliance with the provisions of this pension code will also require diligent and faithful discharge of duties, that an attempt should be made to achieve that end in some other form.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of the sub-section is open, I will not say to gross abuse, but to very grievous complaint.  It may be a complaint that will arise not at the time when the circumstances will be fresh, but perhaps at the termination of 40 years and some of the incidents that will then be brought up to constitute the record of unsatisfactory service may have taken place ten, 20 or 25 years previously.  Deputy O'Sullivan says that they may have taken place during the lifetime of the manager who may no longer exercise authority and, indeed, who may no longer be in the flesh, and therefore could not be appealed to to clear up particular matters.</P>
    <P>If that section were to remain, it would be an essential that a system of recording and dealing with complaints and charges in respect of a workman should be evolved so that, when a complaint is made by any superior officer, that complaint will be immediately inquired into and the worker afforded an opportunity of defending himself.  Only then will it be placed on an official record to which reference can be made.  That has been found necessary in private employment, and I do <Col N="678" /> not know any reason why employment with local authorities should be regarded as more secure in the interests of the individual employed.</P>
    <P>While we are discussing this in relation to officers, the objections are stronger when you deal with the ordinary workman, who will also be affected by a later section and who, as we know from experience, has to deal with this difficulty continuously during his service &mdash; the question of a record being produced on a particular occasion of which often he has no knowledge; he has never had an opportunity of being acquainted with the particular items, or of defending himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we must approach this question with a clear idea of the respective positions of the local authority and the officer or servant, particularly with respect to the benefits which will accrue to the officers and employees of local authorities.  It is estimated that actuarially the cost of those benefits will be from 16 per cent. to 17 per cent. of the salaries. Against that we are asking officers to pay only 5 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am stating that as a background to the consideration of this amendment.  It will be seen that the granting of the pensions is, so to speak, rather more of an act of grace on the part of the local authority than of financial entitlement, or, shall we put it this way, if it is not entirely an act of grace, then the local authority must receive some consideration for the fact that they are bearing such a large proportion of the total cost of the benefits under the Bill and the only consideration we are asking is that the officers should serve with diligence and fidelity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite accept Deputy Martin O'Sullivan's and Deputy Larkin's contention that neither officers nor other employees should be made to feel that they may lose their pensions through arbitrary or unjust actions.  There can be no controversy about the acceptance of that position.  We have provision in Section 73 of the Bill for an appeal to <Col N="679" /> the Minister which would perhaps be some safeguard, almost a total safeguard, against any injustice being done to any person.  It would be a total safeguard if it was not that sometimes even Ministers are fallible.  While I concede that officers should not feel that they may lose their pensions by the arbitrary or unjust decision of a manager or any other authority, at the same time we cannot permit any servant or employee of a local authority to feel that he can get this pension just as a matter of form, to be granted to him irrespective of how he may have served the local authority.  That is the problem which we are trying to solve by including this proviso in the Bill, that no officer or employee of a local authority can be permitted, in view of what I have stated as to the financial apportionment of the cost of this scheme, to believe that he gets his pension irrespective of how he may serve.</P>
    <P>Some people say we should take up a rigorous attitude, that if the officer or employee does not serve faithfully and zealously he should not be permitted to continue in the employment of the local authority.  I would hesitate, ruthless and all as I am supposed to be, to go so far as that; in any event, it would be impossible to enforce it because that is not the tradition&mdash; we may as well face up to it &mdash; which exists in the local services.  I think, for one reason and another, many things are winked at in public employment which would be much more drastically dealt with if the interests of a private employer were concerned.</P>
    <P>I recognise some slight difficulty in what Deputy Larkin and Deputy Martin O'Sullivan have said and I am prepared to give a certain amount of consideration to the arguments they have been making, but I cannot go very far to meet them.  Let me deal with what I think is a misconception of the provision for granting a reduced lump sum.  That was brought in very largely as a compassionate proviso.  It was not brought in with the idea of punishing any person who did not give ordinary day-to-day satisfaction, and let me emphasise that.  It was not brought in to victimise anybody.  It was brought in to meet the case which we are very <Col N="680" /> often up against of a man who served for a long period but who was, perhaps, not very zealous in the supervision of those under him or who was responsible for a grave dereliction of duty by his subordinates and who ought to be punished in one way or another.</P>
    <P>Then there is the case of the man who had become a habitual tippler or who had so deteriorated in character that people would say: &ldquo;You should not have him; you should put him out.&rdquo;  We are often up against a problem of that kind.  You have the man who is failing in the public interest, the man who should not be there because his example is a bad one.  It is my motto, in spite of any sympathy I might feel, to say that the man should be dismissed, and you sometimes have to dismiss a man and leave him without any resources because of the existing state of the law.  This is a provision to enable us to deal with a case of that kind.  It is not with any idea of punishing a man who had rightfully earned his pension by giving average service.  What we intend, when we ask a person to serve with diligence and fidelity, is that he should give the same ordinary satisfaction in his employment as the majority of his colleagues.  That is all that we ask for.</P>
    <P>If it would to some extent prevent &mdash;and I think it would&mdash;too vigorous an interpretation being put on that phrase, I would be prepared to insert in the first line of paragraph (b) after the word &ldquo;that&rdquo;&ldquo;in general he has served in such office with diligence and fidelity&rdquo;.  That would make it quite clear what we are looking for&mdash; that we want ordinary good service. If the Deputy would accept that and if the Ceann Comhairle would permit me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In page 13, line 14, to delete the word &ldquo;five&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;three&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is prompted by the knowledge of the system in operation as far as pensions are concerned in the local government services.  Where these pensions were non-contributory they were generally linked with the idea of deferred payment and the general rates of salaries and wages were taken into consideration. It is through a very wide extension of the precedent of pensions in this case that the contribution prescribed in the Bill is 5 per cent.  We are putting down an amendment that the contribution be 3 per cent. rather than 5 per cent. because we are basing it on the action of the Minister in connection with the Mental Treatment Bill, 1945, where the contribution was and is 3 per cent.  We are anxious to know why the Minister has moved from what was a very good precedent, and why the precedent of the Mental Treatment Bill was not carried out.  The Minister did advert to the question of contribution on a previous amendment and said that it was actuated on a basis of from 15 to 18 per cent.  We would like to know whether there has, in fact, been an actuarial examination of what the position is in respect of pensions; what is the result of that investigation and what it is anticipated the local authority will have to pay to cover the full cost of the services.  It is clear that no charge in respect of this Bill, as far as new entrants into the service are concerned, is likely to arise for the next 30 or 40 years and meanwhile the contribution of 5 per cent. goes into a fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would like to know what sort of fund it is and how it is to be dealt with.  We would like to put it to the Minister that the ordinary workman in the City of Dublin coming in as a new entrant whose wages may run to £5 a week must, under this Bill, pay 5/- a week.  The man down the country with from 50/- to £3 a week must pay <Col N="682" /> about 3/- a week out of that small wage.  That is pretty heavy and will bear on his domestic resources.  The figure of 5 per cent. looks very high and will bear particularly heavily on the workman.  I know that the question of contributory pensions has now become a popular phase of local legislation and examples may be called such as the Electricity Supply Board and other companies where pensions are paid for in this way.  As far as I know, none of these pensions schemes goes as far as a contribution of 5 per cent.  I would like to know what is the value from an actuarial point of view and what the local authority will have to pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy O'Sullivan.  A man with less than £3 a week should not be asked to pay 5 per cent.  It is all right for a man with £7 or £8 a week but it is not right to ask a man in casual work to pay it, or, as is the position in many parts of the country, the man whose wages are stopped on wet days and who may not have his full £3 a week. In these cases 5 per cent. is out of all proportion when we consider that officials with large salaries who did not pay any contribution become entitled to a pension at the age of 65.  I would ask the Minister to give some consideration to the lowest paid man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a marked difference between this and other pension schemes which are also on a contributory basis.  Personally I do not object to contributory schemes on principle. It is the proper thing because it creates interest on the part of the workman. In other schemes there is a percentage payment by officers but in the case of workmen the payment is fixed.  In the Electricity Supply Board it is 1/6 a week and other schemes vary from 1/- to 2s. a week.  In all cases the payment by manual workers is fixed and depends on their ability to pay.  Similarly in the case of officials, the percentage is lower.  Possibly what the Minister says is quite true, namely, that the total cost of this pension code will be fairly large and that the percentage payments, in the form of contributions by officers and servants, will not be of a great order in so far as the <Col N="683" /> total payment is concerned.  The same applies to many of the private pension schemes established and maintained by private employers.  It has always been accepted that, in so far as public employment is concerned, it should seek to give conditions at least not worse than those of the fair employer in private employment.  I am aware of many cases in which the percentages referred to by the Minister a while ago would be similarly reflected by private employers.  The cost of total scheme would represent a cost of 10 per cent. to 15 per cent. yet the contribution required both from the employees and from the manual workers is of a much lower order than that suggested in the Bill.  An ordinary manual worker in Dublin or Cork working for a wage of £4 10s. to £5 per week would be required to pay something like 4/6 to 5/-.  In addition he has to meet other payments of a fixed character in the form of contributions.</P>
      <P>In so far as the road worker, working under the authority of a county council, is concerned, and for whom I think the main benefits are intended, the payment by him of a sum of 2/6 to 3/- per week out of a wage of 60/- does not seem to be acceptable when we consider that pensions are provided by another semi-State authority for a figure of 1/6 per week out of a wage which runs at the present time between £6 and £7 per week.  That matter might be reconsidered in the light of the inability of these workers to pay and thus avoid a situation which has arisen, where, while they appreciated the provisions of the pension code, they felt the charges made were of such an onerous nature that, to a large extent, all the satisfaction and feeling of appreciation were missing.</P>

      <P>I would like to supplement a statement which I have made, lest it be misconstrued.  I said that the effects of the Bill would not be felt for a considerable number of years.

      <P>I think, again, I <Col N="684" /> must remind the House of the very wide scope of the benefits I have given under this Bill.  It not only provides pensions.  It provides a certain measure of life insurance and a certain measure of compensation in the case of injuries sustained in the course of duty by an officer.  It provides female officers and servants with a gratuity on marriage. On top of that it does what no ordinary insurance policy will do &mdash; it provides for the return of the contributions in certain circumstances.  It provides not merely for the return of contributions in the case of a person who leaves the service of a local authority but also for the readmission and reinstatement of his previous pensionable service if he re-enters the employment of a local authority.  All these benefits are provided very largely at the expense of the local authority.  Deputies must remember that I am the only person who can represent the local authority and the taxpayer here and that, therefore, I have to look at both sides of the account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy M. O'Sullivan asked whether we had an actuarial investigation before we formulated the provisions of this Bill.  We did not, but we have had the benefit of seeing the results of certain actuarial investigations.  We know what the trend has been in relation to the Civil Service investigation and on the basis of that I am saying, I think rather conservatively, that the total cost of these benefits will range between 15 per cent. and 16 per cent. and perhaps a great deal more. Towards that we are asking the ultimate beneficiary to contribute 5 per cent., a trifle less, perhaps, than one-third of the total cost.  That is a generous contribution for the rate-payers to make.  I suppose that we should not press that too far.  I do not think I could make any concession in respect of the officers.  I might agree to do so for convenience, because I think it might save the cost of a certain amount of clerical work.  In respect of the servants, if we were to reduce the 5 per cent. to 4? per cent. it would mean that the contribution would be at the rate of ½d. in the shilling.  It would be a convenient way of measuring it.  That is as far as I can go.  I do not think I should be pressed to go <Col N="685" /> further than that.  There is a great deal to be said for keeping the contribution on this basis.  I do not think it would be practicable, particularly in the case of road workers and others, to impose a flat rate of contributions. Their week is sometimes broken.  A man would have to pay his full contribution whether he had a broken week or not.  Therefore, I think we should stick to the percentage basis.  In the case of officers there are so many grades that it would be difficult to get a flat rate of contribution which would be equitable to all concerned. It would weigh more heavily upon the lowly paid and less heavily on the man at the top.  On the whole, there is a great deal to be said for maintaining a percentage contribution.  So far as the position of the servants is concerned I will reduce the rate in the Bill to 4? per cent. but I will retain the 5 per cent. in the case of officers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I had this amendment down on the Report Stage and the Minister is aware of the facts of the case.  This amendment is for the purpose of trying to cover a particular individual who served as a secondary teacher, then served as a technical school teacher for 11 years, then went on to do his degree and served as a secondary teacher while doing that degree, finally coming back as a vocational teacher.  With the exception of two years' break for the purpose of improving his knowledge <Col N="686" /> and qualifications as a teacher there is no fundamental difference between this particular case and the type of case the section is designed to cover.  I think it would be a very grave hardship on this very efficient officer if he were to lose a big number of years' service because of that break of two years.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In pages 34 and 35 to delete Section 79 and substitute the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Where a local authority or mental hospital board granted before the passing of this Act an allowance or a lump sum to or in respect of a person in relation to his having ceased after the 1st day of July, 1940, to hold any office or employment in their service, they may, within 12 months after the passing of this Act, grant one increase (and no more) of the rate of the allowance or the amount of the lump sum, and such increase shall be an increase to such extent as may be sanctioned by the relevant Minister and, in the case of an increase of an allowance, shall have effect as from the date when the office or employment ceased to be held or the 1st day of November, 1946, whichever is the later.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where any such allowance as is referred to in Section 46 of the Act of 1925 was in course of payment on the 1st day of November, 1946, the allowance shall be adjusted, with effect as from that day, in the following manner:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  such part (if any) of the allowance as was computed by reference to the emergency bonus under the Emergency Powers (No. 312) Order, 1944 (S.R. &amp; O., No. 36 of 1944), shall cease to be payable;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="687" /> (b)  the increase or addition added to the allowance under sub-section (2)  of Section 46 of the Act of 1925 shall be adjusted as if it were calculated by reference to a costof-living index figure of 270 and shall thereupon cease to be variable.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where a local authority or mental hospital board grant under this or any other Act an allowance or lump sum to or in respect of a person in relation to his having ceased to hold before the 1st day of April, 1950, any office or employment in their service, they may, in the case of an allowance, grant it at a rate greater, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the relevant Minister, than the rate that would be appropriate therefore apart from this sub-section and, in the case of a lump sum, grant it as of an amount greater, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the relevant Minister, than the amount that would be appropriate therefore apart from this sub-section.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where a person is aggrieved by a refusal or failure during the period of 12 months after the passing of this Act to grant an increase under sub-section (1) of this section, such person may, in the case of a refusal, not later than six months after the refusal, or, in the case of a failure, not later than six months after the expiration of the said period of 12 months, appeal to the relevant Minister against the refusal or failure.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where a person is aggrieved by an increase granted under sub-section (1) of this section, he may, not later than six months after the grant of the increase, appeal against it to the relevant Minister.</P>
    <P>(6)  On an appeal under this section, the relevant Minister may by Order either refuse the appeal or make such provisions as should in his opinion have been made by the local authority or mental hospital board concerned, and any provision so made by the relevant Minister shall have effect as if made by that authority or board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="688" /> (7)  The decision of the relevant Minister on an appeal under this section shall be final.</P>
    <P>(8)  In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;the relevant Minister&rdquo; means&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in relation to a local authority other than a mental hospital authority, the Minister, and</P>
    <P>(b)  in relation to a mental hospital authority, the Minister for Health.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to restore to the local authorities a discretion in relation to the retiring allowances to be paid to officers who retired after the 1st July, 1940, and before the 1st November, 1946, who might be said to be temporarily affected by the Standstill Order.  That is the first object and it is covered by sub-sections (1) and (2) of this section.  Sub-section (3) is designed to deal with the case of those officers who are, so to speak, compulsorily retired under the recent Order fixing the age for retirement at 65.  A number of officers are by reason of that Order leaving the local services earlier than they might otherwise have done.  If it had not been for the Order they would have been permitted to remain in the services and consequently get the benefits of the improved rates of remuneration.  I feel that it is only just that we should permit pensions to be calculated upon the rate of remuneration which they would have enjoyed had they served three years at the now prevailing rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the awkward position under the Labourers Acts in regard to the <Col N="693" /> acquisition of property which is not required for the purposes of the Acts. In Section 7 of one of these Acts there is a provision that in case property of this nature is not required, the original owners and certain other people have certain rights.  I understand that it is now an antiquated provision and that it is the cause of considerable difficulty in administration.  I think that it might be appropriate for the Minister to consider amending Section 32 and whether or not it would be desirable to provide that such powers of acquisition should be freely disposable or interchangeable between schemes.</P>
      <P>For instance, if you have a labourer's cottage that is not required as a labourer's cottage and which might be required for another housing scheme, I suggest that there should be a provision that would enable the Minister to have that change made.  I mention that <i>en passant.</i>  It might not arise under Section 32 but there is no other section which I can think of at the moment under which it would arise. I was not in in time to deal with Section 29, but might I mention now that owing to the extraordinary complexity of the definition of &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; as it exists, it might be as well to wipe out that definition?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera is quite right in saying that the point he has raised is scarcely relevant to Section 32, that is the point as to the disposal of land under the Labourers Acts.  Again, with reference to the section to facilitate entry of the local authority on land which it has acquired for the purposes of the Housing Acts, the existing section, Section 4 of the Labourers Act of 1896, empowered local authorities to enter forthwith on lands which were the subject of Provisional Orders in cases where consent to entry was refused, notwithstanding that the arbitrator had not given his award, provided the local authority gives security for the purchase money. Experience has shown that this procedure was slow and that local authorities in many cases have awaited the arbitrator's award in preference to availing themselves of the powers given by Section 4.  It is proposed to repeal <Col N="694" /> Section 4 and to give county councils, which are now the rural housing authorities, the same powers of entry as are vested in urban authorities by Section 41 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931.  Under the new dispensation the county councils will be authorised to enter and take possession of lands acquired compulsorily, at any time after confirmation of the Compulsory Purchase Order on giving at least 14 days' notice to the owner.</P>

      <P>Before Section 40 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>40.&mdash;(1) In every case in which a grant for the erection of a house is made under Section 15 of this Act to a person or public utility society and an increase in the valuation of <Col N="695" /> the tenement, consisting of or including such house, is made on an application for the revision of such valuation by reason solely of such erection, the valuation of such tenement shall be deemed to be reduced for rating purposes by two-thirds of such increase.</P>
    <P>(2) In every case in which a grant for the erection of a house is made under Section 15 of this Act to a person or public utility society and an increase in the valuation of the tenement consisting of or including such house is made on an application for the revision of such valuation by reason partly of such erection the valuation of such tenement shall be deemed to be reduced for rating purposes by two-thirds of so much of such increase as is attributable to such erection.</P>
    <P>(3) Where a grant is made under Section 15 of this Act in respect of the reconstruction of a house, the valuation of the tenement consisting of or including such house shall not, on any valuation or revision of the valuation thereof coming into force within seven years after the completion of such reconstruction be increased on account of any increase in the value of such tenement arising from such reconstruction.</P>
    <P>(4) In this section the expression &ldquo;rating purposes&rdquo; means the following (and no other) purposes, that is to say, the purpose of the assessment and levying of any rate raised by a local authority for the service of the local financial year commencing next after the completion of the erection of the relevant house or for the service of any of the next following six local financial years.</P>
    <P>(5) Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of the immediately preceding sub-section of this section restricting the meaning of the expression &ldquo;rating purposes&rdquo;, it is hereby enacted in particular that notwithstanding the valuation (in this sub-section referred to as the full valuation) of a tenement being deemed under this section to be reduced in relation to any local financial year, every computation for the <Col N="696" /> purposes of the Income Tax Acts of the annual value of such tenement shall be made in like manner as if the full valuation were in force for the purposes of county rate in relation to that local financial year.</P>
    <P>This is a drafting amendment.  The substitute amendment goes a little further than the original amendment because it proposes to add a new sub-section suggested by the Revenue Commissioners.  This sub-section removes any doubt there might be about the valuation for income-tax purposes of premises which will enjoy a rates remission under the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">

      <P>I take it that the remissions are simply put in line with the practice to date.  Do I understand that the remissions heretofore were given in one of two ways?  One was on a two-thirds basis, and the other was calculated on one-twentieth of the rates in certain cases.  My information on that point is not explicit.  I could not find statutory authority for it but I should like to know from the Minister what is the actual procedure by which the provisions of this section will be implemented. Take a house that would come under the scheme.  In what way would the scheme for a remission of two-thirds operate?</P>

      <P>I want to call attention to the fact that all of these <Col N="698" /> allowances to the utility societies are very properly made to meet rising costs.  The Minister, no doubt, is well aware that apparently there is no suggestion of a builder being able to earn these grants.  I do not know what the Minister has in mind, but I think the House is entitled to learn what is the reason for this omission.  A builder is a person who for years has carried on his trade of building houses for sale. He has carried that on in good and bad times.  I suggest that if it were not for this class of individual, the housing position in this country would be very much worse.  Not only has the speculative builder provided houses steadily for a number of years, but he has also, during the difficult times through which we have passed, been the only rallying ground for the nucleus of skilled tradesmen who were kept employed in the building industry during the war period.</P>
      <P>The Minister may possibly say that previous Governments helped to do away with the landlord who built property and let it for a profit.  Now the Minister is anxious to bring back that class of person who can invest money in building houses for the working classes.  I suggest that by cutting the builder out of these grants the Minister may think he is making a saving but he is really making the saving at the expense of keeping the industry going on regular grounds.  People have called attention to the fact that this Bill does not furnish any extra recruitment of labour; it does not bring in any extra supply of materials.  Its only purpose is to try to remedy the terrible cost to which building materials of all sorts have gone.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider the builder.  He is trying to do away with professional people engaged in the industry who for years have carried on their trade here.  I suppose if they are driven out they could carry it to other parts of the world with profit and advantage to the places in which they would settle.  What is the reason for the extraordinary omission, cutting out of this Bill the builder who is building a house to sell?  It has been his industry and possibly the industry of his father before him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the purpose of this Bill is misunderstood by Deputy Dockrell.  These grants are not given for the sake of putting money in people's pockets.  If it were contended that the speculative builder, the builder building for sale, was selling at a loss, I suppose something might be said for mulcting the general taxpayer in order to subsidise him but, as everybody knows, the contrary is quite the case&mdash;the ordinary speculative builder is making very substantial profits, some people would say exorbitant profits, and even that he was profiteering.  I do not say that.  I do not know; I have not been able to investigate building costs.  I have not the same familiarity with the financial structure of the building industry as Deputy Dockrell has.  I am only going on what the people say, and surely in these circumstances there is no justification whatever for taxing people who can scarcely afford to pay their own rents or to buy houses for themselves in order to subsidise one of the classes which are certainly doing well out of the present housing shortage.  That is what Deputy Dockrell asked me to do &mdash;or rather what he asked the State to do as I cannot do.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to help people who have to find houses for themselves to pay the prices now being asked and I do not think under the present circumstances we can give any subsidies.  Nobody is going to suggest in the circumstances of the present day when there is such a pronounced shortage of houses, that we are going to drive people out of the building industry.  The contrary is the case.  Quite a number of people are becoming very interested in the building industry.  Many cases come before me of people who want to use sites, some of them suitable and some unsuitable, and these people have not had very great experience of building. That indicates that, far from putting people out of the industry, it has become so attractive that people are anxious to try their hand at it.  Let us look the facts in the face, and can anybody see any justification whatever for subsiding such an industry which is already so profitable that people are attracted to its ranks every day?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say something in reply to this explanation of the Minister.  The grants given to the building industry before were given in order to encourage building and I think that they have that effect. They were not given in order to encourage the individual builders engaged in the industry.  The effect of this measure which we are discussing here to-night will be that the builder, unless he builds for a special order, will not be able to build a house in competition with one which is built subject to these grants.  That will mean either of two things.  Either that some way round the provisions of this Bill will be found or that the building industry will be slowed up, if the builder will have to wait until he gets an individual order.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Minister that vast areas of the suburbs of the City of Dublin were built on these lines by builders between the two wars.  I see no reason why the Minister, with the whole resources of his Department and the legal section of the Government, could not have found some way of making the builder the channel through which this subsidy went to the individual, thereby ensuring that the builder, with his specialised knowledge of the work and with his trained personnel, would not be subject to the periodic stoppages which will be the effect of this schedule under this Bill. I think that the Minister, if he had applied himself a little more closely to the problem, could have found a way to do what he wishes to do and to ensure that the trade went through the builder.  To think that individuals, through private means or by virtue of an individual order, can substantially affect the present shortage of houses is something that just cannot be.  I am afraid that we will not see the speedy resolution of the housing shortage which we would like to see carried out through the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am glad to accept your ruling.  I think that the financial provisions of this Bill are designed to facilitate building; that has been explained at length.  Getting down to the basis of these schedules, certain sums of money have been provided and I take it that the Minister has provided the maximum amount of money which he can find available under these headings. These are going to be a substantial benefit to the community.  They are going to provide houses and they are going to encourage the provision of houses.  The increase in the provision of houses will also mean increased expenditure.  We are about to enter the phase of the year when we deal with Estimates and this Bill will have to be paid for.  It has been passed through this House without one little bit of criticism on its financial provision and I would like that to be on record.  I would like it to be on record when the question of expenditure is <Col N="702" /> criticised at a later date and when the Government is criticised, for Deputies cannot have it both ways.  This Bill which will do a good job for housing will cost money and the money involved will have to be found on other stages. I think that the Government has struck a nice balance in doing what it can do within its resources.</P>

Is it intended that the new definition shall apply, and if so, is it completely clear that it does define, as there is a definition in another part of the Bill?

I have given notice of most of them but perhaps I should give notice of others of them by reason of the fact that the sections have been disposed of.  It is proposed to amend Section 2 in Part I of the Bill so as to clarify the position of town commissioners as housing authorities under the Bill.  It is proposed to amend Section 11 in Part II of the Bill to provide that the permission of a housing authority to the multiple letting of a premises may not be unreasonably withheld.</P>
      <P>I should also mention that I propose on Section 11 to bring in an amendment, to meet the point raised by Deputy Dockrell, to apply the designation &ldquo;multiple dwelling&rdquo; to houses let in flats as the expression &ldquo;tenement house&rdquo; might be misleading.  I have already given notice that Section 12 will be amended by the deletion of the words &ldquo;in their absolute discretion&rdquo;. That section will also be amended to provide for a revision of permissions at three yearly intervals instead of yearly as proposed in the Bill.  I mentioned that on the debate in Committee.</P>
      <P>I will also deal with the point which was raised, I think, with Deputy Sheldon relating to the disclosure of allowances from charitable organisations.  I propose to exclude temporary allowances from charitable organisations.</P>
      <P>Section 16 will be amended to meet Deputy de Valera's point that a landlord, while prevented from selling the house to an occupier, should nevertheless be permitted to sell his interest</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to authorise a revision of coroners' salaries in view of the increased cost of living since 1927 when their salaries were last reviewed.  The existing law <Col N="705" /> prohibits any increase or diminution of the salary of a coroner during his tenure of office.  The Bill proposes to abolish this prohibition, as the Minister for Justice considers there is no great reason for retaining it.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will be required, within six months after the Bill becomes law, to revise the salary of every coroner paid by them and, subject to the approval of the Minister for Justice, to make a provisional determination that the salary be increased or confirmed.  Any coroner who is dissatisfied with the provisional determination may appeal against it and the Minister for Justice is empowered either to dismiss the appeal or determine that the salary be increased to a specified amount.  The Minister for Justice is also given power to fix the salary, at the request of a coroner, where a local authority refuses or neglects to make a provisional determination.  Similar machinery for the review of a salary is provided in the case of an extension of a coroner's district arising out of an amalgamation of two or more districts. The approval of the Minister, which may be given only after consultation with the Minister for Local Government, is necessary before any salary is finally determined.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the transfer of the functions of the Minister for Local Government in relation to the amalgamation of coroners' districts to the Minister for Justice.  Under Section 16 of the Coroners (Amendment) Act, 1927, the Minister for Justice is the appropriate Minister in relation to the appointment and removal of coroners, and the Local Government Act, 1941, excluded coroners from the control exercised by the Minister for Local Government over officers of local authorities.  It is logical, therefore, that the Minister for Justice should also exercise the functions in relation to the amalgamation of coroners' districts.</P>

      <P>On the section, I want to have a point cleared up.  I cannot quite understand the effect of sub-section (4) where there are several holdings connected with pipes and provision is made that the limiting length where the local authority does not come <Col N="707" /> in is 100 feet multiplied by the number of houses.  I am wondering if that is not rather harsh.  Presumably, a number of houses in a group or row would be served by one pipe with off-shoots and the total length of such pipes would be relatively smaller in that case than in the case of a number of single houses.  It strikes me that it is not quite fair to multiply the 100 feet by the number of houses as compared with taking 100 feet under sub-section (3) for a single house.</P>

      <P>In reply to the Deputy, this section is to enable buildings which may be somewhat widely separated to be connected by a water pipe, and in order to do that the sanitary authority is responsible for the cost where there is an excess in the total length of pipes over the aggregate of 100 feet multiplied by the number of houses.  You, therefore, divide the total aggregate of pipe by the number of houses before arriving at a decision as to how much the owner is responsible for; it is in mitigation of the expense, rather than any increase in the expense, since the sanitary authority pays for the balance.</P>

      <P>I think it is in Section 34 it is provided that the registration of a camping site will not apply where the owner of the land or some member of his household wishes to camp.  I am wondering if the line of demarcation is not being drawn rather close.  I am imagining circumstances where the owner of land might have near relatives, say, cousins or nephews, who wanted to camp.  They would <Col N="709" /> not be members of his household in the strict sense of the term.  It looks to me as if a man who wanted to allow some relatives to camp would have to apply for registration for a camping site.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy need not have any fear.  I think members of his household will count as relatives.  If the Deputy will look at Section 34, sub-section (12), paragraph (b) it says: &ldquo;If the land is occupied in connection with a permanent dwelling situate on or in the vicinity of such land, and the camping is carried on by no persons other than the occupier of the permanent dwelling and members of his household...&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am thinking of relatives who would not be residing in his household but who would come on a visit to camp there.

      <P>May I ask if there is any restriction under this section with regard to land owned by public authorities, such as the margin of a road where travelling dealers, tinkers and people like that camp?  Will this section restrict that particular kind of <Col N="710" /> camping in any way?  It is certainly very objectionable where there is a wide margin on the side of a road and travelling people insist upon camping there day after day or night after night and become quite a nuisance to people residing in the immediate vicinity.  So far as I know, there is no very effective means of checking that abuse.  If one group of persons come there, the Guards usually get them to move on. But then another group will come along and occupy the same position, so that people in the vicinity are subjected to a very considerable amount of nuisance and trespass.  Would it be possible under this section to restrict that?</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will look at Section 31, which has been already passed, he will see that it enables a sanitary authority to prohibit the erection of temporary dwellings on any land or water in their sanitary district if they are of opinion that they would be prejudicial to public health or the amenities of the locality or would interfere to an unreasonable extent with traffic on any road.  There is a right to appeal in connection with a prohibition of that kind to the Minister and, for the contravention of a prohibition order, the court may order the forfeiture of the temporary dwelling.  How far that section will apply in practice is a matter for the local authority.</P>

      <P>(3)  Where a by-law is made under sub-section (1) of this section in relation to any swimming bath, bathing place or wash house&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="712" /> (a)  such by-law shall be posted and kept posted at such swimming bath, bathing place or wash house by the sanitary authority by whom the by-law was made,</P>
    <P>(b)  if such sanitary authority fails or neglects to comply with paragraph (a) of this sub-section, such sanitary authority shall be guilty of an offence under this sub-section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding five pounds and in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding £1 for each day on which the offence is continued.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where a by-law is made under sub-section (2) of this section in relation to any swimming bath or bathing place&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  such by-law shall be posted and kept posted at such swimming bath or bathing place by the owner thereof,</P>

    <P>As drafted, the section imposes on the local authority the obligation to post by-laws and keep them posted at all swimming baths, whether owned by the local authority or not.  It is felt that difficulty might be experienced by a local authority in carrying out its obligations in the case of a swimming bath not under its control and the amendment requires the local authority to keep by-laws posted in bathing places owned by them.  In the case of other bathing places owned by private individuals, the obligation will rest on the owner.</P>

      <P>This is the Schedule which restricts the use of public bathing places.  I should like to know if under this Schedule it would be possible to make some provision for the safety of people bathing in this way. There are many portions of the sea coast which are really dangerous for anybody except an expert swimmer.  I am just wondering whether it would be possible under this Schedule for the local authority or the sanitary authority rigidly to prohibit the use of portions of the sea coast, which are dangerous, except in some cases under licence.  We all know that every year during the warm weather there is an enormous number of fatalities.  While it might have been intended under the Schedule as drafted that that power should be taken, if it is not already in the Schedule I think that power should be taken to prohibit people bathing where there are dangerous currents, where the water is of unequal depth or where there are other factors which might lead to loss of life.  I should also like to know whether this would apply to rivers as well as to the sea coast.</P>

If the Deputy will also look at Section 37 he will find very adequate measures for the provision of life-guards <Col N="715" /> and life-saving equipment.

The result might be that some local authority might omit to make such by-laws and then there could be no prohibition of bathing in a dangerous area.  Section 37 provides only for life-guards. Deputy Cogan is anxious that the necessary by-laws should be made to prohibit bathing in these dangerous places so that the services of life-guards might not be necessary there.</P>

Bé a thiocfadh as san dá n-éiríodh an múinteoir as gairm ar an lá deiridh de scoil-bhliain &mdash; an gnáthdháta chun éirí as gairm &mdash; ná go gcaillfeadh sé bliain de sheirbhís inphinsin. An chomhacht a bheireann an leasú atá beartaithe anois fén a bhféadfaí, ar athiarratas, dáta ligint múinteora dá leithéid isteach sa scéim do chur siar go dtí dáta nach fuide ná chúig mhí déag siar ó dháta a chéad iarratais, déanfaidh sé sin cailliúnt na bliana seirbhíse inphinsin do sheachaint.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an gceathrú leasú (Alt 8) sé an chaoi ina bhfuil an scéal fé láthair ná má thárlaíonn do mhúinteoir tré é bheith dreoite feadh treimhse níos fuide ná an tréimhse go bhfuil Breis-Thuarastal iníoctha ina leith go dtéigheann sé dá bhárr san as ballraíocht na Scéime.  Má gheibheann múinteoir dá leithéid bás roimh filleadh ar ais i seirbhís dó sé an aisce a bhíonn iníoctha lena ionadaí dhlítiúil phearsanta ná suim is ionann agus méid na síntiúisí a bhíonn íochta ag an múinteoir.  I gcás múinteora a gheibheann bás le linn dó bheith ina bhall den scéim sé an aisce a bhíonn iníoctha ná suim is ionann agus méid na sintiúisí maraon le h-ús iolraithe ortha do réir 3 per cent.  Fén chomhacht a bheireann an leasú féadfar eas-bhall den Scim, go raibh deich mbliain ar a laighead de sheirbhís inphinsin tugtha aige agus a gheibheann bás laistigh de dhá mhí déag tar éis dó dul as ballraíocht, a áireamh chun críche an aisce d'íoc amhail is dá mba le linn dó bheith i seirbhís a fuair sé bás.  Sa tslí sin gheobhfar aisce a íoc lena ionadaí dhlíthiúil phearsanta do réir an ráta is aoirde den dá ráta atá luaite.</P>

      <P>It is pleasing to know that the Minister has introduced this scheme which, we hope, will remove many of the anomalies that have arisen in determining the pensions <Col N="719" /> of certain teachers in respect of the payment of emergency bonuses. There are various aspects of this matter which one might like to deal with, but I am not prepared to deal with them now and I do not intend to delay the House any further.  I believe that this scheme will be acceptable to all concerned.</P>
