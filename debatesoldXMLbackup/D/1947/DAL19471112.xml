    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieSnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will indicate the probable date on which the general election will be held.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot indicate the date more precisely than to say that I propose that the election should take place as early as practicable in the coming year.  Everything depends on the speed with which essential public business is completed by the present Dáil.  As I have pointed out already, it is desirable that the Electoral (Amendment) Bill and the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Bill should become law before the election is held. It is also desirable that certain other important legislative measures should be passed.  Further, new polling schemes will have to be made where they are required to suit the altered constituencies, and the existing register of electors will be affected in every case in which a constituency is altered in name or extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal Bills on the Order Paper.  The Finance Bill should certainly be got through.  The Supplies and Services Bill, which has not yet been introduced, must be passed before the end of the year, and so forth.  There are a number of things like that.</P>

As regards the second portion of the Deputy's question the present maximum retail price of 5d. per pint was authorised by the Milk (Retail Price) (County Louth) (No. 2) Order, 1947, notice of the making of which was published in the daily newspapers on the 1st instant.</P>

The increases in remuneration were on the lines of similar increases granted to servants of local authorities.  The regulations regarding sick leave are based on similar regulations as set out in the Local Government (Officers) Regulations, 1943, and those applicable to certain employees in the Civil Service and in several respects represent an improvement on the arrangement previously in force.</P>

      <P>The agreement with the British Government in regard to the payment of special benefit to persons who have been discharged from the forces of the United Kingdom and who are unemployed in this country does not limit eligibility for special benefit by reference to the date of discharge.  A condition for the receipt of special benefit is that at least 30 contributions must be to credit in the British Unemployment Fund in respect of the two years immediately preceding the date of the first claim.  This condition has the effect of excluding from benefit persons who were discharged earlier than the commencement of the period <Col N="1668" /> of two years immediately preceding the date of the first claim or who, although discharged during that period of two years, have less than 30 contributions in respect of service in the British Forces during that period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of the immediate and urgent need for an extensive expansion in the productive capacity of agriculture for the purpose of increasing our exports, he will consider the desirability of providing cheaper and better credit facilities for farmers who wish to improve the fertility of their land, or to provide better housing and equipment on their farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Grady) Seán O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Grady)</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am aware of the need for expanding agricultural production, I am not aware that existing credit facilities for farmers are inadequate.  The difficulties in the way of increasing agricultural production at present arise not from any lack of money or credit facilities but from a scarcity of materials, machinery and fertilisers.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Agricultural Credit Act, 1947, which came into operation recently, have widened considerably the field of operations open to the Agricultural Credit Corporation. I do not consider that the rate of interest charged by the Corporation is an obstacle to expansion in agricultural output.</P>
      <P>The Housing Bill which has been circulated by the Minister for Local Government will give greatly increased assistance for the building and reconstruction of farm houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is the Minister aware that it is practically impossible, if a farmer has not extensive security, to obtain financial facilities from the Agricultural Credit Corporation?  Is he not also aware that the rates of interest charged by the Agricultural Credit Corporation are to-day far in excess of the rates of interest at which money is <Col N="1669" /> provided for other local purposes? Local authorities can obtain money at a much cheaper rate than the farmer can for the extension and development of his industry.  Surely the Minister must realise that there is urgent need for reduction in the rate of interest for loans for agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that it is difficult for any credit-worthy farmer to obtain a loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  With regard to the question of interest, the difference between the rate at which money is borrowed by the local authorities and that at which money is advanced by the Agricultural Credit Corporation is so very small that it does not enter into the argument at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must realise that while supplies of fertilisers and other commodities of that kind are scarce it is absolutely impossible for the farmer on the poorer land to obtain even the inadequate supplies that are available because he has not got the capital with which to do so and some help should be given to the man on the more improverished land.</P>

      <P>It has been the practice since 1916 that one of the keepers in the National Museum should act as director, in addition to discharging the professional duties of his division.  That arrangement was not regarded as satisfactory and it has been terminated.  The administrative duties formerly attaching to the post of director have been assigned to a principal officer on the Department's staff, pending possible reconsideration of the position in the future.  The correct designation of this officer is administrator, not director. <Col N="1670" /> In the circumstances, the latter part of the question does not arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said in my reply, it was not found satisfactory.  I believe that the work entrusted to each keeper of the museum&mdash;of whom there are three&mdash;is sufficient to keep each fully occupied on the technical side of the work.  That means that the administrative work which is very important in an institution of the size and variety of the museum must be very large and I have decided that the best course to pursue is to have the keepers carry out the ordinary museum work entrusted to them while the administrative work applicable to the museum as a whole should be transferred to an administrative officer who is a man of long experience and has, in fact, dealt with this work for more than 20 years past.</P>

      <P>That would not be quite correct.  I am not in a position, by way of reply to a supplementary question, to define exactly the difference between what might be termed administrative work and what might be termed technical work.  I want to make it clear to the House that this officer represents me in his responsibilities as administrator of the museum and I shall have to determine, if any question arises, whether and where his functions are to be limited.  While he is an administrative officer, I do not want to give the impression that the general supervision of the museum will not be part of his functions.  I do not want the Deputy to have any misunderstanding about the position.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Complete figures for the month of September, 1947, are not yet available. <Col N="1674" /> For the three months ended 31st August, 1945, the consumption of milk in the Dublin Sale District increased by 251,923 gallons over the quantity in the corresponding period in 1944.  During the three month periods ended on 31st August, 1946, and 31st August, 1947, there were further increases in consumption, of 150,234 gallons and 376,600 gallons respectively over the consumption of the previous year.  The figure for 1947 represents, therefore, an increase of 778,757 gallons over that for 1944.  The increased consumption in 1945 and 1946 was fully met by local production.  In 1947, it was necessary to supplement local production by obtaining 151,760 gallons from creameries.</P>
    <P>The procuring of day to day supplies of milk for the Dublin Sale Area is a matter for arrangement by the suppliers in the ordinary way of business, in conjunction, where necessary, with the Dublin Milk Board.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister has misunderstood one portion of my question.  I asked him if he would <Col N="1679" /> have machinery set up in order to inquire into the costings of growing crops for the next year, that is, to investigate the costings of producing various tillage crops during the coming year.  I did not ask him whether he would base prices for the coming year on these costings.  I merely asked him if he would have the machinery set up in order to be able to investigate costings with regard to various tillage crops.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>As will be seen from columns 1359-60 of the Official Debates, Deputy Dillon, in the course of his speech on the motion which the Taoiseach had moved to establish a tribunal to investigate certain allegations relating to the sale of Locke's Distillery, took the opportunity to deliver a personal attack on myself. In the course of that attack he alleged that I had (1) violated the most elementary decencies of personal honour, and (2) betrayed the confidence of my own colleague.  These are grave and serious charges to make against any person, and if they were made outside the House, the person making them would be amenable to the ordinary processes of the law.  It is for this reason that I ask the indulgence of the House and the protection of the Chair while I address myself to Deputy Dillon's allegations.</P>
      <P>These allegations are based upon nothing more substantial than the flimsy circumstance that on the afternoon of Wednesday, October 29th, I accidentally opened the door of the room in which he happened to be engaged with the Minister for Justice. I closed that door immediately I saw Deputy Dillon and I did not hear a single word of the conversation which was then taking place between him and the Minister for Justice.  I did learn later that afternoon from the Minister that the Deputy had furnished him with certain facts, some of which the Deputy had not seen fit to communicate to the House, notwithstanding that one of them, in relation to all he has been saying in this House, is of the utmost importance.  I must emphasise that I learned all this, not when I accidentally opened the door of my colleague's room, but later in common with other Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is surely extraordinary that because he accidentally opened a door, a Minister of State should be accused here in this House, within the jurisdiction of the Chair, of having violated <Col N="1683" /> the most elementary decencies of personal honour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The second charge made by Deputy Dillon is that I betrayed the confidence of my colleague, the Minister for Justice.  But a confidence cannot be betrayed unless there has been an unwarranted disclosure of something which has been revealed to another under seal of secrecy, or something which has been done in like circumstances. The question arises, therefore: what part of his visit to the Minister for Justice in his room here in Leinster House did Deputy Dillon regard as confidential?  Was it what he said to the Minister or was it that he saw him at all?  After his speeches here in this House, how could any matter which Deputy Dillon communicated to the Minister for Justice in relation to the proposed sale of Locke's distillery, be regarded by him as confidential? Did not Deputy Dillon himself tell the House on the 29th October that he had thrust&mdash;and mark the word he chose&mdash; that he had thrust upon the Minister for Justice every particle of information which came his way in relation to that matter?  Similarly, it could not have been the fact that Deputy Dillon saw the Minister for Justice that he wished to be treated as confidential, for he himself has published that to the world at large.  How, then, could I have betrayed a confidence, since it <Col N="1684" /> was neither the subject-matter of the interview nor the fact that there had been an interview that was either private, confidential or secret?  The Deputy published these facts to everybody.</P>
      <P>There are other aspects of this matter which I regret I am not able to deal with.  I cannot conjecture why Deputy Dillon should make that attack upon me.  I know that he knew that I was aware there was something which he should have disclosed to the House but which was not disclosed.  That, however, must now arise for consideration in another place.  All I am concerned to say is, I was quite correct when I did say on the 29th October that until that day Deputy Dillon had not furnished the Minister for Justice with every particle of the information in relation to this transaction which had come into his possession.  I deny I was betraying the confidence of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, or that in accidentally opening a door I violated in any way any principle of personal honour or disgraced myself.</P>

      <P>In page 5, First Schedule, opposite the mention of Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown in the first column, to add in the second column the District Electoral Divisions of Rathfarnham and Whitechurch.</P>
      <P>This amendment would add two small electoral divisions at present in Dublin County to the Borough of Dún Laoghaire and the area of Rathdown. I understand the Minister's aim has been to keep, in so far as it has been possible, to distinct areas and not to intersect county boundaries.  In addition he has endeavoured to keep urban areas intact.  This particular district is in general an urban one and in my view it would be more suitable for the constituency of Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, unfortunately, a fact that County Dublin does not lend itself easily to division and that the population of North County Dublin is insufficient to elect three representatives. Consequently, the additional area from the south county has to be added.  In doing that the Minister has added a number of areas in South <Col N="1687" /> County Dublin in order to bring up to strength the three-member constituency. The electoral areas of Rathfarnham and Whitechurch are small in numbers &mdash; approximately 2,000 to 3,000 electors.  As it is an urban area, I think it would be more suitable if it were added to Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown.  In addition, portion of that area is an old part of the former Rathdown district and it is in that way in close proximity to Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown.  The fact that it is largely an urban area makes it in many ways more suitable it should be attached to that particular constituency than to a constituency which is predominantly rural.  A large portion of this area is in the north of the county but, due to the numerical condition of the division, it was found necessary to include additional areas from the other side of the city.  If the Minister sees fit and this House is agreeable, I think that this would be an improvement to have the two smaller electoral divisions.</P>

    <P>On the Committee Stage, the Minister kindly consented to receive this amendment, and, further, he arranged that the question of Wexford versus South Mayo would be put before the House.  I do not think that anybody looking at the figures could say that Wexford has not a case for five seats when it is compared with two other constituencies which have five seats and which have a smaller population. Unfortunately, it is a question of Wexford v. South Mayo.  But the Minister said that he had difficulty with three constituencies, Wexford, Longford and South Mayo.  Wexford has the biggest population.  The Minister mentioned his reason that South Mayo would have five seats with its substantially smaller population&mdash;that there was a temporary decrease in the population to an extent of 13,000 people.  But what the Minister is forgetting is that this means 13,000 over the whole area of the County Mayo and that it would be substantially smaller in South Mayo. In respect of the whole County Mayo, this decrease in population is certainly not of a temporary nature.  In 1926 the total population of Mayo was 106,000.  In 1936 it had fallen to 98,000 and in 1946 it stood at 88,579.  Therefore, this decrease in the population of County Mayo has been consistent over the past 20 years.  Granted that there has been some decrease due to emigration, I submit that the decrease in the whole county was between 2,000 and 3,000 people, but from the census figures it is apparent that the population in County Mayo had fallen by between 8,000 and 10,000 people during the previous two ten-year periods. Wexford has retained its population during the past 20 years.  While since 1926 it has lost about 3,000 people on the whole, the population has remained fairly constant at between 91,000 and 95,000, and I do not think that speculation on the part of the Minister or anyone else in regard to the decrease or increase in the population is of any advantage.  If it is true, as the Minister <Col N="1689" /> alleged, that there has been a temporary decrease, we must take into account the fact that the decrease has been over a period of ten years.  And it would be, therefore, reasonable to assume that it would take another ten years for it to regain its former size. I would strongly suggest to the Minister that he should not try to speculate on what the population will be in the future.  He should rather have allocated the seats on the present population. If the population of South Mayo increases in the next ten years, the Minister can, and should, introduce another Electoral Amendment Bill which will, if necessary, take the seat from Wexford and give it to Mayo.  At the present time there is no justification for this action, as the population of Wexford is bigger by 3,000 people than that of Mayo.</P>
    <P>This is all I have to add, but if anybody compares the figures of Wexford and South Mayo in regard to population and fluctuation of population over the past 20 years, he will see that the five seats should be allocated to Wexford. It is unfortunate that it is a question of Wexford versus South Mayo but there is no one to blame but the Minister as he should have used a little more discretion in allocating these seats.</P>

      <P>I wish to support this amendment.  As I am a native Wexford man it is natural that we should stand together.  The case is overwhelming that the five seats should be retained by Wexford.  The first I heard of this was when I got the Bill into my hands.  I had heard nothing of it beforehand.  It caused me a certain amount of surprise but I put it down to the fact that we had lost a part of Carlow.</P>
      <P>Our case is a strong one and I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment. The figures are definitely in our favour.  It is ridiculous that South Mayo with a population less by 3,000 people should be given a seat more than Wexford which has a population of 93,000.  The figures are against it and everything is in favour of Wexford retaining the seats.</P>

      <P>You might take him seriously after the election.  The Minister brought in Carlow for one purpose, and it is going back now.  It would be all right if the Minister were going to reduce the number of Deputies and save the expense, but he is going to have more Deputies.  He is not going to reduce taxation by cutting down the seats in certain constituencies&mdash;but he thinks he will suit himself and have a more satisfactory arrangement.  He thinks he will do well.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows that the election is being held as a result of the byelections. The whole country knows that the Minister wants the constituencies cut up to suit himself. Wexford is entitled to representation as well as Mayo or any other constituency, because it, too, will have to bear the cost of extra Deputies.  It is the people not the Deputies that you have to consider.</P>

      <P>I oppose this amendment. If an extra member is required for the County of Wexford I do not see why they should get it at the expense of County Mayo.  Deputy Corish went into great detail on the question of migration as it affects County Mayo.  I wish that what he said were true.  He said that we are losing a great number of people through migration to better land and to areas where there is a reasonable chance of making a living.  Unfortunately that is not so.  If we were losing 10,000 or 12,000 people through migration I certainly would not oppose this amendment.  But what he says is not so.  Deputy Corish knows that well, as also do the other Deputies from Wexford.  They know that apart from the abnormal emigration of the past five or six years there has always existed so far as Mayo is concerned a yearly migration of about 12,000 people, at least.  For the past five or six years most of those migrants could not come back.  We all know there were difficulties&mdash;passports, visas and also the trouble of getting a place on a boat. There was always the danger that even if you could get a ticket you might not be allowed to use it.  The result was that most of the migrants who usually came back to Mayo at the end of the season were unable to come back because they had all this bother and trouble of trying to get the passage back.  Therefore, before they would go to all that trouble, and maybe at the end run the risk of being stranded as hundreds were time and again, and of losing their employment, they preferred to stay in Britain until travel became more normal.  Those people will now, thank God, be coming back. I urge on the Ceann Comhairle and on every member of the House that it would be most unjust to South Mayo to deprive them of a member for no other reason than that Wexford seems to have a grievance.  If Wexford thinks it has a grievance I am not stopping it from getting extra representation but I do not see why it should get it at our expense. Therefore, I appeal to the House and to the Minister not to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not happen to be one of the boys of Wexford nor am I in any way directly interested in this matter.  I think, however, it is rather a serious matter to take a seat from one constituency.  I am in wholehearted agreement with the case that is being made for an additional seat for Wexford in view of the fact, as Deputy Keating has pointed out, that there were five seats in that constituency since the State was established.  If we are to add another seat to the Wexford constituency I think we should not look to another rural constituency for that seat.  I think the representation of rural Ireland generally under this Bill is being reduced while the representation of the City of Dublin is being increased. There are questions about migration and so forth.  I think we ought to anticipate some migration of the population from the congested area around the mouth of the Liffey in the next few years.  In these circumstances we ought to endeavour to see if it would be possible to reduce one of the Dublin constituencies so as to ensure that Wexford will not be unjustly treated. But proceeding on the lines of taking one seat from another rural constituency would seem to me to be a grave injustice.  It is particularly unjust in view of the manner in which this amendment has been rushed.  Very little notice was given to the people of Mayo or to the people of Wexford or to the Deputies concerned.  I think undue haste in getting this change carried through would be considered a grave injustice.  It was only on Friday last that it went through the Committee Stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is very difficult always to appreciate the tortuousness of Deputy Cogan's mind.  We have before <Col N="1693" /> us an amendment by Deputy Corish.  It is not a Government amendment.  It is an amendment which has been put down in the name of a Deputy who represents an Opposition Party.  It is very specific.  It proposes to increase the representation to be allocated to the constituency of Wexford from four to five and correspondingly to reduce the representation which the Bill as introduced proposed to afford to the constituency of South Mayo.  I am not responsible for the antithesis which is expressed in that amendment.  When the motion was first before the House Deputy Corish, quite properly&mdash;I am not contesting his right to have done it &mdash;drew the attention of the House to the fact that so far as he could see Wexford was more entitled, at first glance at any rate, to secure five members than South Mayo was.  It was not suggested that Wexford at any time should secure this additional representation at the expense of any other constituency than South Mayo.  Of course, Deputy Cogan has got to come in here and place responsibility on the Government for the fact that Deputy Corish, quite naturally, took South Mayo as being the constituency which in all its circumstances most nearly corresponded to that of Wexford.</P>
      <P>Let me now say that one of the primary objectives which I had in mind when I was preparing this revision was to preserve as far as I possibly could the existing representation of rural Ireland in the Dáil.  It was primarily for that reason that I took full advantage of the Constitution.  I did nothing unconstitutional in doing that.  I took full advantage of the Constitution to increase the size of this Assembly from 138 to 147 Deputies.  The nine Deputies represent the cost which 1,700,000 of a rural population in Ireland will have to pay in order that their existing representation may be preserved in this House.  We are not increasing the seats, as Deputy O'Leary suggested, from an unworthy motive.  We know, of course, that Deputy O'Leary represents the urban population in Wexford. He does not mind what happens to the farmer or the farm labourer of Wexford.</P>

      <P>Because the Constitution provides that in so far as possible and in so far as practicable the ratio of population per member shall be uniform throughout the country.  So far from the urban population having been favoured by this measure, the fact is that if the Constitution permitted the size of this House to exceed 147 members, the representation of Dublin and Cork would be very much greater than that allotted to it in this present Bill, if representation were to be accorded to the urban areas upon the same basis as we have given representation to the rural areas.

      <P>Now, Sir, if there is anything which could induce me to depart from the undertaking which I gave to the House on the Committee Stage of this Bill it would be Deputy O'Leary's ill-mannered interruptions. However, as I said, I indicated that so far as I was concerned I was prepared to submit my judgment in this matter to the judgment and decision of the House.  In fairness, however, I think there are some things which I ought to say now.  Under the amendment there are two constituencies to be considered&mdash;South Mayo on the one hand and Wexford on the other.  It is quite true, as Deputy Corish has pointed out, that, so far as the population on the night in June, 1946, upon which the census was taken is concerned, the stronger claim would reside in Wexford.  But, as I have already pointed out, we know that a large number of people habitually migrate from Mayo.  Some of them left in 1945. Some of them left in 1946.  As Deputy Walsh has pointed out, because of the exceptional circumstances of the last four or five years, they have not been able to return with their customary regularity.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>They may have been compelled, for one reason or another, to remain away over a year instead of migrating backwards and forwards every year as they did in the past. Another point to remember is that the people of Mayo joined the Defence <Col N="1696" /> Forces in large numbers during the war.  We know that they are expert turf cutters and a large number of them are now working in Kildare having come from Mayo.  We know their sojourn in Kildare will probably be only temporary.  In fact the position is that while the population of Mayo did decline very substantially between 1936 and 1946, the population of Kildare on the other hand, due mainly to these two reasons, has gone up.  I think it is fair to deduce from that that the population will go back to Mayo.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The population of Mayo has undoubtedly declined very considerably&mdash;by not less than 13,000 since 1936&mdash;whereas the population of Wexford declined by only 2,500.  I think I am not wrong in the inference which I draw from the general position when I say that a large part of the declining population in Mayo will be temporary and that some of these people will come back.  I was confirmed in that by another fact which I have not hitherto put before the House but which I think the House might now bear in mind. According to the current register of Dáil electors there would be in South Mayo 55,555 voters.  Now, these are the people who were there on the critical date in September&mdash;three months later than the date of the census in 1946. There are now in what would be the new constituency in Wexford 55,282. That is a very small margin.  The Deputy can see that even within the period from the census date in June, 1946, to the registration date&mdash;the <Col N="1697" /> critical date in September &mdash; there seemed to be a slight preponderance&mdash; I am not putting it any higher than that &mdash;of adult persons in South Mayo as compared with Wexford.  From that I argue that there has been a flow back into South Mayo.</P>
      <P>Another circumstance to which I think I should advert and which I did take into consideration was the relative density of the population in these areas.  I told the House on the Second Reading of the Bill that in drawing the constituencies it had been my endeavour to ensure that the electors could make contact with their Deputies with the least possible inconvenience to themselves.  Therefore, where constituencies tended to be large and sparsely populated, I endeavoured, within the limits of what would be regarded as practicable by reasonable men, to give a correspondingly greater representation to those areas which were sparsely populated rather than to those areas which were densely populated.  The position in that regard is that in Mayo the population per 100 acres is only 11.1 and in Wexford it is 15.0.  That, I submit, is a circumstance which I was bound to take into account.</P>
      <P>In giving these figures, I do not want to sway the judgment of the House in relation to this matter, but I do think that I am bound to do it in order to refute allegations which have been made by Deputy O'Leary that, in ultimately deciding in favour of South Mayo as against Wexford, I was influenced by any ulterior, partisan motive.  I do not know what will be the result of the forthcoming election in Mayo, any more than I know what will be the result of the forthcoming election in Wexford.  I am relying on the wisdom and good sense of the electorate to return this Government again with a majority.</P>

      <P>So far as one constituency or the other is concerned, they are alike to me.  I am, however, putting these facts before the House. Let me be quite clear that, so far as I am concerned, so far as the Government Whip is concerned, and so far as <Col N="1698" /> the Government are concerned, every Deputy is free to vote on this amendment in whatever way he likes, because it is an amendment that can be conveniently disposed of.  It is not like some of the amendments which were put down which would cause us to recast the whole scheme of the Bill.  This is mainly an amendment to transfer one seat from one constituency to another in a case where the claims of these two constituencies are very evenly balanced.  On a matter like that, I am not going to allow my personal judgment to override the wishes, the judgment or the wisdom of the House.  In fact, though I have felt it my duty in view of what has been said to disclose to the House the basis upon which I proceeded, in order that there may be no guidance to anyone I do not intend to vote on this amendment at all.  It is entirely at the free disposal of the House and I shall let wisdom guide the House in its decision.</P>

      <P>I should like to remind Fianna Fáil members that they have to remember that in so far as the Minister, with the co-operation of his officials, of course, framed this Bill, he has to make that type of speech in order to justify his action.  No Minister will admit to me or to anybody else that he did not allocate the seats properly. I suggest that the matters which the Minister has mentioned and the arguments put forward by Deputy Walsh do not hold in this case.  The Minister and Deputy Walsh have spoken about the decrease in the population in Mayo, which they described as being temporary.  They argue that the population figure for Mayo is not a true figure.  The Minister alleges that. Therefore, we do not know what the population of Mayo was from 1926 to 1946, because some of the people happened to be out of the country.  Will the Minister agree that the population of South Mayo from 1926 to 1936 fell from 106,000 to 98,000?  Surely you cannot blame the emergency for that. <Col N="1699" /> Surely you cannot blame, as Deputy Walsh would suggest, the hardship on these people who had to travel, due to difficulties with passports, travel permits, etc.</P>
      <P>What is the population of South Mayo, if it is not as the Minister alleges?  I submit that the population is as stated in this preliminary census of population&mdash;that the present population of South Mayo is 88,579 and that the population of Wexford is 91,704. Which of these constituencies should have the biggest number of seats&mdash; Wexford or South Mayo?  According to the rudiments of arithmetic, you should decide for Wexford.  Wexford has lost a certain number of its population owing to emigration, which we believe is temporary.  We believe that these people will come back.  We have practically the same population since 1922, when this State was established, and we have had five seats.  The population has not fluctuated to any great extent.  Therefore, I say that we should have five seats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that it should be a question of Wexford versus South Mayo.  The Minister pinned it down to three constituencies&mdash;Wexford, Longford-Westmeath and Mayo South.  I submit that Wexford has the best claim amongst these three constituencies to five seats.  As South Mayo has the smallest population of the three, I fixed on South Mayo as the victim in my amendment.  I appeal to Fianna Fáil members to discount what the Minister has stated.  He has to defend what he did.  He has to put up these things and, being a Minister with long experience, <Col N="1700" /> he is well able to advance such arguments. All I ask Deputies is to go according to the rudiments of arithmetic and they will have to vote for the amendment.</P>

    <P>I voted for the principle involved in the last amendment&mdash;that the larger numbers should get representation.  I put down this amendment to secure that the agricultural community in County Limerick will be assured of four seats out of seven.  As the section stood originally, the rural community would be adversely affected by any change inasmuch as the proposed constituency of Limerick City and East Limerick would be dominated by the large vote in the city and what I might call the city urban areas.</P>
    <P>I pointed out on the Second Reading that while places like Anglesboro' and Kilbeheny, almost 40 miles away from the City of Limerick, were included in that constituency, places within a mile of the constituency were included in the other constituency.  If there is to be a division, it ought to be made in a fair and proper manner.  I agree that, under proportional representation, proper representation for the City of Limerick could not be given without taking in some area of the county.  I suggest the proper method would be to take in an area from the county that is contiguous to Limerick, in a semi-circle around Limerick.</P>
    <P>I have looked up some records and I have taken the portion of Limerick <Col N="1703" /> which was contained in what was the No. 1 rural district under the old system of local government.  The places I name are practically the entire No. 1 rural district, with the addition of certain areas from the Bruff district in order to make up the population.  On the basis of population, a proper distribution of the seats in Limerick would be four to the county and three to the city, because the preponderance of the population is in the county. Limerick City has a population of 43,000 or 44,000 and the county has considerably over 100,000.  On that basis the county would be entitled to four seats.  Whether you take it on the population basis or on the basis of the distance of the proposed areas from the city, a fair division of Limerick County could be made in the manner I propose. I am not tied to the exact districts I name, but I would like to be assured that the rural population of Limerick will get four representatives.</P>

      <P>Unlike the unanimity shown by the Wexford Deputies, I think there will not be much unanimity with regard to this amendment.  I listened with interest in order to learn what argument could be advanced in favour of this amendment.  I did not hear one&mdash;certainly there was no argument put forward that would convince anybody as to the reasonableness of this proposal.  I do not see any justification at all for this amendment.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy suggested that we might leave Limerick as it was he might get a certain measure of support. He persists in calling this Limerick City, instead of referring to it as East and West Limerick, for the purpose of indicating that the dominating influence of the city would have a baneful effect on the electorate.  Surely he does not suggest that seriously?  The total vote would be approximately 47,000, of which 23,000 would be in the city and the remainder in the other portion of East Limerick.</P>

      <P>What about the rural areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the rural areas as set down here.  Deputy Bennett is apparently afraid that the <Col N="1704" /> rural community will be overborne because of the dominating influence of the city vote.  I am suggesting that the division as proposed in this Bill would be practically fifty-fifty.  The city vote would be 23,393 while the county vote would be 22,000 so there is not much fear of domination in that. That is how the 47,000 is made up.  The rural community are not going to lose a seat.  The rural community, by being attached to the city, do not lose any representation.  Deputy Bennett wants four representatives east and west.  I do not see any reason why the portion of the county which carries the capital should be deprived of equitable representation. I do not see what the point is which Deputy Bennett made in regard to lopping off the rural population or their domination by the city vote.  That is not in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out that this division of the county has taken place on the figures, guided by the desire to keep to the Constitution in order to have the necessary number of seats with regard to the population.  It is as equitable a division of the voting strength as is possible at present.  The division proposed in the Bill helps to make each area more concise and more easily approachable for administrative purposes.  There is nothing in Deputy Bennett's point about domination by the city or that the rural community are likely to lose fair representation. That cannot be proved by Deputy Bennett or anyone else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy Bennett made a very good case, though I do not claim to have any knowledge of the problem, and I recognise that Deputy Keyes has knowledge of it.</P>
      <P>The Minister stressed the question of convenience, so as not to have constituencies stretching a great number of miles.  Our concern should be to get proper representation in the Irish Parliament, and a Deputy sent to this Parliament ought to be in a position to serve that interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bennett was correct when he said that people 40 miles away would not have the same outlook as people in the city or in areas in close proximity to the city.  Areas within a <Col N="1705" /> mile of the city have been thrown into rural constituencies and parts 40 miles away have been thrown into the city constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise that I cannot make the exact distinctions to suit Deputy Keyes's feelings, but I think that the Minister understands what I mean.  The rural areas around the city share the city's interests; they supply the city with milk, vegetables and potatoes, but people 40 and 50 miles away will not share those interests.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not measured it on the map.  Deputy Bennett said 40 miles.  The areas surrounding the city have an interest in the welfare of the city and supply it with agricultural produce, while people 40 miles away have not the same interest at all.  Areas within a mile of the city are eliminated according to Deputy Bennett.  I merely want to give the House my views in accordance with what I have listened to, and to say what I feel should be done.  It is not fair to people who are within four miles of the city to throw them into a rural constituency.</P>

      <P>The shape of the constituency is the least important consideration. The case that the Minister made in defence of this proposal was that it was an awkward long narrow constituency.  The most important consideration is that urban and rural interests ought not be to mixed up.  If the Minister is forced to take rural <Col N="1706" /> areas into the city constituency they should be areas with urban interests, areas which supply the city.</P>

      <P>I have given a great deal of consideration to everything which Deputy Bennett urged on every stage of this Bill in regard to those two Limerick constituencies.  After all that, I have come to the conclusion that the arrangement proposed in the Bill would certainly not be improved upon by this amendment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bennett made a point about distances.  I understand that Kilbeheny is about 30 miles from Limerick City. Deputy Bennett said 40 miles.  Let us say 35.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, say 35.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On the longest diagonal that is the greatest distance from Limerick City.  One of the objectives which we set out to achieve in this revision was to have constituencies of a reasonable size because such constituencies afford the best opportunity for the electorate and the representatives to meet and consult with one another.</P>
      <P>I have stressed the point that the longest diagonal in the West Limerick constituency to Kilbeheny is about 35 miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In the constituency which Deputy Bennett proposes, the longest diagonal which could be drawn from Bilboa to Abbeyfeale would not be 30 or 40 miles, or 35 miles such as the compromise which Deputy Bennett and myself arrived at, but it might be about 70 miles.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be 65 miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be a community of interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>And there would be a corresponding diagonal from Glin to Mitchelstown.  This huge, sprawling constituency would return four members, while inside, a sort of enclave, comprising Limerick City and a few <Col N="1707" /> areas around it, would return three. You would have Doon West and Bilboa, on the extreme east, in the same constituency as Glin, on the extreme west.  This is the proposed improvement on a simple arrangement which divides the administrative area north and south with due regard to the population.  There is no merit in the proposed rearrangement and I do not think that it would achieve the end that Deputy Bennett hoped to achieve, to get equitable representation for the rural population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it would ensure four.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, as I pointed out in a previous discussion on this Bill, the amendment, if carried, would probably mean that in that small constituency of what he calls, with what justification I cannot see, East Limerick, the rural interests would probably be completely swamped by the urban interests, so that so far from the rural interests getting representation, it is doubtful whether they would get a Deputy at all.</P>
      <P>This proposal of Deputy Bennett's reminds me of nothing so much as the system upon which our country was partitioned because, just as Donegal, one of our most northerly counties, was included in what was called Southern Ireland, so Deputy Bennett, following in the footsteps of other statesmen now deceased, proposes to include the most easterly of the district electoral division of Limerick County in West Limerick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out to the Minister that Deputy Bennett's amendment, to my mind, looking at it purely from a geographical point of view, is a very reasonable amendment? I know some of these districts intimately and I would say that the majority of them are within a radius of eight to ten miles of Limerick City.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not confuse the issue as between East and West Limerick.  What the Deputy really attempted in his amendment was to set up an urban constituency, calling it Limerick City, and giving it three members.  I think it would be a very reasonable way of getting fair representation of the particular area because most of the districts included in Deputy Bennett's amendment in Limerick City and East Limerick are really suburban areas within eight to ten miles of the city.  If I read his amendment correctly, what he is aiming at is to set up a city or urban constituency, giving a fair representation to the urban population there, and leaving the remainder of the county for rural representation.  If we get away from East and West Limerick, really what is in his proposal is a city constituency with a suburban area added and the rest of the county to be represented by four members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is a very reasonable approach to the problem of readjusting this constituency and I think the Minister's proposals give an undue weight to the urban population and to the suburban population of Limerick City. I think there is identity of interest between the areas which Deputy Bennett proposes to have represented by four members.  They are all at the moment in one county and all in one constituency.  Kilbeheny has been mentioned here.  We all know that for Kilbeheny the market town is Mitchelstown. There is no identity of interest whatever as between Limerick City and that electoral area and I think that taking it by and large it would have <Col N="1709" /> been more reasonable to set up a city constituency with a suburban area added and leave the rest of the county as Limerick County.  I would suggest that even at this stage the Minister would reconsider the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was trying to help me out in that particular matter.  The nomenclature might be amended and, instead of calling it Limerick City and East Limerick, it might be called Limerick and the county.  That could be easily settled. I aim at giving the County Limerick proper representation.  The county comprises 130,000 or 140,000 people and the City of Limerick, with its suburbs, the area of north and south rural, comprises somewhere about 50,000, or, at the most, 55,000.  Whatever way you take it, the county would be entitled to five seats out of the seven.  We are not asking in this amendment that they should be given five out of the seven, but we want to ensure that they will get four out of the seven.  I am also asking the Minister to provide that such a place as Kilbeheny, whose residents, if they have any inclination, are inclined towards Cork rather than Limerick, and who market their goods in the town of Mitchelstown, and the majority of whom, perhaps, were never in Limerick, should not be compelled to be associated with the City of Limerick but should be allowed to <Col N="1710" /> remain in the county with which they have identical interests as an agricultural community.  The Minister objected to Doon being put in the County Limerick area.  It is already in the County Limerick area.</P>
      <P>No case can be made that Kilbeheny should be in the city area, because there is no identity of interest whatever between Kilbeheny and the city. There is identity of interest between Doon and Glin, even though they are 60 miles away, because they are an agricultural people.  They are in the same county and if to-morrow the Minister is selecting candidates for the county of Limerick I know he will take good care that they will have representation. That matter will settle itself, but I am arguing strongly that the present method of changing seats is quite unfair, that the agricultural community are not getting a fair crack of the whip.  I want to ensure that of seven seats they will be certain of at least four and they can take their chance of the fifth, to which they are entitled.  Even if they do get the fifth, they will not be over-represented.  I voted on the last amendment because, on the figures, I thought it fair to vote for Wexford.  I ask the House to vote for my amendment because, whether you take it on the figures of population or anything else, the county people are entitled to the representation that I ask for them in this amendment.</P>

      <P>I wish that the method employed here earlier in the evening, in giving a free discussion on certain principles, had been employed as a general principle in dealing with this Bill.  If that had been done in the beginning, the Bill might have had better consideration at the hands of a committee of the House.  However, this is not the time to deal with that question and I do not intend to elaborate on it now.</P>
      <P>I have indicated privately to the Minister that there are certain small adjustments, involving a couple of electoral divisions in the County Cork. They are now attached to certain constituencies but if the Minister examined them he might find that, for geographical and other reasons, they should be associated with the new constituency of West Cork.  The matter is now outside the scope of this House, but may I ask the Minister, if a proposal of this kind is brought to his notice in another place, to give it thorough consideration? It involves the transfer of two electoral divisions, Tarleton and Castletown Dunmanway.  I think the Minister will see that there is some merit in the proposal and I rose only to mention it and not to delay this measure any further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like a few moments to enter my protest against what I think is the complete abandonment of proportional representation. <Col N="1712" /> The introduction of three-seat constituencies is not applying strictly the intention of those who for years have stood in this House in favour of proportional representation.  I remember 20 or 25 years ago when we were talking in other Houses about giving protection to minorities in this country but we are not giving that idea proof that we were anxious to see minorities represented here, to protect the interests of minorities if there was any danger&mdash;which, thank God, there never has been to minorities in this part of Ireland.  If those people in those days gone by thought it was desirable to have proportional representation so that they could get representation then this House has made a step in the wrong direction as three-seat constituencies will not give representation to minorities.  Every member of the House who is contesting a three-seat constituency knows that.  If a minority candidate goes up for election in any three-seat constituency, can anyone tell me where that candidate is likely to get in.  Personally, I protest against what I think is a step towards the removal of proportional representation completely.  I would not be surprised to see proportional representation being removed from our Constitution entirely in the course of another year or two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister to-day had the audacity to suggest that this was an agreed measure and that all Parties were agreeable to its terms.  On the Second Reading I opposed it very strongly, first, on the grounds that it increases the number of Deputies. There is no demand in the country for that increase or for enlarging the Dáil. The people generally realise that the Government is costing quite enough without adding to it in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, on that principle, this Bill should not be allowed to pass.  Again, I object to the increased representation for the City of Dublin at the expense of the rural areas.  The Minister may claim that the population of Dublin has increased.  It has, as a result of misgovernment, of maladministration and of a policy which has driven the people from the rural areas into the city. <Col N="1713" /> Finally, I object to this Bill because it seeks to destroy, as far as it is possible to do so within the Constitution, the principle of proportional representation. That principle is enshrined in the Constitution, and it is not in the power of the Minister or the Government to destroy it.  As far as it is possible it is being sought by this Bill to destroy that system by reducing as many of the constituencies as possible to the smallest possible number of seats.  I think that the five-seat or the seven-seat constituency provides far more equitable representation as between the various interests in the country.  As far as the City of Dublin is concerned, there is no reason why any constituency in it should be less than a seven-seat constituency.  The fact is that the population is concentrated in small areas, and it would have been possible to provide constituencies of sufficient area capable of being properly represented by the Deputies elected.  There is no justification for a three-seat constituency in Dublin.  As a matter of fact, if the whole of the City of Dublin were in one constituency it would be quite possible for the Deputies elected to keep in touch with all their constituents, much easier than it is for a Deputy representing a rural constituency.</P>
    <P>On these grounds I think the Bill ought not to be allowed to pass.  It will add still further to the burdens on the community by enlarging the membership of this House.  As I pointed out before, there is no provision in this Bill, or in any of the legislation that has gone before it, for the compulsory attendance of members in the House. We are enlarging the membership of the House, and it has been suggested we are enlarging it in order to provide that there may be a quorum.  In the case of many important discussions here it has happened that we have not had a quorum of 20 members, notwithstanding the fact that there are 138 members of the House.  I think that this further enlargement of the National Assembly is uncalled for and undesirable, and that it is straining the Constitution to the utmost without justification.  As the Minister has pointed out already, he has had to leave it to a free vote of the House as <Col N="1714" /> to whether Wexford should have an additional Deputy or not.  The only way of providing that additional Deputy was by taking a seat from the County Mayo.  Why did that happen? Simply because the Minister has gone to the utmost limit in the provision of seats in this House.  He has gone to the very utmost limit that is possible within the Constitution.  The Constitution provides that the maximum number of seats shall be 147.  The Minister has gone to that extreme limit, and he now finds that when a county is inadequately represented he has to take a seat from some other constituency. In view of these things, I think the House should not agree to this Bill.  In view of the attitude which the Minister has taken up on the delicate question as between Mayo and Wexford, I think that he should leave the final passing of the Bill to a free vote of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the evil in this Bill is the evil that it is neither fish, flesh nor good red herring.  If you are going to have proportional representation, it is perfectly obvious that you should have five or seven-seat constituencies.  Personally, I think proportional representation is a fraud and a cod, and that it ought to be abolished.  I believe in the single member constituency, with the transferable vote, so that the man who gets the support of the largest number of people living in the constituency will represent the constituency.  The constituency should be of a size to enable the T.D. to familiarise himself with all its problems.  Under that system you would get a clear majority in this House, with a good strong Government, and with no doubts about it after a general election.  The rag-tag Constitution that we have provides for proportional representation.  I suppose that, until we can change that, we have got to abide this as well as the many other evils that have been foisted upon us by the incompetent Government that we have got.  But, having got this evil, it should not have appended to it an additional fraud.  Deputy Byrne has pointed out that all the talk about proportional representation&mdash;when the vast bulk of the constituencies are <Col N="1715" /> three-member constituencies&mdash;is just fantastic.  It becomes manifest at once that the majority will get two seats and the minority will get one.  The Independents, unless they are of an exceptional character, will get pushed out altogether.</P>
      <P>I urge on the House that, perhaps, the best thing it can do is to pass this Bill in order to manifest to the people the obvious fraud that proportional representation has become in this country.  That would be a valuable step towards the abolition of this system of election and the substitution therefor of single member constituencies, with the transferable vote.  It would ensure that the individual who ultimately secured the support of the largest number of voters residing in the constituency would be elected to represent him in this House, and would ensure that after the general elections that may take place in the future history of this country we would have a Government in this House backed by a clear and unequivocal majority.  That is very much more likely to be found from an electorate voting in single member constituencies than under the present system.</P>
      <P>Proportional representation is, in fact, as we all know in our hearts, the child of the brains of all the cranks in creation.  So far as this country is concerned, it was tried out on the dog. I doubt if any other sane democratic country in the world has put it into operation in regard to its Parliament. It may have in regard to its corporations or county councils.  The single transferable vote is quite another story.  I think it is true to say that the kind of proportional representation that we have operating in this country has not been adopted in any other country.  It was foisted upon us by a collection of half-lunatics who believed that they had something lovely that would work on paper like a jig-saw puzzle, but like all these crank ideas in operation, it has resulted here in an election in 1931, an election in 1932, an election in 1933, an election in 1939, an election in 1943, and an election in 1944.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An election first and a blackmail campaign the second time&mdash;that was how it <Col N="1716" /> was worked.  The public expressed their will, whereupon they were told that if they adhered to that view there would be chaos, whereupon they turned.  Five years later they express their will, and again they are told that if they persist in that view there will be chaos.  The people are blackmailed into changing their opinion.  Therefore, I advise the House to vote for the Bill so that we may provide our people with an opportunity of getting sick of this fantastic system and hasten the day by which we will return to a normal system devised to ascertain the will of the people and, at the same time, devised to ensure that when Parliament meets after a general election there shall be a strong Government representative of the majority of our people with full authority to rule until the lapse of the life of the Parliament when it returns to the people and takes their verdict again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to refer to the suggestion which has been made by Deputy Murphy that two district electoral divisions might be transferred from South to West Cork. I will look into the matter but, to be quite frank, I will have difficulty in conceding it.  Apart altogether from the merits of the case, of which I am not aware, since I do not know what the Deputy would like to urge in regard to them, there is this difficulty.  If I accept an amendment in the Seanad it may mean that we shall have to come back here and call the Dáil to dispose of it.  If, notwithstanding the merits of the matter, that position should arise, then I would think that, in view of the expressed desire of us all to clarify the existing position in the country as soon as possible, I should have to ask the Seanad not to accept an amendment of that sort, not to do anything which would necessitate the Bill coming back to the Dáil but to have the amendment disposed of there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to enter at length into the issue which has been raised by Deputy Byrne.  We are not abolishing proportional representation.  Proportional representation is embodied in the Constitution and the limitation put upon it there and which we are <Col N="1717" /> observing is that constituencies should not have less than three members. Three-member constituencies are not unknown under the existing system and they are not unknown in the City of Dublin.  Deputy Byrne, who raised this hare, sits for a three-member constituency, I think.  I do not know what particular minority he represents but at any rate, it has not debarred them from having secured representation here.  There is no reason to believe that a three-member constituency, which has not prevented the minority from expressing itself in Deputy Byrne's constituency any more than it has prevented itself from expressing itself in mine, is going to debar any minority of significant size from securing due representation here. The fact of the matter is that, as Deputy Dillon has pointed out, proportional representation if carried to extremes, with seven-member or even five-member constituencies, is likely to result, not in a more representative Dáil, not in a Dáil which would be more truly representative of public opinion throughout the country than a Dáil based on three-member constituencies would, but it is likely to give a weak and unstable executive&mdash; an executive which would not be able to give the country a lead and which would not be able to formulate and carry through whatever policy it, in its judgment, might think the interests of the country required.</P>
    <P>As to the other proposal which has been recommended by Deputy Dillon, I would say that the inevitable result would be that we should have people standing for Parliament who would be all things to all men; who would not merely endeavour to secure the votes of the organisation which put them up but who would try to secure the vote of every other Tom, Dick and Harry, more sympathetic towards other organisations.  We should have a system in which, inevitably, the policies which would be put before the country by political organisations would be watered down, so that they would make some appeal to every element in a community; and we should have here, not a Dáil composed of Deputies who have some fixed principles, principles for <Col N="1718" /> which they are prepared to stand and fight, but a Dáil composed of trimmers and, inevitably, a Government composed of trimmers also&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in which case you would not have that strong executive which Deputy Dillon believes is in the best interests of the people of this country.  For these reasons I consider that if ever it is felt, and I am not suggesting that the need has arisen, that it would be in the best interests of the people of this country to substitute some other system of election to Parliament for that which we have already, the suggestion made by Deputy Dillon should be the last one we ought to consider.  I want it to be quite clear that I am not denying that that system would be of very great benefit and advantage in relation to, say, the election of members of local authorities, because there we do not want to have people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The situation is radically different from that which prevails in relation to the election to Parliament. There, people are returned to look after purely local affairs, with an eye to the interests of everybody in the community, with no power of formulating a political policy, but returned solely as the representatives of the ratepayers to look after their interests and to ensure that the local services are well administered.  That is a position which differs fundamentally from that in which members of the Legislature find themselves.  Members of the Legislature must stand for certain fixed principles in political life and affairs.  For that reason, therefore, they must be men of a definite political character.  The principles to which they adhere may be acceptable or repugnant to us, but at any rate they have to be not trimmers but men of some principle.  That is why Deputy Dillon's suggestion is the worst that could possibly be devised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 4 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 19 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution therein of the following sub-section for sub-section (2) there of:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) A member of a harbour authority who is absent for more than six consecutive months from the meetings of such harbour authority shall vacate his office unless the harbour authority decides that there is good reason for such absence.</P>
      <P>I put down this amendment as the operation of the Principal Act has brought about an anomalous position. Under the provisions of that Act, a member of a harbour board becomes automatically disqualified if he is absent from 50 per cent. of the meetings in any consecutive period of six months.  The men who sit on these boards are mainly drawn from business interests and it is difficult for them to keep an account of their attendances. The manager, however, has to keep a constant check on their attendances.  I think there should be some stated period provided for so as to enable members to keep in touch with the matter.  There is no notice given to members of the fact that they are liable to be disqualified.  They are automatically disqualified under the terms of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, again, there is no credit given to them for attendance at committee meetings.  Some of the most important functions of these boards are delegated to committees from time to time.  But under the existing provisions attendance at a committee meeting does not count.  A member becomes disqualified from membership if he misses 50 per cent. of the meetings in any consecutive period of six months, although the holiday period may intervene or other things of that kind.  I suggest to the <Col N="1722" /> Minister that that position ought to be remedied.  It may not appear to be a very major matter, but I think it is a matter of importance.  As I say, the members get no notice of the matter, even if they are absent on holidays or anything else; their disqualification is automatic.  I think there ought to be some period set down.  I am not inclined to press strongly for a period of six months as set out in the amendment. In fact, there is a slight error there, as six consecutive meetings was my intention.  I think a period of three months would meet the matter.  The present position, however, needs to be altered.</P>
    <P>I do not know of any institution or board having a similar procedure.  As I said, a member may have attended several committee meetings but there is no credit given for these attendances. If a member is absent from 50 per cent. of the actual board meetings, he is disqualified. If the Minister thinks the period six months mentioned in the amendment is too long, I think a period of three months ought to be provided for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good deal to be said for the broad general view expressed by Deputy Keyes, but I am afraid the amendment in its present form would be highly undesirable in this respect: under the terms of the amendment a member who merely attended three meetings in the year which would be within the section would be deemed to be a good and proper member of a harbour authority.  I am sure Deputy Keyes would admit that a member who attended only three times in the year is not worthy of being a member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me, however, that the percentage stated in the Act itself is too high.  As anybody who has experience of harbour boards will understand, there is a series of committee meetings at which perhaps the business of the board is really done.  Take the case of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  It is at its finance meeting, which precedes the meeting of the board, that the business is really done.  The board may meet on the Thursday and that meeting may be regarded as a confirmation of the preceding day's work. <Col N="1723" /> Very often the members of the board who are interested in the work will attend the finance meeting on Wednesday. They may not be able to attend the board meeting on Thursday, but they get no credit for their attendance on Wednesday.  That is the point to which Deputy Keyes is referring.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to say what would be the correct approach to it.  It may, however, interest Deputy Keyes to know that the Dublin Port and Docks Board have adopted another method which I shall mention so that the Minister may be aware of it.  If a member who is unable to attend a stated meeting of the full board sends an advice to that effect, that advice is placed before the board and, if there is good reason for his absence, the board accepts his explanation and in fact credits him with attendance at that particular meeting.  Of course, the reason given must be a good one.  The board, for instance, will not accept a telephone message to say that he is detained somewhere.  He will have to give a good and sound reason for his absence.</P>
    <P>With Deputy Keyes, I would impress on the Minister that the percentage of attendances required at stated meetings of the board, which, as I say, are merely confirmatory meetings, is too high.  The danger is, however, that if you give credit for attendance at committee meetings you will have members merely attending at the committee meetings and the stated meeting may fall through.  In that way the business would be reduced to a state of chaos because, if there is not a quorum present for the stated meeting of the board, the meeting will fall through.</P>
    <P>There are two lines upon which you might proceed: (1) to lower the 50 per cent. provided for in the Act for the actual meetings of the board; and (2) something like the method adopted by the Dublin Port and Docks Board, which at the moment is giving satisfaction. I might say that that system has only been in operation for a couple of weeks.  We had encountered somewhat the same difficulties as are being encountered in Limerick, as members were continually having to explain their <Col N="1724" /> absence and were about to be disqualified.</P>

      <P>I have one difficulty in arguing against the amendment and that is the fact that the Act as introduced last year contained a provision on the lines which Deputy Keyes now suggests, and I was persuaded by the Dáil to adopt the alternative provision which is now in the Act.  The Deputy, however, is under one misapprehension. He states that a member who fails to attend half the meetings of a harbour authority during six consecutive months is automatically disqualified.  The section provides that he shall vacate office unless the harbour authority decides that there is good reason for such absence, so that it is clear that disqualification is not automatic. It is in the power of the harbour authority to decide on the merits of the case that he should not be disqualified from continuing membership.  It seems to me that there is not much difference between Deputy Keyes' proposal and what is in the Bill.  In the last resort, it is the harbour authority itself which has the final decision as to the continuing qualification of any member.  I would therefore suggest, merely from the point of view of leaving things as they are, if there is not good reason to change them, that the Deputy might withdraw the amendment having regard to the fact that the final decision under the section of the Principal Act rests with the harbour authority.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 5 to insert the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>5.&mdash;(1)  Where by-laws made by a. harbour authority specify the time during which goods may remain upon any quays or other places within the harbour of that harbour authority, the following provisions shall apply in relation to any goods (other than goods forfeitable under the Customs Acts) remaining upon such quays or other places after the expiration of the time so specified&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the harbour authority may, with the consent of the collector or other proper officer of customs and excise in the case of goods which have not been entered and cleared by the customs, at any time after such expiration remove the goods to another place or store, subject in case the owner of the goods is known to the harbour authority, to their giving to such owner seven days previous notice of their intention to so remove the goods, and the cost of removal and subsequent storage shall be recoverable by the harbour authority from the owner of the goods,</P>
      <P>(b)  the harbour authority may hold the goods until all rates, rents and other charges due in respect of the goods and the cost of removal and storage (if any) are paid to the harbour authority,</P>
      <P>(c)  the harbour authority may sell the goods, subject, in case the owner of the goods is known to the harbour authority, to their giving to such owner fourteen days previous notice of their intention to sell the goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) A harbour authority shall not, <Col N="1727" /> under sub-section (1) of this section, sell for home use any article if any prohibition or restriction on importation applies in respect thereof or if the price which would be obtained is less than the amount of any duties of customs or excise payable in respect thereof.</P>
    <P>(3) The following provisions shall apply in relation to goods sold by a harbour authority under sub-section (1) of this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the proceeds of such sale shall be applied in paying the following charges in the following order:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) any customs or excise duties due in respect of the goods,</P>
    <P>(ii) all rates, rents and other charges due on the goods to the harbour authority,</P>
    <P>(iii) the cost of removal and storage (if any) of the goods and the expense of and incidental to the sale,</P>
    <P>(b) where the proceeds of any such sale have been so applied&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) if any surplus remains, it shall be paid on demand to the persons appearing to the harbour authority to have been the owner of the goods before such sale,</P>
    <P>(ii) if the rates, rents and other charges due on the goods, the cost of removal and storage of the goods and the expenses of and incidental to the sale remain unpaid in part, the balance thereof may be recovered by the harbour authority from the person who was the owner of the goods before such sale as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>(4)  Nothing contained in the foregoing sub-sections of this section shall affect the powers of the Revenue Commissioners under Section 73 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876.</P>
    <P>This amendment is being introduced at the request of the Cork Harbour Commissioners. The commissioners in their representations to me referred to the present tendency on the part of importers, and particularly on the part of <Col N="1728" /> importing agents, to use the quays and the transit sheds at the ports as storehouses. The section provides that if goods are left on quays or other places within the harbour limits, in excess of the period allowed under the harbour by-laws, the harbour authority may have them either removed and stored at the expense of the owner after giving seven days' notice or hold the goods until he pays the cost of removal or storage as well as other rates and charges or they may sell the goods after giving the owner 14 days' notice and recover from the proceeds of the sale, the costs incurred by the harbour authority as well as rates and other charges.  Under Section 85 of last year's Act, there was power to charge rent in respect of goods left on the quays or at any place within the limits of the harbour for a period in excess of that laid down by the by-laws.  It has however been found that the charge provided for under the by-laws for that purpose, has been ineffective in securing the desired result.  That is possibly due to the abnormal circumstances now prevailing but, in any event, it is obviously undesirable that importers and importing agents should use the quays and transit sheds of a harbour authority as storehouses.  Additional power is given to harbour authorities under this section which is regarded as being necessary to prevent abuse.</P>

      <P>On the section, I just want to say that I drew the Minister's attention to the position of the Dundalk Harbour Commissioners.  The Minister is well aware that owing to circumstances over which neither the harbour commissioners nor himself have control, the harbour commissioners find themselves in a very bad position at the moment, so bad that they find it almost impossible to carry on.  It was with a view to enabling the harbour commissioners to raise a loan to pay off existing loans that I wished to have the amendment, which had just been ruled out of order, inserted in the Bill.  I need not worry the Minister with the whole history of the Dundalk Harbour Commissioners because he is well aware of it.  Suffice it to say that the aggregate of the interest charges on the capital sums which they borrowed some years ago in order to buy out private interests and the various little sidings at the harbour, including a special of £9,000 which they got some time ago, is more than the income derived by the harbour commissioners during the last few years.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, imports had practically ceased up to the past six months.  I may say that the position is looking somewhat better.  We all hope that in the near future there will be a resumption of what was the chief source of income for Dundalk and other harbours, namely, imports of coal.  I think we may look forward to an increase in so far as imports of coal are concerned.  If that happy position comes about, the harbour authorities will be able to continue, but at the moment they find it almost impossible to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to see in yesterday's papers that the Minister had taken steps to remedy the position in relation to harbours, in so far as the making of river basins safe for shipping is concerned. That is welcome news for Dundalk, Drogheda and Sligo.  If not on this stage, possibly on the Report Stage the Minister might consider putting in an amendment similar to the one I submitted which will empower harbour <Col N="1730" /> authorities, if they so desire, to raise a loan, which the Minister will guarantee, to enable them to pay off existing loans.  I presume if they did raise a loan it would be at a lower rate of interest than they are paying at the moment and the savings would enable them to carry on in a better way than they have been carrying on during the past few years.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will keep this matter before him and that he will recognise the unfortunate position in which the Dundalk Harbour Commissioners find themselves at the moment. Perhaps he will do something to lessen the load of debt by way of annual charges which they have to meet and which, in view of the income now accruing to them, they are scarcely in a position to meet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>An amendment is not necessary to enable the Minister to make a grant to the Dundalk harbour authority.  Grants are being made to harbour authorities at present for doing essential maintenance work which may have fallen into arrears during the emergency or for the construction of improvement works, but only for these purposes.  There are no grants available for paying off old debts.  A harbour authority can get a loan out of the Local Loans Fund for harbour works.  The Minister could guarantee a loan.  He has guaranteed one for the Dundalk harbour authority, but only for the execution of specific works, not for paying off old debts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a guaranteed loan of 35,000 in the case of Dundalk and I recently informed the harbour authorities there that I have no objection to their proposal that arrangements should be made to secure the consent of the trustees and the debenture holders to the transfer to the commissioners of the existing sinking fund in respect of the guaranteed loan so that it might be applied in cancellation of an equivalent amount of the debenture. That would have the effect of reducing by one-half the annual payments to the sinking fund.  We have made some grants to the Dundalk harbour authority for essential maintenance work.  I understand that there is a question of the Board of Works <Col N="1731" /> making an offer for the dredger there which is now out of commission and which will require a great deal of repairs before it can be put back into work.</P>
    <P>I am very anxious that harbours such as Dundalk should be rapidly put into commission again and provided with all necessary facilities because the time is in sight now when the trade upon which those harbours depended in the past will be restored.  There is an application from the Dundalk harbour authority for a grant for improvement works under consideration, but there is difficulty in having the surveys, which are necessary before such works can be approved, carried out.  The difficulty arises out of the scarcity of skilled engineering staff.  However, the application of the Dundalk Harbour Commissioners will be disposed of as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (4), to insert the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4) In fixing the compensation payable under this section the arbitrator shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case and, in particular, the circumstances in which the annual sum, in respect of the cesser of which the compensation is payable, became payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment has been introduced on the representations of the Cork Harbour Board.  Deputies will remember that the Act provided for the cancellation <Col N="1735" /> of the annual payment made by the Cork Harbour Board to the Cork Corporation arising out of an agreement made in 1820.  The Act provided that compensation would be paid by the harbour authority to the corporation because of the disappearance of the annual payment, the amount of compensation to be determined, in default of agreement, by an arbitrator. The commissioners suggested that the arbitrator should have power to decide whether or not any payment should be made at all, as well as what amount should be paid.  They felt that in the absence of any terms of reference the arbitrator might just work on a formula computing so many years' purchase and have no regard to the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies will remember that a similar question arose in connection with the Transport Act when the payment of wayleaves by the Transport Company to the Dublin Corporation was terminated, and the provision inserted in this Bill is taken from the Transport Act.  It provides similarly for the empowering of the arbitrator to have regard to all the circumstances of the case.  Of course, the Cork Harbour Commissioners would rather there was no compensation at all, but we could not provide for the wiping out of the payment without compensation; it might have been held to be unconstitutional.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.  Its main provisions involve no change in the present law.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to give permanent effect to temporary provisions with regard to Irish Shipping Limited, as contained in Emergency Powers Orders.  The <Col N="1737" /> Department of Industry and Commerce prepared this Bill and the following Merchant Shipping Bill as one measure, but it was considered by the legal officers of the Government that there were reasons why these various provisions should be contained in two measures rather than in one.</P>
      <P>During the war foreign shipping companies which operated regularly to Irish ports suspended their services, and the problem of obtaining ships for essential commodities became a constant source of anxiety.  It was considered unlikely that private enterprise would undertake a job of the magnitude involved and Irish Shipping Limited was formed with the backing of the Government.  The company, as everybody knows, rendered invaluable service during the war and was one of the principal factors which saved us from economic collapse during that period.</P>
      <P>The company has at present a liner service to Montreal, St. John's (New Brunswick), New York and neighbouring ports, as well as Gothenburg and Oslo, and in addition operates tramp services mainly from Canada, North Africa and the Baltic.  It undertakes chartering of vessels for Irish importers and provides agency services for foreign ships trading to Irish ports.</P>
      <P>The company undertook war risk insurance in 1941 and subsequently extended the insurance business to cater for ordinary marine and aviation risks.  The entry of Irish Shipping Limited into the field of insurance was in a sense an accident dictated by circumstances arising out of the war when coverage against certain war risks could not be obtained through the usual channels and it was never intended that Irish Shipping Limited should retain the insurance business as a permanent feature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under normal conditions, the specialised business of marine insurance, which would be the main business left after war risk insurance ceased to be necessary, could more appropriately be carried on by concerns already engaged in other forms of insurance business. An arrangement was made therefore, after negotiations with the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Limited, that <Col N="1738" /> the marine underwriting business of Irish Shipping Limited should be transferred to the insurance corporation in January of last year.</P>
    <P>It is, however, to the credit of Irish Shipping Limited, that they established in Dublin a marine underwriting market and I understand that in consequence of its enterprise there has been built up already a substantial premium income from abroad.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of efficient and economic ship repairing facilities is essential to the operation of a separate merchant marine.  In 1941 Irish Shipping Limited, established the Cork Dockyard Company to acquire the Haulbowline dockyard.  The Dublin dockyards were fully occupied and were unable to cope with the additional work following the expansion of the Irish merchant fleet.  The Cork Dockyard Company played an important part during the war in keeping our vessels in commission and the part which our ship-repairing industry must play in the future is no less important.</P>
    <P>The only important new provision in the Bill provides for an increase of the capital of the company, which is at present out of proportion to the company's assets.  It has a present authorised capital of £200,000 and all the shares are held by the Minister for Finance except for the qualifying shares of the five directors.  Provision is being made in this legislation for increased capital, so that, if necessary, the company can call upon it to implement fully their plans for the establishment of a worth-while merchant fleet composed of modern ships.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided as a matter of policy that the size of the fleet to be maintained is to be determined, on the one hand by the minimum tonnage required to bring in essential imports at all times, and on the other hand, by the possibility of obtaining profitable employment for the ships.  At present the company has seven new ships under construction with a total dead weight tonnage of 46,000 tons.  Three of them are 9,000 dead weight, two are 7,500 tons, and two are 2,000 tons and the total cost of the vessels is approximately £1,900,000.</P>
    <P>The cost is being defrayed out of the <Col N="1739" /> company's reserve funds.  The vessels, when completed, will be used to inaugurate a new service to South America and to improve the existing services for which the present tonnage is inadequate.  The vessels are being built in Great Britain.  The possibility of having them built in our own shipyards was explored, and that possibility is still being explored, but so far it has not been found possible to place an order with an Irish firm.  Apart from the British firms who secured the orders, shipbuilders in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland and Italy were asked to quote for these vessels. Arising out of a suggestion which I saw made at one time in a newspaper, I should perhaps mention that Messrs. Harland and Wolff, of Belfast, were also asked to quote, but stated that they were unable to do so, because of their present heavy commitments.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to give the company power to increase its capital to £5,000,000, but no issue of shares can be made without the authority of the Minister for Finance, given after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Minister for Finance has also certain controlling power over the company by virtue of provisions in the company's articles of association and these powers are being preserved in the Bill.  The memorandum and articles of association of the company may not be altered without the approval of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Bill for the payment of subsidies to the company and for the guaranteeing of loans. These provisions are already contained in an Emergency Powers Order.  I should perhaps say that it is not contemplated, in any circumstances we foresee in the immediate future, that subsidies will be necessary.  Everybody knows, however, that shipping is a most competitive trade, and that, during the period between the wars, freight-cutting and other unfair practices were adopted by powerful shipping organisations in order to drive out smaller organisations and take their business from them.  I think it is desirable <Col N="1740" /> to have this provision for subsidy in the Bill, if for no other reason than to give notice to anybody who may be thinking of smashing our small merchant marine service that we are not going to allow that to happen, that, if necessary, we will utilise the resources of the State to keep it in existence as an essential safeguard for our security.</P>
    <P>At the present time, of course, shipping can be carried on profitably and the ships of Irish Shipping Limited are trading on all routes at competitive freights and securing ample cargoes which yield profit, but if circumstances should arise in which competition became intensified and unfair practices were adopted by shipping organisations or other Governments adopted a policy of subsidy in order to obtain an undue proportion of the trade for their merchant service, we would have to give support to our organisation also.  I do not think that anybody would contemplate with equanimity a repetition of the situation in which we found our selves at the beginning of the war, without adequate shipping under our own control.  It is, of course, inevitable that there will be an increase in the total amount of shipping in the world.  The report on maritime transport which was prepared in Paris in connection with the Marshall Plan estimates that, by 1951, the tonnage of vessels available to the countries participating in the plan will be approximately 16 per cent. above their prewar tonnage.  Our country's proposals are modest in perspective.  The extension of this merchant fleet may be a big undertaking for us, but I think it is necessary to keep in mind that, even when we have carried out the development programme in contemplation, our merchant fleet will still be amongst the smallest in Europe, even by comparison with the other small nations of Europe.  The Belgian, Danish and Portuguese fleets will all be substantially larger than ours.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the power to guarantee borrowings is also being retained. No guarantee for a loan raised by the company has in fact been in force since August, 1942, but, because of the matters to which I have referred and which justify the retention in the Bill of the provision for a subsidy, it <Col N="1741" /> is regarded as desirable to retain also the power to guarantee a loan which would enable the company to secure credit, if it required it, readily and on reasonable terms.  Sections 3 to 7 of the Bill deal with the holding of shares in the company by the Minister for Finance and I should perhaps say that it is not intended, at any rate at present, that any new issues of capital will be offered to the public.  The accounts of the company are published annually and they are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  That arrangement to have the accounts audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General is not required by any legislation-it is an arrangement made on the initiative of the company.  It may be a matter of interest to Deputies to be informed that, since it was established in March, 1941, the company has paid a total of £2,078,000 in taxation to the State.</P>
    <P>The Bill must be viewed as part of a general scheme to achieve a reasonable degree of self-sufficiency in time of emergency.  Apart from that security aspect, however, the establishment of a merchant marine service must be regarded as a useful factor, in that it may lead to a growth of trade, and, what is of special importance at present, a conservation of dollar supplies.  It will not suffice merely to have a sufficiency of tonnage on the Irish register.  The shipping must be Irish-owned and must carry the Irish national flag.  We must have Irish crews available to man these vessels and Irish ship-repairing facilities available to overhaul and repair them when necessary.  At the present time, Irish Shipping Limited and the Cork Dockyard Company, its subsidiary, find employment for over 700 persons.</P>
    <P>A good augury for the future is the provision of the new graving dock at Dublin, towards the cost of which a Government grant of two-thirds of the total cost, to a maximum of £500,000, has been made.  When completed, the new dock will be capable of accommodating vessels up to 18,000 tons gross. At present, the graving dock facilities are not adequate to take vessels of the size now in use and the larger vessels of Irish Shipping Limited could not <Col N="1742" /> be dry-docked in Dublin or any Irish port, if that course became necessary. The provision of the new graving dock at Dublin is therefore also a necessary step to ensure that, in time of international difficulty or emergency, we will have not merely an adequate merchant marine but the facilities to keep it on the sea.  A great deal of the work for which this Bill makes legal provision has already been done.  It has been done under the authority of emergency powers Orders which it is desirable should cease to operate and should be replaced by permanent legislation.  That is the main purpose of the measure which I recommend to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <P>Nobody will object to giving permanent effect to emergency legislation under which the State had, during the emergency, a shipping service of its own.  The people generally realise the great benefit which they derived from Irish Shipping Limited, at a very difficult time and during periods when we might, otherwise, have been deprived of certain essential commodities from abroad.  It has always been difficult to ascertain the full facts about Irish Shipping Limited.  It is true that they publish a balance sheet but, at best, a balance sheet gives only a limited amount of information which a company is bound to disclose under statute.  The fact that the Comptroller and Auditor-General audits the accounts of the company, under an arrangement with it, does not make available to members of the House full financial information regarding Irish Shipping Limited.  I have always held the view that a State company of this kind should be compelled by statute to have its accounts placed before the Comptroller and Auditor-General and that these accounts should come up in the ordinary way for examination by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Irish Shipping Limited, has paid so large a sum in taxation over the past six years&mdash;£2,078,000&mdash;is news to most Deputies and shows that the company must be making a substantial profit.  During the course of the emergency, a number of persons using the services of Irish Shipping Limited, complained of its high rates.  There may have been contributory factors <Col N="1743" /> over which the company had no control but it was significant that they did, on two occasions, reduce the freights they were charging.  It was equally noteworthy that the premiums payable on marine insurance carried on by the company were higher&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody was compelled to insure with the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;its marine insurance rates were higher than similar rates elsewhere.  I admit that shippers were free to insure elsewhere.  I should like to get from the Minister a picture of the financial strength of the company.  He mentioned that it was proposed that the company should pay out of its reserve funds for the new ships.  It is satisfactory that the company's position is so strong; that it is able to pay out of profits for the ships now required.  It is, however, important that the Dáil should get an adequate idea of the present financial position of the company.  I suggest that the Minister might consider, on the Committee Stage, an amendment, now that the company is being established under permanent legislation, that the Comptroller and Auditor-General be responsible under statute for auditing the accounts of the company and that these accounts be laid before the Dáil.  It is possible to get a copy of the balance sheet but information is not made available in the same way as it is when accounts are, under statute, furnished and made available to Deputies.  The proposal to expand the capital is, no doubt, necessary in view of the fact that the company will continue as a permanent feature of our economic life.  Before, however, the House is called upon to pass the Bill, we should get a clearer indication of the financial position of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as this Bill ensures that the State will have ships of its own, I think it will be welcomed by all Parties and by the people generally. The Minister referred to the work done by the few ships we had during the war in taking necessary materials here, but he also mentioned that, in between wars, there is a period of keen <Col N="1744" /> competition between shipping interests. He visualised foreign combines buying up or putting out of business our little shipping companies here.  I hope these ships will be worked on a competitive basis&mdash;that they will not be dependent upon subsidies just because they belong to the State.  The Minister knows that freight charges have a very important reaction upon industry.  If we have to pay higher freights to have our goods carried in Irish bottoms than would be payable if they were carried in foreign bottoms, that may be all right so far as keeping the ships going is concerned but it may be all wrong in its effect on our internal economy.  I should like to sound a note of warning that advantage should not be taken to run up costs simply because subsidies may be available which the country will have to pay.  I am glad the Minister is conscious of that.  I trust that those whose interest it is to keep these ships going will realise that it is also in their interest and the interest of the country that the ships should be worked at a cost which the country can afford to pay and a cost which will react favourably on the price of materials which have to be imported in order to keep our industries going.  So long as that aspect of the matter is kept in view by the Minister, I think all Parties will have a hearty welcome for this Bill and wish it all the success it deserves.  I do not think that the Minister mentioned the number of ships which it is proposed to have at sea.  Perhaps he would do so in his reply.  It is good to hear that, in addition to the setting up of these shipping services, there is to be an extension of our dockyards, especially the yard in Dublin.  The Minister mentioned that it would be so extended as to accommodate ships with a tonnage up to 18,000.  That will be a welcome extension because it will enable the authorities there to engage in building and repair work which could not previously be done because of the restricted area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The accounts of the company are, of course, published.  It is a public company and it complies fully with the requirements of the Companies Acts.  I have no desire whatever to withhold information from the <Col N="1745" /> Dáil regarding the finances of the company but I do not think that it would be practicable to have those accounts considered by the Public Accounts Committee.  They are not public accounts.  They are the accounts of a commercial organisation&mdash;a commercial organisation which could not reasonably be expected to keep all the data which a Government Department must keep so that every possible transaction of the Department is fully documented and all information concerning it capable of production at a moment's notice either to enable a reply to be given to a Dáil question or to answer some query by the Public Accounts Committee.  To impose on a commercial organisation the burden which the keeping of records in that form would involve would be greatly to handicap its operations. This commercial organisation is getting whatever business it gets in competition with the rest of the world in the most competitive trade in the world.  There is no protection here. There is no Government assistance of any kind and there is no statutory obligation on any Irish importer or exporter to avail of the services of Irish Shipping Limited.  He can avail of American, British, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese ships to bring cargoes in and out of this country if he can get service from them cheaper.  We think it is good business for Irish shippers to support Irish Shipping, Limited, even if they can get an occasional cut freight from someone else because, in the long run, it is in their interests that the company should be kept in existence but there is no question of any legal obligation on them to do so. If we are to maintain that position, to keep this company in the position that it can get business in competition, clearly, we must not impose on it any obligations involving overhead expenses or charges which its competitors have not to meet.  That, I think, answers fully Deputy Coburn's point.  This company is thoroughly competitive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is getting all the business which it is now getting in competition with any other shipping company operating on the same routes. <Col N="1746" /> It made substantial profits during the war.  In the main these profits derived from its marine insurance business. They got that business, again, in competition with Lloyds and other insurance agencies.  They had a fortunate experience.  I think, during the whole of the war, they had not to pay out on any of its own ships lost through. belligerent action.  Two ships were lost which were in the service of the company but they were both chartered from the United States Maritime Authority under a contract which required them to be insured in the United States.  The substantial profits of the company derived largely from that business and again I want to emphasise that they got that business in free competition with other marine insurers in this country and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>They got into the business mainly because other marine insurers would not undertake the risk which it was necessary for certain importers to incur in bringing goods to this country via Lisbon.  At a certain stage of the war, when it seemed possible that the Germans would extend their activities into the Iberian Peninsula and occupy Lisbon, ordinary insurance companiesin England and elsewhere refused to insure Irish firms importing goods through Lisbon against war risk attaching to these goods while in store in Lisbon beyond a certain period of time.  It looked as if the inability of these firms to get that cover would close that channel of importation.  In order to keep it open, Irish Shipping Limited, went into the business of giving insurance against that risk and then found it was a business they could extend. Their extension into it cut down the insurance premiums which were being demanded by outside marine insurers. Its intervention in the business effected very substantial saving for all people interested in shipping goods here because insurance rates were cut by all insurers, but it continued to get business on merit and on that business it made substantial profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the balance sheet of the company on the 30th June, 1946, its tonnage replacement reserve stands at £2,700,000.  It will be remembered that the company had to buy ships during <Col N="1747" /> the war.  It bought anything that would sail and that it could get, irrespective of price.  It was, therefore, necessary that the company should, not merely wipe out of its accounts the heavy initial cost of buying these ships and keeping them in service during the war, but also build up a reserve fund from which the ships could be replaced when orders for new ships could be placed with shipbuilding firms.  The balance sheet of the company is in fact quite healthy and it indicates that it will not be necessary, arising out of its immediate programme, to avail of the additional borrowing powers for which this Bill makes provision or to avail of Government guarantee for loans.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, however, to keep in mind that there are fields of activity for Irish Shipping Limited, which have not yet been touched.  I refer to the cross-Channel business as indicating a very important field to which, it seems to me, we will have to give attention. If the company is to enter that field it must enter it with proper equipment and in a proper manner, which will involve utilisation of the larger capital resources for which this Bill makes provision. At the present time the company, I understand, has nine ships in service and has seven ships building.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly true that the company made high profits during the war.  It is not true that it made these high profits by charging excessive rates for its services.  It is true that during the war years no other ships would come to this country and the company could in fact charge what they chose.  They did, however, fix charges on a provisional basis.  When they found that those charges were yielding substantial revenue, they cut them again and again until, finally, competitive conditions were restored and since then they have been working on competitive rates.  In the main, however, the high profits which they made accrued to them from the insurance business and that business was of immense value to this country.  Not merely did it yield these profits to this company but it brought down the cost of insurance through Lloyds' agents or other channels very, very substantially, <Col N="1748" /> which was of benefit to everybody who had to insure against war risk or ordinary marine risk or any risk associated with the movement of ships or goods on ships.</P>
    <P>I think these are the only points that it is necessary to refer to now.  There is, as I have said, every desire to give the Dáil the fullest possible information of the company provided the company is not required to do more than an ordinary commercial undertaking would be required to do in the matter of publishing details of its business or in the keeping of records which would be the means of answering inquiries concerning its business.  It is in a highly competitive trade and it cannot remain in that trade unless it is given full commercial freedom of operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It should have full freedom but the fact that we vote the money should entitle the Dáil to information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary to remember that there is no money being voted.  If occasion should arise in which the Dáil was being asked to vote any money for this company then, of course, all the information necessary to justify that course would have to be given to the Dáil.  At the present time there is no question of voting any money at all. The Minister for Finance orignally subscribed £200,000, which is the present capital of the company.  I mentioned the taxation figure to indicate that he got back that £200,000 ten times.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Both when the Minister introduced his Supplementary Budget and when we discussed a Budget in the beginning of the year, very strong emphasis was laid on the fact that the increase in the rate of <Col N="1749" /> income-tax was imposing a very serious drain on family life.  In the early part of the year, a considerable amount of argument and information was put before the Minister which indicated that it was absolutely necessary&mdash;if the income-tax rate was going to be at the rate then, not to talk at all of the rate to which it is going to be raised now&mdash;to give substantial additional relief to those who have the responsibility of maintaining and educating children. Now, when the Minister proposes to add an additional 6d. to the income-tax, the question raises itself strongly again.</P>
      <P>We are opposed to any rise in income-tax that does not make a substantial additional allowance for people who have families to rear.  It is evident every day that, so far from no effective steps being taken to reduce the cost of living, the cost of living is rising as every month passes.  The very fact that the Government are forced to see about arranging another type of cost-of-living figure indicates that they are trying to side-step the very definite position of hardship that arises here.  I ask the Minister again, before he asks us to accept this additional increase in income-tax, to face up to the question of those who have families to maintain.  Unless it is shown to us that he intends to introduce proposals to relieve them, we shall vote against this increase.</P>

      <P>It is not good enough for the Minister to answer glibly like that.  We have shown, and are prepared to show, that we understand whether the situation is serious or not.  We have shown that we are prepared to support the Government in any measure it is necessary to take to help to keep the finances of this country right or to help the people to weather the emergency.  The Government are entirely shutting their eyes to the difficulties being experienced by people with families to maintain.  The matter has been put very fully before the Minister and it is not sufficient for him to say glibly that this Party or any other Party is not prepared to face its responsibilities and impose taxation when necessary.  It is generally considered that the imposition of this taxation is not necessary, but we particularly object, when it is being imposed, to the fact that no additional relief is being given to assist in the maintenance, rearing and education of children.</P>

      <P>I think it would be well if the Minister would again explain what, in fact, is the general effect of this section.  When the Minister was dealing with this matter before he apparently appears to have slurred over the effect of the tax in such a way as to create surprise in the case of the people on whom the tax will fall.  For instance, Financial Resolution No. 5 indicates that, in the case of wine not exceeding 25 degrees of proof spirit, the new tax is going to be 12/-, of wine exceeding 25 but not exceeding 30 degrees of proof spirit the tax is going to be £1, and of wine exceeding 30, but not exceeding 42 degrees of proof spirit that the tax is going to be £2 8s.  It did not appear to the public, at any rate, that the new tax on the wine most in use in the country was going to be at the rate of 8/- per bottle.  The report of the Revenue Commissioners for 1946 shows that only 5,087 gallons of wine not exceeding 25 degrees were imported and 136,566 gallons not exceeding 30 degrees, but that in the case of wine between 30 and 42 degrees proof spirit the import figure was 388,700 gallons, or something over 70 per cent. of the total import.</P>
      <P>Some members of the licensed trade have felt, from the public complexion already given to the Minister's remarks, that they are now liable to be charged as profiteers by reason of the fact that the wine which the majority of them sell is now bearing a tax of 8/- per bottle-there being six bottles to the gallon-whereas the Minister's remarks would have led them to understand that the tax that was being imposed was substantially less than that.  I think it would be well if the Minister cleared up for the public generally what the effect of this new tax is.</P>

      <P>The Financial Resolution gave exactly the rates of tax which were being imposed in the Budget, and it is up to anybody affected to make his own calculations.  I gave one or two sample cases&mdash;showing what was estimated would be the increased duty per bottle.  As the Deputy has seen <Col N="1753" /> himself, the duties on wines are imposed per gallon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did say&mdash;and this is what has given rise to the misunderstanding&mdash;in his Budget statement at column 394 of the Dáil Debates when dealing with the increased tax on wines that what was proposed was:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Double the tax on wines so that the rate of duty on a bottle of light table wine will be about 2/- instead of l/- per bottle; on ordinary sherry, 3/4 instead of 1/8 per bottle; on champagne, 10/4 instead of 5/2 per bottle.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have pointed out that the fact is that 70 per cent. of the ordinary wines imported are above 30 degrees, and that, in fact, the tax that is on a bottle of that particular wine would be 8/-.  I think that the Minister, when he was dealing with the matter at all, could have avoided misunderstanding on the part of the public and of traders if he had commented over the whole range instead of commenting on the figure that bears the lower tax.</P>

      <P>There has been a certain amount of conflict between the opinion expressed by the Minister for Finance and the opinion expressed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to the intention of the proposals to increase the duties on spirits. The Minister in his statement on the Supplementary Budget said that this increase in tax would bring in an additional £935,000.  I would like if he would refresh our minds as to what this tax will bring in in a full year.  As I understand it, this £935,000, as an additional tax on spirits, will be got between this and the end of the financial year.  I should like to know if the Minister expects to get this tax out of the consumers of spirits here, or whether it is the intention to close down to some extent on the distribution of spirits here with a view to exporting <Col N="1754" /> spirits abroad.  The Minister is here proposing a very heavy tax on the consumer of spirits, and it is doubtful whether the figure mentioned will be arrived at.  I think it is desirable that we should have cleared up for us what is the real intention of the proposal in Section 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained the intention of imposing this duty on spirits&mdash;that it was to collect the £935,000 which we estimated.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce simply adverted to a statement made by some Deputy to the effect that the consumption of whiskey would drop, and he said that, in that event, there would be more whiskey to export.  I expect there will be this £935,000 extra this year.  In a full year, the figure estimated is £1,795,000 extra.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a word on this.  From 1938 up to the present, the duty increase on spirits has been 88.9 per cent., while the duty increase on beer has been 111 per cent. I want to suggest to the Minister that the consumers of spirits here belong to a class than can afford to pay.  They will not feel the extra amount put on them as much as the ordinary working man who consumes beer.  I think this tax should have been put the other way round, and that there should be a greater percentage increase on spirits than on the ordinary pint of stout.  I suggest to the Minister that, even now, he ought to increase the duty on spirits and reduce the duty on beer.</P>

      <P>We are, Sir, and I sincerely hope that we shall hear Deputy Corry's voice equally loudly and at greater length when it comes to beer as we have heard him here now on spirits.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry intervened on the question of the tax on spirits and, as part of his intervention, I would be glad if he would put it into some kind of better perspective than he has put it at the moment, or that his Minister has put it.  For what reason has the tax on spirits been increased by 88 per cent. in the last few years?  That is the question I would like to ask the Minister and Deputy Corry to answer.  There would seem to me to be no answer to it unless the Minister and Deputy Corry take up the attitude that the condition of this country has come to such a pass that it is only the better classes who can afford to have or who ought to have a &ldquo;sip&rdquo; of whiskey.  I do not think he will find many of his constituents who will entirely agree with him on that.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with him.  I am opposed to this increase in the tax on whiskey.  I think it is an outrage that in the last few years it should have been found necessary to increase the tax on spirits to such an extent, particularly in our present circumstances when the Government has made no attempt whatsoever to reduce the general cost of government.  It is a deplorable step that the Government in a lazy kind of way should now turn to the glass of whiskey in order to get another £935,000&mdash;not in a year but in five months out of this year.  We would, I think, like to hear a little more from Deputy Corry on that.</P>

      <P>Generally speaking, with regard to these new impositions upon the people, we have yet to hear a case made on the Government Front Bench as to why the gigantic taxation levied off the country at the present moment has got to be still further increased, whether by a tax on property, or on spirits, or an increase in income-tax, or the tax on beer, or the tax on motor cars.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that I have not yet heard any case made why there should be an increase levied on any commodity.  It has become popular now to regard whiskey as the beverage of the affluent, just as heretofore champagne was regarded as the beverage of the well-to-do.  The crushing weight of taxation imposed on spirits in Budget after Budget has put or is putting spirits completely out of the reach of the person of moderate means.  I think every decent person in the country deplores intemperance.  I think the members of the licensed trade as a community and as an organised body deplore intemperance more than any other section because it interferes with their business and the amenities of their premises, etc.  I heard predecessors of the Minister, speaking from that same bench, when they were greater advocates for an even higher tax on whiskey, pointing out that taxing spirits too highly in any country had very dangerous repercussions and that the dearer you made spirits the more you provoked the tendency to illicit distilling and the more you drove people towards drinks such as mountain-made poteen, &ldquo;Red Biddy &rdquo; and all such beverages as drive human beings into frenzied lunatic animals.</P>
      <P>The present degree of intemperance in this country, because of the price of alcohol, is due in large measure to the amount of poisonous substances sold to ignorant people, particularly in large congregations such as immense fairs and that kind of gathering.  The direct result of imposing too heavy a tax on alcoholic beverages which tends to put them out of the financial reach of the many is to encourage poisonous, medicated, dangerous substitutes. That has been discovered in more countries than this.  The deplorable scenes that have taken place in some parts of the country are entirely due to the imbibing of poisonous substitutes which immediately and dangerously affect the human brain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should have some consistency in Government policy.  We had that announced on one occasion, and then a successor comes along and brushes everything aside and says: &ldquo;In half a <Col N="1757" /> year, or less, I am going to take an extra million pounds off whiskey&mdash;no matter what the result may be...&rdquo; I am arguing this point very, very seriously.  Illicit distilling and the sale of crude immature alcohol, with the medication of such things as methylated spirits, are the most abhorrent practices that could grow up in any civilised country.  That is the natural result when you put a gigantic tax on beverages produced under State control and of known alcoholic strength so that the person indulging knows the exact strength and, if he is a wise man, knows his own measure. That is the result when you replace those by dangerous so-called alcoholic refreshments a small thimbleful of which may turn a man into a raging lunatic.  Any legislation that brings about that state of affairs should be sternly opposed.</P>
    <P>A modern idea seems to have grown up, because of the crushing weight of taxation, that whiskey or spirits is not a proper drink for the poorer person. That is a most undemocratic viewpoint. The elderly poor person is entitled to a small stimulant just as much as the wealthy person.  The small occasional stimulant for the poor person ought never to be regarded as a luxury or as an evil.  When the situation arises where the small stimulant becomes prohibited, because of price, and where a bulky commodity replaces it in order to carry as much stimulant, that is highly dangerous.</P>
    <P>It is true, as Deputy Corry has said, that porter and stout have become the drink of the poor and that spirits have become the drink of the wealthy.  That has come about because of the repeated impositions.  But we are now reaching a point where even stout and porter can no longer be regarded as the drink of the poor.  They can only be bought to-day by the comparatively comfortable, well-to-do people.  Once a pint breaks into the second shilling I do not think it can be any longer regarded as the beverage of the poor.  The result will be that we shall drive them more and more in the direction of these highly dangerous, inflammable, unhealthy, medicated substitutes.</P>

      <P>I do not know where <Col N="1758" /> Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy O'Higgins spend their time.  Deputy Mulcahy was down in Tipperary in the recent byelection. If he has any interest in his constituency he ought to know what the condition of the harvest is there this year.  He ought to know that where last year you had eight barrels to the acre there are only four barrels this. year, and that if bread is to be found for the people of this country from now until next October some 200,000 tons of wheat, which was grown in this country last year, will have to be bought abroad this year at whatever price it costs.  Deputy Mulcahy talks about the price of Government.  Deputy Mulcahy, at a general election a few years ago, was endeavouring to drive up the cost of Government by paying the civil servants more.  That, however, has. nothing to do with the matter under discussion at the moment.  I have given the real reason why this money must be found.</P>

In this city you can get what is called &ldquo;A Cat's Whisker&rdquo; for 3/9.  The buyers of these do not care whether there is a bob extra put on to them or not.  They are a class which can bear it.  If my figures are correct, I am suggesting to the Minister that it is unfair that the duty on spirits should be increased only by 88 per cent., while the duty on beer is increased by 111 per cent.  My plea is not for the civil servant with £10 per week; it is for the 50/- a week man whose only pleasure is his plug of tobacco and his pint on a Sunday. That is all he can afford.</P>

He was very careful not to suggest that something extra should be got from the men who can afford it and less taken from those who cannot afford it.  That is why I am suggesting to the Minister that, even at this late stage, he would be well advised to increase the duty on spirits and reduce the duty on beer accordingly.  That is the plea I make.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to follow Deputy Corry into the world of percentages and perhaps we might get away from that for a moment.  At present the price of a glass of whiskey is 2/6 and, if Section 6 is passed, 1/7½ of that will be taxation.  I should like to know from Deputy Corry how much he thinks that 1/7½ should be increased <Col N="1760" /> in terms of pence, forgetting about percentages. I should also like to know in what way the question of bread comes into it.  If I understand Deputy Corry, he suggests that the proceeds of this tax will be sent abroad for the purchase of wheat or flour.  That develops a new line as to what this tax is for and I should like to have a little more explanation of it.  If 1/7½ of the 2/6 for a glass of whiskey at present represents tax, I should like to know what the Minister and Deputy Corry think it should be.  There should be also further enlightenment as to how this additional taxation will will be used to bring an increased supply of wheat and flour into the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section, I would urge on the Minister the advisability, even if it is necessary to impose these heavy new duties, to make a discrimination between one kind of tobacco and another.  There may be a case made for the tax on tobacco which is slightly different from the case made in respect of the other taxes in so far as tobacco is mainly bought in dollar countries.  The necessity for economy on such type of expenditure is, I think, obvious and apparent to all, but the incidence of these heavy taxes on the solid plug tobaccos, the type of tobacco enjoyed by the very poorest members of the community, makes it in my opinion, nothing short of a brutal tax. There is no use in the Minister or anybody else saying that tobacco is a luxury, that if anybody wants to avoid or evade the tax, he can give up smoking.  To the poorer classes, tobacco is not a luxury.  It is the only little form of comfort they have in their lives.  The imposition of this tax on plug tobaccos is, I think, unjustifiable. We have not reached such a desperate plight in the affairs of this country that the only source we can turn to for revenue, is that little comfort in the lives of the poorest members of the community.</P>
      <P>I remember the Minister leading a frenzied army up and down this country, he was so shocked and outraged at the very idea, in really terrible times when the State might be described as being on the verge of bankruptcy, of any Government in any set of circumstances, taking a shilling a week from old age pensioners.  In this section and in the next section at least one shilling a week is being stolen out of the trousers pockets or the purses of the average old age pensioners.</P>
      <P>I think one of the most offensive remarks that ever was directed at that unfortunate class, whose only little bit of comfort is the pipe, was the Minister's glib remark that if they do not like the tax they can give up smoking.  There are a number of things that the Minister likes and it would not be just quite fair to him for Parliament to say: &ldquo;Let him give them up.&rdquo;  Parliament gave the Minister a very substantial increase so that he could continue to enjoy the things he likes.  I am making a distinction between cigarette tobacco and expensive blends and mixtures and the hard plug tobacco.  I think there is a reasonable and humane case for exempting the hard plug tobacco which is smoked by the poorest people in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like Deputy O'Higgins to know that I did not say that people who do not want to pay this tax should give up smoking.  What I said was that if they did not want to pay any more tax, that if they wanted to spend the same amount of money on tobacco in the week, they could smoke five pipes or five cigarettes instead of six.  I do not want to go into the whole Second Reading debate on this or any <Col N="1763" /> other section of the Finance Bill.  We discussed the necessity for this taxation on the Financial Resolutions and again on the Second Reading of this Bill.  It was not introduced for fun or to impose a hardship on the smoker or on the person who takes a drink of whiskey or anything else, but because of the necessity to gather money in order to reduce the price of certain essentials such as bread, sugar and tea. That is the reason why this extra taxation was put on tobacco, including hard plug.  Already we are giving a rebate of 2d. an ounce on hard plug.</P>

      <P>The imposition of this tax is, in my opinion, and in the opinion of the Party to which I belong, an outrage on the poorer sections of the community.  Those who are inflicting this imposition on the poor seem to have no sympathy and to be out of touch with that particular section of the people.  They do not seem to realise the pleasure derived by the older sections of the community from their pipes.  In my experience the one pleasure the working man has is his pipe or his pint of porter.  The poorer sections have no holidays&mdash;there are no seaside resorts for them.  Their only pleasure is the pipe or an odd drink; and when they are working in the fields or on the roads they enjoy a smoke. The pipe is the one and only pleasure of the poor.</P>
      <P>I think it shows a great lack of understanding of the requirements of those people to impose a tax of this sort upon them.  In my early days plug tobacco sold at the rate of 6½d. for two ounces and now it costs 3/11.  That price is beyond the reach of the poorer sections.  Some time ago there was a little increase given to old age pensioners&mdash;2/6 a head.  That is now taken away from them.  It is definitely the most iniquitous imposition ever put forward in this House and it is most unpopular.  I ask the Government to withdraw it and to find the money in some other way.</P>

      <P>The Minister told us that if the people will take only five pipes or five whiffs instead of six they can defeat the tax.  He knows that that <Col N="1764" /> will not happen.  He budgets on the certainty that it will not happen.  If it happened he would not get his revenue.  He hopes to get £1,960,000 in the half year.  I do not think that the enormity of this tax has been fully realised.  It will mean £4,000,000 in the full year.</P>
      <P>From speeches I listened to from different Ministers for Finance I was given to understand that what is called the tobacco tax is the most buoyant of the lot and it brings in the most revenue.  On top of the amount of money that smokers ordinarily give to the revenue we are now adding nearly £4,000,000 in a full year.  Deputy Halliden's phrase is very mild.  He said that it is an iniquitous tax.</P>
      <P>The Minister must know that human effort is called forth in the way in which it is required in the matter of production not merely by the wage a man gets to supply himself and his family with necessaries, but by giving certain incentives to him to work.  The incentives the poor have are: (1) drink, (2) smoking, and (3) something in the nature of entertainment. Some people go to play football matches and some go to see them. At higher levels people go to play or see other games.  People who have not that outdoor viewpoint go to enjoy entertainment such as is provided by the cinema and other types of entertainment in the evening.</P>
      <P>All the incentives there are tending towards greater production, all the incentives that help people to put forward greater human effort in order to get a greater store of goods, which is a necessity in this country at the moment, are being clamped down upon by the Minister.</P>
      <P>When I came into the House Deputy Corry was remarking that nobody had shown any way in which this money can be saved.  I want to show one way. The Minister's excuse for this tax is that the Government want to reduce the price of bread, butter and tea and the only way out is to tax semi-necessaries&mdash;their object is not to relieve taxation, but to prevent the price of certain commodities rising to too high a point.  Hence we get these taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1765" /> We have on other occasions pointed out one way of saving millions.  The Army used to be run at £1? millions.  It was graded down to £1,160,000, but the average was about £1? millions and it is now £4,500,000.  There are £3,000,000 which could be saved by bringing the Army down to a proper level and bringing down Army charges to a level which the State can bear.  At the time when we were imposing £1? millions on the State for the Army, we were told that we only required the Army because of the discontent in the country caused by the fact that our gallant Republicans were being kept from attaining their objectives, and that when the Fianna Fáil Party came into power those objectives would be obtained and there would be no need for such an Army.  The Republicans have obtained power but the discontent is apparently now such that it is necessary to spend £4,500,000 on the Army while £1? millions was sufficient for us.  By reducing the Army, the tax on beer, tobacco and entertainments could be completely done away with. If the Minister wants other suggestions we can give them to him on the Estimates, but that is the biggest charge and he should reconsider bringing down our defence forces and saving millions of money.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins started by saying that when the shilling was taken off the old age pensioners by the Cumann na nGael Government the Minister for Finance was in the front of the tempest howling it down, Does Deputy O'Higgins realise what that meant to the old age pensioner in comparison with what is now being done?  At that particular time when an old age pensioner who was living entirely on the 10/- a week lost that 1/- he lost more than he would now lose by the tax on tobacco.</P>

The Opposition seems to forget when Deputy McGilligan is talking about the cost of the Army, the high grant necessary to keep it up. Deputy McGilligan compares the cost of the army with the £1? millions which it formerly cost, but does he consider what each member of the Army gets by way of pay as compared with when the cost of the Army was £1? millions?  He will find that the average cost per head of the soldiers, the average cost of the officers, the cost of materials and the food they eat is to-day far higher than at the time which Deputy O'Higgins described as a period of such dire distress that only for the shilling taken off the old age pensioners the country would have fallen into ruin.</P>

      <P>No, but that suggestion was made by the Minister for Finance to-day, that the pipe smoker could be satisfied with five pipes of tobacco instead of six and the cigarette smoker with five cigarettes instead of six.  I want to reply to that point and to say that it is an insult to the ordinary workingman to suggest that way out of his difficulties.  Other ways have been given to the better-paid sections of the community.  They have been allowed to increase their incomes to meet these increases in taxation.</P>
      <P>The Minister himself has secured an increase in order to meet that increased taxation, but the man most severely hit by these increased taxes, the man who is hit even more severely than the old age pensioner, is the ordinary manual worker, the man who has to be out early in the cold of the morning to do manual work in the fields, on the roads or in the factory.  To suggest that that man can cut down his allowance of tobacco is a sheer insult to the intelligence of this House.</P>
      <P>The struggle for existence has been so keen for a number of years that the workingman, the small farmer, and the whole range of people with small incomes, have been cutting their tobacco allowance to the barest minimum.  If it were possible for them to economise still further, they would be doing so, but the Minister knows that it is impossible for them to economise, because he is budgeting to get a very considerable amount of revenue from this duty.  He is assuming that the people will smoke the same quantity as heretofore.  I should like to ask the Minister&mdash;many people are asking the question and it might be as well if he replied to it here and now&mdash;if the British Government, in the course of their discussions with him, asked him to impose these increased taxes.  It may be that they did not.  It may be merely a stupid idea of his own, but it would be no harm to have that question answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago, we had the Taoiseach here expressing his concern about the difficulties of expanding production.  This certainly will not help to induce the worker to put his best into the work of production.  The <Col N="1771" /> Taoiseach talked about incentives.  The worker to give of his best must be contented and must have incentives to work hard and he is surely entitled to something more than the bare necessaries of life.  The luxuries he has been able to provide for himself are very limited and one of the luxuries which he values very highly is his smoke. Notwithstanding the Taoiseach's concern for incentives to produce and to work harder, here we have something which is going to have a depressing effect, so far as the worker's output is concerned.  The Minister has shown very clearly that, notwithstanding his contention that a man need not smoke any greater quantity, that he can have five smokes where he formerly had six, he anticipates that that will not happen, judging by his estimate of what he will get from this increased impost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does this mean to the consumer? What is the total amount taken in respect of tobacco?  In the Budget Statement of this year, we were told that last year the Minister had collected £11,500,000 from tobacco.  In that Budget, he increased the imposition on tobacco by £3,000,000, making the amount £14,500,000, and now, for five months, he is imposing an increase which represents practically £2,000,000.  That figure may be more than doubled for the 12 months, which means a total of £18,500,000 which the people who enjoy a smoke have to pay, on the assumption made by the Minister that consumption will not fall. What does that mean per individual? It means, on the basis of 80 per cent. of the men and 60 per cent. of the women being smokers, approximately 1,250,000 consumers.  It is quite simple to calculate the average tax paid on tobacco per individual.  It means on average that they pay in taxation alone for tobacco something over £15 per head.  That is on average&mdash;taking the light and heavy smoker.  If a man is a more than moderate smoker, he pays at least £20, and possibly £25, in tax.  Then, we wonder why there is difficulty in inducing the worker to work harder and be contented with his lot.  The Minister would have to agree, as would the Government, that, having regard to the <Col N="1772" /> very few luxuries we have in this country, this is, if we call it a luxury at all, an essential luxury.  No matter where we found the money, an effort should have been made to find it elsewhere. If the worker cannot provide himself here with the few luxuries which he regards as essential to the enjoyment of life, then he will go elsewhere. If he cannot get his smokes here, he will growl and grumble and he will not give of his best.  It is obvious that the Minister has not taken into account those aspects of the matter.  I think that the Minister has not at any time been honest about this matter.  It is an effort to cut down imports because we overlooked the fact that our export trade was a very valuable asset.  We have an adverse trade balance of about £70,000,000 now.  One of the things that have resulted from the London talks is that we must cut down our imports.  This is an effort to cut down our imports and not an effort to help the housewife.  That is the situation to which Fianna Fáil policy has brought this country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Briscoe has challenged my figure in respect of the Army.  Take 1935-6, when the Army was not running at £1? millions, which I said was the average, but at £1,500,000.  The pay of officers, noncommissioned officers, cadets and men was £500,000.  I am doubling that. That is £1,000,000.  I put that extra £500,000 to the £1,500,000.  The cost to the State was £2,000,000.  The personnel are not getting double the 1935-6 rates.  The cost of the human personnel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That figure is still lower and they are not getting double the 1931 pay.  I took the cost when it was running at £1? millions, but take it at £1,500,000 Add £500,000 and that gives us £2,000,000.  The cost at present is about £4,500,000, so that there is £2,500,000 to be saved there without touching the pay of the personnel. There is a pocket of £2,500,000 in which the Minister can plunge his hand if he wants to get moneys to provide subsidies for bread and sugar and other things.  Deputy Davin is right.  The <Col N="1773" /> best the Minister can do with these foolish subsidies is to bring the cost-of-living figure back to what it was last May, when it reached the highest point it ever reached in this country.</P>
      <P>The old age pensioner has been dragged into this debate.  He is not in the foreground of the picture.  But he wants his human needs satisfied in a particular way.  The man I was talking about was the man who wants an incentive to work, who has not reached the age at which he would qualify for the old age pension.  But the old age pensioner does show this matter up in a strong light.  On the 1930-31 cost of living, the £ was worth internally 27/6.  Let us say 27/-.  Ten shillings were, accordingly, worth 13/6.  The old age pension recently amounted to 10/-. To that, 2/6 was added and a voucher was taken away, but we need not think of that at the moment.  That sum of 12/6, nominal, buys what 6/3 bought before the war, so that the old age pensioner is reduced from 13/6 to 6/3 on commodities in which tobacco is not included.</P>
      <P>The old age pensioner, as we all know, did get a smoke now and again out of what he could save from the 13/6 in the old days, or 6/3 nowadays.  How much can he save out of that sum for smoking now and how much more will he have to save to get a smoke at the new price? That is what we are up against.  I wish that in this debate we could go into the point raised by Deputy Briscoe now and which was raised previously&mdash;the control of our £.  It has been brought to his realisation that we do not control our own £.  Who is responsible for that&mdash;the Minister for Finance?</P>

I tried to urge on the Minister that he should take steps to control the £ and he refused to do so.  The result is that we are having not our own inflation, but British inflation and we cannot prevent it because the Government which Deputy Briscoe supports did not take action when occasion arose.</P>

      <P>The policy to which Deputy McGilligan has referred is old enough, as our policy, to be adopted with safety by the Government Party, which likes to adopt our policies about 15 or 20 years after they are promulgated.  The policy of economy of which Deputy McGilligan has been speaking is almost 20 years old.  When the 10th Assembly of the League of Nations met in Geneva, in September, 1929, Deputy McGilligan dealt with this point.  In the report made to the Oireachtas by the Irish delegates to that Assembly, we find this short quotation from a speech by Deputy McGilligan before the General Assembly:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Five years ago we had, comparatively speaking, made a considerable decrease in the armaments of the Irish Free State and had reached a position of something approaching normality.  Since then, however, we have further reduced our annual expenditure on arms from about £2,800,000 to less than £1,500,000. When I mention that our expenditure on education now amounts to over £4,500,000 a year and to a single branch of social service, namely, provision for old age pensions, our State contribution is in the region of £3,000,000, it will help to place in true perspective the present provision of £1,500,000 for all purposes of national defence.  I have little doubt that, from the technical point of view, excellent arguments could have been advanced against these reductions but the feeling that influenced our decision was that money urgently required to develop agricultural <Col N="1775" /> and other industries should not be squandered on arms.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The moneys which the Minister is now proposing to take from the people are fairly urgently required to maintain what was their old standard of living. This money is urgently required by people who are in difficult circumstances and have great problems to face.  We are squandering money on arms at a time when nobody has attempted to solve the technical problem that arises with regard to arms.</P>
    <P>We want an Army of a particular size.  The country is not providing it. More than that, we are told by the Government&mdash;and we do not blame them&mdash;that they do not know how to equip their Army because the problem involved in equipping armies to meet <Col N="1776" /> conditions of warfare in the future has hardly been examined at all.  The case for saving unnecessary expenditure on Army organisation and equipment is stronger to-day than it was 20 years ago.  The money is needed not only for development but to attempt to maintain the standard of living.  The Government have, in other cases, adopted, 18 years later, the policy systematically pursued by us.  This policy is 18 years old.  It is nearly old enough for the Minister and his colleagues to adopt it.  That is the suggestion which Deputy McGilligan makes to the Minister and which I support.  It is a grave blow to the people to be asked, in their smoking of five months, to pay another sum of £2,000,000 to the Exchequer, which is taxing them to an extent they were never taxed before.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 8 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a proposal to increase the tax on cinema-goers.  I do not know how this has affected the city cinemas so far, but I have been informed by cinema proprietors in more towns than one that the effect of this tax will be to close down the cinema industry in country places.  The signs appear to be there even at present and if the case made for this tax is similar to that made for others, namely, the necessity to collect money so as to use it in other directions, then the proposal contained herein is not likely to attain its objective.</P>
      <P>One of the great causes for complaint and unrest in this country is the topheavy condition into which we are getting, the fact that the capital is growing and the rural areas withering. We are developing into a kind of hydrocephalic monster with an immense head and a shrunken body.  There are different views as to the cause, but there seems to be common consent that one of the big contributory factors making for the flow of the population from the country to the capital is the dreariness of life in the country places as compared with the bright lights and the attractions of the capital.  Many attempts have been made to stem that rather pathetic trudge away from the country up to the city; various social organisations are attempting through different channels to make life more interesting and more attractive in the country.  One of the most useful, and certainly harmless, efforts in that direction is the rapid growth of picturehouses in the smaller towns. There has been a pronounced development in that way in recent years, and its immediate effect has been to make people more content with life in the country.</P>
      <P>I do not think any Deputy would suggest that these country cinema houses are making immense profits or that any of the proprietors are becoming extremely rich.  They are just able to carry on with reasonable profits and they have not got properly to their feet.  They have got only as far as their knees, when down on top of them comes this tax.  If my information is anything like correct, it will put them out of business, meaning a return to the gloom, the dreariness and the monotony of country life which was draining the country and overswelling the city.  I do not think the tax will meet its avowed object, namely, to bring in revenue.  If the Minister makes a check on figures even up to the present moment, he will find there is a drop in revenue instead of an increase, at all events from the provincial cinema, and I ask for reconsideration of that particular provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be as helpful as possible to the Minister in this particular matter and look at it objectively.  I see he intends that this increase is to be on cinemas, dog-racing and professional boxing, and the expectation he had was that, after he had operated his tax machine, he would <Col N="1779" /> get £150,000.  I presume that that is for a half year, so let us say £300,000 for a full year.  I want to answer the appeal which, I am sure, will come from the other side of the House: &ldquo;Where else can the money be got?&rdquo; Last week, we were told, to the astonishment and amazement of most Deputies, that we had purchased five &ldquo;Constellations&rdquo; for £1,250,000.</P>
      <P>We all know that that is a non-paying branch of a bankrupt service, but we are told this is to be for prestige.  Why should we not have said: &ldquo;We are a poor country just at the moment and we will have only four-fifths of that prestige we ordinarily would get, and will cut out one Constellation.&rdquo;  Then we could save £250,000.  Should not that be done, if we are really so hard up that, in order to bring the cost of living back to the May figure, which was very high, we have to give certain subsidies on certain commodities and then get the money back in these other ways, part of it being this entertainment tax? If we are so hard up, should we not say here that we will pull in a little bit of the prestige that in a more wealthy period we might afford?</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins has talked about the dreariness of country life and indicated that that has been allayed to some extent by the advent of the cinema.  One could hardly imagine a young man who wants to take his girl&mdash; at least, his best girl&mdash;to a theatre, bringing her out at night to look at the Constellation going by and saying that that is as good as any cinema, or at least is costing us as much.  I suggest that to drop one Constellation out of the five is not a terribly big sacrifice, and in that way we could have saved all the money required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish the Minister would divide this tax up.  I do not know how much out of the £150,000 is expected from cinema tax, how much from dog-racing and how much from boxing.  I am sure there are people in the House who will speak on behalf of those who go to the dogs.  I always regard that section with a certain amount of sympathy.  I know very well that they know that part of the money they pay goes to improve the breeding of the dogs, but I am sure that <Col N="1780" /> they are hopeful also that they are going to make a little bit of money.</P>
    <P>I do not know how much comfort the people who go to greyhound racing derive from the thought that by doing so they are going to improve the breeding of dogs, but we are assured that the aim of those who go to greyhound meetings is to improve the breeding. As far as professional boxers are concerned, this would be a damaging tax but for the fact that its effect in the coming year is going to be small.  There is not very much to be got from it this year, but in a full year the tax may have a depressing and damaging effect. I do not know whether the Minister is inclined to damage that particular form of amusement.  I gather from the newspapers that we have a certain national pride in what some of our boxers have been able to do both here and abroad.  The boxers are somewhat upheld by those who satiate themselves by sitting outside the ringside instead of going inside.</P>
    <P>This sum of £150,000 could be saved by docking the vote which deals with aviation and meteorological services. That vote has been very much increased.  We thought that it had stabilised itself in 1946 at £861,000, but this year it has been raised by £600,000, and that in a country that cannot afford to give a subsidy for bread and butter.  It can afford an additional sum of £600,000 for these services, and that figure does not include the Constellations. Drop one of the Constellations and you have the whole problem solved.</P>

      <P>To come back to the tax on cinemas, I consider that it will be the main item of income so far as this tax is concerned.  Deputy McGilligan <Col N="1782" /> did not deal with that very much.  It is well known to all of us that if the Minister were to accede to the request that this particular increase of tax should be withdrawn he would also have to ask the cinema proprietors to reduce the prices that they added on by way of extra profit when the last tax was put on.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not add on the last occasion just the tax fixed by the State.  They took up an excuse at that particular moment to increase prices generally.  If you talk to cinema proprietors&mdash;Deputy O'Higgins, I think, said he had spoken to some of them&mdash; they will tell you that the cost of cinema operations have gone up very considerably, almost 100 per cent., mainly due to increased cost of labour.  I suggest that we ought to regard these matters as frankly and as clearly as we see them.  I have noticed no falling off in the attendances at cinemas as a result of the previous tax or the increase in prices.  I see the people going there as before, and the queues are as large as ever.  In addition, I still hear of people looking for sites to build new cinemas in spite of the present exorbitant tax which they say would put the cinema business out of existence altogether.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in the city.  Down the country where the prices are in quite a different range from what they are here taxation is in a different range also.  It is quite obvious that if you examine the small town that has a limited attendance possibility to a cinema, the cinema there is not going to be as attractive as the cinema where there is a tremendous populattion of possible attendances and where they can give much more attractive films than in the small places.  There is no comparison between the country cinema and the city cinema, and it will be the city cinema that will bear practically all the brunt of this particular tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan talked about greyhound racing tracks.  I agree with <Col N="1783" /> him, as one who occasionally visits a greyhound racing track&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I mean is that, as one who visits racing tracks, I have found that it is not easy to make money when I back a dog.  I agree also that a great argument used in connection with commercially run greyhound racing tracks is that this additional tax is going to bring down attendances and that, consequently, they are not going to be able to increase the prize money to help dog owners to produce a better type of dog that has a sale value overseas.  I have heard that, but I say it will not affect it in any way.  I have made inquiries as to the position and I have been told that if 10/- were charged for entry those who frequent greyhound racing tracks regularly would still pay.  Look across the Channel.  Over there, a tremendous crowd of people frequent greyhound racing tracks as an entertainment to-day and the admission charge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The tax on professional boxing is held out as a terrible disaster which will overtake the Government for having dared imagine they were going to get one shilling return on professional boxing affairs on which there is going to be an additional tax.  Deputy McGilligan knows well that the reason this country was attractive for professional boxing affairs was the promoters of professional boxing found they could get a much better nett result because of the very low tax costs here in the running of these classes of entertainments.</P>

The boxing promoters, as a whole, found it would be attractive from the point of view of profit for them to run these affairs here.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the explanation. When Deputy McGilligan in that vein of humour makes all these suggestions I do not see how any case can be made in present circumstances.  We have to impose certain taxes now to help to <Col N="1785" /> subsidise the particular items we want to keep at a certain maximum level.  I do not see how anybody can argue that these increased taxes, under present circumstances, can be objected to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was universally accepted that the principle upon which taxation should be applied was that taxes should be applied to that section of the community best able to bear them.  It would seem that the Minister for Finance in imposing taxes on tobacco, stout, greyhound racing and pictures has sought to do the very opposite.  I may just take one instance &mdash;greyhound racing.  Greyhound racing is the poor man's sport in the country.</P>
      <P>The greyhound industry is a very important industry in the country.  It is an industry that brings about an export worth approximately £1,000,000 a year.  It is an industry that provides remuneration to the agricultural producer and the agricultural worker in the country.  It is an industry which provides a diffused profit throughout the country.  That industry is taxed. Just visualise the people who breed greyhounds and the people who attend greyhound meetings.  Visualise them as a mass of the people here.  You will agree that they are not the wealthier section of the community.  Turn to horse racing.  There is no tax on horse racing.  Not only is there no tax on horse racing but it is subsidised to a larger extent than the value of the tax collected on greyhounds.  Visualise the horse owners.  Visualise the people who attend the race meeting at the Curragh.  Visualise the horse breeders. Can you say that they are a poorer section of the community than those who attend greyhound meetings or those who breed greyhounds throughout the country?  If the principle I have referred to of taxing that section of the community best able to bear it were to be applied to those people it is quite obvious that they should be taxed before greyhound racing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of cinemas I would say that cinemas in the cities are no luxuries for the poor people.  It is their only escape from the sordidness of life in tenements and in overcrowded dwellings.  It is all very well for the Government and for the Minister who <Col N="1786" /> increased his own salary by £10 a week to impose an additional burden on those people.  I submit to the House that it is a burden the House should not sanction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not yet started to go to the dogs and I do not frequent boxing tournaments, but I do occasionally, when I have time, visit the cinema.  I am, therefore, particularly interested in this cinema tax, as it affects our rural areas.  The tax on admission to cinemas may not restrict to any great extent the audiences in the larger towns and cities, but when we come to consider the very small towns and villages, where cinemas have been established in recent years, we must realise that this tax may have the result of closing many of these cinemas.  There is no doubt whatever that the cinema proprietors in the small towns are finding it very difficult to keep those places of amusement open.  During the last ten or 12 years rather a large number of cinemas have been built in the various town and even in the villages.  That is true.  I think, however, that most of the people who have gone into that business have found that the profits are very small and that it is very difficult to secure the attendance which is necessary to make the business a paying proposition.  The Minister may say to me: &ldquo;Well, is it not all for the best?  Is it not better that these local cinemas should be closed down and that the rural population should turn to some other form of amusement and that they should try, if possible, to provide their own forms of amusement?&rdquo; I am all for encouraging our people, particularly our young people, to provide themselves with their own forms of entertainment, but you must remember that we are living in an age when people are not blind or stupid. Nowadays people in the remotest rural areas have a very good idea of how people live in the larger towns and cities.  If these people in the most remote rural areas are deprived of this amenity they will be more inclined to turn to the larger centres of population for this entertainment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In imposing this tax has the Minister <Col N="1787" /> taken into consideration the conditions prevailing in the small towns?  In the small towns the cinema has to struggle in order to keep going.  If it is forced out of existence through the imposition of this tax and if the rural poulation is deprived of the cinema it is inevitable that they will have an added sense of grievance and that they will feel themselves placed at a disadvantage as compared with the cities and larger towns. In the cities there is a stratum of society in a position to keep the cinemas going in spite of the very high tax.  In the country the high tax will have the effect of forcing the poor people to remain away and it may have the effect of closing down the cinema in the rural areas altogether.  I think that is one result which must follow from this increased taxation.  The city cinema will be strong enough to survive. The country cinema will be forced out of existence.  That is a serious consideration and it is one upon which the Minister ought to dwell.  We cannot afford to do anything at the moment which will have the effect of driving more people away from the rural areas. If we are going to survive as a nation we must have more production.  The bulk of that production must take place in the rural areas.  We must produce more turf, more coal, more farm produce and we must win more mineral resources from our soil.  In order to do that we must ensure that the bulk of our people will work whole-time on the land.  We will not do that by depriving the people in the rural areas of the one slender amusement that they have. I agree with the Deputy who said that we should encourage more communal entertainment in the rural areas&mdash; entertainment provided by the people themselves.  But we should do the same in regard to the cities and towns and we should in no circumstances place the rural population at a disadvantage as compared with the urban population; rather, I should say, we should not add to the existing disadvantages which the rural population endure as compared with their city brethren.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I make a serious proposal that we should turn our <Col N="1788" /> attention to the aviation and meteorological services if we want to get £150,000.  Does the Minister seriously say that it is not possible to make any serious reduction&mdash;in something that makes for the good of the population generally&mdash;in order to get £150,000 in the half-year or £300,000 in the whole year out of Vote 56?  Considering the fact of its having risen to the extraordinarily high level of £915,000 on what is acknowledged to be non-paying services, that it is amazing that they should have risen in the year we are speaking of now by another £3,000,000 or £4,000,000; and I cannot believe that there is any difficulty in the way of finding £300,000 out of the £600,000 now being spent on these services.  I have talked about the Constellations. Deputy Briscoe answers and says that they were bought some time ago.  I want to know when they were bought? Was the order placed for them any time this year?  I imagine it would have been.  That was at a time when the cost of living was rapidly increasing for us.  Surely someone should have thought that here was a place where we could at least reduce and where we could suffer some little reduction of our national pride and prestige in order to effect a saving.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan says that it is desirable to turn the people towards communal amusements&mdash;amusements provided by themselves&mdash;instead of having them frequenting the cinemas.  That is something which would be commended by everybody.  But we must take things as they are.  It does not do to make a sudden change.  People in the rural areas are accustomed to getting a little solace by an occasional visit to a picture house.  In the main they are the younger elements in the rural population who are enabled to go to the picture houses only on the pocket money which their parents can give them.  That pocket money grows less and less as times grow harder and harder.  As a result of this increased tax they will have to forfeit even that slight amusement in their arduous lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I always did hear that there was one step nearer and nearer to the servile state&mdash;that is, where the State take over everything, provide food and <Col N="1789" /> drink and housing and take away from men the responsibilities they have to face up to&mdash;their own personal problems&mdash;and that you got to the last point when the State began to look at even the pocket money of the people and eventually pared that down and gauged it to the lowest possible fraction.  Apparently we are approaching that state now.  We have got to the stage where the people are not given such wages as enable them to pay their way or rear their families as they should be reared.  We have instituted things called &ldquo;social&rdquo; services&mdash; pauperising gifts in the main.  Now, we come to the point where we say: &ldquo;We have cut wages to half what they used to be; we have given you little social services derived from taxation on other people; we are now at the point of examining how you enjoy yourselves and spend your leisure and we are going to impose some impediment on the free exercise of that leisure.&rdquo; Apparently that is the last point and we have reached it now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the increased tax on cinemas, I speak for the rural areas.  I urge the Minister to seriously consider the application of that tax.  The condition of the rural cinema is very different from that of the city cinema.  The income level of the people in the rural areas is much lower than that of the people living in the city areas or in the larger industrial towns.  It is vitally important to ensure that the people will remain in the rural areas.  Everything possible should be done to encourage them to stay.  Special consideration should be given to them in the matter of entertainment. They should be encouraged to remain by giving them at least an equitable measure of consideration. On the basis of income they are not able to pay what the people in the cities and larger towns can pay.  They have not the amenities of the cities and towns.  Must those people who, accepting the sound advice to remain on the land, be deprived of the facilities freely available in the cities and the town?  Is there not a direct incentive given to them there to leave the rural area?  Why should they be <Col N="1790" /> deprived of the simple pleasure of a weekly visit to the cinema?  The serious effect of that deprivation will be felt just as it is being felt at the moment by the publicans because of the increased cost of whiskey and beer. We have seen the devastating effect of that.</P>
      <P>I urge on the Minister that he should reconsider this plan of his and work it out upon a more equitable basis which will be just and applicable to the income of all parties.  If he does it on that basis&mdash;and only on that basis is he justified in imposing the taxation &mdash;he will exempt from this increase in tax the picture houses in the rural districts and small towns.  Otherwise, he will be inflicting a further injustice upon the people who are unfortunate enough, under present conditions, to have to reside in those districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister claimed that this tax on entertainments will bring him in about £150,000 in the half-year. I am not suggesting that the entire tax is unjustifiable, but I am pleading that there ought to be some relief for the rural places of amusement. I do not know how much money that would cost.  Whatever it would cost, the Minister may ask me: where is the money to come from?  I should like to offer my suggestion and it is this.  We provide a considerable amount of money in the Estimates for entertainment. We make a generous provision for entertainment at the Presidential palace.  That is one direction in which we could secure some economy to meet the reduction in taxation which I suggest.  The money provided for entertainment at the Presidential palace is for the purpose of entertaining distinguished visitors.  When we realise how distinguished some of these visitors are we begin to ask ourselves: are we justified in spending this money and would it not be better, instead of spending this money, if we were to give some relief to the amusements and entertainments of the poorer sections of the community?  Again, we are spending considerable sums of money on the Institute for Advanced Studies. That is another form of entertainment which the Minister and the Government <Col N="1791" /> claim ought to be promoted.  It is a form of entertainment upon which we could have a little reduction.  The School of Cosmic Physics is supposed to tell us all about the weather.  But, notwithstanding the fact that we have voted large sums of money for that school, the Taoiseach could not tell us to-day whether the weather is going to be fine or stormy for the general election.</P>

I should like to make a plea that that has gone on long enough.  We all deplore the flight from the land and people leaving their own areas.  If the people who live in the rural areas ever read the debates that take place here and read the speeches of Deputy Coburn and other Deputies about the sordid conditions that exist in the rural districts, the wonder is that anyone is left in rural Ireland.  That goes on here year in and year out and I want to protest against it.  There are no people living their lives so fully as the people in the rural areas.  After travelling up and down to the city for 20 years I say that the people do not live a full life in the city.</P>

One would think that there was never any tax on cinemas, that there was no tax on dog-racing, that there was no tax on stout or tobacco until this Budget was introduced; that this was the first time we had a tax on these things.  In the last financial year before this one the people of this country voluntarily spent £17,000,000 or £18,000,000 on drink and tobacco alone.  There was no pressure by the Government or by any of the forces of the State to compel them to pay these taxes.  They would have paid far more if more drink had been available.  Deputy McGilligan does not deny that, I am sure.</P>

In fact I think there has been a tax on dog-racing since it started.  That tax is being increased now.  We are told that it is the poor who attend dog-racing and that the rich and the millionaires all attend horse-racing. We are told that it is the poor who attend the cinemas, the poor who drink, the poor who smoke tobacco.  We have been listening to that now for two or three weeks in this House.</P>

      <P>One would think that no one else was being taxed and that only these sections of the community will pay the increased taxes.  The total increase sought is very small as compared with the amount voluntarily paid by the people in previous years. The extra taxes on beer, tobacco, cinemas and dog-racing are all taxes that will be paid voluntarily by those who do pay them.  They need not be paid.  There is no compulsion on anyone to pay a halfpenny.  They are voluntary taxes and they will have no effect whatever on the cost of living of the citizens.  They would have no effect whatever if these people did not volunteer to pay them.  They volunteered to pay almost £20,000,000 last year on drink and tobacco.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people have shown by that fact that they have had this money over and above the amount required to meet demands for the ordinary necessaries of life.  The Minister proposes to collect, if the people volunteer to spend it, and only then, a certain sum under this Budget and when he receives that money, he proposes to utilise it to reduce the cost of living.  I think it is a sound and a good Budget, notwithstanding the fact that every section of the Opposition have tried to misrepresent it in every possible way they could.  They have done that for sound political reasons, from their point of view, and for that purpose only.  In their hearts and souls they know quite well that it is a sound Budget and that it was absolutely necessary in order to halt inflation.  Deputy McGilligan <Col N="1794" /> knows that, but he can make fine play with it.  He can get considerable amusement for ten or 15 minutes of an evening by doing that.  However, I think it is a Budget which can be justified and which we can stand over. The Opposition is welcome to all the capital they can make out of it.  It represents only a brief episode in the life of a nation, but the Minister's proposals are nationally and financially sound.  They are proposals that every sound and sensible man will welcome and justify in the country.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy MacBride a short time ago speak of greyhound racing as the poor man's <Col N="1795" /> sport, I wondered whether he was ever at a greyhound racing meeting.  I run dogs on the Cork and Dublin tracks and I have some experience of this sport. I do not believe that people running dogs at these meetings will object to paying this tax.  I often wonder how it is that people trying to have a bet on their own dogs are not knocked down in the rush when attempting to get to a bookmaker, seeing the big number of people who are anxious to put on &ldquo;tenners&rdquo;, £50 and even up to £100 sometimes.  It is surprising how poor people could have all this money.  I can assure you from my experience that on some occasions you could not get near a bookmaker unless you were a fighting man.  I should like to see some figures showing the turnover of these bookmakers on a night at one of the Dublin or Cork tracks.</P>
      <P>Most of the people who attend dog racing are regular patrons of the game. They pay from 3/- to 5/- admission on each of three nights a week&mdash;perhaps in Dublin on six nights a week&mdash;and yet Deputy MacBride suggests that it is the poor man's sport.  If a man is investing that amount every night in the week on admission fees, merely to get in the gate, I am sure the amount he invests in bets reaches a figure that would frighten some people.  Some of the people attending dog racing tracks undoubtedly have rather small salaries but the amount which they invest in bets is rather surprising.  I do not believe, speaking from my own experience, that the people running dogs at these meetings would object to the payment of this tax.  I remember shortly after the Government came into office when a tax of this character was proposed the Cork Coursing Club discussed the matter and they were quite willing if necessary to pay the tax.  They were quite willing to bear that tax in the interest of the nation.</P>

      <P>That is tantamount to a suggestion that the tax might be doubled and the members of the Cork Coursing Club would still cheerfully pay it.  I wonder would the Deputy stand before his constituents in Cork and say that he was responsible for such a suggestion, that the Government <Col N="1796" /> could get this £150,000 from the Cork Coursing Club&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>You may get some part of the people going to the dogs on particular occasions who attend horse races during the day, but the people who can afford to take a day off for a horse race meeting are certainly not the people in the main who go to the dogs.  I do not believe there is anybody listening who will seriously question that statement.  When the argument is put up that people cannot afford to pay these taxes, Deputy Allen puts the grand construction on that, that they have volunteered to pay in the past.  I expect we shall hear one of these days, now that Deputy McGrath has broken the ice, that a whole lot of publicans, cinema proprietors and people who run greyhound racing tracks, have come to the Government and have asked them for permission to pay these taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Allen says that they are voluntary payments because a certain sum has been paid in the past.  Does the Deputy not take the view that that <Col N="1797" /> might be an indication that the people who pay these taxes, regard these pursuits as something essential to their lives, something that is definitely not a luxury?  There are some people who seem to be tending towards the belief that we should have such a puritanical spirit in the country as to be able to screw every penny out of those who desire to enjoy themselves now and again.  Deputy Allen thinks that a man is something approaching a depraved type if he feels now and again that he wants a drink or a smoke or to go to a cinema at night or to visit a dog track occasionally.  Have we got to the point that that is to be regarded as something abnormal?  Surely that is the point you get to when you cut in on people's amusements, particularly when the amusements are not of an extravagant type and are certainly not of a depraved type, in the effect they have on the people who enjoy them.  It is very definitely a bad thing to get to the point of depriving people of entertainment which aids them to live, which aids them at least to better living and may in the end have the subsidiary result of making them work harder.</P>
    <P>Anyone reading in the papers what is happening in England will realise that one of the points of attack is whether or not certain taxes have not been responsible for the low productivity of the men at work.  Are we setting our feet upon that track without paying attention to what is happening on the other side?  Notwithstanding the patriotism of the Cork Coursing Club and the volunteers who have subscribed so much through liquor and tobacco, how many peope would offer any casually-chosen 100,000 of our population their choice between a tax on cinema prices and cutting one Lockheed Constellation out of five?  I think the vote would definitely be in favour of cutting out the Lockheed Constellation, and by having four Lockheeds instead of five we could save the money that is required here.</P>

      <P>I would not have intervened in this debate were it not for Deputy Allen's speech.  Deputy Allen wanted to paint conditions in the country districts as something more jovial than they really are.  I noticed that <Col N="1798" /> Deputy Allen was not in his usual good form when he was speaking to-night.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Allen when he speaks here usually has a smile, and he draws laughter from other Deputies. To-night he was a most serious man; his heart seemed to be in his boots.  He tried, with an effort, to get us to believe that the people in the country are falling over themselves to co-operate with the Minister in his new taxes. When we were discussing the tobacco tax it occurred to me that there is no smoke without a fire.  If there is not a fire there is a certain amount of heat in the country with regard to these taxes.  I think that most Deputies over there, when they go on the election platforms, will find that the heat is not confined altogether to the smokers.</P>
      <P>I wonder under what conditions Deputy Allen would like us to live in the country.  There is great talk about the flight from the land, about the numbers who have gone to the cities, and the hundreds of thousands who have gone across the Channel.  I should like to see some attempt made to bring them back.  Is there any indication that the Minister for Finance and the Deputies behind him&mdash;even Deputy Allen&mdash;have any desire to induce some of our people who have, unfortunately, left this country, to return?  Any person in the country can tell Deputy Allen what is happening there at the moment.  He can tell him that the pint has gone to 1/1, that one has to break into the third shilling in order to get a second pint; he can be told that two ounces of tobacco cost nearly 4/-, and that it will cost him a few extra pennies to get to the cinema.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances, if he is living in Dublin, will he be induced to go back to the country?  Yet, Deputy Allen suggests that the people in the country are falling over themselves to pay the taxes that are being imposed under this Bill.  So far as I know country conditions, they were never in a more pitiable state.  Two or three workers after a laborious day at threshing, or other work, might like to go to the local pub to have a drink or two, <Col N="1799" /> to chat as in the old days and yet not get drunk.  You will see very few drunken men in the country now, I am glad to say.  Country men might like to chat about affairs of State and the glorious Government we have.  An odd man might shout &ldquo;Up Dev&rdquo; if he drank too much&mdash;and that would be very seldom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>How many bottles would they get?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>You do not hear many shouting &ldquo;Up Dev&rdquo; now.  They would not get enough bottles to put that much spirit in them, even if they had any desire to shout it.  Many a man might like to have a pint of stout.  That could not be regarded as an extravagance, because it is really a necessity after a hard day on the farm.  Surely, there must be some little amusement for them?  Deputy Allen apparently resents that they should have some little relaxation.  Nowadays they cannot afford to have much.  If a number of them have a few pence left they cannot have a game of pitch and toss, because the police will get them for breaking the law.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen could have painted a grand picture if he wanted to.  The real picture is that very few people in the country can afford a second bottle of stout, and Deputy Allen knows that as well as I do.  He is a lucky man who can have a couple of pints in the week, whereas in the old days he could have one every night.  Deputy Allen knows that the Minister was exaggerating when he said: &ldquo;We will only reduce the smoke to five-sixths of what it was.&rdquo;  I do not agree with that.  I do not see why a countryman's luxury should be reduced, even by one-fifth. Deputy Corry suggested that in no circumstances should a countryman be allowed a glass of whiskey.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The main entertainment we had to-night was Deputy Corry's suggestion that a countryman was not entitled to any of these <Col N="1800" /> luxuries and that they should be confined to the very rich.  I think when it comes to speaking out of order I am less culpable than many other Deputies. I resent the declaration that these taxes do not affect the ordinary residents in the country, and particularly the poorer people.  I do not think that anybody of any politics will back up the statement by Deputy Allen a few moments ago that the taxes imposed in this Budget or any Budget were voluntarily paid by the people.  Well now, I will leave it to the sense of the House.  People do not go to gaol to evade them, but if he tells me that the taxes are voluntarily paid, with goodwill, then it is useless to argue in this House.</P>
      <P>These taxes fall more heavily on the people in the country districts than anywhere else, because they have less surplus wealth.  Something is needed to make country life more attractive and to bring back the numerous people, men and women, who have left it, instead of putting every obstacle before any attempt they might make to come back.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to my feet to say something about Dublin in regard to the entertainment tax. Some Deputies have spoken as if the rural areas were the only, or the chief, places affected by the entertainment tax.  Deputy McGilligan spoke of the sordid conditions which may obtain in the country.  He did not, of course, say that the whole country was sordid. Deputy Allen said that none of the country was sordid and took it as a personal insult to rural life in general. Of course, it was not intended as such. I say this to the Deputies: sordid conditions exist in the city.  We have in Dublin, as everybody knows, sordid streets and slums, as well as beautiful streets and fine buildings.  The people who live in these sordid conditions in the city go very frequently to the cinema and the cinema plays a part in their lives which it does in no other sections of the community in the whole country.  At least, the rural people have God's fresh air and beautiful pleasant surroundings in which to go out on a Saturday afternoon or on a Sunday or in the evenings during the <Col N="1801" /> summer.  City people, however, have nothing to do but to walk round city streets or to pay money to go comparatively long distances out in the country.</P>
      <P>This is not the time or place to get into a discussion on what I might call the ethical and moral considerations of going to the cinema.  I am not advocating that all the population should rush to the cinema any more than I am advocating that they should rush to the dog races or the horse races, but there are many citizens who wish to go to the cinema perhaps once a week and I consider that they have a perfect right to go as often as they wish, as long as they are not spending too large a share of the family income on the cinema. We, of this House, have no evidence that many people are beggaring themselves by going too often to the cinema.  This tax is not being brought in, I take it, as a sort of puritanical measure to prevent people from going to the cinema, but merely in order to raise revenue.  The point is that in this City of Dublin it will have a very deadening and dulling effect on the life of persons who need the colour, the entertainment and, in many instances and increasing instances, the educational value which the cinema can supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speakers to-night have spoken about dog racing and horse racing, and I was sorry to see Deputy MacBride pitting one somewhat against the other.  I do not wish to follow that line.  I think that horse racing, under certain conditions, is very fine entertainment. People can get out into the fresh air and the country, but the same, however, cannot be said about dog racing.  We have a big greyhound industry in this country <Col N="1802" /> and I suppose that that greyhound industry needs a certain amount of care and attention.  Nobody wants to interfere with that industry, but certainly very many people who go to dog races, after paying their entrance fee, spend an inordinate amount of the family income putting money on dogs for the purpose of bets.  This is a matter on which I do not like to lay down the law or lecture people&mdash;it is their own business.  If it were a case of increasing the taxation on dog races or on the cinema, I would say that the tax should be taken off the cinema, where at least the whole family can go for entertainment and leave it&mdash;if you are faced with those alternatives&mdash;on dog racing where you may have people spending in bets more money than they can afford.</P>
    <P>In the main, this interference with the legitimate pleasure of the people, as evinced in the entertainment taxes which we are discussing, is a bad and unfair principle, and I would ask the Minister to take off the high taxation on the cinemas, bearing in mind that the people of Dublin, the capital city of this country, have just as great an interest, and perhaps greater, in the cinema than the inhabitants of the rural areas.</P>

It is £6,800 on dog racing and professional boxing and £143,200 on the cinemas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which imposes a tax of 3d. a pint on beer and stout, and the equivalent on the bottle.  The Minister's case for this Supplementary Budget is that the money is required.  He estimates that, under this section, he will receive in five months over £800,000.  In a further breath, he tells us that, if anybody wants to evade this tax, all he has to do is to reduce consumption.  The object of the tax will, of course, be defeated unless it brings in the revenue estimated.  Let us assume that the Minister is correct in his estimate and that he collects off those who drink beer or stout £800,000 in five months. Remember, the only case for this Supplementary Budget is that it will reduce the cost of living.  We reduce the cost of living by putting a new impost of nearly £1,000,000, over a period of five months, on, in the main, the poorest section of the community.  One of the two Government Deputies who participated in this debate, when we were dealing with the tax on whiskey, pointed out, in defence of that tax, that beer was the drink of the poor man and that spirits was the drink of the wealthy man.  Out of the mouth of that Government Deputy, we have the clear admission that his Minister, in order to reduce the cost of living, is placing a new imposition of nearly £1,000,000 in half a year on the backs <Col N="1805" /> of the poorest section of the community.</P>
      <P>There are two sets of persons involved in this impost.  There is the man who sells the beer and the person who consumes it.  There are, approximately 12,000 such traders in the State&mdash; unquestionably decent, upright members of the community, the hard core, the spearhead, the centre-piece of every progressive national and social movement.  Very few of them are wealthy.  The average is of the middleclass, shopkeeper type up and down the country.  They are rearing their families decently and doing their best, in a modest way, for them.  That section of the community is asked to bear a tax, under this section alone, of, approximately, £2,000,000 a year.  In addition, they will pay their increased income-tax and the various other charges.  We are told that that is being done in the best interests of the community and so as to reduce the cost of living.  The presumption is that the Minister will, for once, be correct, that his estimate will be somewhere near the mark, that he will get the revenue he estimates, that he will get that extra couple of million pounds, mainly out of the pockets of the workman&mdash;exclusively out of the pockets of the workman, according to the Government Deputy who spoke here this evening.  We are told that that is to reduce the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the case of the moderate drinker, the steady, hardworking man, the man who has one pint at dinner hour and, possibly, another at night. You are putting a direct imposition on that man of, approximately, 4/- a week.  In the same Budget, you are giving him a relief equivalent to less than 1d. per head per day of his household. It is all very well to be talking of official figures and of reducing the cost-of-living index figure.  If we are realists, if we are really facing up to the situation of the back-broken man and heart-broken woman struggling with a progressively soaring cost of living, we may be able to argue that, through this Supplementary Budget, we are reducing the cost-of-living index figure, on which beer and tobacco do not figure, but, in fact, we are increasing <Col N="1806" /> the actual cost of living in the majority of homes.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows very well that the recreation of the workman in Dublin and rural Ireland, the abstemious man, the regular worker, is this&mdash;to sit and smoke and chat over a pint at night.  To reduce the cost of living in the homestead of that abstemious man, who never drinks to excess, who is a good husband and good father, we are proposing to clap on this tax.  If the cost of living is reduced in that homestead, or in such homesteads, it will be only because the tax drives the person concerned to give up that little bit of comfort.  If it drives him to that extreme, then the tax will be a complete failure.  Instead of bringing in revenue, there will be a heavy loss of revenue.  Parliament and people are entitled to a direct, straight lead from Government, not a lead like the flight of a jack-snipe, zig-zagging, relying on one leg and one set of arguments one day and on another leg and an opposite set of arguments the next day.</P>
    <P>The argument is used that the people concerned can evade the tax by reducing their consumption of stout or porter.  If that device is adopted, then this proposal is a sham.  Not only will it not bring in extra money but it will bring about a slump in the revenue. From the human point of view, from the point of view of the welfare of the honest man, who is working with bone and muscle, I have no hesitation in describing this tax as an exceptionally brutal tax, as a tax which is nationally unjustifiable.  I should not subscribe to the arguments put forward earlier in this debate by Deputy Corry but I invite Deputy Corry and other Government Deputies who feel like him to stand up to their public statements by their vote.  Let everybody who considers this a just imposition on the people vote for it.</P>
    <P>I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported.  Committee to sit again to-morrow.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 13th November, 1947.</P>
