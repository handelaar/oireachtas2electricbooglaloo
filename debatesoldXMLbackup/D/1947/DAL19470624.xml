      <P>As I stated in reply to a question by Deputy Tadhg Ó Murchadha on the 13th November last, there were discussions between the Electricity Supply Board and the corresponding authority in the Six County area with regard to the drainage works required in connection with the hydroelectric development of the River Erne. Mutually satisfactory arrangements had been worked out between these two authorities when the Six County Government was advised, we understand, that additional statutory powers would be required to enable the undertakings involved to be entered into on their side.  The grant of these powers is the purpose of one of the clauses in the Bill at present before the British Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2" /> There has been no recent agreement or arrangement other than this arrangement about Lough Erne.</P>

The temporary discontinuance of railway services is governed by the provisions of Emergency Powers (Córas Iompair Éireann) (Reduction of Railway Services) Order, 1944.</P>

      <P>The airborne passenger traffic to Shannon Airport has added to the State's earnings of dollars, but it is not possible to furnish an estimate of the net amount of this income as there are substantial contra items of dollar expenditure on the provision of goods and services to the operating companies and in respect of expenditure of Irish travellers.  Other currencies involved apart from dollars are negligible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state, for each year since 1923: (a) the number of persons and corporations assessed for income-tax payment; (b) the number who paid income-tax; (c) the number assessed for surtax payment; (d) the number who paid surtax; (e) the rate at which income-tax was levied, and the revenue thereby received; and (f) the surtax rates, and the revenue from surtax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Income-tax statistics are not compiled in such a manner as would enable me to give an exact reply to parts (a) and (b) of the question.  To obtain the required figures going back to 1923 would involve an expenditure of time and labour which could not be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Besides, it is not clear what distinction the Deputy seeks to draw between the number of persons and corporations assessed to tax and the number who paid tax.  Normally, the figures would be the same.  It is estimated that for 1946-47 about 133,000 individuals and 5,000 corporations would be liable to pay income-tax; for 1947-48, the corresponding <Col N="6" /> estimates are 121,000 and 5,000, respectively.</P>
    <P>Regarding the remaining parts of the question, I would refer the Deputy to the annual reports of the Revenue Commissioners where information may be obtained concerning the number of persons chargeable to supertax or surtax for the years 1923-24 onwards, the rate at which income-tax was charged, the yield of income-tax and also the rates and yield of supertax or surtax for each such year.  The report for the year 1945-46 will be ready for issue shortly.</P>

      <P>There are one or two matters to which I would like to advert in the course of the examination of this Estimate.  One of these relates to a matter which has already been raised, namely, the question of our external relations.  On the previous occasion I raised in this House the question of regularising our External Relations Act.  It seems to me that our method of regulating our relations with other countries is most irregular under our present External Relations Act and under our whole constitutional procedure.  It has been asserted in this House that the President is the Head of the State.  I think the President ought to be the Head of the State, that he ought to be acknowledged by all citizens as the highest authority within the State, and that <Col N="23" /> so far as our relations with other nations are concerned, he ought to be the embodiment of the will of the people here, he ought to be the instrument through which we deal at the highest level with other countries.</P>
      <P>When we come to look at the External Relations Act and when we come to look at our constitutional position generally, we find that when we come to accredit representatives to other countries, the President, who ought to be the head of the State, takes a back seat and there is pushed into the arena of our public relations with other countries a gentleman known as the king.  We have acquired a king not because of any natural right on his part to be king&mdash;because of any sense of association with this country&mdash;but we have simply borrowed a king from another country.  We have said to the other country: &ldquo;Lend us this king of yours so that we may utilise him for the purpose of regulating our external affairs with another country&rdquo;.  That, to my mind, is the craziest scheme that has ever been invented.  At the time it was introduced, I was strongly opposed to it&mdash;strongly opposed to borrowing this king for the purpose of our external relations.  I thought then and I think now that it was a humiliating position in which to put ourselves.  Strange as it might seem, I have some personal sympathy for the king because of the position in which he has been placed by a situation of this kind.  One of these fine days we may well wake up to discover that the king will not do this job any longer for us.  Then we will be in a nice situation!  Then we will have to find somebody to do this job.  As kings are not now as numerous as they used to be, it may not be easy to get another king to do the job. Somebody else then will have to do it. I should like to know from the Taoiseach who he thinks is the best fitted in such circumstances to do the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the obvious function of the Head of the State here is to accredit our representatives to other countries and that he ought to be the accrediting authority.  The Head of every other <Col N="24" /> State does the accrediting in respect of that State.  I should like to know from the Taoiseach what unusuality there is about our concept of life or of the Constitution that we cannot do what the other people of the world do, namely, utilise the Head of the State for the purpose of accrediting representatives to other countries.  There is one simple question I should like to ask the Taoiseach to answer: why does not the Head of the State discharge that function here?  Why will we not let him discharge that function?  What set of circumstances compel us in 1947 to use as our accrediting authority the king of another country, in the selection of whom the people of this country had no say whatever?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has told us that by all the methods of definition and by reference to authorities on the definition of a republic this is a republican State.  I concede at once that it functions in a manner similar to the manner in which republican States function throughout the world, but it is a most amazing kind of republic at the same time.  Does the Taoiseach or anybody in this House know of any republic in the world where the monarch of another country accredits its representatives abroad?  Can anybody imagine France searching, for instance, for a Scandinavian King or a British King to accredit representatives from that country to the United States?  Can anybody imagine even one of the Scandinavian countries asking the President of France or the President of the United States to accredit representatives from that country to Great Britain or any other State?  Can anybody even imagine Great Britain asking the Head of another State to accredit representatives from that country either to this country or to any other country?  The whole position is a perfect anachronism and the sooner we get rid of that anachronism and that piece of irritating novelty in our domestic legislation and in our constitutional code the sooner we shall make clear to the people of this country and to the world generally the constitutional status which this country enjoys to-day.</P>
    <P>I think the Taoiseach asked Deputy <Col N="25" /> McGilligan in the course of a discussion on this matter a few days ago whether the Deputy desired to get rid of the King as the accrediting authority?  Surely that is not the issue involved&mdash;whether Deputy McGilligan wants to get rid of the King or not.  Ought not the Government to realise that the selection of the King of Great Britain for the purpose of accrediting our representatives abroad has no parallel in the constitutional procedure of any country; that you cannot get a parallel for that in any other part of the world; that it is something which, in fact, is being foisted upon our people in very unusual circumstances; and that the obvious thing to do is to regularise the position?  Who is preventing us from regularising it? Nobody has dared to suggest that Great Britain would complain; nobody has dared to suggest that Great Britain has any right to complain. Nobody has dared to suggest that any of the countries in the world would not take from us a representative accredited by the Head of the State elected by the people of the State.</P>
    <P>What is preventing the removal of that anomalous piece of machinery in our external relations?  What is preventing us from appointing the Head of the State as the accrediting authority?  Is there any power in this country preventing it?  Is there any external power?  If there is an external power, we ought to know that external power.  We ought to know what is preventing the Government from taking the obvious step of appointing the President of this country as the properly recognised accrediting authority in our relations with other countries.  We ought to have from the Taoiseach some explanation as to why a position of that kind is being continued.  I think the Taoiseach must know that it is an anomaly which cannot be justified by any unusual and tortuous approach to the whole problem and that, when efforts are made to explain it, it is still as unsatisfactory as before the explanation is attempted.</P>
    <P>I want on this occasion again to throw this issue into the realm of <Col N="26" /> public discussion in the hope that we can get away from something that nobody can justify; something, as I said, that is unusual and without parallel in the constitutional relations of one country with another and in the international relations of one country with another; and which ought to be got rid of at the earliest opportunity. I know of nobody preventing the Taoiseach from introducing legislation to get rid of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not even need legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That makes our laziness all the more unjustifiable.  We do not need legislation and yet we do not do it.  This Presidential establishment is a pretty costly institution as it is.  If it can be justified on this grandiose scale, its justification may reside in the usual function which a president discharges. If he is to take second place to the British monarch every time we are appointing a representative to another country, then I think we are deliberately insulting the President by withdrawing from him the function which he ought to have in the matter of accrediting our representatives to other countries.  I should like to get some more enlightenment from the Taoiseach on this matter on this Estimate this year than it has been possible to get on previous occasions in justification of this unusual and novel procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to make a brief reference is the question of Partition.  The question of Partition is rightly regarded by our people as a suppurating wound in our relations with the British people; not so much the British people at large, but with successive British Governments. So long as it continues, there can be no really friendly relations between the two peoples, because the partition of this country represents a thwarting of the will and of the desires of our people.  It represents a sundering of this motherland, a tearing away from the motherland of six counties which ought to be, and geographically and otherwise are an integral part of the territory called Ireland.  For many years now we have witnessed the partition of this country continue and almost <Col N="27" /> take on a new permanence each year. Unless something is done to throw that question into the arena of world politics, I am convinced that, by our own inactivity in the matter, we are continuing to condone the partition of this country by an external authority.</P>
    <P>In recent months we have seen, in particular, the British Government graciously saying to the people of India: &ldquo;We are now prepared to give you what you always had a natural and moral right to, the right to determine the form of government under which your people shall live&rdquo;.  We have seen the British offer one kind of settlement after another to the Indian people.  We have seen them agreeing to the form of government which has been decided by the Indian people themselves.  We have seen a promise by the British Government that after next year the Indians need not come even into the British Commonwealth; they are perfectly free to decide what form of government they will have. We have had declarations from prominent representatives of the Indian people that they would prefer to establish a free republic for India and the British Government consents to their right to do that.  It does not dare to question the right to establish free institutions in India and separate these from the British Commonwealth and enter international affairs as a free republic of India.  We have seen the British Government, too, recognising that she can no longer justify some of the extraterritorial rights she had in Egypt and she is being compelled by force of world circumstances to negotiate a new agreement with Egypt.  She is obliged to shed some of the privileges and prerogatives which she had in Egypt.</P>
    <P>It is in circumstances like that, in which Egypt is being given more liberty and independence and the Indians are now having acknowledged their right to set up a free republic in India, that we ought to bestir ourselves to raise this question of Partition with the same force and the same enthusiasm and with the same desire to compel a solution of the problem as the Indians and the Egyptians.  I see no evidence here of <Col N="28" /> any such intention.  I am strongly of this opinion, that if the British Government can offer the Indians, as a people and as a nation, the right to determine the form of government under which they will live, and if they are now willing to shed their extraterritorial rights in Egypt, there is no moral reason, and there never was, why the people of this country should not be given the same right to end here, by a free vote, the cancerous evil of Partition, a British-made product, conceived in Britain, implemented by Britain and possible of maintenance only by the support that it gets from Britain.</P>
    <P>Is there any insuperable difficulty in our Government saying to the British Government that we want a formal conference with them on the question of abolishing Partition?  Britain is an occupying power in the Six Counties, as big an occupying power as any of the victor nations in Europe.  She has no moral right to be there, and never had any moral right.  She is in the position to-day in which she is an occupation force in the Six Counties. It ought to be our task&mdash;and we may not have the opportunity for ever&mdash;to raise now with the British Government the question of ending Partition and restoring to this country the unity and the indivisibility which is the country's natural right.</P>
    <P>It may well be that the Taoiseach has taken steps which have not been revealed to the House or to the country.  An occasional reference to Partition in a broadcast makes no perceptible contribution towards focussing on that very serious problem the spotlight of publicity which must be focussed on it if ever we are to bring about a solution.  It was not by occasional broadcasts that the Indians managed to push their problems into the forefront of world politics and to win an ever-widening measure of sympathy from the freedom-loving peoples of the world.</P>
    <P>In our relations with Britain we shall have to insist that Britain will stand where she properly should stand in the eyes of freedom-loving peoples; that is, as an occupying authority in the Six Counties.  She has no moral right there, no moral justification for her <Col N="29" /> maintenance there, no authority from the Irish people to occupy that portion of the country or to remain in occupation. I suggest that while other countries are gradually shedding their fetters, while Britain is being compelled to acknowledge throughout the world the right of oppressed and subjected peoples to fashion their own institutions and plan and order their own national lives, the Government should initiate proposals requesting the British Government to have a formal conference on Partition so that its evils may be pointed out to Britain and its dangers, even to Britain, revealed.  In that way there can be brought home to them a realisation of the suppurating wound which Partition has brought about in the relations of the two peoples, with the hope that the British will be prepared to do for Ireland what they now apparently are willing to do for India, namely, to end unhappiness and to bring about a situation in which the two peoples, accepting the one way of life, the democratic way, with trade relations and intercourse which peculiarly fit the two peoples, can live in terms of amity and concord, one with the other.</P>
    <P>I feel convinced that very valuable work can be done if the Government would initiate a conference of that kind.  The present British Government can have no great love for the people who were the architects of Partition. They have shown they are not unwilling to break with the imperialism and ascendancy of the past, which fettered countries like India and Egypt.  I think we will be doing worse than a disservice to the people of the Six Counties if this opportunity is not availed of for the purpose of initiating a formal conference with the British Government.  I can see no harm arising; I can see it being used as a means of enlightening and informing British Ministers and the British public, and I can see, too, that it will have a very far-reaching effect in bringing home to the peoples of the world, all freedom-loving peoples in particular, that there is still a serious problem in this country, a problem which takes the form of six of our counties being held in subjection by an occupying force.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> If the Taoiseach takes steps along the lines I have indicated, he will gain for Partition a world-wide publicity that it has never yet got and, if not immediately, it may ultimately result in the British Government recognising that, even apart from their desire to please us, in their own interests they ought to bring to an end the cancer of Partition and all that it has meant in poisoning the wells of friendship between the Irish and the British people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In every debate that has taken place on the Estimate for the Department of External Affairs, there have been demands made on the Taoiseach to clarify our position in regard to the British Commonwealth of Nations.  I think I was one of the Deputies who intervened in the debate last year and I demanded from the Taoiseach a definite statement as to what our position is.  A statement was made by the Taoiseach then and, as far as I can interpret it, it meant that this country is a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations and that it is not the intention of the Government to withdraw from that membership. I think a little more will have to be done to clarify the position, because there still seems to be a certain amount of confusion in the country.  One leading newspaper, which ought to be well informed on such matters, made the following statement recently in the course of an editorial:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If Fine Gael came into office to-morrow, there is not a single measure carried through by Fianna Fáil which they could dare to repeal, even though General Mulcahy still speaks as if it were their intention to bring this independent State into a British Commonwealth status.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was an editorial in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 17th April, 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So the <i>Irish Press</i> seems to be under the impression that this country is outside the British Commonwealth and it is defying the Opposition Parties to bring us back.  I think there is room for some discussion between the Head of the Government and the editor of the <i>Irish Press</i> on this question.  If <Col N="31" /> we are in the British Commonwealth, it is of small importance for the Opposition Party or any other Party to bring us back, if we are already there.  I think there has been an attempt to deceive the people in regard to this matter and it is an undesirable thing that the ordinary people should be deceived.  I think it is better that the people should be told exactly where we stand and what is our ultimate aim.  If the ultimate aim of the Government is to preserve the existing relationship with the British Commonwealth and to seek on that basis the reunion of our country, I think they would be wise to let the people know that that is exactly their policy. Having regard to the importance of reuniting our country, I think there is a good deal to be said for that policy.</P>
    <P>Partition is, perhaps, the major national evil.  Our nation is divided and no citizen of this country, who is really and truly patriotic, can look with complacency on that division.  No Irishman can regard that long straggling frontier across the face of our country with anything but regret and deep sorrow.  It is not only the loss of six valuable counties but there is also entailed the demoralisation which the almost unending smuggling along the Border creates.  There are all the conflicting interests as between the Six Counties and the rest of Ireland, the growing up of vested interests in Partition&mdash;vested interests within the Twenty-Six Counties which might feel that the reintegration of the Six Counties in this State might bring them economic disadvantages and vested interests within the Six Counties which are growing stronger and stronger every day.</P>
    <P>On the question of the measures which should be adopted by our Government to bring to an end this unhappy state of affairs, there is certainly room for very considerable discussion and need for very careful consideration.  World-wide publicity is a grand thing; it is a fine thing in the matter of exposing a wrong but one has always got to be extremely careful in regard to raising an international problem, particularly at a time like this when the world is in <Col N="32" /> its present extraordinary, abnormal condition.  I have no doubt whatever that we should use our radio for the purpose of seeking to enlighten the majority of people in the Six County area and converting them to our viewpoint. I have no doubt whatever that our radio should be used extensively for appealing to the people of all Parties in Great Britain.  That policy of seeking to educate the people of a nation with which we have a dispute is a prudent one.  It is a better policy than the adoption of hostile or aggressive measures.  In the years prior to the first great war, there was a long period during which national effort was directed towards enlightening the people of Great Britain and, while there may be many people at the present time who believe that much of that effort was wasted, and that much of it was futile, I think that, with the efflux of time and a clearer recognition of all the facts of the case, it has now come to be recognised that very important and useful work was done over a period of 30 or 40 years in enlightening the people of Britain and in preparing them to accept the idea of self-government for Ireland.  There is no doubt whatever that as a result of long-sustained propaganda, the British people were converted in 1914, and even long before that, to the idea that this country should have self-government and the fact that they were, did play an important part in the ultimate achievement of this country's independence&mdash;perhaps a more important part than is recognised to-day.</P>
    <P>Our attitude to the people of Britain should be one of friendship.  There is an old saying that one can live without one's relatives but one cannot live without one's neighbours and since Britain is a next-door neighbour of this country, it is absolutely essential, particularly in world conditions of the present time, that closer friendship should be established between the two nations.  Our appeal and our desire for the reunification of our country should not in any way impair that friendship. Enlightened opinion in Great Britain will, I think, eventually come to see that it is in the best interests of the people of that country as it is in ours, that this nation should be one. <Col N="33" /> Probably, in trade, in finance and in economics a united, independent Ireland, next door to Britain, is the best safeguard Britain could have.  The fact that they will have a strong neighbour, a good neighbour and a friendly neighbour ought to be an inducement to them to go all-out to have this Partition question satisfactorily settled.</P>
    <P>I hold that we ought to concentrate our energies on bringing the largest possible volume of propaganda to bear on this question, not aggressive and not hostile propaganda, but simply a clear and plain statement of our case and of the injury which our nation suffers by being divided, of the advantages which we would gain by being reunited as well as the advantages which that would also bring to Britain. On the question as to whether we should go further and appeal to other nations to intervene in this question, I have grave doubts.  If I am living next door to another farmer and I have a dispute with him about a fence or some other matter, I can plead with him and appeal to him and I can bring every possible pressure to bear upon him to see my point of view, but if I bring my case before some other person I immediately arouse a certain amount of hostility in my neighbour.  It is just a question as to whether an appeal to some other nation, such as the United States, might not in the long run do more harm than good in the matter of bringing this question to a satisfactory settlement.  I am particularly influenced in coming to that opinion by something I read over the week-end.  I read some propaganda which was sent to me by an organisation in America which calls itself the Connolly Memorial Committee. I believe that, if we were to link ourselves up with the type of propaganda that is circulated by that committee, we would probably ruin whatever hope we have of advancing the cause of national unity.  That organisation has, apparently, published a pamphlet which it has circulated amongst the people of America, a pamphlet which grossly misrepresents the conditions here in this country.  It is a pamphlet which, I think, ought to be repudiated not only by the Government but by every independent Party in this nation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> I listened to a discussion here last week as to whether our Radio should be beamed on America so as to bring our propaganda and our publicity to the other side of the Atlantic.  I hold very emphatically that our Radio should be beamed on the United States, but not for the purpose of initiating or dragging the United States into a conflict with Great Britain or with any other nation, but for the purpose of repudiating and contradicting the lying propaganda which has been issued by this so-called Connolly Memorial Committee. That committee has grossly exaggerated prison conditions in this country, and it grossly misrepresented the discussion which took place in this House.  I see before me in that pamphlet the heading, &ldquo;Mr. Boland threatens Deputy Donnellan.&rdquo;  We all remember the circumstances in which that alleged threat was made in this House.  We all know the remark made by the Minister for Justice in that particular case was purely a joke.</P>

      <P>It is up to Deputy Flanagan to help out this particular kind of anti-national and anti-Irish propaganda if he thinks fit, but I am quite certain that the Minister for Justice had not the slightest intention of intimidating or threatening Deputy Donnellan in any way.  I am quite sure, knowing both Deputy Donnellan and the Minister for Justice, that no one would be more grieved than the Minister for Justice if Deputy Donnellan were to commit some crime that would bring upon him the rigour of the law.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but this is a matter of national external policy, and the full implications of it could not, I think, have been fully debated on the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It is a question of national policy whether we should direct our publicity towards rectifying and correcting serious misrepresentations of this country abroad.  I believe that it is a sound policy to inform the American people as to what are the true conditions here.  We cannot allow an organised section in America to link this country up with anti-British propaganda there, or with pro-Russian propaganda there because, inevitably, the major division into which the entire world is now divided must affect this question.  We know that every bit of organised and well financed propaganda in the United States is directed towards building up a public opinion favourable to Russia.  It is for that reason that our propaganda should be directed towards showing that, in this democratic country, we are able to manage our affairs, and that there are not here conditions such as have been described by this Connolly Committee. If the conditions were such as described by these people, democracy here would have failed completely and there would be a justification for American people coming to the conclusion that democracy was not worth defending. When we realise the danger to our <Col N="36" /> national interests of this type of propaganda it is only right that we should direct our external policy towards having the facts of our case properly presented.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton, dealing with the question of Partition, referred to the fact that India has been given freedom but India also has been partitioned and there again there is a tremendous problem to be solved.  The problem of India has not been solved any more than the problem here has been solved and, recognising that fact, we should not be so cheerful in suggesting that there are easy and simple methods of solving the question of Partition. The question is very complex and very serious and all the energies of our people must be directed towards a solution. Therefore, in connection with world-wide publicity on the question of Partition or the question of the rights, interests and welfare of this nation, it is desirable that all Parties in this House should be brought into consultation by the Government.  In old-established nations, such as Great Britain, whenever there is a decision to be taken involving foreign policy, it is customary for the Government to consult with the Opposition.  Having regard to the dangers which lie all around in the present abnormal world situation and the danger of a false move in external affairs, it is desirable that such consultation should take place and that, if possible, in regard to the control and direction of radio publicity there should be set up some sort of advisory council to control that type of propaganda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past year this nation applied for admission to the United Nations Organisation.  The application was turned down as a result of the opposition of Russia and Australia.  I am one of those who maintained that it was right that we should make application for membership but when our application was rejected the dignified course and from a national standpoint the most desirable course would have been to withdraw our application and to wait until the United Nations Organisation made up its mind to invite us to become a member.  Once our application has been rejected, no <Col N="37" /> useful purpose is served by hanging on to the door-knob begging for admission. That is not a dignified or self-respecting procedure and no nation can afford to throw away its self-respect.  The Taoiseach may know of some very sound reasons for continuing to knock at the door of the United Nations Organisation. If so, I would like to hear them, but I would be very slow to be convinced that that procedure is necessary. If there is a complete change in the formation of the United Nations Organisation&mdash;and only such a change will lead to a change in Russia's attitude towards this country&mdash;I am sure the Supreme Council of the United Nations Organisation will send us an invitation to become a member.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary thing that this wonderful, humanitarian organisation in America did not think it necessary to make an appeal on behalf of Archbishop Stepinac.  There was no agitation raised by this organisation in America in connection with the criminal manner&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, Sir. I wish to point out that the Archbishop has been the victim of an inhuman policy, a policy pursued in over half a continent and I want to urge strongly upon the Government that as none of these humanitarian organisations to which I have referred has taken steps in the matter, it is the duty of the Government to take such further steps as may be necessary to rouse public opinion in the nations of Europe that are still free against that crime and injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Broadly and briefly, our external policy should be one of friendship with all free nations, particularly those that are nearest to us.  Such a policy will be beneficial not only in regard to securing our ultimate national unity but in advancing our external commercial interests.  I do not know why some people in this country claim the right or think it is good national policy to attack Britain on questions which have no concern for us.  We had a demand made in this House during the past year by Deputy Briscoe that <Col N="38" /> citizens of this country should not be allowed to join the Palestine police. At the same time we know that citizens of this country are co-operating in helping the Stern gang and the people who are fighting against Great Britain.  Our policy in regard to Palestine, I think, should be one of neutrality.  If it is wrong for citizens of this country to join the Palestine police, it is equally wrong for citizens of this country, whether real citizens or synthetically-produced citizens, to co-operate and assist in the fight being waged by the terror gangs in Palestine.  Our Government should take very strong action to ensure that no assistance is given by any section of our people to the terrorists in Palestine.  I read an article in the <i>Irish Press</i> during the past year which rather astonished me, in view of that paper's position and I think it is desirable that we should have a change of attitude on matters of this kind.  In that paper, there was a bitter attack upon Britain's policy in Palestine, but there was not one word of condemnation of the terrorist policy of the Jews. If you condemn one, you must condemn both.</P>

      <P>I know that the Government have no connection whatever with the <i>Irish Press</i>, but it is the duty of the Government, even though the Press is absolutely free, to give a lead in matters of this kind and to make it clear in their public pronouncements through the Information Bureau or any other means at their disposal that this country is not backing the Stern gang.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The world at present is in as grave a condition as humanity has ever faced. The present position is probably more serious than any other which faced humanity.  We have an attempt on the part of one totalitarian Power to overrún the entire globe, to overrun all the nations of the earth and to bring them under subjugation.  In such circumstances, it is the duty of a nation which is free, which is democratically governed, to take all such steps as may be necessary to avoid giving any assistance <Col N="39" /> whatever to the would-be dictators of the world in Russia.  For that reason, I hold that our international policy should be guided by extreme prudence and circumspection.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to two documents which it should be the duty of every well-informed person to read. There is another document which any Deputy who wishes to take an interest in foreign affairs should study very carefully&mdash;the diary of Count Ciano, published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> during the last few weeks.  Any man who has any desire to take an intelligent interest in foreign policy would do well to read that diary carefully, because in it we have revealed the malice and villainy of a small group of dictators who set out at that time to overthrow democracy and establish control over the entire world.  That diary not only reveals how criminal was the campaign waged by Hitler and his immediate associates, but it shows how equally criminal was the conspiracy of those who associated with him.  The Russian Government in 1939 were as much implicated in the attack upon the peace and freedom of the world as were the rulers of Germany, and it is only by studying documents of that kind, by studying the inner history and the motives which inspired these gangsters, that we can realise how grave is the position at present and how necessary it is for all nations, great and small, to co-operate in preserving the peace of humanity.</P>
    <P>One lesson that a small nation such as ours should learn from Count Ciano's diary is that, whenever in doubt, whenever you have to choose between right and wrong, it is better to choose right.  Italy, a weak nation, a badly armed nation, chose wrong and suffered for it, and we know now that the rulers of Italy at the time knew they were doing wrong.  There may be people who will say that opportunism is sometimes good, that you can sacrifice principle in order to gain some temporary national advantage, and that we should sacrifice principle in the hope of winning back the Six Counties.  We might get a guarantee <Col N="40" /> from some big Power, such as Russia, that she would restore the Six Counties to us, if we were to assist in her campaign for world domination, but I think that any potential advantage secured or sought to be secured by such means would be the same as the advantages which Italy hoped to get by entering the war.</P>
    <P>There is one course, and one course only, open to a small nation such as ours, that is, to act truthfully and honourably in regard to other nations, to rely on the justice of our cause and of our case.  If we do that, I think we shall eventually succeed in securing the reintegration of the Six Counties with the rest of Ireland and the establishment of a really democratic State for all Ireland.  That should be the major aim of our external policy, and it is an aim which will be secured more effectively if the Government adopt the suggestion I have made and seek, in regard to external policy, the co-operation of all Parties in the House. If an effort is made by the Government to seek that co-operation, I think it will be forthcoming.</P>

      <P>It has become customary, in introducing this Estimate, to give no survey of any kind of international affairs, to give a mere detailed explanation of the various sub-heads in the Vote.  A more usual and a better form of presentation would be for the Minister to outline, in so far as information is available to the Department, general world conditions and our interest in any particular aspect of world affairs.  For some reason, however, with the exception of a brief reference to our application for admission to the United Nations Organisation and a short description of the fact that we are about to open two new Legations, the Taoiseach's introductory remarks were confined entirely to giving more detailed particulars of the sub-heads of the Vote.  If a Deputy wanted information on that matter, it would be a simple thing for the Minister, when replying, to give full particulars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Supplementary Estimate which is being taken with the Vote, there is a sum of £10,000 for cultural <Col N="41" /> relations with other countries and this sum is to be spent as a Grant-in-Aid. I would like to hear fuller particulars of the proposed cultural relations and receive more information on the form which those relations are expected to take.  Certainly, in the absence of fuller information and in the absence of more detailed particulars, I cannot support a grant of £10,000 for such a purpose.</P>
    <P>In addition, we have a sum of £500 for an Official Handbook of Ireland. This handbook is to be handed over to be developed by the chief of the Government Information Bureau.  The experience of Deputies here in the past and the experience of most people is that the Government Information Bureau in certain cases is used as a Fianna Fáil propaganda agency, used in a manner which does not reflect credit on this country and which would in no way enable people outside to get an accurate view of conditions here. For that reason, in the absence of a guarantee that the preparation of this handbook will not be entrusted to the same hands with the same result, I cannot&mdash;and I think most people in the Opposition cannot&mdash;support a sum of £500 for that purpose.</P>
    <P>On the whole question of propaganda abroad, a good deal of exaggeration seems to have taken place concerning criticism of this country abroad. Excessive attention is paid to the fact that we have critics outside, as all countries have critics outside their own borders who from time to time either write or speak in terms antagonistic to their interests.  Deputies should realise that, with certain exceptions&mdash; important, but nevertheless existing exceptions&mdash;the majority of the world will be uninfluenced by any propaganda that we can do either on the wireless or through the Press.</P>
    <P>I heard earlier this evening here strong appeals being made to the Taoiseach to use the radio as a means of influencing public opinion throughout the world.  I take it that that means influencing anyone who is prepared to listen, or influencing anyone who may have associations with this country by ties of blood or trade relations or for some other reason. I wonder if Deputies realise that if we <Col N="42" /> were to broadcast to the Chinese in either English or Irish they would not be in the slightest interested.  It is ludicrous to suggest that we should embark on a world-wide propaganda programme under the direction or the control of the Minister for External Affairs in order to influence public opinion in various parts of the world. This is generally referred to in connection with the question of Partition as a means of influencing people who are regarded as being in a position to effect alterations in the position of this country and Great Britain concerning Partition.  On that matter, it might or might not have certain beneficial effects.  So much has been said on it from time to time and a regular annual review generally takes place here on the question of Partition, that I do not propose to dwell on it at length.  It is likely that more beneficial results would accrue from direct contact between the two Governments than from any amount of propaganda over the wireless or through the Press on the public either in America or in England.</P>
    <P>It is true that a number of our people have left this country for America, many of them permanently. A great number of the Irish are the descendants of former emigrants and undoubtedly are interested in our welfare and in our position from the international viewpoint, but it is equally true that many of them have severed their link with this country and their material and other prosperity is bound up with a country which they have made their national home.  In considering this question, then, we should give some attention to the fact that many of these people no longer regard themselves as Irish.  However, large numbers still regard themselves, if not directly as Irish, then as descendants of emigrants.  They have close personal ties with this country and many of them have relations and friends here.  They are deeply interested in our welfare, but anything which would give them or their neighbours in America the impression that we were trying to use them as a tool might, in the long run, have results other than those we intend, as it might influence them adversely rather than <Col N="43" /> in our favour.  Some Deputies are prone to exaggerate the effect of a campaign of that kind, under the direction of the Department of External Affairs, carried out over the radio or through the influence of Press agencies or through the proposed official handbook.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was strangely silent on the question of emigration.  From time to time Government spokesmen&mdash; and, in particular, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach&mdash;have alleged that Opposition propaganda is responsible for emigration or, at any rate, is a strong contributory factor. They have said they cannot understand why these people emigrate and they pretend to be amazed that they seek a livelihood elsewhere.  In their innocence, they tell us they do not know why these people will not remain at home, as there is much useful work to be done.  If they are in earnest and really want an answer, would it not be advisable for either or both of them, or all the Ministers, to stand some night or morning at any of our ports and ask some of the emigrants why they are leaving?  They might get an answer that no one in this country could give them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to the position in which these people are abroad and want to lead up to that. It has come to my notice that various categories of workers who leave this country for England, on their arrival at the ports there, are ticketed and grouped on a numerical basis and then sent to their future place of employment or sent to a distributing centre, for further travel to the factories or towns in which they are to be employed. I think it is degrading that in 1947 our citizens should be ticketed and herded on a numerical basis to their future abode.  I have heard complaints of the manner in which this operation is carried out to the effect that these people are, more or less, treated like cattle&mdash;herded together <Col N="44" /> and brought from one place to another. I think that some system could be adopted which would have regard to the dignity of these people as human persons and which would, at the same time, enable those who are employing them to get them expeditiously to their destination other than having them grouped numerically with a band on their arms and then herded and brought to the place of employment or place of further distribution. As far as I can understand, there is a distinction between certain categories of workers.  I would like the Minister, when replying, to inform the House as to the distinctions made and who is responsible for the system under which Irish workers going to England are ticketed at the ports in this fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies here have referred to our position in international affairs and our position should we eventually be accepted into the United Nations Organisation. Considerable speculation has taken place on our future rôles. Certain comments have been made on our status.  A good deal of wonder has been expressed at our status at the moment in international affairs and at our proposed function should we be admitted to the United Nations Organisation and should we be enabled to take part in the deliberations of that body.  I think it is true to say, not merely of individuals but of nations, that people always respect one for what one is and not for what one pretends to be.  There is nothing more degrading than that we in this country should pretend to be one thing and, in fact, be another. From time to time the Taoiseach refers to our external position, refers to the External Relations Act, and discusses our sovereignty.  Very often he says that we are completely independent and that if anyone has any doubts on the position he has only to look up the External Relations Act, and the Constitution and, further, that we can at any time, if we want to, repeal that Act.  Certainly I, for one, would far prefer to see that Act repealed than that we should continue this never-ending form of apology when we are not certain what we are and when we <Col N="45" /> wish other people to believe that we are one thing whereas, in fact, we are another.  We have, from time to time, heard statements and references to our position.  We have, from time to time, heard from the Taoiseach and from the Government views on our position as though other nations or individuals outside were attempting to belittle our position or in some way to derogate from our international status.  It has not merely been food for discussion amongst ourselves here and throughout the country but it has also been the subject of many articles in the Press.  I think that a number of these articles and discussions suit the Taoiseach.  I think the Taoiseach likes to have the problem discussed.  It is a form of mental or other exercise in which people indulge and very often it distracts them from the true position &mdash;very often from other more pressing problems&mdash;but all the time, because of its nature, it attracts attention and we devote time to a discussion of that nature when we might more profitably discuss graver problems which, in every way, are having a far more serious effect on the lives and interests of our people.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the matter upon which I would like to dwell, namely, that if we in this country have a false sense of our position, if we have a false appreciation of our status, and if we feel that other people outside have a similar false conception then would not it be far better, far more honest&mdash;possibly not as astute, not as suitable a political manoeuvre which, however, I do not regard either as astute or as a good political manoeuvre&mdash;to repeal the External Relations Act?  I think the External Relations Act is a tricky manoeuvre and I think its abolition would enable this country to stand forth for what it is, to stand forth for what it has been in the past and, in the future, to stand forth as an independent State conscious of our status and of our history.  I think it would be far more honest and far more in keeping with our traditions to repeal that Act.  I think that to carry on as we have been is to continue what has been so aptly described as &ldquo;living a lie&rdquo;.  There is nothing more corrosive <Col N="46" /> of national independence, of pride, than a form of status which some people consider astute but which, when examined more closely, appears to most people to be a tricky device.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the question of the two new Legations.  The Taoiseach referred to this matter as being primarily in the interests of trade and he said that in the future a number of these negotiations which, in the past, were carried out between commercial interests are now to be inter-governmental. I would like fuller information on that matter.  Is the coal which this country secured from America to be regarded as an example of intergovernmental trade?  I think we all realise that it was only when the coal exporting authorities in America were enabled to deal directly with the coal importing firms here that the necessary facilities were forthcoming.  If the example and experience which this country had in connection with the importation of coal is to be regarded as a line for future trade in other matters and between other countries, then we would want a fuller guarantee that the new Legations will facilitate trade and that the increase in the diplomatic representation of this country abroad will, in fact, be beneficial to our interests.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to urge on the Minister the fact that there has been some restriction on people wishing to leave this country in order to spend holidays in Britain.  I do not know whether the restriction is one imposed by the Department or one imposed by the British authorities.  However, the fact of the matter is that a number of agricultural labourers who were merely going to Britain for holidays experienced difficulties in getting the necessary facilities.  In certain cases the refusal was at the British end, and in other cases the refusal was at our end.  It may be that there is some fear that a number of these people will refuse to return and that they will take up employment in England.  I imagine that an easy solution of the problem would be to give them a permit or passport for a limited period only.  Certainly if people <Col N="47" /> from this country who have relatives or friends in England are anxious to spend a holiday there, despite the inconvenience, I think the facilities should be provided.  I should like to say that I experience nothing but the greatest assistance and the most extreme courtesy from all officials of the Department of External Affairs in any matter which I bring before them.  They deal with the matters in a courteous and considerate manner and, so far as my experience goes and the experience of anyone on whose behalf I had to make representations, the Department facilitated them in every way.  But in connection with these permits and visas for people who wish to travel to Great Britain on holidays, there is not merely considerable delay, but, in certain cases, a blank refusal, and I think this restriction should be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I heard Deputy Cogan advocate a common national policy in external affairs and that advocacy is to be appreciated.  But, listening to the debate on Friday and to-day, I did not see anything in common between the members of the Opposition.  Deputy Cosgrave spoke of the futility of spending large sums of money in putting the position of this country before the world.  He wanted to know what is the use of it; who would listen to us; would the people of China or the people of Peru listen to us?  Before that, Deputy Cogan said that we were not doing enough to draw attention to the position of Archbishop Stepinac, a citizen of another small nation who is wrongly imprisoned.  If we cannot do anything for our own country, what can we do for Archbishop Stepinac?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point made by the Opposition was that they were worried about our independence under the External Relations Act.  Yet the same people are advocating that we should <Col N="48" /> not go abroad in stating the case about the mutilation of this country; that we should not tell the world about the junta in the Six Counties; that we should grovel and be subservient to John Bull; that we should do nothing to offend him; in fact, that we are to have no independence when dealing with this terrible affliction on this country.  In one breath, we are told about our lack of independence and, in the next breath, when there is a national desire to reveal to the world the gerrymandering in the Six Counties we are told: &ldquo;Do not do it or you will offend America, you will offend John Bull; you will interfere with the relations between the United States and Great Britain.  Rather than such a thing should happen, let Partition go on; let hundreds of thousands of people be crushed out of existence; let them be deprived of ownership of the land and be knocked out of every public position, and establish the will of a certain group of individuals up there: a Protestant Parliament for a Protestant people.&rdquo;  I cannot see the logic of these people advocating independence where, they allege, it is not and, at the same time, advocating subservience to the people who are responsible for Partition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">

      <P>I should like to remind the House that, on 1st March, 1933, it subscribed unanimously to the proposition that a reunion of the Irish nation founded on goodwill should be the primary object of public policy and that every other constitutional issue should be subordinated thereto.  What I have to say in relation to this Vote will be largely devoted to the problem of Partition, which has loomed largely in the recent speeches.  But I want to say at the outset that, since that resolution was passed, I have seen no evidence, good, bad or indifferent, of any intention on the part of the Government to take any practical steps towards removing the barrier of Partition.  Indeed, I have grave doubts that Fianna Fáil consider it wise in their own partisan interest to remove that barrier.  However that may be, certainly during their 15 years of office no steps of a practical kind have been taken by them to effect a <i>rapprochement</i><Col N="49" /> with Stormont or by any other means to undo the evil of Partition.  I regard their policy as deliberately calculated to preserve that barrier rather than to remove it.</P>
      <P>If we take the efforts that have been made recently, both in this House and outside the House, to convince our people that we have a Republic down here as one of the examples of Fianna Fáil policy calculated to offend Northern Ireland opinion and calculated to make more permanent the Border, then surely we can conclude that there is no intention on the part of the Government to take practical steps in this matter.  If there is one thing more than another calculated to offend Northern Ireland sentiment, it is the parading of this bogus Republic which we go on with down here.  The second point I think that is offending Northern Ireland sentiment&mdash;and I say it in all seriousness&mdash;is the stress the Taoiseach and his Ministers lay repeatedly on Irish and the necessity for promoting Irish throughout the country; again, if you like, giving the impression to the people across the Border who do not want to learn Irish that, if they have ever to come under a Dublin Government, they will be forced to learn a language which they hate.</P>
      <P>I want to make myself perfectly clear on these two points.  Republicanism, de Valerism, if you like, paraded as Republicanism, is anathema to the Orangemen across the Border; so also is the Irish language.  If we are continually harping on these two subjects down here, we are not going to take any practical steps towards getting inside the skin of the Orangemen. When I say Orangemen, I say it in all seriousness, because I firmly believe that the evil of Partition is due to the fact that we have in the Six Counties, and perhaps on this side of the Border, a militant political organisation of Orangeism, and these are the gentlemen who are interested in preserving the Six-County Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I say that, every time we parade the Republic here and every time we give them the impression that we are going to bludgeon them into learning Irish if ever they come under a Dublin Parliament, we are sending them <Col N="50" /> farther and farther away from us than ever.  I want to approach the problem of Partition from that particular angle rather than from any other angle.  I think it is a mistake that we should give them that impression.  For that reason, I disagree entirely with Deputy Norton when he suggests that we should cut the painter&mdash;the King, such as he is, in our Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled to my opinion.  I may say that the first time I read those two things together it was clear to me that the King is in the Constitution.  I want to say that the King is the last link, and a very slender link, between us and the British Commonwealth of Nations.  I was disagreeing with Deputy Norton in recommending to the Taoiseach that that very slender link should be cut, because I look upon it as the last hope we have, such as it is, of ever effecting a <i>rapprochement</i> between the Six County Government and ours.  If you set up an absolute Republic here and cut the painter, then we have done away with all hope for ever of solving our Partition problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold strongly on this matter, because I can see across the Border almost 1,000,000 people who have sentiments <Col N="53" /> towards the Crown.  We may not respect these sentiments, but they are entitled to their sentiments and to their opinions.  If we set out deliberately to offend these sentiments, we have no hope of effecting that reconciliation which, I hope, can be brought about some day.  I think the Orangeman is a pathological case from many points of view, but I think he has been made that deliberately by the centuries of mal-administration which took place in our history here.  I believe that he has been brought to that pathological condition through historical circumstances, largely.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the House that the Orangeman, such as he is, is really an Irishman to begin with.  Those people who are Orange to-day were, centuries ago, our people.  They emigrated to Scotland and they lost the faith in Scotland.  They or their descendants came back here and settled in the North and that is just the problem, that in the time of their exile, as you may call it, from this country, they changed their religion and came back to find we had held on to ours, and their descendants to-day have that peculiar religious fanatical outlook, if you like, largely conferred upon them from that time and fomented by politicians through the centuries since.  The Orangeman is a paradox in many ways.  The solemn league and convenant to which the Orangeman subscribes was, in Wolfe Tone's time, the solemn league and convenant of the Irish Republic, but it has become in Orangeism to-day the solemn league and convenant of Unionism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what makes it so objectionable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is what makes it so objectionable, but I can see through the ramifications of the Orangeman's mind an Irishman, if you like, despite the paradox of his situation.  He is really an Irishman, a contrary, if you like, stubborn, pig-headed Irishman, but nevertheless an Irishman, and we have to recognise that fundamental fact before we attempt any understanding with him. Unless we can do that, then we will completely fail to solve the problem <Col N="54" /> of Partition.  I disagree with Deputy Norton when he hawks our political troubles and our Partition problem over to Clement Attlee in Westminster. I disagree with Deputy Cogan when he suggests that we should submit our case to Uncle Sam in Washington.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I definitely did not suggest that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I even disagree with Deputy Cogan when he goes so far as to put his hand on the door-knob of the United Nations Organisation and almost sings &ldquo;Open the door, Joe.&rdquo; I thought at the time Deputy Cogan came to the door he was going to parody &ldquo;Open the door, Richard,&rdquo; the song about which we have heard so much.  I do not want to go into all this question about opening the door but I should like to see some attempt at going to Belfast to open the door. I think unless we go to Belfast to open the door we are wasting our time in sheer futility.  That is the approach we have got to make to Partition and if we are not going to attempt to make that approach to Partition, then let us for goodness' sake forget it.</P>
      <P>As I have mentioned Partition, I did, some time ago, interest myself in reading on this subject various people, amongst them Orangemen, and I came across some extraordinary statements. Away back in 1914 Sir Edward Carson was asked by a Pressman how the Ulster trouble came about.  His answer was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;My dear fellow, to explain that, I should have to go back on history for at least three centuries.  It would take me about a month to do it and at the end I suspect that you would not understand.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I seriously suggest to the House that it would take us a good while to get to the fundamentals of Partition and there is no use in Deputy Norton, Deputy Cogan or anybody else coming to this House and suggesting that by a breath of wind in the right direction, Partition will disappear.  There are too many facets to this problem for Partition to disappear, as it were, by mere wishful thinking.  There is a big fundamental problem involved in this <Col N="55" /> question.  It was of fundamental importance during the recent war and it will be even more fundamental in any future war.  There is no doubt but that Britain regards the North of Ireland and the North-West passage as one of the chief outposts for the protection of Britain.  There is no doubt but that if a base had not been available there for the American forces during the recent world war, their chances of getting a foothold in Europe would have been very remote.  I merely mention that as one aspect of the problem that has got to be solved.</P>
    <P>There are other facets of the problem that we have to remember.  You have economic, historic and financial considerations involved in this question. I do not want to go into all these matters but I do want to suggest that amongst the Orangemen you had a history of persecution and a history of suffering for conscience sake.  You have there an old tradition.  Do not let us always forget that tradition, and assume that they are just pig-headed, anti-Papists who go out on the 12th July beating a drum.  They have a history and a tradition behind them. Away back in the 16th and the 17th century these people were persecuted and were driven from their homes and their lands in the North.  They were deprived of their jobs and their professions; their houses and their lands were cleared; it was &ldquo;to hell or to Connaught&rdquo; for them just as much as it was &ldquo;to Hell or to Connaught&rdquo; for the people down here in Cromwell's time.  Let us remember these facts when we approach them.  Let us remember that the descendants of these people who went to America fought with Washington, side by side with our emigrants and that more than half of the signatories to the United States Declaration of Independence were of Ulster stock.  If we can remember these facts then we should have some appreciation of the problem that confronts us in approaching these people.</P>
    <P>I know that there are many inconsistencies. I know it is hard to agree with an Orangeman who will praise Washington as a hero and at the same time who will look upon Wolfe Tone as <Col N="56" /> a traitor and a villain.  I know that you have that difficulty in getting to the back of his mind but I do want to suggest that if you rush into this matter, you can do a lot of harm.  If we take the right steps and try to see behind the mentality and the traditions of these people, giving them credit for all these things in which they believe, we may perhaps be able to bring them round to our point of view.  I do not believe that anything in the nature of hawking our troubles elsewhere will get us anywhere.  I hold that the proper approach to this question is that of Dublin <i>vis-à-vis</i> Belfast.  I have seen little done in the last Government's time or in the present Government's time to effect a <i>rapprochement.</i> Rather on the contrary, have we gone further and further away from any effort at reunion.  Behind the scenes something may have been done; I do not know, but if anything like that is happening it is all to the good. Years ago something was happening but unfortunate events down here ended them rather abruptly.</P>
    <P>I do want to advocate strongly that there can be only one or two ways to solve Partition, the first being a <i>rapprochement</i> between Dublin and Belfast by which we shall be able to get these people to see eye to eye with us and arrange some sort of federal union with them.  The other alternative is force.  Mind you, force may become necessary some day.  I am not a believer in having our country truncated indefinitely and our people handed over to the junta in Belfast.  I do not believe that the people of this generation has done its part and I believe there is a big job of work awaiting future generations.  I believe that the task of bringing about a union of the North and the South of this country awaits some Irish Cavour of the future.  I do believe that we have given 25 years to what you might call delicate handling of the Partition problem.  I do believe that we have given the kid glove every time to these people.  I do believe that we have gone as far as we possibly can in holding out the hand of friendship and that, 25 years after the Treaty, it is time that we were beginning anew the effort to reunite our lost territory.  I do not <Col N="57" /> want to go into details, into all the constitutional developments which have taken place.  I did at one time go into the matter on behalf of a body of Irishmen and Englishmen who were endeavouring to see if there was any approach by which we could bridge the particular difficulty.  Having gone into the matter I discovered that there was none by which we could do so, speaking legally and constitutionally.</P>
    <P>May I remind the House that under the 1920 Act the Belfast Parliament was set up in June, 1921?  In June, 1921, the King visited Belfast to open the Belfast Parliament.  The Belfast Parliament was, therefore, a <i>fait accompli</i> even before the Truce of July, 1921, was signed and long before the Treaty was signed.  Before the Treaty, or before the negotiations for that Treaty had been begun, the Belfast Parliament had been established as a <i>fait accompli</i> in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>It is well that the younger generation should realise that when they enter into discussions on the Partition problem. Under the Treaty and under the Act, there was a provision for a Council of Ireland.  It was deliberately established for the purpose of leaving some way by which a reunion could be effected between the North and the South, but under Articles 12 and 13 of the Treaty the Council of Ireland was more or less abolished.  It was preserved in form, but its effective powers were taken away.  Under a subsequent enactment&mdash;the Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act of 1922 &mdash;the Council of Ireland's powers were placed in the position that if either the Government here or the Government in Belfast wanted to take these powers to themselves, then they could do so, but that if, after a period of five years, they did not do so, then an Order in Council could be made transferring the powers to the Six County Government.  In actual fact, the powers were transferred to the Six County Government on the 1st April, 1926.  These powers were limited powers.  As well as I remember they related to the railways, diseases of animals and fisheries, but though they were limited powers still they were left <Col N="58" /> there as a tribute, if you like, to the hope that reunion might be effected even on such a slender basis as the Council of Ireland afforded.  In actual fact what happened was that our people down here, in the circumstances in which they found themselves, did not, of course, take any cognisance of the 1920 Act, and did not take any cognisance of the Council of Ireland.  The Council of Ireland went by the board so far as we here were concerned, and eventually the North of Ireland got these powers.</P>
    <P>To-day, when there is some question of added powers being given to the North of Ireland Parliament and when, apparently, certain people who are outside this House question the right of the North of Ireland to get any extra powers, it is well that they should remember that that Parliament got these powers in 1926&mdash;powers which were intended for all Ireland and which would be exercisable by the Council of Ireland.  They were given to them in 1926 and referred, as I have said, to fisheries, diseases of animals and the railways.  The only thing that was left after that happened was the provision that the two Governments could meet at any time they saw fit or necessary on matters of common concern.  That was left in a very nebulous sort of way&mdash; that if at any time the two Governments saw fit they could meet on matters of common concern.  In actual fact, we have never met on common ground, and we do not seem ever to have had a common outlook on any matter affecting the country.  I think it is regrettable that the two Governments have not availed of these very slender powers such as they were.  I think it is regrettable that some effort has not been made over the years to effect an approach by the two Governments so that a common basis might be found for coming together on matters of mutual concern and of national concern.  I think that if there had been some use made of these powers, it is quite on the cards that we would have made further progress towards reunion than we have made.</P>
    <P>However, as I have said, the Council of Ireland is gone so far as we are concerned. <Col N="59" /> It is now a matter quite open to the two Governments to come together when they see fit, but the position seems to me to be that neither Government is prepared to take the initiative.  Neither Government will make the first move, and in a situation of that kind things are bound to drift indefinitely.  Neither Government, apparently, is prepared to risk its honour, good name or prestige in making the first move.  The only link, therefore, that is left is the King as an organ in our external relations.  I disagree with Deputy Norton and other speakers, who have advocated that that link should be cut.  I think it would be a mistake, taking the broad view, to take the King out of the External Relations Act, and if I may say so, out of the Constitution, because I feel that it would be calculated to injure our position, particularly in relation to Stormont and the Six Counties, but more particularly in our relations with the Commonwealth of Nations.  I think that would be a retrograde step, one that would be very much misunderstood across the Border, and one that would certainly be much more misunderstood throughout the Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton and other people seem to think that, by merely asking the present Labour Government in Great Britain, we could do a whole host of things as regards the removal of the Partition problem.  I do not believe a word of it.  There was a Bill recently before the British House of Commons relating to the North of Ireland.  In the case of that Bill we saw that 200 British Labour M.P.s put down an amendment, the discussion on which was calculated to provoke a strom in relation to Northern Ireland.  An extraordinary thing happened.  When it came to the time to move the amendment nobody moved it and, as far as I can see, there was only one man who had the courage of his convictions&mdash;Mr. Bing&mdash;to come back to the North of Ireland and say what he felt like saying to the people in the North.  So much, therefore, for their sincerity in the matter.  As far as I can see, they are simply playing Party politics with the Six County position.  They appreciate <Col N="60" /> that the Six Counties comprise the last stronghold of conservatism throughout the Commonwealth and feel they must play Party politics with it. I have no intention of suggesting to the Taoiseach that we should lend ourselves in any way to that.  As far as I can see, it is a purely Party game in Great Britain.  I think the approach should be a direct one between Irishmen and Irishmen.  I would also like to stress a fact which emerged in the course of that debate, that almost every speaker who took part in it said that the problem of Partition, as far as they could see it, was essentially one for settlement between Irishmen and Irishmen.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the historical aspects of Partition or to apportion blame for Partition&mdash;to apportion the blameworthiness for it on particular British statesmen.  We all know who are responsible for Partition and we all know how it came about as well as the antagonisms that were there at the time.  I do not want to waste the time of the House in going back on past history, but I do feel that while to British statemanship in the past the blame for Partition could largely be assigned, nevertheless, it would do us no good now to open old sores and traduce them for what they said in those days.  I do sincerely suggest that we in this country in this matter of Partition have a very serious problem. It is at the root of all our problems, and particularly at the root of our international problems.  It is a problem that we ought to face up to soon in the hope that we can effect a settlement between the North and the South. The problem is not an easy one.  It is not one that can be solved by inactivity or by a negative attitude down here. It is one that demands a positive policy.  I agree that it is one upon which all Parties in this House should have a common understanding.  Above all, it is one that should be above Party politics.  It certainly should not be made the plaything of politics.  It is a national problem and I feel that every section of the House would be behind the Taoiseach if he were prepared to take some practical steps towards bringing about the ending of Partition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="61" /> I, for one, have said before and I repeat it now, that I feel that we should have some representation in Belfast whether they like it or not.  We ought to have some representation there; we ought to go there and try to contact those people and use our resources here for the purpose of peacefully persuading them of our goodwill, of our friendship and above all, of our tolerance.  Many of those people have prejudices, narrow, bitter beliefs that if ever they came under a Dublin Parliament they would be ruthlessly treated in the matter of their religion and of their civil rights.  We know quite well that because of the traditions which we have established since this State was set up the feelings and fears of those people are quite ill-founded. Nevertheless, they are there, and it should be our duty to do everything possible to try to get those people to realise that they have nothing to fear from coming under a Dublin Parliament.  I would like to see, not a propaganda directed so much against Partition, as a propaganda directed by us to show that our Constitution is deliberately framed to embrace them whenever they see fit to come in; that our Constitution is so deliberately framed that, if they came in in the morning, English can remain their official language, if they choose to make English their official language. Our Constitution provides that either the Irish or the English language may be the exclusive language of a particular area.  That has been deliberately put in to meet the North of Ireland problem but the North of Ireland people have never heard of that.  They never realise it. They do not appreciate it.  They read the daily newspapers and they think every time the Taoiseach speaks about Irish: &ldquo;If we ever come under the Dublin Parliament we will be all sent to the Gaeltacht to learn Irish&rdquo;.  That is what they feel.  They do not know about the other matter.  They do not realise that even if they came in in the morning our Constitution would permit them to have a subordinate parliament in Belfast and that we could have some form of federation. These are the aspects of our position that I would like to have propaganda <Col N="62" /> directed towards, towards curbing the anticipations and anxieties and fears of these people, not, by shouting &ldquo;Up the Republic&rdquo; every fine morning, to get them to feel that we are going to trample on any sentiments they hold dear.  I believe the parading of the Republic is calculated to do infinite harm in the Six Counties and I say that seriously as I have been many times amongst these people and I know every time the word &ldquo;Republic&rdquo; is paraded in any way down here it stinks in their nostrils.</P>
    <P>It is time we woke up to these facts and faced realities and, realising what these people are, that we would go some of the way to meet them.  I do not want the Taoiseach to go to the United Nations Organisation or Washington or London.  I want him to go to Belfast.  That is where we have to begin, and that is where we have to end.  If we do not succeed in doing the job on Irish soil we certainly are not going to solve the problem on foreign soil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach a couple of questions arising out of this Vote.  I agree with the Deputies who have commented on the method of presenting this Estimate. The Taoiseach adopted the method of merely giving the figures arising out of the various sub-heads.  He gave little or no information on the very important matter of foreign affairs generally. In the past, and again on this occasion, he adopted the method of giving the minimum amount of information, listening to the discussion and then saying whatever he has to say at the end.  I feel that the House is entitled to a different kind of treatment and, certainly, to considerably more information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy give us some idea of what he wants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am leading up to that. The House has discussed at length a very important matter, the question of Partition.  I do not intend to refer to that.  It has been discussed in great detail.  The Taoiseach gave us information about our diplomatic services abroad and the expansion of these services and told us that it was due to the expansion of our international <Col N="63" /> trade relations.  He went on to say that international trade was becoming more dependent upon inter-governmental arrangements and that they had increased the personnel of our diplomatic representatives to 16 and had appointed a commercial secretary to the Legation at Washington and that Mr. Kerney had been sent as head of an economic mission to Africa.  He left the work of our diplomats at that.  The information I am looking for from the Taoiseach is, what has been done by our diplomatic representatives so far as trade is concerned because, while our representatives perform other functions and look after our people abroad, the most important feature of our diplomatic services is the economic aspect of their work and their interest in developing trade with this country.  The House is entitled to know from the Taoiseach what is being done at present in the development of trade with this country. When we bear in mind the difficulties that have been outlined by the Minister for Industry and Commerce with regard to foreign exchange in the future and the figures he has given of our very substantial adverse trade balance at present and the gap between imports and exports which he anticipates will widen because of the additional imports that will be available when more goods come on the market, it must be considered a very important matter.  The House is entitled to get very full information as to what is being done at present with regard to trade development, of the opportunities that are available and as to the policy that the Taoiseach proposes to pursue in future. World trade is in a very fluid condition and most countries are entering into trade agreements and arrangements to consolidate trade and to effect the security and stability which is essential to trade development and expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary that we should have got no information whatever on such an important matter from the Taoiseach.  I hope that when he is winding up the debate he will avail of the opportunity to give the House full and frank information on what he envisages as being in the best interest of the country so far as trade development <Col N="64" /> is concerned.  Trade development is a very vital matter.</P>

      <P>We are discussing the diplomatic service and I want to know from the Taoiseach what our diplomats abroad are doing and I suggest that on this Vote we are entitled to full information on that matter.  There is one other question I want to ask the Taoiseach.  He told the House that we are now members of a number of international organisations.  I am particularly interested in the work of the Food and Agriculture Organisation. We became a member of that organisation last year at Copenhagen and I was struck by the fact that the delegation we sent there was composed of civil servants with the exception of the Minister.  Ours was the only country as far as I know that was represented in that way and I want to ask the Taoiseach is it his intention to pursue that in future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach need not shake his head.  He probably does not know how Great Britain was represented last year.  The leader of the British delegation was the President of the National Farmers' Union of Great Britain, Mr. James Turner. Evidently the Taoiseach and his Government think there are no farmers here capable of representing agricultural interests and that the only people fit to speak for the primary interests of this country are the civil servants. When I say that, I do not want to reflect on civil servants in the least; but I want to suggest that a bureaucratic <Col N="65" /> organisation of that sort is not the right way to represent this country abroad, and that the interests involved and that would be served by this international organisation ought to be represented.</P>
      <P>I submit to the Taoiseach that it is quite possible to find farmers capable of speaking here on agricultural matters in the international sense and I object very strongly and resent that the Government have adopted the policy of sending civil servants instead. There is no excuse for that, as no other country is adopting that policy.  I feel it is a reflection on the people who represent the primary industry.  They ought to be encouraged to exchange views with other countries.  It is lack of appreciation of what other countries are doing that has created a good deal of the stagnation attached to agriculture here.  Evidently the Taoiseach wants to encourage that sort of thing and wants to suggest to Parliament and to the country that the only people qualified to speak for agriculture are the people in Merrion Street.  I want an assurance from the Taoiseach that that policy is going to be changed in the future, not merely with regard to the Food and Agriculture Organisation but with regard to other international organisations as well of which we are members.  The people of this country are the people best qualified to speak on behalf of this country in international assemblies.  I do not object to civil servants acting in an advisory capacity&mdash;they must be there in an advisory capacity&mdash;but in an advisory capacity only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In future, when we are sending delegations to these international organisations and paying money for affiliation and for the expenses of such delegations, they ought to be properly constituted.  The Government ought to encourage our people to take an interest in these international organisations, and we certainly will not develop the interest, so far as the country as a whole is concerned, by sending civil servants.  The Taoiseach may appear to be heated about it.  I think it is a most reasonable request and it is something on which I would expect his co-operation.  We are supposed <Col N="66" /> to be a democratic country.  If we are, let us be represented in a democratic way.</P>

      <P>Throughout this debate a good deal has been said on Partition, and I would like to join with Deputy Norton in making a very strong appeal to the Government to give this very important matter more attention than they have given it in the past. During our 25 years of native government no practical steps were taken, in my opinion, to end Partition.  The tactics carried on in the South by the Taoiseach and in the North by the Premiers of the Northern Parliament such as Mr. Andrews and Sir Basil Brooke have resulted in Basil Brooke and Andrews keeping de Valera in power and de Valera keeping them in power.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach.  They are playing into each other's hands. One will shout: &ldquo;The Border must go&rdquo;, and will have the whole South of Ireland behind him; Basil Brooke will shout: &ldquo;No surrender; the Border must remain&rdquo;, and will have the whole Six Counties behind him; and in that way they are keeping each other in power.  It serves the Fianna Fáil Party and the Taoiseach to have the Border there, as otherwise the last trump card of the Party would be played out.  Despite the fact that the Taoiseach has found so many trump cards in the last 15 or 16 years for election purposes to attract the support of the majority of the people, I believe that all his trump cards are not played, that he still has to throw out the trump card of Partition.  Any Irishman can see that no serious effort has been made in regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hearing Deputies suggesting how the problem could be approached, I think there is only one way of approaching it, that is, the Six Counties are ours and no more about it; we are entitled to them and we should pass England, the British Government or the Unionist Government of the North or anyone else, no compliment, nor should we pass any remarks good, bad or indifferent as to whether it pleases or <Col N="67" /> satisfies those people.  The Six Counties belong to us and as far as having those Six Counties under the same administration as ourselves I believe the present Government have made no effort to bring about such a state of affairs.  One could ask the simple question as to what attraction there is in the Twenty-Six Counties for the people of the Six Counties to throw in their lot with us.  I say here in this House, with a very deep sense of regret, that the ordinary rank and file of Northern Ireland, the workers or the business people, would be insane and downright lunatics to throw in their lot with the Twenty-Six Counties at the present time, as our standard of living is much lower than theirs.</P>
    <P>There is only one way these people can be attracted and that is by their having something to get that they have not got from the Six County Government. Our working-class people, road workers and agricultural workers, are only in receipt of 50/- a week, but in the Six Counties they are getting £3; our old age pensioners get only 12/6 but across the Border they get 22/6. If we could raise the standard of living in the Twenty-Six Counties by even 1/- more than the standard in the Six Counties, there would be no question of any steps being taken to bring the Six Counties in with us, as they would certainly come here to the improved conditions.  While our standard is as low as it is, there is no hope of the ordinary rank and file in the Six Counties throwing in their lot with us here in Southern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have visited the City of Belfast and the City of Derry and have taken part in election campaigns in the North and I am satisfied that, when the people of Northern Ireland have their choice, they do not usually follow on the side where there is the loudest handclap, but follow the policy where there is a shilling better in wages or standard of living, and if we can give them that shilling more in the Twenty-Six Counties the North will throw in its lot with us.  When that day comes, it will be very easy to deal with the whole question of Partition, as we will have the people of Northern Ireland behind us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="68" /> From the way in which the Taoiseach has handled the Partition problem, I say that if there is any champion of Northern Unionism anxious to hold on to Partition or British rule and administration in Northern Ireland their greatest champion has been the Taoiseach.  He has done everything humanly possible to make the Border a permanent fixture.  He has gone even so far as to make public statements to the effect that we are now a republic, that we have achieved what we have been out to achieve in the past and that our State is an independent republic.  That is downright &ldquo;tripe&rdquo;. There is no sane person in the country who believes we are a republic.  While a certain section of our people believes we are a republic because the Taoiseach says we are, we are by no means a republic.  If we are a republic to-day, we were a republic a week after the Treaty was signed. A republic, in my view, means complete national independence, economic freedom for the masses of our people and a State in which Irish ideals and Irish cultural traditions are fostered, and certainly the republic about which the Taoiseach speaks from time to time is by no means in accordance with the republic which Wolfe Tone and many others who have gone before us fought to secure.</P>
    <P>As one ordinary citizen, I can safely say that I owe no allegiance to King, President or Taoiseach, and, as an Irishman, I feel very disgusted by the very small effort made, not only by this Government but by previous native Governments, to bring about a satisfactory ending of Partition.  The Taoiseach may say that, so far as the King of England is concerned, he has no jurisdiction and no say whatever with regard to our administration, but the King of England has some functions, be they small or great, with regard to our Ministers abroad and the Ministers of other countries who are accredited to this nation.  I always thought it strange that, when foreign Ministers come to this country, they present their credentials to the Taoiseach as Minister for External Affairs.  I thought the proper course would be that they would present their credentials to the Head of the State. <Col N="69" /> Why should the President be ignored? We have a President who makes appearances at various ceremonies or big social functions, but when it comes to a question of recognition by foreign missions, he is completely ignored, and I should be glad to hear the Taoiseach explain why all foreign countries ignore the President.  The President is recognised in no part of the world except the Twenty-Six Counties, and there only by a small section of the people because of his political record.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to this country's application for admission to the United Nations Organisation.  I believe that when the door was slammed in the face of the Irish Government, the proper thing to have done was to walk politely away and withdraw the application.  On the occasion of the debate on the question whether or not we should join that organisation, I said that I believed it would fail as the League of Nations had failed.  The Government, in applying for admission to that organisation, were taking a very serious step, because the vast majority of our people were unaware of and unfamiliar with the charter of the United Nations Organisation.  I should like to ask the Taoiseach what percentage of our people knew anything about that organisation or had read its charter?</P>
    <P>Before any question of making an application for admission, the majority of our people should have been instructed and given some knowledge about the organisation.  Copies of the charter should have been provided in large numbers for each household, so that people would know what this country was joining and would know that, in accordance with the charter, we were handing over to the Security Council the whole of our military activities, and agreeing that, if war came in future, that Security Council should determine what part of the world our Army should be sent to.  If that had been explained to our people, I believe that the vast majority would strongly protest against our Army being sent to fight on European or any other battlefields.  We have enough to do in defending our own shores, and, if necessary, fighting for our lost territory, without participating in battles <Col N="70" /> which are of very little concern to us or to our liberties.</P>
    <P>The Bishop of Killaloe, the Most Reverend Dr. Fogarty, one of the most outstanding Churchmen of to-day, in an address some time ago, said he was delighted that Ireland's application for admission was rejected because the United Nations Organisation was bad company.  I agree with that statement, and I urge on the Government that the step they should take is to withdraw completely their application for admission. The Taoiseach, in the course of his remarks on the occasion of the debate with regard to that application for admission, made no reference to the fact that, although all the arrangements for bringing about world peace were set out in the charter, that charter, which was designed to bring about peace and harmony amongst the nations of the world, never placed its deliberations under the protection of Almighty God.  The name of God, the King of Kings, is never once mentioned in that charter, although peace and harmony amongst all peoples and nations cannot be brought about unless the efforts to that end are placed under God's protection.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan bitterly criticised the literature circulated by the Connolly Commemoration Committee in the United States, and suggested that the radio should be used in order to make known to the world our case for the ending of Partition.  Surely he has sufficient commonsense and intelligence to know that the radio here is used solely as a machine for the Fianna Fáil Party and that the people of America and England will get only one side&mdash;that we are a republic and well satisfied with our position.  He has been a member of the House for the past 15 years and he should know that the radio is controlled and administered for one purpose only&mdash;the promotion of Fianna Fáil policy.  If the Deputy wants proof of that statement, he has merely to listen to the news from Radio Éireann relating to the debates in the Dáil when he will find that only one side is given.</P>

      <P>I have read the circular and booklet to which Deputy Cogan refers.  I do not know who the authors are and I do not know who is responsible for the compilation of the literature.  I do not know whether they are Irishmen or whether they are Irish-Americans.  I do not know whether it is a Catholic organisation or whether it is a group of Communists. From inquiries I have made I have learned, however, that there is quite a good communistic trend behind the literature that has been circulated from this committee in America. Nevertheless, I am in complete disagreement with Deputy Cogan, the reason being that I have read the literature very closely and carefully and I regret to say that every word contained in it is quite true.  Deputy Cogan made reference to an exchange which occurred in this House between Deputy Donnellan and the Minister for Justice to which very good publicity was given in this literature.  I was in the House during the exchange in question. As a matter of fact my own name and the names of many members of this House are included in that literature which, I may say, has been completely compiled from the official records of this House, word for word. It deals more closely, however, with the question of Partition and the treatment of republicans.  I feel a deep sense of regret that it should be left in the power of any outside body to print the literature that has been printed.  I am sorry to say our Government have left it in the power of outsiders to print the leaflets and the literature that have been printed and circulated in the United States.  However, I must say that everything in <Col N="72" /> that literature is quite true and that the material has been taken from the Official Reports of the debates in this House.  The Deputy also&mdash;I do not know whether he was serious or not&mdash;appealed to all those who are interested in foreign affairs to read Count Ciano's diary which is at present being published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> because, in his opinion, we would then learn something about criminal conspiracy, public trickery and so on. It would be very interesting if, at some future time, the Taoiseach's diary were published.  There we would have criminal conspiracy &mdash; far more enlightening to our people, and an eye-opener to some of his followers to-day. I believe that if this country has the experience of one traitor that the greatest traitor we have had at all times is the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>There always seems to be an air of unreality about this question of external affairs.

      <P>Various speakers have mentioned the question of Partition.  Partition is a major Irish tragedy.

      <P>I doubt very much the disinterestedness of their motives.  At any rate, it does remain certain that those people do not help the situation.  I think many people are apt to forget, when they are talking about Partition, that Partition arises from the wish of a certain number of people in the North of Ireland and that no matter how much world opinion is drawn on that unhappy situation the real kernel of it is the attitude of the majority of the people in Northern Ireland.  I do not think the Government here makes any realistic approach to that problem.  I have never seen this country&mdash;Southern Ireland&mdash;trying to adopt a policy that Partition did not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are ways in which it could. There are, perhaps, trade concessions of a major sort that could be made without any harm or hindrance to our own people in the South, but which might facilitate the North and would be an earnest to the people of the North of the sincerity of our wishes.  I believe that it is along the lines of the North coming in willingly that any real solution can be found to this matter. The various people who propose panaceas and put forward schemes for propaganda are, I think, in the long run not really doing the matter any <Col N="76" /> good.  I have talked to many people in the North of Ireland who have said to me that they would like to see Partition done away with, that they would like to see all Ireland united under one Government.  I think it is only by our reliance on the goodwill and the ultimate good sense of people in the North that we shall achieve the end which all sincere Irishmen would like to see brought about.</P>
    <P>I have never heard of any scheme put forward by the Government here as to what I might call a solution for a removal of the danger or uncertainties in which the great industries in the North of Ireland would find themselves if Partition came to an end.  That is a matter which every North of Ireland person mentions when you talk about Partition.  They say: &ldquo;We have our great industries there which depend very largely on markets.  Will those industries be in danger?&rdquo;  When the Government talk about Partition, I should like to see a constructive approach made to that subject.  I should like a constructive attitude to be adopted by many people who pretend, at any rate, that they would like to see Partition done away with.  There is a great deal of humbug talked about it.  There are many people who are deeply sincere in regard to the matter; but there are some people who, I am afraid, are not quite so sincere or they would not talk in the wild and foolish way in which they do, a way which can only make the solution of the problem which we all desire more difficult of attainment.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Cogan mention Count Ciano's diary. He mentioned that it showed up the attitude of dictators.  I must say that it does show up the attitude of dictators.  To my mind, it also showed the pharisaical attitude of this Government during the war years, which, at any rate, in its public utterances pretended to see no difference between one side and the other.  Reading the statements and the happenings recorded by that man, you see what an evil thing the Fascist and Nazi attitude to human life and human dignity really was.  But, I am afraid, we never saw any difference publicly; I think we did privately.</P>

      <P>It certainly does not apply to Deputy Dillon.  Concerning the actual expenditure proposed in this Vote, I see that in a number of places we have chargés d'affaires&mdash;in Switzerland, Sweden, Belgium and Lisbon.  I wonder just why we have a chargé d'affaires in certain countries and not a Minister.  It has been suggested to me that it is because we wish to carry out our representation &ldquo;on the cheap&rdquo;.  I do not know whether that is a fair statement to make concerning our representation abroad; but certainly a chargé d'affaires is paid less than a Minister and keeps up a smaller establishment.  I wonder is the net result one which, in effect, is a waste of money.  In the main, would it be better to do the thing properly and have less representation abroad&mdash;select certain places and keep up a better state; or to do it over a wider area and not spend so much money on it? Nobody wants to see public money wasted.  I do not suggest that it is actually wasted in these cases; I do not think it is.  But I wonder are we under-paying some of our representatives abroad in an effort to cover too wide a field?</P>
      <P>I should like to hear some statement from the Taoiseach concerning the policy behind our representation abroad.  What is our ultimate aim; how far is the appointment of chargés d'affaires a temporary measure; how far is it the considered opinion of the Government that a chargé d'affaires and not a Minister in the various countries is the ultimate aim?  I would welcome a statement concerning these matters.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that I consider the Department of External Affairs one of the best run Departments of this State.  The officials are courteous and efficient and I am sure the representatives abroad do us honour in the posts which they occupy.  I would like to see that in our efforts to save money&mdash;which is a lawful purpose&mdash;we do not find ourselves, in effect, doing the job on the cheap.</P>

      <P>On this occasion there have been repeated complaints, <Col N="78" /> which I heard a few times already, to the effect that in introducing the Estimate, I do not give a survey of foreign affairs generally.  I do not see what purpose would be served by my taking the whole field of world relations and talking about them.  It would be a different matter if there were some particular situation that we could immediately influence.  If there were some particular matter in which action was required by this State, I certainly would deal with it in introducing the Estimate.  It is said that a practice of the kind suggested is adopted in other countries.  I am not aware of it.  When foreign Ministers bring in their Estimates in countries that have a democratic organisation like ours, they deal with the matters that immediately and directly concern the State, and it is only in so far as their own State is involved that they give a general survey.  In the case of Britain, for example, with its wide-flung contacts, it is natural that the Minister, in introducing his Estimate, should deal with the many problems that immediately affect Great Britain.  It would be ridiculous for us to proceed on the same lines.  Whenever a matter that immediately and directly concerns us has to be dealt with, and it is a new matter not dealt with already, I would naturally refer to it when introducing the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two subjects, closely related, which have occupied a considerable portion of the time taken by Deputies in this debate.  One is Partition and the other is our relations with States of the British Commonwealth. With regard to Partition, I think that everybody in the country knows what the Government's attitude is&mdash;that we think that the partition of our country was a cruel wrong, and that we believe that, as long as Partition persists, it will make difficulties for each part of Ireland and for both in its relations with Britain. It makes it difficult for us here because, when there is a wrong crying out to be righted, you will have people asking themselves how it can be righted; and seeing the difficulties of righting it in any other way, you will have people thinking of the methods of force.  That is equally true for the other portion of <Col N="79" /> this country.  The result is that it involves the Governments in two parts of the country in problems of an extremely difficult kind, and these problems become much more serious when there is a crisis.  It is in times of crisis that those who think that force is the remedy will think of using the methods of force.</P>
    <P>Partition, therefore, is a very serious matter for the two parts of our country. It is also serious in its consequences with respect to what was referred to here as the traffic across the Border.  We have smuggling, we have attitudes of mind developing towards law and towards the rights of the community, and these attitudes of mind are, without a doubt, damaging generally to the morale of the country as a whole.  It affects also the relations between our country and Britain. That has been pointed out by other speakers, who have indicated quite clearly their conviction&mdash;which must be the conviction of anybody who seriously considers the problem&mdash;that so long as Partition persists, the relations which people of goodwill desire to exist between the peoples of these two neighbouring isles cannot exist.  The goodwill cannot, at any rate, be made fruitful.</P>
    <P>How to deal with Partition has been discussed, and some of the speakers have said that this is a matter which can be dealt with only by dealing directly with our fellow-countrymen in the separated Six Counties.  I am afraid there is something more to it than that.  In order to end this, you will have to get concurrence of wills between three parties&mdash;we here who represent the people of this part of Ireland, those who represent the majority in the separated part of Ireland, and the will of those who are the majority for the time being in the British Parliament.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. It is true, I think, that if there were agreement between the peoples of the two parts of Ireland, British consent to <Col N="80" /> do the things that they would have to do could be secured.  It was in that conviction that, when Mr. Lloyd George first communicated with me as President of the Republic back in 1921. I tried to have a conference here between ourselves and the representatives of those who were Unionists.  My invitation to them was based on the view that, if we here in Ireland could come to an agreement, the British could hardly dare to refuse to honour it.  I did not succeed in getting the representatives of the Six Counties to meet us at the time.  I did have a meeting with representative unionists in this part of Ireland and we had no difficulty in getting agreement upon the immediate things with which we were dealing.  But I was unable to secure the wider conference.  Believing that the position is as I have said, and wishing to make it quite clear that it was so, when we had negotiations with Britain in 1938 I tried to secure from the British Government at that time a declaration to that effect, but I could not get any declaration at the time that I considered to be of value.</P>
      <P>I think that it would make for a solution of this problem if at the present time the British Government would make a simple declaration to the effect that they were desirous of seeing Partition brought to an end, that they would do anything that they could to help to bring it to an end, and that if agreement was reached here in Ireland, there would be no hesitation on their part in giving effect to the agreement.  Until, however, a declaration of that sort is forthcoming, we can only deal with this problem on the basis that there are three parties, the concurrence of whose wills will have to be brought about before Partition can be ended.  That does not mean that I at all differ from Deputy Morrissey in the view that if we can get first a concurrence of wills between our people here and in the North, the other would follow.</P>

      <P>I do not know, but I should like to see the ground cleared by removing whatever element of doubt there might be on the matter.  The <Col N="81" /> question of Partition is not a new one &mdash;at least as far as I am concerned, and probably as far as most of the older people in the House are concerned. As far as I am concerned, I can say that it was the problem of Partition which first brought me into polities.  It was when I realised that force was going to be employed to prevent effect being given to a decision which had been won in Britain as the result of 50 years of labour, that I felt that the time had come when the other method would have to be used.  I think I can say that it was that realisation that first determined me to join the Volunteers and which has largely determined every step I have taken in Irish politics since.  It was mainly on Partition that I broke with Lloyd George in our conversations; it was because, amongst other things in the Treaty, it seemed that Partition was still being provided for, that I felt that the Treaty was objectionable.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the first time I have said it and it is true.  The problem of Partition is a difficult one to solve.  As was indicated by other Deputies who have spoken, there are only two ways of solving it.  One is by force and the other is by the method of persuasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That means that there is only one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On that particular matter, I expressed my opinion back in 1921.  I believe that it cannot be solved, in any circumstances that we can now see, by force, and that if it were solved by force, it would leave a situation behind it which would mean that this State would be in an unstable position.  Great world changes can take place.  I am not talking about enormous changes; I am only talking about <Col N="82" /> what one can reasonably foresee and hope for; and, in my view, a solution by force would leave this country in an unstable and unhappy position.  I therefore agree with Deputy Morrissey in ruling that out as far as we are concerned.</P>
      <P>There remains then the policy of persuasion. If you are going to persuade people that a certain situation should be changed, what you have got to do is to prove that it is wrong in its essence, and that there are evil consequences flowing from it.  I take it, therefore, that in the case of Partition there are two bases on which you must work.  The first is to show that it is unjust and the second that it leads to evil results.  Apart altogether from the fundamental injustice of cutting up an old nation like ours arbitrarily into two parts, the way in which it was done was wrong.  The general view that is spread abroad by those who want to maintain Partition is that there is something like a homogeneous community in the Six Counties, that they are, so to speak, a separate nation, entitled to that self-determination which was asserted to be the right of all nations during the first world war.  I think everybody who understood the term at that time will admit that this right of self-determination was meant to apply to historical entities, entities that were entitled to be regarded as nations, that had the attributes and characteristics of nations.  It was to entities of that sort that the right to determine how they were to be governed was to be conceded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The term could have no application to a portion of a nation arbitrarily cut off and its use in this case was only a pretence designed to cover the real intention of securing for the time being permanence of power in that area for a minority political group in the nation as a whole.  Nobody could say, I think, that the principle of self-determination was ever intended to apply in such a case.  The Six Counties had no historical basis whatever as a unit.  To disguise that they call them Ulster.  Of course, everybody knows they are not Ulster.  Ulster was not taken because, in the nine counties of Ulster, even at the time when Partition <Col N="83" /> was being considered, there was a majority, a small majority it is true, against it.  It was believed that if the nine counties were taken it would place the minority whose interests Partition was designed to serve in a very precarious position, and on that account the historic Province of Ulster, as a whole, was not cut off but was itself partitioned.</P>
    <P>On what basis did they proceed to cut off portion of the province?  I think Sir Edward Carson, or Lord Carson&mdash;I am not sure of his title at the time&mdash;said that land grabbing was an old human failing and that they proposed to grab as much of the land of Ulster as they might be able to hold. It was on that principle of grabbing as much as they thought they could hold, that six counties of Ulster were cut off but not the whole nine.  Even if one were to admit that preponderance of opinion in a specific area in favour of one particular view would be any justification whatever for partitioning an ancient nation, that justification would apply only to an area of approximately two counties around Belfast.</P>
    <P>But, in addition, four other counties were cut off so that to-day you could take the four others, except Down and Antrim, as a block and say that that block of four by a majority desired not to be subject to the Parliament of the Six Counties, that it was simply by coercion that they were part of the area cut off and that they desired to be attached and to belong to the rest of this country. Therefore, even if you were to admit the principle of self-determination in the extreme form of allowing it to be used to cut off politically dissenting minorities, it is only two counties that that could apply to.  There is no justification even on that basis for cutting off the six.  Therefore, on any basis whatever, the cutting off of six of our Ulster counties cannot be justified.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken of the disadvantages and of the evils that follow from that situation, and I do not think it is necessary to go into them further. I hold that the first thing that we have got to do is to make clear how wrong is the whole basis of Partition so that <Col N="84" /> fair-minded men, and particularly those who are immediately concerned, can understand the problem, and not be confused by the use of a name like Ulster or by suggestions about self-determination or any other phrases intended to hide away the real facts.</P>
    <P>Now what can we do, apart from making the position clear to everybody? I repeat&mdash;I regard it of considerable importance that we should make the position clear.  I believe it ought to be made clear in so far as we can do it to the people of Britain, and I think it ought to be made clear in so far as we can do it to the people of the United States of America.  I believe that the public opinion of these two countries is of importance in settling this problem, and I think it is right that we should do what we can to inform that public opinion. But apart from making the facts of the position clear, which is helpful from every point of view, what can we do ourselves?  The attitude that I have always taken is that we ought ourselves to go as far as we reasonably can go to meet the views of the people in the Six Counties.  We could, of course, just abandon our own views. No one will expect us to do that.  We must not forget that the people down here have their views which they hold just as strongly as the people in the Six Counties hold theirs, and that there are certain things which they are not prepared to sacrifice.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear repeated here arguments which I heard put forward by Mr. MacDermot when he was a Senator, that the name &ldquo;Republic&rdquo; here&mdash;the mere mention of it&mdash;is a deterrent; that therefore we ought not to mention it; and that the fact that we try to get our people here to use Irish, and to keep it as our aim to restore the Irish language as the spoken language of the people of this country, is also a deterrent.  It is, I suppose, true to a certain extent that the people in the North have not the same interest in the Irish language that we have, and that the majority of them there are not interested in having a republic.  But the people in this part of Ireland are.  I do not see why the people in this part of Ireland should sacrifice ideals which they hold dear&mdash;completely <Col N="85" /> sacrifice those ideals in order to meet the views of people whose position fundamentally is not as just or as right as our position is.  I have said, however, that we ought to go as far as we can.  In other words, we ought to go to the point at which we would have the greatest possible measure of agreement here and there. I do not think that we would have advanced very far if, in order to get agreement in the North, we were to ignore the views of the majority of our people down here.  How far, then, are we to go?  There are obviously limits. What are they?  I could not help thinking of this when I listened to Deputy Coogan speaking.  May I say that on the constitutional position I have nothing whatever to say against his speech except that I do not agree with him on certain points of interpretation. When he came, however, to the question of historical differences and the question of religion I naturally asked myself: &ldquo;Well, if they object to our religion, are we to change our religion, too?&rdquo;  Surely that ought to be proof in itself, the moment you think about it, that there are distances which the people down here will not go to meet the views of the people in the North.</P>
    <P>As a result of the elections in 1918 and 1919, a republic was declared here by the representatives of the majority of the people, and that was maintained. In 1921, there was another general election.  Those who went forward in the 1921 election went forward as candidates pledged to maintain the existing republic, and it was on that basis they were elected.  There was, therefore, a republic here in 1921. The majority of our people proved they desired that form of government.  The Treaty came.  I am not going to go into that further than to say that I think it will be admitted by anyone who reads the debates at the time that it was accepted only under the threat of force.</P>

I believe that the Constitution as we have it&mdash;which makes all the provisions that were indicated by Deputy Coogan&mdash;as well as our association with the States of the British Commonwealth in the form in which it is at the moment, is the farthest that you can go to meet the views in the North and at the same time get agreement here.

The only people who do not understand it are the people who do not want to understand it&mdash;the people who want to create political confusion.  If there is any deception in the matter it is not deception on our part but deception on the part of those who, in the face of clear facts will still&mdash;because the situation is a bit delicate&mdash;try to create confusion about it.</P>

      <P>We hear people talking about living a lie.  I remember the time when we had a lot of talk about Constitutional fictions.  I wonder what the word &ldquo;fiction&rdquo; means in this context? Now, in order that there would be no Constitutional fictions, we got rid of every kind of fictional form in our Constitution.  We got rid of them in 1936, before we did anything else.  We wiped out the King and got rid of the Governor-General in every single Article of the Constitution, so much so that from the opposite benches it was <Col N="91" /> said: &ldquo;You have no King in the Constitution; you have a republican Constitution.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only the kind of parrot phrase to which the people opposite attach value.  The position is that we came in here and we changed a Constitution which was monarchical in every feature of it.  We got rid of these in the space of 24 or 48 hours, in 1936, on a certain historic occasion. But, we had to proceed cautiously and carefully.  For example, I did not want the position created in which we would have to get all our representatives reaccredited. Consequently, in the External Relations Act, we provided for the use of the King by the Executive Government of the day in so far as it was prepared to use it, for such purposes as it was prepared to use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a very different position from the position ten days before&mdash;a very different position. It meant that if at any time the Government here&mdash;representing the majority in Parliament, representing the majority of the Irish people desired not to use that machinery they need not do it.  If at any time it did not serve the purpose which it was intended to serve it could be got rid of.  What was the purpose it was intended to serve?  It was intended to serve the purpose of keeping up an association and that association with the State of the British Commonwealth was considered by us as desirable in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Why are the boys not shouting now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was considered desirable, because there was another problem that remained to be solved and because it represented a distance which I thought our people might go towards meeting the sentiment of the people of the Six Counties.  It provided a method through which, if looking at the matter from a practical <Col N="92" /> point of view, our people considered that there was material advantage in maintaining an association, the association could be maintained.</P>
      <P>We have worked on that basis.  It is pretended that foreign representatives and foreign nations do not know what the position is.  They know perfectly well what the position is.  There is no deception of any kind.  In our Constitution it is set out quite clearly that the executive power in the State is vested in the Government of the day, subject, of course, to Parliament.  It is expressly provided in the Constitution that&mdash;subject all the time to Parliament&mdash;it is the Government of the day that is the supreme authority in the executive domain, whether it is a question of internal affairs or external affairs.  As regards internal affairs, the Constitution sets out the respects in which the President of the State is to be the organ through which that executive power is finally manifested or put into action; and it is clearly set out and there is no constitutional fiction about it, that it is the Government here that has all the executive authority, both internally and externally, and that that is so as regards everything of an executive character that is done internally and externally, with one or two very small exceptions which are powers reserved to the President, such as the power of giving a dissolution or refusing it in certain circumstances. All the other executive functions of the State are discharged either directly by the Government or on the authority of the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of the position now.  I say that in our Constitution there is no doubt whatever about it.  The position of the Government as the chief executive authority is made perfectly clear, and the organs by which the executive authority of the Government expresses itself are indicated, first of all, as far as the Constitution is concerned, by the powers which are given to the President and then by the power that is given to the Government, to use for accrediting purpose&mdash;at its discretion <Col N="93" /> for so long as they desire to use that method&mdash;the King, that is, the King of the several States of the British Commonwealth.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter a pin.  I am talking about the position at present.  The difference between the former position and what we have now is the difference between a lie and the truth.  In the old Constitution there were powers &ldquo;vested in the King.&rdquo; Where was the lie and where was the truth?  We have no fictions of any kind&mdash;that is the difference between our Constitutions.  Instead of having the kind of lying and deception which was referred to here, we have made the position far more explicit&mdash;so explicit are we that even when the President performs the functions which he carries out, on the advice of the Government, it is written down on the face of the document that he is acting on the advice of the Government.  There is no fiction of any kind&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>And no change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;in regard to our Constitution.  It has been suggested here that we might give more powers to the President.  I remember well that, when the Constitution was going through, that question was debated. It was argued in the debate that the President was going to be a dictator, that he had so much power that he would be a dictator.  Of course, that was absurd; it was just another convenient deception to use at the time. The Legislature can always add to the powers of the President, provided only that the extra powers would be exercised on the advice of the Government. For instance, if the method which we have so far used for indicating our association with the States of the British Commonwealth should not fulfill its purpose, if it is considered that it is not going to fulfill its purpose, it is very easy, if we wish to do so, to transfer these powers to the President by an Act of this Legislature.  It is a question even whether you could not do it without an Act of the Legislature.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Simply by giving him a letter to sign, on the authority of the Government.  The Government is the authority in the Constitution by which our external affairs are conducted and it is on their authority, no matter what instrument is used, that foreign representatives are accredited.  The letters of credence show even on their very face, that it is on that authority that they are issued.  Just as one person's signature can be used, so another person's signature can be used.  Naturally, if you wanted to have the procedure established more explicitly, you would do it by an Act of this Legislature, but it is questionable whether that would be necessary.  At the moment it seems to me that all that is necessary is that what is done should be covered by the authority of the Government and be accepted by the foreign State concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If then, at any time, it is considered desirable to make that change, it can be done.  It can be done very readily in a variety of ways.  I have not deemed it desirable to change the procedure, certainly not at the present time.  I think that it should be left there as a sort of external symbol, so to speak, of our association, but I would seriously consider whether it was desirable or not to change it if I thought that it was creating confusion in the minds of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>And if I thought that those who were desirous of creating confusion were going to succeed to such an extent that the confusion would have serious results.  I do not believe that is so at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as it rests with Deputy Dillon and the others who pretend that they have a horror of living a lie and are really only trying to create a false impression, I know that confusion will be created.  I am depending, however, on the common sense of our people, on the same sort of common sense as Deputy Cafferky <Col N="95" /> showed when he said that he was not being deceived, that he was able to read the Constitution and the relevant Acts.  I believe that our people, seeing how the position has developed and seeing what happens, are not going to be deceived.</P>
      <P>It is quite possible, of course, that the association could be put on another basis, which would not involve such a procedure at all.  But, at any rate, for the moment, the arrangement serves a useful purpose from the point of view of the interests of our country. It does enable an association to be maintained which, I think, is valuable both materially and from the point of view of the ending of Partition.  I have on previous occasions spoken of the reasons for the association and its value, so far as we are concerned, and I do not think it is necessary to repeat them now.  I think I have dealt fairly fully with Partition and the more or less related question of the nature of our association with the States of the British Commonwealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some other matters of a less important character were raised to which I should perhaps refer.  One of these was the question what plan we had with regard to our representation abroad.  We have an Ambassador, Ministers, High Commissioners and Chargés d'Affaires, and reference was made to the variety of titles.  Well, in the case of other countries, there is a similar variety.  As regards our representatives in States of the British Commonwealth to whom Deputy McGilligan referred particularly, we think that the present position is wrong.  It means that our representatives in the States of the British Commonwealth and vice versa occupy as High Commissioners a position inferior to that of the representatives of other countries.  The Canadian Government agree&mdash;I do not know about the others &mdash;that the position is anomalous. Logically, instead of taking a lower rank, these officers, as representing States which are associated, ought to have the highest place of all and ought to be of at least ambassadorial rank. I believe there will be development in <Col N="96" /> that direction.  Already we have here a Representative of the British Government and we have a Representative in Australia.  These things cannot be done by unilateral action however&mdash; they have to be done by negotiation and agreement with the other States concerned.  But when we meet these other States, so far as we have influence, our influence will be used to see that the representatives here of the Commonwealth, and our representatives in those countries, will take precedence and not be put behind the representatives of the other countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were to try to reply to everything that crosses the Deputy's mind, it would take me a long time.  They might be of Ministerial rank, and Ambassadors, too.  With regard to our having posts headed by Chargés d'Affaires, that is not purely a matter of money as Deputy Dockrell suggested; it is also a matter of what the other countries concerned decide to do.  Our attitude generally is that whatever the rank of the envoy sent by other countries, we reciprocate by sending a representative of equivalent rank.  That is one way in which we may come to have a Chargé d'Affaires. We may also approach it from our own point of view&mdash;from the point of view of the amount and character of the work which requires to be done and of the extent of our interests in the country concerned.  Every Deputy will admit, I think, that our interests in all countries are not the same, and that our interests in the United States, for example, or in Britain, or Canada, or Australia, are very different from our interests in other countries.  Therefore, I do not think there is anything to be surprised at, in the fact that we have Ambassadors, Ministers and <Col N="97" /> Chargés d'Affaires.  That is true of most countries.  The general tendency at present, of course, is to go up the scale. Many countries are tending to give up Ministers and to make their representatives Ambassadors.  I suppose each country is anxious, when questions of precedence and the like arise, that its representative will not be classed behind those of other countries.</P>
      <P>I was asked some questions about the provision for cultural relations with other countries and about what was intended to be done in connection with it. I think I explained in general terms that the intention was to get a committee of people interested in cultural relations who would have a knowledge of our position abroad and the need there might be for making ourselves better known to other countries and who would be available to examine proposals made with that object.  Countries larger than this country, and with more varied means of getting their outlook and the facts of their position known, have adopted this method, and we have been charged with being remiss in not having, in respect of the United States and other countries, made more use of the opportunities of presenting the cultural and other facts about this country.</P>
      <P>That brings me to Deputy Dillon's attack upon the broadcasting service. It was very interesting to find that, at the time Deputy Dillon was attacking us and misrepresenting what the Minister for Minister for Posts and Telegraphs had said with regard to our beaming programmes to the United States, the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Marshall, was objecting very strongly to the curtailment of the funds to be made available to his Department for the purpose of explaining America to the world.  I do not think there can be any objection to our explaining ourselves and doing what we can to undo the misrepresentations which have been spread about us.  Like every good thing, it can be abused.  No doubt there could be abuse by us, just as there could be abuse by the United States or Britain of their radio powers.  But I do not think any such abuse will take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was very wrong to try to <Col N="98" /> stir up the antipathy there is in certain sections against us and our people.  I think it was quite wrong for a representative here to lend himself to a campaign of that sort.  It was purely hypothetical&mdash;no single concrete case of what he suggested could be pointed to&mdash;but, even though it was hypothetical, the suggestion was quite good enough to make ammunition for those who want material to use against us and our people.  I was in the United States and I know the position there. I know perfectly well that our people are well able to stand up to the suggestion that they are more Irish than American.  They have proved themselves, in all their history, as being the most loyal of the various stocks which have come into that country, and they are not in a position in which they have to bow their heads because somebody shouts out that they are hyphenated Americans.  That was tried before by very powerful people, but it did not work.</P>

I do not know that Mr. Ziff is a Communist and I do not believe he is a Communist.  I believe he is a Zionist who is interested in Palestine as the national home for the Jews&mdash;a subject which is not new to me, but which I know about back since the time of the Balfour Declara-body&mdash;no <Col N="101" /> tion.  Is it suggested because Mr. Ziff, representing that cause, links up with certain other people in the United States, that somehow or other I am responsible for that?  I was never consulted on the matter, nor was my approval necessary in any way whatsoever. What they do as citizens of the United States is their own business. If they do something of which a large section of our people in the United States do not approve, then as members of the community; as citizens of the United States, the objecting section will make their opposition felt.  I do not know that Mr. Ziff is a Communist. I have been told&mdash;I have not seen it, but I have been told&mdash;that in fact he has repudiated any such suggestion.</P>

I can <Col N="102" /> not go into this matter now, because it is at present in process of judicial determination.  The other matter is the question of jurisdiction over the Lough. The same thing would apply to Carling-ford Lough.  There has been, on this matter, an old difference of opinion between Great Britain and ourselves, and we have not been able to resolve it.  It is ultimately associated with the whole question of Partition.

      <P>Deputy Dillon was good enough to accede to my request to postpone the question about Australia until I got the information.  I was anxious to get the exact information and I have it here.  It is an answer that was given in the Australian Parliament to a question on the 26th March, 1947, as to why the Australian delegate in the Security Council abstained from voting on the applications for admission to the United Nations.  Dr. Evatt spoke as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Constitution of the United Nations requires that applications for admission must be made to the Assembly and there must be a reference from the Assembly to the Security Council.  Without the Assembly dealing with the matter at all, the Security Council, two months before the Assembly met, took upon itself the duty of considering applications for membership.  The Australian representative objected to that procedure in the first instance and maintained that objection by declining to vote at that stage.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When explaining in the Security Council on the 29th August why he proposed to abstain from voting, the Australian delegate stated that the Australian Government would be prepared, at what it regarded as the proper time, to support the application of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I explained in connection with the main Estimate that there were two main items here.  There was the question of cultural relations and there was the question of the official handbook. There is also the additional sum for salaries, wages and allowances for representation in the Argentine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a specific matter which I want to raise on this Supplementary Estimate without opening a general debate.  Part of this money is designed for the promotion of what are described as cultural relations with other nations.  One of the purposes, I take it, is to improve relations with members of the Commonwealth of Nations, particularly in regard to the fundamental kind of belief that we all share in the sphere of politics and philosophy.  A number of international Parliamentary associations exist in the world, amongst them the Parliamentary Association to which members of the Parliaments of the Commonwealth belong, to which the Parliaments of those dependencies of the British Empire which are believed to be graduating to independence are allowed to belong, and with which the Congress of the United States of America has, in the last few years, chosen to associate itself, not by direct membership, but by a degree of <Col N="107" /> association which has resulted in meetings in Washington, where they have been the hosts of the members of the Parliamentary Association, and in Canada and Australia, where the Parliamentary Association has entertained the Congress.</P>
      <P>This Parliament belonged to that body for many years, but to maintain its membership it was necessary to make an annual contribution and, inasmuch as the members of this House are none of them rich men, it was not feasible to raise the contribution that is customary in association of this kind by voluntary subscription as it is possible to do in other Parliaments where there are some very rich Deputies or Senators who may contribute liberally to the fund.  And so, in regard to the Inter-Parliamentary Association, which is another body, and certain analogous bodies, the Government made an annual grant, but when the present Government came in, in so far as the Parliamentary Association is concerned, that grant stopped, and we were told the reason it stopped was that the English branch called itself the Empire Parliamentary Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether it was explained to the Taoiseach adequately or not that the general question as to whether the incorporation of the word &ldquo;Empire&rdquo; into such a body is a matter which engaged the attention of many and it was generally agreed, I think, on the part of Canada, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and Great Britain, that it would be more appropriately called The Commonwealth of Nations' Parliamentary Association, but their only difficulty was that Australia called it The Commonwealth of Parliamentary Association, because they spoke to the Commonwealth of Australia, and it was hard to evolve a title without creating confusion.  It is right for the House to know that, in fact, each national association is independent of all its associates but, as a convenient piece of machinery, the secretariat of the British Parliamentary Association had habitually acted as a clearing house for the correspondence between all the various members and <Col N="108" /> for the distribution of a journal which contains broad pictures of the proceedings in each of the Parliaments that belong to it.</P>
    <P>Very largely in order to spare the susceptibilities of the Taoiseach and his colleagues, the Irish branch eliminated the word &ldquo;Empire&rdquo; from the title, pending action by all the other branches in choosing a new form. We said that in common with South Africa and, I think, with Canada, we thought the title &ldquo;Empire Parliamentary Association&rdquo; was manifestly wrong and mistaken because the word &ldquo;Empire&rdquo; now belonged to Great Britain and her imperial dependencies and had no relation at all to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Ireland and, at that time, Newfoundland. Everyone agreed that the title was anachronistic.</P>
    <P>I understand there is to be a meeting of all the associations and, I think, certain representatives of the Congress of the United States in New Zealand this autumn and, I am informed, one of the matters to be brought under consideration there is an amendment of the title.  On the one hand you do not want to slap people across the face in Great Britain to whom the old imperial concept has a certain sentimental attachment.  This is a time when the Empire of India is being deliberately, by the voluntary act of the British Parliament, converted into something very different, and it is not an occasion on which you want to rub peoples' noses in the fact that this is a changing world.</P>
    <P>But they have no feeling about it at all.  The other members of the Commonwealth have no desire to retain it. When the Taoiseach gets up in his hat and says by implication: &ldquo;My heart twitters at the thought of finding some little Imperial haven where I can find refuge,&rdquo; my inclination is to spit in his eye and tell him to behave himself.  At least, I am not an Imperialist abroad and a Gael at home, like some people I know.  The fact is that I believe Deputies on all sides of the House feel the same way about this business.  We are anxious to collaborate in any association of democratic parliaments because we believe that there are forces <Col N="109" /> abroad in the world anxious to destroy Parliamentary democracies and the more independent and sovereign Parliaments associate through their members, the better it is for the Parliamentary system of government and the better it is for the several countries that these Parliaments govern.</P>
    <P>I cannot leave the point without directing the Taoiseach's attention to the fact that the position adopted by him has not even the virtue of consistency, because annually his Government sponsor Estimates in this House for subscriptions to the Imperial Institute of Ethnology, the Imperial Agricultural Research Station, and others.  There are five or seven imperial institutes mentioned by name in the Estimate for Agriculture every year for which we appropriate money to pay our membership fee.  I think the Government are perfectly right to do that.  I do not think anybody regards that as any sort of reflection on the Constitutional status of this country.  What does really matter is that you find there is something useful to be done, something outside the sphere of purely utilitarian considerations, in an association providing opportunities for Englishmen, Irishmen, Australians, Canadians and South Africans to sit down together, talk things over, to meet and to be friendly with one another, even if they can agree about nothing.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach may say: &ldquo;What would the boys say if I were to provide money for an Empire organisation? Leave out the word `Empire' or Deputy So-and-So will go for me. Deputy Ó Briain will go half mad if I ask him to vote for it&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>He is afraid of his life but Deputy Ó Briain votes like a man for the Imperial Institute of Etymology, the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, the Imperial Institute of Agricultural Investigation, the Imperial Institute of this, that and the other, because nobody is so rude as to remind him that he is going to vote for it, but if you remind him, his Gaelic soul rises up like a blazing sun <Col N="110" /> and the Taoiseach says: &ldquo;What am I to do?&rdquo;  The best thing you can do with him is to bring him downstairs and talk to him like an uncle because the only purpose for which this association exists is to promote understanding and goodwill.  I, speaking from personal experience, certify to this House that it does those things, that it has done most useful work in bringing Deputies and Senators of this House into contact with Deputies and Senators of other States in the Commonwealth, to our great mutual advantage. Here I must complain that the Taoiseach is not as always clear and plain as one would desire or as I think a man in his position must be because his Government cannot appropriate a penny for the Empire Parliamentary Association but his colleague the Minister for Local Government you will find sitting in the Empire Association in the Parliament Hall in Westminster drinking tea with other members of the association.  When he goes out one door, Patriot Briscoe is trotting in the other door.  If you go and read the book containing entries of the gentry who have called on this shocking Empire Parliamentary Union, you will find that a good many members of the Taoiseach's Party when they are in London and want some little facility, have no objection to stealing off to the Empire Parliamentary Association.  Of course the boys at home never hear a word about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every time I go to London I go there delighted I am a member of it and I should like every Deputy to be a member of it.  The funny part of it is, if they want to go there with their tails cocked to sing the <i>Soldier's Song</i> they will find delegates from Canada, South Africa and other members of the Commonwealth ready to join in the chorus and to say: &ldquo;It is a most beautiful song.&rdquo;  Far from discovering that they have developed into disloyal sons of Cathleen Ni Houlihan, I venture to prophesy that they will be saying: &ldquo;Look here, poor old England is not as bad as some gentry make out.&rdquo; They will discover to their amazement that the vast majority of reasonable men in this world are very broad-minded, tolerant creatures, not concerned to corrupt the sea-green incorruptibles <Col N="111" /> that come from this country at all.  Therefore, I suggest to the Taoiseach as Minister for External Affairs that it would be a sensible thing to do, that it would be a gesture which would be acknowledged and appreciated not only in Great Britain but throughout the other sovereign Parliaments of the Commonwealth if this farce were put an end to and a modest sum provided which would entitle us to take our place on a footing of equality with all the sovereign Parliaments that belong to this body, to join in its deliberations and in the deliberations that sometimes take place with representatives of the Congress of the United States.  I believe that by doing that, we would not only be doing a material service to our own country but we would be doing the material service and the all-important service of consolidating Parliamentary democracies all over the world in a mutual understanding so that, in the testing times that lie ahead, those who seek to destroy them would find that they have bitten off more than they can chew.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon confined his remarks to what used to be known as the Empire Parliamentary Union.  Deputy Davin knows that they are two different bodies.  I want to support the point of view of Deputy Dillon.  I do so for this reason, mainly, that it is to our interest as a nation to have the closest possible association with the Parliaments of what is known as the Commonwealth both for our own safety and security.  If a crisis arises and if our freedom and our community are threatened it is to those very nations of the Commonwealth that we will have to appeal for support.  We did appeal to them when threatened during the recent crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, when concluding the debate on the main Estimate, and when dealing with the question of external association, said he believed it was in the interests of this community that that association should exist and should be continued, at least for the present, both for material and other reasons. With that I entirely agree.  I want to suggest to the Taoiseach that for the very reasons which he gave it is, in my opinion, important for this nation that it should have close association not only with Britain but with Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.  That is an association from which only good can flow to this country.  I think that if we had closer and more frequent personal contacts between the members of this Parliament and the members of the other Parliaments to which I have referred it would, perhaps, give to their peoples a better understanding of our position here.  That might be helpful not only so far as our external relations are concerned but even on the point on which such emphasis is laid in the <Col N="114" /> discussion on the main Estimate&mdash;the point relating to Partition.  I am not so sure that when we are trying to gather together the forces that may be helpful in putting an end to Partition we might not find in, say, Canada, forces with as much influence not only in Britain but in Northern Ireland as we would probably find anywhere else.</P>
    <P>Deputies, I am sure, recognise that there is no real, genuine reason, no national reason, why we should not be associated with this organisation.  I hope that the Taoiseach will lend an ear to the points put forward by Deputy Dillon.  I want to repeat the Taoiseach's words on the main Estimate that, in my opinion, it is to the advantage of this nation that we should have that association.</P>

      <P>In this Estimate we are asked to vote a sum of £500 for the publication of an official handbook which, I understand, is to be circulated amongst our representatives abroad. I would like to know, since the House is asked to vote money for that purpose, if the handbook will be laid on the Table of the House so that Deputies may have an opportunity of seeing it before it is put into the hands of our representatives abroad.  I think it would be a very grave injustice on the tax-paying sections of the community if this official handbook was simply to be an instruction to our representatives to act and speak as the representatives of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I think that we have the right to see, when we are providing public money for a pamphlet of this kind, that it is of a kind that this House would approve.  I am in complete agreement with Deputy Davin when says that we should not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.  I would like if a similar instruction were issued to people in other countries not to interfere in the internal affairs of this country.  I think that the pamphlet to which Deputy Dillon has referred, and to which I referred earlier, constitutes a gross interference with the internal affairs of this country.</P>

      <P>With the general desire that has been expressed in favour of contacts with the representatives of the States mentioned, I am in full agreement.  I think it is all to the good that these contacts should take place.  It is part of the work of undoing the false propaganda levelled against us in the past.  I believe, as I said earlier, in an association of our State with the States of the British Commonwealth, but the essential point is to have it on a proper basis.  If you have it on the right basis, then you will get the support of your own people, but if you have it on the wrong basis you will get the hostility of a large section. I can honestly say that what I have been striving for during the whole <Col N="116" /> of my period in public life is to get a proper basis established.  I believe that once a proper basis were established the various factors making for good relationship would exercise their natural influence; but I always believed, too, that as long as the basis was wrong, then everything would go in the other direction.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon said that the name &ldquo;Empire&rdquo; on the journal would have been changed if it could have been done without creating confusion between the general body and the association in Australia.  If that is so, how much more anxious ought we to be not to get into a position in which confusion would be created?  I have been striving for the last three or four years to get rid of things precisely because they seemed to create that kind of confusion in other directions.  I have been trying to get the facts made clear so that if we differ we will know what we are differing about.  In this case I am anxious to have the association on the right basis.  I believe that if we succeed in getting the right basis&mdash;I think the editor of the journal knows some of the difficulties&mdash;the rest will be set right.  We have not been a member for a long time.</P>

      <P>We have not paid over a long period of years.  We deferred paying until the matter was made clear, but if the change which the Deputy seemed to indicate is made it is likely that the big difficulty will disappear. It was to avoid further confusion that action has been deferred. Subscriptions have been paid in the past to this body about which Deputy Dillon is concerned because it was felt that some of the work undertaken was of a cultural or scientific kind.  I cannot remember the various considerations which came up on each particular occasion, but I know it was felt if we joined this association we were going to be publicised, so to speak, in what appeared to be a wrong position.  We <Col N="117" /> deferred taking action, therefore, until the foundation is made right, as I hope will happen.  If that is done, I agree that everything is in favour of it.</P>
      <P>I do not know what further explanation Deputy Davin wanted.  I explained the purpose for which this £10,000 was required when I introduced the main Estimate.  I explained that a committee was to be set up which we hoped would commend itself generally to the members of the House, of people who would be associated with cultural matters in this country and, if possible, people whose names carried weight abroad as well as at home and people who were acquainted with conditions in foreign countries. Such a committee could be very helpful. For instance, we hope to have exhibitions of various kinds abroad&mdash; such as book exhibitions, for instance, of which we have had several here.  The activities undertaken would be of that kind.  The main point is that the sum is a grant-in-aid and that no 1d. can be spent by the Minister on his own initiative.  Whatever use is made of this money it must be with the approval of the committee.  The Minister has the power of veto.  If a proposal is made which the Minister in charge of External Affairs does not consider to be in accordance with the general purposes of the sub-head or to serve the country's interests, he can refuse to allow it to be carried out; but he cannot himself carry out a proposal for the expenditure of any of this money against the wishes of this committee.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Cogan misunderstands what the handbook is about.  I may be wrong but he seemed to me to have an idea that it would be a handbook of instructions to our representatives abroad.  I do not know if the Deputy ever saw the Handbook of Saorstát Éireann which was produced here before we came into office.  The edition was quickly exhausted.  He can see a copy in the library, perhaps.  It is a book of that sort.  It is not official instructions.  It is a public document and, having been produced by money voted by the Oireachtas, it will naturally be open <Col N="118" /> for criticism by the members of the House if there is anything that calls for criticism, on my Vote or any other appropriate occasion.  The intention is to bring that book up to date.  It was a valuable book in many respects. It was very well produced.  It was, in fact, a splendid specimen of Irish printing and Irish production and I hope the new book will be of the same quality.  It is considered desirable to have two editions, one a de luxe edition such as the one that was produced before, to be available for representatives abroad to give to important personages, representatives of other countries, and so on, who want to get an idea of the conditions here and some information about our national life.  There will also be a cheaper edition which will be available for wider distribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put this point to the Taoiseach?  At the present moment we have a branch of a Parliamentary Association in existence.  I think I am right in saying that an officer of the Oiraechtas is actually an officer of the branch.  All that we are asking is that the Exchequer should give to such members of this Oireachtas as think it right to maintain that branch the same assistance as the Exchequer gave to the members of the Oireachtas who used to belong to the Inter-Parlimentary Union.  I submit to the Taoiseach that if the existence of the word &ldquo;Empire&rdquo; in the name of the British member of this group of associations is, in the judgement of the Minister for External Affairs, calculated to create an ambiguity, the appropriate method of marking his and his colleagues' apprehension in that regard is to abstain from membership of the Irish branch and to say: &ldquo;Though we approve in principle of this business of members of democratic Parliaments, either within the Commonwealth or wider sphere meeting and talking it over one with the other and though we would be glad to collaborate in this particular one, we do not feel ourselves free to do so unless and until this ambiguity is removed&rdquo;. That keeps the Taoiseach and his Party right on the record and, without being unreasonable, I suppose there is <Col N="119" /> a certain justification for their anxiety in that regard.  In any case, whether it is justifiable or not, men are entitled to their own feelings, whatever they may be.  On the other hand, it gives those members of the House who are outside the Taoiseach's Party and who do not feel that this organisation gives rise to the ambiguity which troubles the Minister's colleagues, our rights in the matter.  We are allowed to belong to the association, the general objectives of which all are agreed are good but the terminology employed to describe it, questionable in the eyes of some.  Surely it will be enough that the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party and his colleagues eschew membership unless and until that ambiguity is removed, without seeking to impose upon us an intolerable financial burden or else the somewhat humiliating position of having to seek continued membership of this Parliamentary Association with a token subscription which means that we are enjoying the amenities which all these Parliaments provide for their colleagues without subscribing to the common fund for the central secretarial work the £100 or whatever is appropriate from a branch founded in a Parliament of the size of Oireachtas Éireann.</P>
      <P>I invite the Taoiseach, without committing himself finally to this matter, to address his mind to that aspect of it and to determine whether it would not sufficiently dissociate him and his colleagues from any ambiguity that may exist by their abstaining from membership unless and until the defect, as it seemed to him, was remedied.</P>

I know that on some occasions that officer has had to entertain them at his own expense and I think that is wrong.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The emoluments and allowances of the President are governed by the Presidential Establishment Act of 1938, Section 1 (1) of which provides for the payment to the President of emoluments and allowances at the rate of £10,000 a year.  Of this sum £5,000 is specified in the section as being the President's personal remuneration. The Bill before the House proposes that the emoluments and allowances of the President be raised to £11,500, his personal remuneration, however, being retained at £5,000.  The increase proposed represents 30 per cent. on that portion of his income which is allocated to the expenditure of his office.  The increase is obviously necessary on account of the increased cost since 1938 of maintaining staff and of any other necessary provisions connected with the Presidential office.</P>

      <P>In those few words, we have put before this Parliament a proposal that the salary of a gentleman who is already in receipt of £10,000 a year and is costing the taxpayers, for maintenance alone, £52,000 a year in the present financial year&mdash;£1,000 a week&mdash;should be increased by the sum of £1,500 per annum free of income-tax. That is the case made for it, when a Minister rambles in, tells us that <Col N="121" /> there is an increased cost of living since 1938, and that on top of £10,000 salary and £42,000 maintenance we should vote out of the public purse another £1,500 a year, to be taken out of the pockets, not only of the rich but of the poor as well.  That suggestion is an insult to Parliament, an insult to any democratic Assembly in the modern world; it is a cynical joke at the expense of the many practically destitute people who have to live on incomes of 11/-, 10/- and 9/- a week.</P>
      <P>We heard reference within the last half hour to the spread of Communism and the danger of Communism.  What is the breeding ground of Communism, what are the essentials in order that the seed of Communism should germinate? Discontent, disappointment and disillusionment with regard to the structure of the State and the Parliament of the State; unreasonable, inhuman comparisons between the worldly position of the few and that of the many; the wide extremes between immense undreamt-of wealth and dire destitution.  We underline in this Bill the wide gap that separates the conditions of hundreds of thousands of our people and the conditions under which a privileged, luxurious few exist.</P>
      <P>I wonder how many individuals in this State are in receipt of an income of £11,500 a year and have, from outside sources, not from within their own pockets and not out of their own bank account, an income to maintain an establishment costing £42,000 a year over and above that £10,000.  If there are any of those individuals, tiny in number, unique in their luxurious surroundings, blessed to a unique and exceptional degree with the world's material wealth, surrounded by every form of luxury, every form of assistance, everything that could be dreamt of in association with money, how would we think if any one of them were such that, by any machinery or any device, they suggested extracting from the people of this country, poor and rich alike, a further £1,500 a year, free of income-tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the case made?  Is the sum of £52,000 per annum insufficient to keep that old gentleman, not only in reasonable comfort but in undreamt-of <Col N="122" /> luxury?  Is that sum inadequate? Have our notions become so grandiose that £1,000 a week is insufficient, in face of the economic blizzard that exists, to keep one old gentleman in reasonable comfort and luxury?  Is there danger of destitution, that we must bring in this particular Bill?</P>
    <P>We voted out of the taxpayer's pocket, just a couple of months ago, money to provide for the upkeep of this particular officer of the State and his household.  We provide a salary of £10,000 a year, £5,000 of that being exempt from the laws that apply to the ordinary man who is earning money&mdash;that £5,000 being free of income-tax.  We provide £32,000 to be spent on his establishment during the current year; we provide him with service, staff, officers, every form of assistance, clerical and otherwise, at an expense of £4,120 a year.  In case he might be inconvenienced by the increased cost of commodities that another person on a much lower salary has had to buy, such as a motor car, we provide another £300 a year, on top of that £10,000, for renewal of his motor, and we provide him with travelling expenses.  We provide for any expenses in the way of stationery, telephones, telegrams&mdash;we do not ask him even to buy a postage stamp.</P>
    <P>Altogether, we voted a sum of £52,033.  I wonder how many tens of thousands of people in this country are living on the odd £33, or less than that, leaving out the £52,000.  Yet, in a democratic Parliament, in a State which claims to be Christian in its outlook and which functions under a Constitution of which every second phrase is a pious aspiration and in the teeth of an encyclical recently published which refers to the necessity for Christian distribution of wealth, we think it is reasonable that one man, already costing £52,033 per annum, should get another £1,500, and this within a month of a reluctant grant of a half-crown a week to tens of thousands of old age pensioners, the half-crown being gobbled back within three weeks by the increased cost of tobacco, of meat and of butter.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister and his colleagues have their feet planted on <Col N="123" /> the earth on which they used to have them planted.  I do not think they are living in the same world as ordinary people.  I ask the Minister are there as many as five people in the whole of this State who enjoy incomes of £10,000 per year, with free house, with rates and taxes free, with fuel and light free, with all kinds of servants and services free and with extra money for travelling expenses and incidentals. Are there five in the whole State?  Have our notions with regard to conditions for this President gone completely crazy?  Does the Minister think that, with a free vote of this House, he would get as many as 12 Deputies in the whole Assembly to support the suggestion contained in this Bill?  Does he think, by any process of feeling the public pulse, he would get approval from the people out of whose pockets this money is to be taken?</P>
    <P>It is a most outrageous suggestion. And where does it emanate from?  Was there any case made that there is a situation up there in the Phoenix Park that calls for an extra Vote?  Where does the recommendation come from? The nearest thing to a recommendation on this point we have are the views of a very representative body of people&mdash; the Salaries Commission&mdash;got together to advise the Government and the Dáil on what would be a suitable scale of expenditure for this proposed new establishment of President.  These people were taxpayers, representative of the business community, the professional classes, industrial organisations, farmers' unions and labour bodies.  They approached their work with a high sense of responsibility, in the determination to do the right thing, and they approached it in the belief that no State should be let down by anything in the way of a niggardly grant to maintain any high office in the State.</P>
    <P>They were aware of the fact that the Governor-General's establishment, which had been so much propagandised, so much decried by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance as an outrageous financial blister on the backs of the Irish people, had cost the Irish people £26,000 per year.  They <Col N="124" /> called all the evidence they could and their recommendation, their suggestion, was that whatever type of establishment would be maintained by the President, it should not exceed £15,000 per year all in, and that that should be subject to review after a number of years when we saw the expenses of the office and the type of establishment. The idea before their minds was that, in their desire to do the right thing, they were probably naming an excessively high figure.</P>
    <P>Then, the Constitution laid it down that, during the term of office of the President, the salary or income could not be reduced.  The headline was £15,000 per annum.  During the period of President Hyde, that cost was not very much exceeded&mdash;it swung between £18,000 per annum and £22,000 per annum&mdash;but then we got a Fianna Fáil President and we got the Fianna Fáil monarchial notions, the grandiose outlook on expenditure and the contempt for taxpayers, and immediately the £22,000 per year jumped to £39,000, and to £52,000 this year.  Now we are told that that is inadequate, that £1,500 must be added to that.</P>
    <P>I wonder, when this matter was being considered by the Government, if any consideration was given to the fact that this is a tiny island, or portion of a tiny island, which has a very small and dwindling population in which the people are, in the main, financially poor, and in which the vast majority of families are living on incomes far less than £3 per week.  Does the Minister think it reasonable, in view of that situation, to place the contrast before our people of the vast majority of families existing on less than £3 per week, a great many individuals existing on less than 12/- per week, and one man and his establishment unable to carry on on £1,000 per week and requiring another £1,500 to maintain that establishment?  I wonder if power corrupts or drives mad.</P>
    <P>I have here a publication issued by the Executive of the Fianna Fáil Party and sold for 2d.&mdash;a speech made in this Assembly by the man who is now Taoiseach, expressing the considered views of himself and his Party as to what would be reasonable expenditure <Col N="125" /> by way of salaries in this country. Some of the views expressed in this 2d. speech of the Taoiseach are well worth just calling to the attention of the Dáil in general and, in particular, to the attention of his ardent disciples who sit behind him.  It is a pretty fair headline.  What does the Taoiseach tell us:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We recognise that we are a comparatively small country, and that we cannot afford to carry on our administrative services here on the same scale as if, for instance, we were part of the British administrative system&mdash;the centre of an Empire. We, as I tried by example long ago to point out, had to make the sort of choice that might be open, for instance, to a servant in a big mansion. If the servant was displeased with the kicks of the young master and wanted to have his freedom he had to make up his mind whether or not he was going to have that freedom, and give up the luxuries of a certain kind which were available to him by being in that mansion.  He had to give up the idea of having around him the cushions and all the rest that a servant in the mansion might have, and the various things that might come from the table of the lord.  He had to forego these in order to get the liberty of living his life in his own way in simpler surroundings. If a man makes up his mind to go out into a cottage, he must remember that he cannot have in the cottage the luxuries around him which he had when he was bearing the kicks of the master.  That is simple commonsense.  If he goes into the cottage, he has to make up his mind to put up with the frugal fare of that cottage.  As far as I am concerned, if I had that choice to make, I would make it quite willingly.  I would say: `We are prepared to get out of that mansion, to live our lives in our own way, and to live in that frugal manner.' &rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder if that cottage in the Phoenix Park is without cushions.  One could buy a lot of upholstery for £15,000 a year.  For £52,000 a year one could buy, perhaps, all the cushions that are available or ever were available <Col N="126" /> in this tiny island of ours.  This is the frugal fare of a simple Irish cottage!  This is the way we are living up to the doctrines preached when the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and his followers were bidding to secure the support and the confidence of the people in this country by a campaign of economy, by a campaign of denouncing bitterly extravagant expenditure&mdash;spending the taxpayer's money on super-luxuries for any individual or any particular office.  This particular speech goes on to point out the absurdity of this tiny island, known as Ireland, contributing £20,000 to two heads of State&mdash;£10,000 a year to one head of State down here in the Twenty-Six Counties and another £10,000 to another head of State in Ulster.  Deputy de Valera, as he then was, pointed out that there was £20,000 a year in salaries alone for two heads of State of this tiny island with a population of 4,000,000 people, and that in the United States of America, with a population of 117,000,000 people, the President, who did the work of an active Prime Minister, was only paid £15,000 a year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <P>The reason for the reminder is not to give a pointer to the Deputy but to remind him of the fact that what is fixed by legislation in this connection is not so open to criticism as the Deputy would imagine because it is laid down in the Constitution that the President's emoluments and allowances cannot be reduced during his term of office.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is so laid down by the Constitution and, as the Deputy is aware, the Constitution cannot be amended except by an Act entitled an Act to amend the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I never suggested that it be amended.  My point is that the sum is more than adequate and that it is outrageous to look for £1,500 more. Undoubtedly that is in order and it is the most relevant line that could be taken.  There was an onus on the Minister when he came in here to look for an extra £1,500 to demonstrate that the £52,000 which was already voted was inadequate to maintain that office in not only reasonable comfort but extravagant luxury.  We must realise that comparisons and contrasts will be made which are absolutely indefensible and which nobody with any degree of courage or with any degree of conviction could possibly even attempt to stand over.  Will the Minister, standing at a crossroads anywhere in the County Louth, meeting constituents of his there, with Kathleen O'Houlihan living up the mountainside existing on an old age pension&mdash;10/- a week which, the Minister says, the taxpayer can only afford to increase by 2/6 a week&mdash; justify the condition under which tens of thousands of Kathleen O'Houlihans have got to live when we have a Vote here to-night to give £1,500 a year extra to a person who is already costing the taxpayer £52,000 a year?  The £52,000 is law.  There is in recent years a kind of a Government conception that anything that is law is right, and that is distorted to read that anything you want to make right, well, then, make it law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The theory of that may be quite sound, but in practice it can be most corrupt.  You can make very evil things right by making them legal; you can make very damaging and disastrous things right by making them legal, if the only thing necessary to make them legal is for one man to decide: &ldquo;I am going to make them <Col N="128" /> legal,&rdquo; and if that one man has the unquestioning, dumb, disciplined support of a majority in a national Assembly.  I believe that all this kind of thing that we are facing of late, this kind of lunatic expenditure, is the direct result and the immediate consequence of having an over-all majority following one man, a majority which is over-disciplined, over-obedient and over-regimented..</P>
    <P>We are discussing the position of the President of this country.  Would the Minister dare to leave this suggested increase of £1,500 to a free vote of a free Parliament?  Would the Minister dare to take off the Whips and then submit this question to the House? That is the real test.  We are sent here as representatives of the people. We are sent here to safeguard the public purse.  If, through the instrumentality of an over-obedient majority, we start sharing out amongst ourselves the people's money that we are sent here to protect, we are no better than a gang of theives sharing the loot after the successful plunder.  There is no morality, there is no decency, there is no honesty in the proposal before us.</P>
    <P>Some years ago when we were passing the Constitution we heard a lot about the important functions that would be carried out by this particular office, the salary of which we are proposing to increase.  We were told of the duties that would be taken off the Taoiseach and his Ministers of interviewing foreign visitors and all the rest.  Within the last hour, we had the Taoiseach complaining of the amount of time he had to give to interviewing these foreign visitors, the way his time is being taken up more and more.  As one Deputy, I do not know what the particular functions of this office are. I cannot see that they are so very onerous that they cannot be carried on adequately within the sum of £52,000 per year.</P>
    <P>When there was a President, really and truly and fully representing all the people of the country, he was able to carry out the functions for half the figure that its costs to maintain the same establishment under a Fianna Fáil President.  We have fallen into the groove now of making it a Party <Col N="129" /> position, a reward for distinguished old gentlemen of the Party that happens to have a majority.  There was a phrase used by Mr. Churchill: &ldquo;Turn them out to grass.&rdquo;  In view of this Bill, it would be more correct to say: &ldquo;Turn them out to clover.&rdquo;  £52,000 a year and we are asked to put an extra £1,500 on to it!  Remember, there is a time when your very religion compels you to decide between the rules of discipline inside an organisation and your own promptings of conscience.</P>
    <P>In view of the Votes that we have put through, the tiny little increments that we have given to people subsisting on 10/-, 12/-, 15/- or £1 per week, in view of the circumstances under which they have to live, does every individual Deputy who is supporting this measure believe firmly and conscientiously that he is doing the right thing, doing the just thing, and doing the national thing as prompted by his conscience, when he votes an extra £30 per week, free of income-tax, to this particular gentleman?  Are Deputies prepared to justify that before every individual taxpayer, rich and poor, in their constituencies? On a question like this, a question of conscience, a question of fair play, a question of doling out moneys that you are sent here to safeguard, there is no alibi in saying: &ldquo;Party rule; the Whips were on.&rdquo; You cannot get any alibi for going against your public conscience.  You cannot get an alibi for trampling on all decent standards that should apply to representative men carrying great responsibility and elected to a position to safeguard the contribution of others by voting it out in this manner.</P>
    <P>I think the Bill in itself is an outrage on any sense of public decency. I think the Minister's introduction of it was a gross Parliamentary scandal. If we had any people here who knew the world and how things were done elsewhere, if we had a gallery here of old age pensioners, if we had a distinguished strangers' gallery of hardworking labouring men earning from 50/- to £3 per week and they saw the Minister ramble in here to say that on top of the £52,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy <Col N="130" /> should remember that appeals to any gallery here are not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not appealing to any gallery.  I am saying that if the gallery was populated by old age pensioners, and if the distinguished strangers' gallery was populated by hardworking labouring men with a weekly wage of from 50/- to £3, what would they think of the casual way in which the Minister rambled in and stated that, in addition to the £52,000 for the maintenance of this gentleman and his household, in view of the increased costs since 1938, we should give him another £1,500 per year.  Does anybody think that the terms &ldquo;scandal&rdquo; and &ldquo;indecent&rdquo; are too strong to use <i>vis-à-vis</i> this particular Bill?  I think that when the implications of this Bill are understood inside and outside this House it will be regarded as the most outrageous, the most reactionary, and the most rabidly callous piece of dishonesty that was ever perpetrated at the expense of a very poor and long-suffering population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I resent the words used by the Minister in introducing the measure.  He described it very shortly and very curtly as an increased emolument to meet the increased cost of living. I wonder what will the average reader of to-morrow's paper think when he sees that the President wants £1,500 extra to meet his increased cost of living?  I think the proposal is degrading in that it reduces the office of President to a joke.  I know what the average person in the country will say to-morrow when he reads that the Minister for Finance has decided that the President's cost of living has reached such proportions that he must introduce a Supplementary Estimate for £1,500 to meet it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not like any member of the House to take up an attitude, in dealing with this proposal, that would in any way degrade or lower the very high office of President.  In every democratic country you have a Chamber of Deputies or Representatives or Members of Parliament, or whatever you may call them.  They propose certain legislation.  Over them in most democratic countries you have a second <Col N="131" /> or upper Chamber.  Here we have the Seanad, in England they have the House of Lords, in France they have a Senate and they have a Senate also in the United States.  That second or upper Chamber acts as a check on any injurious legislation that may emerge from the lower House.  Should that not be enough, and should there be a chamber of representatives and an upper house both incapable of turning out proper legislation, there is a third or final check.  In our case it is the President, in England it is the King and in France and America it is the President.</P>
    <P>That is all very necessary because, from time to time, even in the best regulated Chambers, legislation emerges which does not meet with the approval of the majority of the people. We need checks or screens to make sure that nothing injurious will emerge finally into law.  For that reason I would not like this debate to develop a trend that might degrade or lower the office of President by an iota.  We have a President and courts to interpret the law and the day we have not these safeguards, then God help the ordinary people if they are to be left to the tender mercies of a Chamber of Deputies and a Senate, as was amply demonstrated recently.</P>
    <P>The Vote for the President's Establishment this year is £52,033.  Under sub-head D there is £300 for motor cars&mdash;replacement grant&mdash;and there is a note which says that no Vote provision was made for expenses in connection with the maintenance and running of the cars.  I do not know who drives the cars, but I presume the President has two drivers.  Between salaries and expenses and maintenance we can add another £1,000 to the £52,033.  The Government must have their heads up in the clouds when they have the audacity&mdash;I think there is no other word that meets the situation&mdash; to ask for a further £1,500 for a President who has £5,000 as a personal salary and £5,000 for expenses in connection with his office.  If we give him £1,500 more it will bring the total for his establishment in the coming year to well over £54,000.  I wonder what <Col N="132" /> will the worker, who is so handsomely treated by getting an increase of 1½d. an hour, say to this.</P>
    <P>The last speaker talked about the old age pensioners.  We can now see the pattern which began to take shape on 8th May when the Minister introduced the Budget and put an additional 3d. an ounce on tobacco.  It means that the cigarette and pipe smokers down the country will be called on to meet the expenses connected with this establishment. Smokers must have realised by this time what the 3d. extra on each ounce of tobacco means.  Now they know where the money is going.  It is nothing short of scandalous, and in case the Minister turns up his nose at that word, I may tell him I will stand over it.</P>
    <P>If this proposal goes through, we will have the President's establishment costing approximately £54,000. The strange thing about it is that two years ago, before the present occupant of the office was elected, the establishment cost £22,700.  There is no adequate explanation given for the proposal to vote more than double that figure.  The President is not the head of the State in a manner that we would like to see the President of this country being head of the State, because at most functions it is the Taoiseach who represents the State and that is altogether wrong.  The President's expenses are not as high by any means as perhaps they might be if he fulfilled the duties of his office or was allowed to fulfil them properly.</P>

There was a sum of £10,000 fixed by law and if the Minister did his duty he would ask for a reduction instead of an increase.  Recently there was a case where the President signed a Bill, but a few days later that Bill was declared by the President of the High Court to be repugnant to the Constitution.

I am not by any means anxious to go outside the scope of the debate and I do not want to question the ruling of the Chair by any means. <Col N="134" /> I never did, but I do hold that the Minister is asking for £1,500 increase and the only excuse, because it is an excuse that he is giving, is the increased cost of living.  I am pointing out to the Minister that the measure he should have introduced was a measure to reduce the existing salary of £10,000 because the man who signed that Bill is not fit or suitable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins in dealing with this Bill and in referring to the fact that we are being asked for an addition to the sum of £52,000, said it was inevitable that comparisons would be made.  Fifty thousand pounds, £1,000 a week, plus about £30 a week if this Bill becomes law.  I want to ask the question: can this country afford it?  I want to put that question to the Minister for Finance because the only excuse that was offered in this House by the Minister or by any of his colleagues as to why he could not give more than 2/6 a week to the aged and blind of this State was that the country could not afford it.  He did not attempt to suggest that they were not entitled to it.  It was that they could not afford it.  We can afford to give a 30 per cent. increase to a citizen who is already in receipt, by way of salary and allowances, of £1,000 a week, but we can afford, according to the Minister for Finance, to give only 25 per cent. increase to the destitute and the blind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me make a comparison for the Minister and the House.  Let me give to the House a case that was brought under my notice yesterday, and I know the old pair concerned intimately.  I know them, I think I may say, since I was born; the husband was wounded in the Boer War&mdash;that is a long time ago&mdash;and was awarded by the British Government at that time a pension of 15/- a week.  At the time of the Boer War, 15/- had a very big purchasing power as compared with the present <Col N="135" /> day.  That pension was subsequently increased by the British Government, following the 1914-18 war, to meet the increase in the cost of living, to 24/- a week.  A few years ago his wife reached the age of 70.  There were just the two of them with nothing to live on except what he was getting from the British Government as a result of a wound received 47 or 48 years ago.  Because of the fact that he was getting 24/- a week from the British Government, his wife could get only 4/- a week from the State here.  That was bad enough.</P>
    <P>Recently, very recently, the British Government increased that pension again from 24/- to 30/- a week and immediately, this Minister who asks the House to vote £30 a week to the occupant of a job who has £1,000 a week, this Minister or those acting under his authority, immediately proceeds to reduce the miserable old age pension of 4/- a week to 1/- a week.  In other words, what the British Government were trying to put into that man's pocket in reward for services given 47 years ago, is taken out of his pocket by the Irish Minister.  There is the contrast&mdash;1/- a week for this old woman.  If the British were to adopt the same attitude to their pensioners as we adopt to ours, the Minister, under the law as it exists in this country, would have to pay the full 10/-a week to this old woman.  This man is not to benefit by the generosity of the British Government nor is his wife to benefit.  This Government decides that 3/- a week is to be taken from her and her so-called pension must be reduced to a miserable 1/- a week so that we can afford to give £1,000, plus £30 a week, to another citizen.  That is the comparison.</P>
    <P>Is there any justice in that?  Does anybody want to suggest to me for a moment that any member of this Chamber believes in what is now being done to that old man and woman?  I do not believe there is a member of the House would stand for that, but that is being done.  Her pension is being reduced to 1/- a week because we cannot afford to pay her any more.  I want to ask members on all sides of the House, are they satisfied that we <Col N="136" /> are doing equal justice to citizens of this country if we say that we cannot afford to give more than 25 per cent. of an increase&mdash;not over 1938 but over 1918&mdash;to the blind and to the aged, while we can give an increase of 30 per cent. under the Bill which we are now discussing?  I do not want to go back on all the speeches and the statements that were made by the various members of the Government Party about the extravagance of their predecessors.  I do not want to give any quotations from the posters plastered at every cross-roads or the speeches that were made at every cross-roads.  I do not want to remind Deputies of the wild charges of gross extravagance which they made against their predecessors.  I want to come down to the present.  I am putting an actual case of a man and his wife, where the generosity of the British Government is being availed of by the Irish Government to rob an Irish citizen.  That is putting it plainly and straightly.  I can give the Minister or any member of the House the names and addresses of these people and the facts of this case.  I do not propose to say any more than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The complacency and the indifference, not only to the feelings but to the rights of our own people which have been displayed by the Government in introducing this Bill have, I think, shocked public opinion.  For years we had from the Government Party&mdash;long before they came into office&mdash;a campaign against high salaries and a determination to defame anybody enjoying a salary of over £1,000.  Anybody who went to races was deemed to be a &ldquo;seoinin&rdquo; or a degraded, despicable citizen of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To-day we find that £52,000 is not enough to maintain one citizen, even though he may be the first citizen of the State.  We know that in the old days the Lords-Lieutenant were looked upon as men who lived in the highest state of luxury, who lived in the lap of luxury and who did themselves remarkably well, but in the present year's Estimate we have to provide £32,000 to improve the amenities of the Vice-regal Lodge, to provide more curtains, <Col N="137" /> more cushions and more luxuries of every kind.  Surely, in a democratic State one would imagine that the first citizen who had risen from amongst the plain people and who had been elected by them would have sufficient comforts and luxury when provided with those which were considered sufficient for the old Viceroys and who, I suppose, were for the most part born of the aristocracy.  Apparently, the new aristocracy have higher ideas in regard to luxury and comfort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not referring to any individual person.  I am referring to the person who occupies, and will occupy, the office in the future.  Comparisons have been made between the manner in which the occupant of this office is treated and the manner in which humble citizens of the State, such as old age pensioners, have been treated.  I have a very intimate knowledge of the conditions which arose in my constituency during the last severe winter.  It was so abnormally severe that many farmsteads were completely isolated for weeks, and even for months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result, many farmers lost the greater portion of their stock.  I made an appeal on their behalf for some little compensation to enable them to meet their losses, some direct grant to enable them to carry on their business. I was told that there was no money available, and that the only thing that the Government could do was to provide a loan which would have to be repaid and which I may say, could only be repaid with great difficulty by those who lost everything that they possessed.  Why should that attitude, I ask, be adopted towards the <Col N="138" /> ordinary farming community, towards the people who are struggling to live in our mountains and valleys?</P>
    <P>I do not ask for a salary or a pension for them.  I just asked for a little recoupment to enable them to recover from the disaster which had overtaken them and for which they could have no responsibility.  The reply I got was that there was no money available.  Yet, the Minister comes in to-day and in one or two sentences demands £1,500 per year for an office that is costing £52,000.  I think it would take more than two or three sentences from the Minister to justify such a demand, and I think that before the debate ends he will have to exert himself and find some reason why this increased grant should be made.  If, as he has contended, costs have risen, surely before we start raising the salary of the highest-paid citizen of the State we should first give attention to the lowest-paid.  I suggest that if £52,000 is not sufficient there could be some administrative pruning which would enable the Office to be carried out under the amount already provided.  I think the Minister has insulted the intelligence of the House and of the people by making this demand, and that if he has any confidence in the intelligence of his own Party he will leave this Bill to a free vote, take off the Whips and let every Deputy vote according to his conscience.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise for the purpose of joining with previous speakers in protesting, in the strongest possible terms, against legislation which, if passed, will mean a further addition on the taxpayers of the country.  I agree with what Deputy Morrissey said a few moments ago when he asked if the country could last if such extravagance was to be continued.  I look upon this legislation as an outrage.  I think that it is something that should be condemned in the strongest possible terms by every Irishman and every member of the House.  Everyone with a conscience who examines the circumstance of the people to-day, from the smallest taxpayer to the highest, is aware of the heavy burden that has been placed upon their shoulders through the mismanagement of the <Col N="139" /> present Government&mdash;through the ever-increasing taxes that are going to make the rich richer and take from the poor so that they may become poorer.</P>
      <P>Take the ordinary working-class people, the poorer sections of the community, the agricultural workers, the farmer who is producing with skill and industry from sunrise to nightfall, the old age pensioner who has retired and is living a miserable existence on the paltry sum of 12/6 a week, the home assistance recipient on a miserable allowance of 5/- per week, the poor unfortunate widow, deprived of the breadwinner, to provide for herself and her children, the poor unfortunate bog workers about whom I talked loudly in this House six months ago&mdash;the responsible authority decided that those men were to get an increase of 1d. per hour &mdash;the poor unfortunate teacher carrying out the all-important work of teaching our children religious knowledge and preparing them for the rough road through life&mdash;six or eight months ago protests were made against the Minister for Education for refusing to meet the just demands of the national teachers&mdash;when demands were made in the case of all those people the reply we got was that the country could not afford to bear additional taxation to give them more than they are getting, and that the very limit of taxation had been reached.</P>
      <P>The section of the people that deserve attention and consideration and that should be put in a position to secure the necessaries of life are being forgotten by the Government that once maintained that £1,000 a year was an outrageous salary for any man.  The Leader of the Government a few years ago, speaking publicly, said on many occasions: &ldquo;A hair shirt for one, a hair shirt for all.&rdquo;  To-day it is a silk shirt for some and no shirt for others. That is the position as we see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan, leader of the National Agricultural Party, placed before the House the alarming circumstances of the small farming community as a result of the severe winter.  They suffered losses of live stock from exposure. In my own constituency there are cases that would bring tears from <Col N="140" /> the hardest member of the Government. Deputy Davin will bear me out when I say that there were cases in the parish of Wolfhill that would bring tears to one's eyes.  Despite the fact that we have been told by the Minister for Finance that there is no financial accommodation for these poor people to assist them to rehabilitate themselves on their small holdings, despite the fact that nothing can be done for the other sections of the people that I have referred to, in the midst of all this poverty there is an alarming proposal to grant an increase of £30 per week to a man who already has £1,000 a week.  Will the Minister give the House an indication as to what was responsible for the alarming and ever-increasing expenditure in Arus an Uachtarain since Dr. Hyde left it and since the new President took office?  I understand from the official records that during the term of office of the last President the cost of running Arus an Uachtarain and meeting allowances and salary of the President was £22,000. When the establishment was run at that time for £22,000 it can be run for £22,000 now.  Deputy Blowick said we must have a President and we must respect the President.  How did the country exist without a President up to the time that Fianna Fáil introduced a President?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was only asking the Minister to inform the House as to the reasons for the alarming increase in the running of this establishment and the reason why the President of the State must get an increase of £30 a week.  I hope the Minister will give us some reason for the alarming increase in view of the failure of the <Col N="141" /> Minister for Education to give us a reason as to why the teachers should not get an increase and in view of the manner in which his colleague the Minister for Local Government dealt with the application by the county managers for paltry increases for bog workers and road workers.  I submit that this is an Act of lunacy that should not be passed.  It is a Bill that the people of the country are up in arms against.  It is insane legislation.  In no country in the world has extravagance risen to the degree that it has risen to here.  Every honest-minded Deputy will go into the Division Lobby, in the event of a Division being challenged and, if he is voting in accordance with his conscience, will vote against an increase of £30 a week for the Head of this State.  There is a certain amount of entertainment that must take place in accordance with the high office of the President, but I fail to understand why it has gone to such an enormously high level.  I have been informed that the President gave instructions not too long ago that the finest and most elaborate curtains were to be removed from the windows of Árus an Uachtaráin.</P>

      <P>I was endeavouring to bring out the comparison and to show why this man should not get this alarming increase in view of the very poor circumstances that exist in the country.  You will agree with me, Sir, and every Deputy will agree, that there are at this very moment old I.R.A. men who fought hard to put into office the men who are now sitting dumb on the opposite benches, ready to march after the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, to pile up the huge burden on the taxpayers in order to meet this waste and to continue these acts of squandermania, old <Col N="142" /> I.R.A. men who at one time stood gallantly by the present Government, who are paupers in county homes to-day and a penny cannot be found to give them a proper existence or to enable them to take their place in the country.</P>
      <P>I protest in very strong language against legislation being introduced which will increase the funds of the President in his office.  Deputy Blowick pointed out the high honour and dignity attaching to the office of President. I think that, as far as dignity and high honour are concerned, they are not attached to the post at the present time.  We had a President, at a cost of £22,000, who represented the people, who represented all the people, who was a unanimous and non-Party choice, but since that office has turned into an office to which a politician may be elected&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There has been a good deal of talk about extravagance here to-night but I think the direction in which most of the extravagance has gone this evening is in the line of talk. It is quite evident from the speech to which we have just listened and from the speeches that have gone before it that Deputies have spoken here to-night who have not even taken the trouble of reading the Book of Estimates or of reading the Vote for the President's Establishment.  Deputy Flanagan wants us to view the office of President and the high honour attached <Col N="143" /> to it from the point of view of the amount of money it costs and, because the amount voted in the last year of the previous occupant's term of office was £22,000, whereas this year it is £52,000, he wants us to accept that the present occupant is not as honourable as his predecessor.  He wants to know from this side of the House how this extra money has been arrived at, how the increase from £22,000 to £52,000 has occurred.  The Book of Estimates is there in the Library for Deputy Flanagan or anyone else to peruse and, if he had read the Estimates, he would have discovered for himself how that provision is made up.  I propose to read out the different items in that Estimate, to show Deputy Flanagan and others how the amount is arrived at.</P>

On the Central Fund, there are Emoluments and Allowances for the President and pension of the ex-President.  We have here in this total of £52,000, the salary of the President.  Some Deputies would like us to believe it was £1,030 a week, when there was included in the total a sum of £1,200&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am making my own speech, not Deputy Blowick's.  When we take the £1,200 from the £11,200 we get the personal salary of the President, £5,000, and the expenses of the office, £5,000, making a total of £10,000.  If the office of the President was run during the tenure of office of the previous President for £22,000 and if we take the amount that is being expended over and above the amount expended in that year, £32,565, under the Public Works and Buildings Vote, we get the actual expenses of the President's Establishment this year of £20,000.  It was £2,000 less than that figure.</P>
      <P>The figures that Deputy Blowick is interested in are the figures of the various officials attached to the President's Establishment.  I do not know why he wants me to quote them.  I intended to quote them, anyhow, but they are certainly not in support of his argument that the President himself is getting £1,030 a week.  We have the salary of the secretary of the President, £1,000, with increment bringing is to £1,200; and a higher executive officer with an allowance of £430.</P>

      <P>The total under this service is A, £4,120; B, £100; C, £280; and D, £300.  There has been a good deal of extravagant talk, a good deal of insincerity and a good deal of propaganda about the speeches to which we have listened here to-night in connection with the proposal to give an increased entertainment allowance to the <Col N="146" /> President up to £1,500.  I must say that I have very little knowledge of what it costs in the way of entertainment to run the President's establishment, but this House in its wisdom in 1938 fixed a sum of £5,000 as a reasonable sum for entertainment expenses of that office.  We have heard on other occasions about the various increases that have taken place since 1938, about the depreciation in the value of money, and so on, and it is only reasonable to assume that that £5,000 is, to say the least of it, not as valuable for the purpose for which it was intended in 1938 as it was then.  If it was started as a reasonable sum in 1938, then an increase of £1,500 on that sum is not an extravagant allowance to-day.</P>
      <P>If Deputies were honest with themselves and honest with the House and, above all, honest with the country, they would agree that, if they accepted that figure in 1938, we should have no hesitation in recommending that the entertainment expenses of that establishment be increased.  We have Deputy Morrissey expecting us to weep over the pitiful picture he painted of the ex-Boer soldier and the allowance that the British Government were paying to him.  I hold that that man should not be a charge on the State. If he suffered wounds in fighting the Boers, he should not be a charge on the Irish nation, but should be a charge on the British Government, and I do not see why any of us should weep tears over his plight when the British Government are evidently doing their utmost for him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to say anything disrespectful of the office or the person occupying the honoured position of President of this State. The Minister, when very briefly introducing this Estimate, said, in effect, that the increase was being asked for in order to meet the increased cost of living.  The President is in a specially privileged position in relation to the cost of living as compared with practically any other citizen, rich or poor, in the State.  He is provided with a palatial establishment.  Rates, taxes and costs of running that establishment are met, and he has at his disposal a very good garden where he can <Col N="148" /> get vegetables for nothing, when the ordinary citizen, who is lucky enough to get a head of cabbage, has to pay 1/2 for it.  He is provided with everything at the expense of the taxpayer, with the exception of his clothes, and is in a specially privileged position compared with almost any other citizen.</P>
      <P>Apart altogether from that&mdash;I should like to hear that argument answered, if there is an answer to it&mdash;in regard to the increased cost of living, the President is being treated very differently from the way in which other citizens who have had to submit demands to their employers to meet the increased cost of living are treated. Generally speaking, the policy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce with regard to increased rates of remuneration given to ordinary citizens to meet the increased cost of living has been administered through the Labour Court, but that Labour Court, in almost all its decisions and particularly in the decisions applauded by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, gave increases to lower income group on the basis of a certain percentage. The employees of the Electricity Supply Board were quoted by the Minister as the line upon which the Labour Court was to model its recommendations, and, generally speaking, it has gone on that line&mdash;60 per cent. increase to the employees in the lower income groups, 55 per cent. to the next group, 50 per cent. to the next, 40 per cent. to the next and so on&mdash;but here we have an increase suggested for the President of the State, the best-paid person in the State, and the most privileged and honoured person in the State, of 30 per cent. compared with 25 per cent. to the old age pensioner.  I ask the Minister to relate his action in this matter to the action of his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and of that court which administers labour policy in matters of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something radically wrong. There is no doubt that the President is in an extremely favoured position, and if money, as the Minister said quite recently, is available for every useful purpose, surely the purpose for which <Col N="149" /> money should be voted, in the first instance, is for the raising of the standard of living, of the purchasing power of the 400,000 citizens of this State who have to live on 12/- or less per week. How many of these with 12/- or less per week are in a position to buy butter, bacon, eggs, and even a head of cabbage, at present prices?  The President is in an entirely different position and, briefly, there is no man who will vote for the Second Reading of this Bill who will do so with the good-will of the majority of the people of his constituency.  No sensible or honourable Deputy will vote for the Second Reading and no Fianna Fáil Deputy will do so, if there is a free vote of members of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the necessity to intervene in discussions of this character unspeakably distasteful.  The whole House appears to have overlooked the fact that we are not discussing an Estimate, that we are discussing an amending Bill, a Bill to amend the Presidential Establishment Act, 1938. I think all this talk about a comparison of the President's salary with that of a Boer war pensioner or old age pensioner is quite irrelevant and has no validity at all, because, if it is followed to its logical conclusion, the President of Ireland, when entertaining distinguished visitors, should give them a meat tea at six o'clock, a nourishing slice of cold corned beef, a cup of tea and a cut off the loaf.  That, after all, would be the kind of evening meal that most of us eat and there would be nothing wonderful about it.  But I do not think the President of Ireland should extend to the honoured guests of this nation the hospitality which may be acceptable to the more intimate members of our family circle.  I think that, when distinguished visitors come to be guests of the President of Ireland, they should be offered the kind of hospitality that our distinguished citizens travelling abroad are in the habit of receiving, and I believe this Oireachtas should make available to the President of the State from time to time such money as may be necessary to maintain that modest stateliness which is proper in the household <Col N="150" /> of the Head of the State&mdash;internal Head, remember.</P>
      <P>I do not know what kind of entertainments go on in Arus an Uachtarain at present.  I have not heard anyone describing himself as dazzled by the show put on and I am not altogether satisfied that anything has been said here which would justify this Oireachtas voting this substantial addition to that part of the Presidential income which is tax free. The Presidential income is divided into two parts.  The £5,000 received as salary is subject to income-tax, the £5,000 received as entertainment allowance is tax free.  The House will observe with interest that this £1,500 is being clapped on to that half of his income which is tax free.  It, therefore, really represents a supplement to the real income of the President of a sum which more closely approximates to £5,000 or £6,000 than to the £1,500.</P>
      <P>Now, Sir, I come to the extremely disagreeable duty which I have tried to persuade myself for the last week I might properly eschew.  It is a matter about which I suppose I have prepared not less than six Parliamentary Questions and on each occasion when I came up to the fence of putting it down I tore the question up because I could not persuade myself that it was incumbent upon me to take the initiative in such a matter.  However, when I find that the Government see fit, on their side, to bring up this matter and to put it up to each one of us tacitly to accept as becoming an arrangement, unless we expressly criticise it, I, for one, am not going to imply approval or give my tacit consent to the arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Principal Act, which we are to-day concerned to amend relates entirely to the emoluments of the Presidential household during the President's tenure of office, during his period of retirement and, in the event of his pre-deceasing his wife, the pension payable to his widow up to the time of her re-marriage, if such should occur.  We are, therefore, constrained to examine this whole question of emoluments with a view to determining whether we are making provision for the President and his consort <Col N="151" /> adequate to ensure that in any foreseeable contingency they will be in a position of independence becoming to the high station to which they have been called.  I think the provisions of the Principal Act, more especially if they are amended by the Bill now before us, provide amply, if not generously, for the occupants of the position of the President and consort of this country.  I consider that the provision that we made was made, albeit not on the express understanding, certainly on the implicit understanding that neither the President nor his wife would engage in an office of profit or a profession of profit during their tenure of office or, indeed, while in receipt of emoluments by way of salary or pension for the work of the office of President imposed upon them.  We are confronted presently in this country with the exceedingly embarrassing and distressing circumstances that the consort of the President has seen fit to continue to practise, by deputy, as a public analyst&mdash;a profession from which she derives a substantial income.  The result is that the President's wife has become an annual topic of controversial discussion at the meetings of local authorities of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  I am discussing with the House as to whether the circumstances of the occupants of the office justify this provision, unless the kind of undertaking which I imagine this House assumes itself to have received without any express declaration on the part of the other parties is now made available to us.  It is legitimate <Col N="153" /> to make the case that salaried persons, whose income could be described as static, in times of a rise in cost of living are entitled to be granted a supplement to that static income so as to ensure that their standard of living will not be materially altered by the rise in the general cost of living. But the reason why it has been repeatedly emphasised in this House that business people do not require that kind of consideration in times like this is that it has been argued that, in the ordinary nature of things, their income derived from a commercial enterprise tends to keep step with whatever rise there is in the cost of living.</P>
      <P>Surely, if the occupant of the Office of President, whoever he may be, and his consort, whose incomes from the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners are treated as one, shall hereafter have the right during their tenure of office to engage in commercial transactions or the active practice of a profession, the emoluments from which, as a result of representations made on their behalf, rise in step with the cost of living, there can be no ground for saying that the income of this office is static and must therefore be adjusted by a supplement in the event of the cost of living rising.</P>
      <P>Surely, when Oireachtas Éireann fixed the total income of the President at £10,000, no member of the Oireachtas contemplated that the President or his consort would engage during their period of office in a commercial enterprise or in the prosecution of a profession from which they receive reward from diverse citizens or from public funds.  If that implicit undertaking has not been recognised because it was never more than implicit, has not the time come, if we are to treat the Presidential income as static and supplement it in times of rising prices, to add another provision to the Presidential Establishment Act which will provide that neither by deputy, <i>per se</i> nor <i>per alios</i>, shall the President or his consort engage in any office, profession or commercial enterprise during the term of their office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will agree with me that, if we provide £1,500 extra on the ground that the rise in the cost of living makes it impossible for the President to discharge the duties of his office unless a supplement is provided to bring his salary up to bear the same relation with the cost of living as it did before the rise took place, the Oireachtas is entitled to add that it takes this precaution on the assumption that the occupant of the office has no income from any other source; that the occupant of the office, if he had an income from another source when he entered it, divested himself of that income; that the occupant of that office shall not in the future move the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, under the powers of an Act passed some time ago, to make an Order permitting the President to continue in a profession of profit by deputy during his tenure of office, more especially if repeated and acrimonious discussion of this arrangement at the meetings of local authorities throughout the country suggest that the Order authorising the President to act by deputy, in fact, empowers him to appoint a salaried deputy, while drawing into his own revenue account all the fees payable in respect of the work done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Oireachtas would also, I imagine, stipulate that, in such circumstances, they will not be asked to close their eyes and refuse to see clamorous applications by the President's deputy to the local authorities that the fees payable to the President's deputy shall be increased consequent upon the rise in the cost of living.  I cannot see that any useful purpose is ever served by our closing our eyes in this House to <Col N="156" /> situations which we know the people down the country clearly see and eagerly canvass.  The easy thing is to turn away from saying things of people with whom one has no quarrel and whose susceptibilities one has not the slightest desire to hurt; but the fact remains that those who send us here are entitled to expect of us all, when a duty, however disagreeable, awaits doing, that it will be done.</P>
    <P>I suggest that either of two courses would be appropriate in the situation in which we find ourselves, which has been created by the initiative taken by the Government in introducing this Bill.  Without any reference to the existing situation, without any animadversion on the present or past occupants of the Office of President, if, by this Bill, we are to establish the principle that the Presidential emoluments will from time to time be regulated by fluctuations in the cost of living, we should append to the principle enshrined in Section 2 an express proviso of the tacit undertaking which I understood we had, that whosoever undertook the responsibilities and the emoluments of the Office of President of this country would divest himself of every other occupation more completely and more irrevocably than any other public servant of the State.</P>
    <P>All this might have been said crudely, and I am an old enough hand at confining myself strictly within the four corners of the most restricted rules of order to do so while saying things disagreeably and trenchantly, if I desire to do so.  Distressing as this matter might become if anyone wants to make it that way, I believe it is in the best interests of all sections of our society that we should exert ourselves, on all sides of the House, to keep it on as detached a level as it is possible to do. I do not know why it always seems to happen to me.  I do not believe I am any more contentious than any other man.  I do not know why I should have to bell the cat.  I know that in this case&mdash;and I want to reiterate it&mdash; I have felt constrained to put down Parliamentary Questions about this matter many times and, in fact, drafted them, only to tear them up.</P>
    <P>I have taken this opportunity to put <Col N="157" /> this matter clearly in issue without any acrimony and, I trust, without disrespect, not only to the person of a public servant but to the personal character of the parties concerned, for whom I have nothing but a warm regard, born of an acquaintance which, I think, could be dignified with the name of friendship, going back over many years.  Sometimes doing what one believes to be one's duty involves one in the loss of things that one has esteemed precious, but that is all part of the day's work.  Whatever the consequences of my intervention in this debate may be, I made it after the fullest deliberation.  I am convinced that it is in the best interests of the office, its occupants, this House and our people's lives, that it should be settled definitely and in a dignified way now and for the future.</P>
    <P>I am aware that an unsuitable word may quickly bring this whole matter down to a level that all of us would profoundly regret in retrospect.  I cannot charge myself with having employed any such in the course of my observations.  I exhort those who would seek to discredit me by moving the discussion to that lower level to forbear and reserve their exertions for some other occasion.  There will be plenty of opportunities, if any Deputy is anxious to roll in the gutter, to try to make me join him on some other occasion.  Individuals outside this House, for whose susceptibilities every Deputy here is equally solicitous, are here involved; therefore all matters touching them should be discussed with calm and with restraint.  In that spirit I approached this matter.</P>
    <P>I believe something should be done along the lines suggested by me and, unless something is done along those lines, I believe that the passage of this Bill will excite bitter resentment in many parts of the country.  I believe that if this were made an occasion for clarifying the position of the occupant of the Presidential Office, our people would not be narrow-minded or covetous or grudging, if the issue was put honestly before them.  As things stand, they have a deep and, in my judgment, a well-founded belief that this provision would improperly be <Col N="158" /> made but, with the amendment making this the occasion of the President eschewing all other office or occupation of profit during his ten years of office or his period of retirement, I believe the people would accept the principle that these emoluments should fluctuate with the cost of living and that the obligation is required of him to provide for those whom it is his duty to entertain, something more elaborate than a meat tea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister concludes, I want to say just a few words on this Bill.  We are presented here with a proposal from the Government to increase the President's allowances by £1,500 and we are asked to provide this increase for an establishment which already costs £52,000 a year.  The House is being asked to do that as if it were the only outstanding economic problem before the country. Whatever grievance the President may have in regard to the increase in the cost of living to-day as compared with 1939, there are tens of thousands of other citizens who have a much bigger grievance and they can find nobody to offer a remedy for their grievances so quickly and expeditiously as is being done by the Government through the medium of this Bill.  This is being done at a time when tens of thousands of citizens are scarcely able to get the barest necessaries of life, when they are not able to buy the food or clothing necessary for a reasonable sustenance.  At a time when large numbers of people are compelled to do with much less than they had in pre-war days because of the rapid increase in the cost of living, we are arranging through the medium of this Bill to adjust the President's way of life by grafting £1,500 on to a sum of £10,000 in respect of salaries and allowances. I think that the Government seem to have taken leave of their senses to introduce a Bill of this kind in present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, while making special provision for a citizen in enjoyment of a salary of £10,000 a year, a citizen who is in a much better position than tens of thousands of his fellow-citizens to weather the economic storm brought <Col N="159" /> about by the war, is introduced in circumstances under which large numbers of our people are suffering grave economic hardship without any hope of redress.  The Bill proposes to equate the President's cost of living in 1939 to the President's cost of living to-day by granting him an increase in salary and allowances of £1,500.</P>
    <P>When we remember the miserable pittance of 2/6 given to old age pensioners, the weakest section of the community, to enable them to meet the increased cost of living, we get some idea of the sense of values that obtains in this House.  At a time when thousands of unfortunate citizens are still subsisting on home assistance standards and when our social services are so grossly inadequate that large numbers of our people are living in real destitution, I think it is a mockery of the sufferings of these people that this House should be asked to vote £1,500 as additional emoluments to the President.</P>
    <P>I think it is not many months ago since the Minister for Finance gave an advice to this House in the matter of expenditure.  He told us on that occasion that one of the ways in which the cost of living could be kept down and inflation prevented was to refrain from spending money on the purchase of goods.  The Minister's advice on that occasion to the people generally was to keep their money until a later period. &ldquo;By doing that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will probably get more goods and better value if you buy these goods and these services at a later date.&rdquo;  Should that advice not be tendered to the President now?  With an income of £10,000 per annum, a very substantial income in our circumstances, should not the President be advised, with the economic situation of the country as it is and with the example of large numbers of worthy citizens before him&mdash;citizens who are not able to make adequate provision for a decent standard of living&mdash;that it would be intolerable to contemplate a situation in which, whilst not making provision for really needy people, the Government would propose to make an additional £1,500 available for the salary and allowances of the President?  I think the Government's <Col N="160" /> approach to this whole matter has been the reverse of what commonsense demands in the present situation.</P>
    <P>This country is not in a position in which it can look with tender care or delicious solicitude at the financial circumstances of persons in receipt of £10,000 per annum.  They have got to take the rough with the smooth, the lean with the fat, in matters of this kind.  They cannot expect the tender adjustments such as would be necessary in respect of persons in receipt of a lower remuneration or low wages even when they are lucky enough to have employment.  Persons in the position of the President have got to take a chance in the way that things may turn out.  They have got to remember that even though the cost of living goes up, involving additional inroads on their incomes, nevertheless, in comparison with millions of other citizens, the President is still in a position in which his problems are small, insignificant and trifling, compared with the problems confronting the masses of the people of the country.</P>
    <P>As I say the Government has been unwise in its whole approach to this matter.  I think what the Minister should have done was to go to the President when the President was seeking this increase&mdash;I do not know whether he sought it or not but that is immaterial anyhow&mdash;and give him the advice which he gave to the Dáil some time ago:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Do not buy now, do not spend now, if you can avoid spending; keep your money until later on.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It would not be too much to expect, having regard to the salary of the President and the whole cost of the Presidential establishment, that the President should be tendered the advice that if he could get over his difficulties by economies to the extent of 30 per cent. in his establishment, that would be equivalent to the increase which is now proposed to provide for him and that he would be at the same time responding to the Minister's advice to spend as little as possible because he might get better value for his money later on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I dare say it is a bit late and a bit hopeless for anybody at this stage to question this proposal to provide £1,500 of an addition to the President's already substantial income. Nevertheless, I think it is the duty of Deputies to criticise and protest against this extravagant expenditure because we must examine this proposal from the point of view of the people to whom this money really belongs; the people who will have to meet this extra expenditure by increased taxation in one way or another.  In the good old past of over 15 years ago when the present Government Party were in Opposition, they made great capital all over the country of the gigantic expenditure, as they called it, entailed by the upkeep of the Governor General's establishment.  They gained support and votes by promises of all sorts of reductions if they were once put into power here, but it was an unfortunate day for the Irish people that some of us took them at their word.  We gave them the steamroller to steam-roll through any proposal they wished in this House, a steamroller which will now enable them to provide the chief citizen of this State with an increase in a <Col N="162" /> salary which is already more than the people of the country can afford.</P>
      <P>The fact that the President's establishment costs this little island over £52,000 is something which should make the ordinary taxpayer open his eyes in wonderment.  Having regard to our decline in population, and the stagnation in all forms of production, I think this is an entirely wrong time to set about giving an increase to our President.  This money might be much more usefully expended in other directions.  We are told, of course, that it is only a small sum, but we must remember that at the same time we had another Bill before us a short time ago providing for increases which we were told amounted to only £24,000 and before this week is out we shall have a still further Bill providing for increases of £30,000.  All these thousands of pounds added together come to a very large sum in the end. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
