      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state if, in view of the serious drain of emigration on the population of this country, especially of young people, he will make representations to the British Government, with a view to securing the withdrawal, at an early date, of the Office of the United Kingdom Liaison Officer for Labour.</P>

      <P>The suggestion contained in the question is not warranted.  The official referred to does not induce people to emigrate or act in any other way contrary to our regulations.  In fact, the work of his office is of material advantage to us in preventing emigration harmful to essential production here and in protecting the interests of Irish workers who have decided to seek employment in Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that there is a considerable number of applications for replacement of lost or damaged ration books; that residents <Col N="432" /> of West Dublin are obliged to journey to the Kevin Street Garda Síochána station for their forms and to have them vouched; and whether, in view of the inconveniences and hardships so caused, he will make provision to have these applications dealt with at local Garda Síochána stations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy's inquiry refers to applications by residents in &ldquo;A&rdquo; District of the Dublin Metropolitan Garda area, in which district there are three Garda Síochána stations, Kevin Street, Kilmainham and Newmarket.</P>
      <P>The recent marked increase in the volume of applications for replacement of lost or damaged ration books in the area in question imposed an undue strain on the limited facilities for dealing with such applications at the Kilmainham and Newmarket Garda stations and the Garda Commissioner found it necessary to divert all applications by residents of the area to Kevin Street Garda station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is the Minister aware of the hardships and inconveniences which the working class are put to in the areas of Inchicore, Crumlin and Chapelizod in having to go to Kevin Street, in the first place, to apply for the form, then to fill it up and to have it signed by a peace commissioner and then to bring it back to Kevin Street again?  The Minister is aware that the head of the house is at work, in all probability, and it remains for the wife to undertake these journeys at a time when she has other work to do and it is a considerable hardship.  If there is a strain &mdash; and I believe that there is &mdash; on the Garda authorities then having to deal with it all in one station makes it all the more onerous, while people have to stand in a queue to wait their turn for a considerable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of persons from Inchicore area who made application for the replacement of ration books at Kevin Street station was 13.  It is desirable that people should not lose or damage their ration books.  The arrangements dealing with <Col N="433" /> the matter are entirely the responsibility of the Garda authorities and they had serious grounds for making the change from Kilmainham and Newmarket stations where the facilities were completely inadequate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, if any of this work was done at Kilmainham station, it was done satisfactorily and there were no complaints, but now, in this very bad weather, it is a hardship on people and the Minister ought to reconsider the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not desired to make it easy for people to replace lost and damaged ration books.  People should be encouraged not to lose or damage their ration books.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not desirable that people who have genuinely lost their ration books should be put to hardship and inconvenience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether his attention was directed to the statement, attributed to the President of the British Board of Trade, concerning the refining, in Great Britain, of sugar for this country; whether he will state if the Irish Sugar Company purchased, in Peru, a quantity of brown sugar; whether the sugar in question was refined in great Britain; the total quantity of refined sugar so dealt with in the present year; the over-all cost of such sugar delivered to the premises of the Irish Sugar Company; the grounds on which Peruvian sugar was refined in Great Britain rather than in the factories of the Irish Sugar Company; and if it is now the settled practice to divert the treatment of imported sugar from Irish to British factories?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In December, 1946, Comhlucht Siuicre Eireann, Teo., arranged for the purchase in Peru of a quantity of raw sugar.  This was the only kind of sugar that could be bought at the time.  Portion was imported and distributed as raw sugar. The balance was sent to Great Britain for refining.  The total quantity of the refined sugar imported from Great Britain in the present year amounted to 8,210 tons.  This sugar was not delivered to the premises of the Irish Sugar Company but, when landed at Dublin at a cost of £65 2s. 6d. a ton, was distributed direct to the wholesale trade. It was not found practicable to refine the Peruvian sugar at the factories of the Irish Sugar Company because, at the time the sugar came to hand, there was an acute shortage of fuel and a lack of adequate transport and storage facilities.  There is no settled practice of having imported raw sugar refined in British factories rather than in Irish factories.  The question will be decided as and when it arises in the light of the ability, or otherwise, of Comhlucht Siuicre Eireann, Teo., to have the work done efficiently in its own factories.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna &mdash; Questions.   Oral Answers. - Tea Imports.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the reasons for the decision to import tea supplies to this country direct from Ceylon and India; if he is aware that tea, in these places, is purchased in competition with substantial British interests, resulting in very high prices; and whether he consulted the interests concerned here before the change was carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the war the bulk of the Indian tea supplies to this country was obtained through British merchants.  During the war period and up to December, 1946, Great Britain obtained the exportable tea available in India and Ceylon under a bulk purchasing arrangement with the Governments of those countries.  The teas so purchased were allocated by the International Emergency Food Council, the supplies for this country being included in the British re-export allocation. I informed the Dáil on June 21st, 1945, of my intention, in view of our experience in regard to tea supplies during the war period, to take steps as soon as might be practicable to arrange for the purchase of this country's tea requirements in future in the countries of origin by Irish firms and to have them imported here on through bills of lading.  A decision made late last year by the Governments of India and Ceylon to terminate the arrangement regarding bulk sales and to allow tea to be sold freely as from January 1st, 1947, resulted in Great Britain being no longer able to supply tea to this country and, accordingly, it became necessary for me to make the alternative arrangements immediately.  After consultation with representatives of the Irish wholesale tea trade I decided that the Government-sponsored company, Tea Importers, Limited, should purchase in India and Ceylon and <Col N="436" /> import direct a quantity of tea sufficient to enable tea supplies to be maintained for a considerable period ahead.</P>
      <P>I am aware that following the resumption of public sales of tea in India and Ceylon the increased world demand, together with the reduced supplies in producing countries, caused a marked increase in prices, which was further aggravated by the imposition of export taxes by the Governments of India and Ceylon.</P>

Occasionally, encroachments on our exclusive fishery limits have taken place and such have been followed by appropriate action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware that a foreign trawler approached within half a mile of Wexford Bar on the 26th November last.  A telephone message was received on that day in my Department from a representative of Muinntear na Mara, to the effect that a number of foreign trawlers were fishing off the Wexford coast and he was apprehensive lest these trawlers should enter and operate inside territorial <Col N="443" /> waters.  About midday on the 27th a further telephonic communication to the effect that trawlers had come within half a mile of Wexford Bay was received.  Following on this information a ship was sent to patrol the area.</P>
    <P>During this patrol, which commenced on Friday, the 28th, L.E. Cliona reported two foreign trawlers 7½ miles south of the Great Saltee and one 9 miles S.S.W. of Great Saltee.  None was seen in Wexford Bay.</P>

In my opinion, the bald announcement, featured as it was and unassociated with any statement by me, affects my reputation adversely, although I admit that such a thought, obviously, never entered the mind of the Chair.  I do believe that the announcement is likely to create an impression or a suspicion in the minds of a great many people that I was either guilty of perjury or gross disrespect for the Chair.</P>

My contract with the Almighty was to <Col N="450" /> adhere to that bond.  If I deviated from that bond or contract, it would be up to me to apologise to the Almighty and make my peace with Him.  Whether my opinion was right or wrong, if I adhered to that sworn bond to tell what I believed to be true and to keep faith with the Almighty, I could not consider under any circumstances tendering an apology or making an apologia to any earthly tribunal because I kept my trust with God.</P>

      <P>In page 7, lines 18 to 48, to delete Section 10 and substitute the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>10.&mdash;(1)  Where the members of a local authority consisted immediately before the passing of this Act of aldermen and councillors&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the members shall continue to consist of aldermen and councillors,</P>
      <P>(b)  where the members are 30 or less in number, the number of aldermen shall be the same as the number of local electoral areas and&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) if an election of members of the local authority for an electoral area is contested, the firstelected candidate shall be an alderman, and</P>
      <P>(ii) if an election of members of the local authority for an electoral area is not contested, the local authority, at their quarterly meeting after the election, shall elect from the candidates elected for that area, in accordance with the principles of proportional representation, one alderman.</P>
      <P>(c) where the members are more than 30 in number&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) the number of aldermen shall be ten,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  where at an election of members of the local authority, the elections for members for all <Col N="453" /> the local electoral areas are contested&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  the returning officer shall prepare a list of the candidates elected showing in order the totals of the first preferences recorded and the list shall begin with the candidate for whom the highest total is recorded and, in any case where totals of first preferences recorded are the same, the order on the list of the candidates concerned shall be determined by lot,</P>
    <P>(II)  when such list is prepared, the returning officer shall prepare a roll of aldermen,</P>
    <P>(III)  in preparing such roll of aldermen, the returning officer shall place successively on the roll the names of the candidates whose names appear on such list, in the order in which they so appear, until ten names are so placed, but where the name of a candidate elected for a local electoral area has been so placed, no further name of a candidate elected for that local electoral area should be so placed,</P>
    <P>(IV)  the candidates whose names have been placed on such roll of aldermen shall be aldermen,</P>
    <P>(iii)  where at an election of members of the local authority, the elections of members for one or more of the local electoral areas is or are not contested, the local authority, at their quarterly meeting after the election, shall elect from their members, in accordance with the principles of proportional representation, ten aldermen,</P>
    <P>(d)  any member who is not an alderman shall be a councillor.</P>
    <P>(2)  The functions of a local authority under this section shall be reserved functions for the purposes of the County Management Acts, 1940 and 1942, and for the purposes of the <Col N="454" /> Act or Acts relating to the management of any county borough.</P>
    <P>This is the amendment which I promised to introduce on Report to meet the point raised by Deputy Byrne and some other Deputies in relation to the question of aldermen and councillors. I think it is satisfactory.  It allows those who head the poll in the respective areas to be aldermen provided the number of members of the council is more than 30 and where the number is not more than 30 we propose to select the ten persons in the different electoral areas who secured the greatest number of first preferences.</P>

      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>This amendment proposes that appeals against refusals of a housing authority to allow the demolition of habitable houses or their use otherwise than as dwellings, should be made within a month of the refusal and that the Minister's decision should be given within three months of getting the appeal.  At first sight, this amendment <Col N="456" /> might appear to be in favour of the person concerned, the owner of the property, but I do not think it is. From his point of view, he might have a genuine grievance if he were debarred in changing circumstances from making an appeal after the expiration of one month from the making of the demolition order.  We may assume that where the circumstances are such that the owner would feel that he had good ground for an appeal, he would make the appeal immediately the order was made.  If, however, the circumstances should change and the case for the appeal were strengthened by the change in circumstances, the amendment in the form in which it is now proposed would debar the owner from making the appeal in the new circumstances so that, from the point of view of the owner, the amendment has not at all the merits which I am sure the drafter thought it possessed.  Again it would be quite impracticable to limit the Minister's decision in a matter of this sort to three months because many inquiries may have to be made.  These inquiries are as a rule made by letter and some time may elapse before the answer is procured or, indeed, becomes procurable. As the amendment stands, I submit that if the appeal were not decided within three months, then the original refusal of the demolition order would stand, so I think the amendment for these reasons should not be pressed.</P>
      <P>I should give notice on this section that it is proposed to introduce an amendment on the Report Stage in these terms: To provide that pending the determination of an appeal by the Minister, a person shall not proceed to demolish a habitable house, in whole or in part, or use it otherwise than as a dwelling.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to consider excluding farm dwellings from this section because I feel they fall into a different category. The House appreciates the Minister's motives in having this section inserted, <Col N="457" /> in order to ensure that houses fit for habitation will not be demolished, but farm houses, I repeat, are in a different category.  A farmer may contemplate building a new house and converting his old house into an out-office.  He may have actually built the new house and if he were refused permission to demolish the old house it would stand there uninhabited without being used for any other purpose.</P>

      <P>As some doubt has arisen, we will make sure that it will not exist any longer.  As regards the point raised by Deputy Hughes, I think we may assume that the housing authority, in a case of this sort, will be the county council, and we can also assume that they will not unreasonably refuse permission to demolish.  Therefore, if it is proposed to convert an existing dwelling on a farm which is vacated by reason of the fact that another house has been built in substitution for it, we may assume the members of the county council, representing the rural areas, and particularly under the new Local Government Elections Bill, will not unreasonably refuse permission to demolish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think it would be desirable to have some safeguard in this section that will direct the local authority in what particular cases they ought to refuse permission for a demolition and in what particular cases they ought to grant it?  I can envisage many cases in which it would be desirable to prevent the demolition of a dwelling-house. The demolition of a good house is an evil that ought to be restricted. It is one of the rights of property which, in the public interest, it might sometimes be necessary to restrict, having regard to the shortage of housing accommodation.  In the case of a farmer who provides a new house, as Deputy Hughes said, it might not be desirable to prevent him from demolishing the old one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless the old one happens to be reasonably habitable and could be occupied without causing too much inconvenience to the farmer.  If we are to prevent owners in urban areas from demolishing houses that are habitable, or converting them to other uses, then we must put the owners of houses in the rural areas in very much the same position. We must, in connection with rural houses, pay due regard to the circumstances and the convenience of the farmer who has vacated the house.  We can take that aspect into consideration, but we cannot say to the owner of a house in an urban area, who might be demolishing it to make available a more valuable building site or, by converting it, to become the owner of a very valuable hereditament: &ldquo;We will not allow you to do it,&rdquo; while we say to the rural dweller: &ldquo;If you happen to have a house in the country you can do with it what you jolly well like, whether it is habitable or not, whether it is urgently required for a dwelling-house or not, and whether it could be <Col N="459" /> used as a dwelling-house without causing any grave inconvenience to the owner of the farm&rdquo;.  That is an aspect of the matter for which we must have some regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an important issue at stake.  I think the House should agree that, unless State intervention is necessary, there ought not to be any intervention.  The freedom of the individual ought to operate where it is not necessary for the State to come in.  Obviously it is necessary in towns and villages and districts where you have people living in close proximity to each other and where a housing problem exists.  But there is no housing problem on a farm and, if a farmer builds a new house and the old one remains in his farmyard, it is hardly possible to conceive any case where you could put in a tenant in such circumstances so that there would be no interference with normal farming operations.</P>
      <P>I am in agreement with control and intervention where that is necessary to preserve for human habitation suitable dwelling-houses and to ensure that they are not destroyed, but I think the Minister is going too far when he wants to operate that principle in rural districts where there is no housing problem or, at all events, where the same problem does not exist as in urban areas.  We are now proposing, for the first time, to give a housing authority control over a farm house situated on private property, where there is no likelihood of the old house being used by another family.</P>
      <P>In the ordinary course, conditions must be pretty bad when a farmer builds a new home.  The old house is usually converted for the purpose of housing animals; it is invariably used for that purpose.  My main objection is to the encroachment of the State, this interference with the individual, and the regimentation that inevitably follows from such a course.  The man no longer has his freedom; he must ask some authority for permission to do something that ought to be purely his own affair.  I object to this proposal on principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="460" /> I agree with the Minister that it is unlikely that the county manager, the county council or even the Minister himself will unreasonably refuse permission, but I object to the principle that is involved.  It is only where it is essential in the public interest that you should have intervention and control that we should seek such control. Where it is not necessary to have that control, we should preserve the liberty of the individual.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in substantial agreement with Deputy Hughes.  There are cases where the public authority should intervene.  For instance, a very good dwelling might have been dismantled in a county within the past few years for the purpose of utilising the building materials.  The case is cited where a farmer builds a new house and is compelled to maintain the old dwelling.  You have the other case where a farmer admires an outside holding on which there is a good dwelling and where it would not be in the national interest if that dwelling were demolished.  There are cases in which it would be undesirable to permit demolition.  A house might be on an outfarm, on a separate holding, and it could be made available by the owner for letting.  It might even be desirable to insist upon him keeping the house in repair for a member of his own family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a Government Department which seeks to establish new holdings and provide houses on them.  I have in mind a case where the Land Commission sub-divided a holding and built three houses on it.  The three holdings were sold to one man who did not reside near them.  Eventually the houses were allowed to fall.  That is one case which shows the manner in which this section can be ignored&mdash; that is, by permitting an owner to allow a vacant house to fall into disrepair, or assist in allowing it to fall into disrepair by removing the doors and letting live stock enter, or using it for other purposes which may tend to bring it into disrepair.  There are certain cases&mdash;possibly a very restricted number&mdash; in which there should be some power in the hands of some public authority <Col N="461" /> to prevent the demolition of good houses, but I think the power should be sent out in the Bill and there should not be indiscriminate use of the power by some local authorities.</P>

      <P>So far as Dublin is concerned, it is important that this section should be retained, more particularly while the present housing shortage lasts.  I had a particular case a short time ago on the north side of the city where the owner of a number of houses in a reasonably good state of repair wanted to demolish these houses and to dispossess the tenants so as to set out on some grandiose housing scheme.  That would have involved an undoubted hardship for quite a number of people concerned and it was with a considerable amount of difficulty that the owner was dissuaded from his purpose.  It had to be done without having the backing of the law, as is envisaged in this case.  I do not know what may be the application of this provision elsewhere, but I do know from personal experience that we in Dublin welcome this section.</P>

      <P>We cannot go as far as that in this Bill.  Let us look at this matter in a broad way and let us not try to draw a distinction between country and town which suggests that country people and townspeople are natural enemies.  If this principle is a good one in present circumstances and if it must be applied in present circumstances <Col N="462" /> because of the dire housing shortage, then its application should be general because, while it is quite true that the housing situation is not as acute in the rural areas as in the urban areas, there is, neverthless, a rural housing problem as well as an urban problem.  We require at least 17,000 houses in the rural parts of Ireland, and, so long as that deficiency exists, are we justified in allowing any person to demolish or convert a habitable house in the countryside while, at the same time, we would refuse the owner of that house, if it were situated in an urban area, the right to demolish it? We have to be just and we cannot make fish of one and flesh of another.</P>
      <P>If, as everybody, including even Deputy Hughes, admits, we are justified in preventing the demolition or conversion of dwelling-houses in urban areas in present circumstances because of the housing shortage, we shall have to face up to the unpleasant fact that we must also take power to prevent the unjustifiable demolition or conversion of a habitable dwelling-house if it happens to be situated in a rural area. There is no escape from that, if we want to be just one with another, and, as Deputy Cogan and Deputy Heskin, and others who apparently take a somewhat broader view of this matter than Deputy Hughes is prepared to take, have pointed out, there are cases where houses are unoccupied which could be tenanted without causing any grave inconvenience to any person. In these circumstances, I think we shall have to apply the principle generally and rely on the good sense of the local administrators to ensure that the principle will not be abused by unreasonable application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No person is going to take up an unreasonable attitude in relation to this matter.  We do know that in the case of a residential holding, if a farmer happens to be living there, and if he has vacated the old house and built a new one immediately adjacent, probably when he set out to build that new house&mdash;with the help of a Government grant&mdash;let us not forget that&mdash;he had in mind the conversion of the old dwelling to some other use or, perhaps, its demolition and, as Deputy Hughes has <Col N="463" /> told us, a farmer very seldom builds a new house unless he is unable to live with comfort or in a healthy environment in the old house.  We may assume from that that he only vacates the old house when it becomes uninhabitable and, therefore, in general, the section will not apply.  There may be cases, however, in which, in the public interest, it should be applied and I suggest that the power should be given to the local authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has overlooked the fact that there is no power to compel the owner of a house to let it and, if that sort of thing is persisted in, the house would stand empty and would not be used for any purpose. The place I envisage is the home in the centre of the farm away from the roadside. In that respect, there is no case for intervention of any sort.  The old house is becoming dilapidated, the farmer is pushed financially to provide an alternative residence and obviously in that case the house is not demolished but used for the housing of animals. Why should the local authority step in and exercise any control?</P>

The Minister has made a good case for intervention in relation to house property in urban areas, but this is an invasion of the rights, the freedom and the liberty of the individual, so far as his occupation and utilisation of land are concerned.  I do not think the Minister has made any case for it.  I am going a long way with the Minister in giving him power to exercise control and to ensure that a good house is not demolished, but I have suggested that that control should be exercised only where necessary and no case has been made for the exercise of that control, or for intervention, where it is not called for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I went rather outside.  I was not quite correct there.  The house would only be eligible for a grant where it was inside an urban area.  It would not be eligible in a rural area, I regret to say. That suggests a frame of thought to me which I may give effect to in another Bill later.  In any event, the position is that if a person allows a dwelling to fall into disrepair the local authority can compel him to put it into repair, provided it is a house which is suitable for occupation by persons of the working classes, under Section 19 of the Act of 1931.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so&mdash; not in those circumstances.  I must confess that I am a little bit puzzled myself about this because, under Section 19 of the Act of 1931, a local authority, on representations made to it by its officers, if they are satisfied that a dwelling house which is of the type suitable for occupation by persons of the working classes is in any respect unfit for habitation, can serve upon the person having control of the house notice requiring him within such reasonable time as may be specified in the notice, to execute the work specified in the notice in order to make the house fit for human habitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="465" /> I was under the impression that, where such notice was given, the local authority would indemnify the person in respect of some part of the cost.  I may be wrong in that and therefore I may have misled the Deputy when speaking to him.  However, it does appear to me that if we are going to compel the owner of a house of that type to put it into habitable condition we, perhaps, ought to try to help him to do it.  The position, in any event, in relation to the general question which Deputy Heskin and Deputy Coogan have raised as to what was going to happen where a house is vacated and is being allowed to fall into disrepair is, as I have pointed out, that the housing authority has power to compel the person who owns the house to put it into habitable condition. In any event, in present circumstances, with the present housing shortage, a person who had a house which he did not want and which he was not prepared to maintain, would probably try to dispose of it and would have little difficulty in disposing of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that would be an entirely new principle which would carry us a long way outside the ambit of this Bill and, if I were to consider that at all, I think I would want to consider it as an entirely new feature in the housing code.  I could not commit myself to a principle like that in a rather extemporised discussion like this.  I think, too, in relation to the whole of this matter that Deputies ought to advert to amendment No. 5 on the Order Paper, which will limit the duration of the section to the 31st December, 1950, that is to say, the section will only be operative in its present form for three years and by that time, perhaps, the position will have so much improved that we may be able to drop the provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to remember in connection with all this&mdash;and I have to say it in relation to a point which Deputy Hughes has raised&mdash;that, after all, if we are going to ask the community to <Col N="466" /> help a man to build a house and if as the result of getting a grant from the State he goes out and builds a house, I think the community are quite entitled to say: &ldquo;Well, if we are helping you to build a new house for yourself, we think we ought at least to allow the old house to stand to house another family that is not nearly so fortunate as you are.&rdquo;  There must be an element of give and take in all this matter.  As to the farmer about whom Deputy Hughes has been speaking, we ought to remember that he will not build a house out of his own unaided resources, that the community is coming in behind him to a very considerable extent and that, taking it by and large, there is no grave injustice done in trying to restrict his right to do what he likes with the old house, to this extent, that if it is in habitable condition it will not be demolished or will not be converted to another use as long as there is an acute need to use it as a dwelling-house.  That is the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section I want to pursue a point I have already made on Second Reading and I would again urge the Minister to consider it in some detail.  First, in order to understand Section 7, one has to go back to the definition in Section 2. Again, I would draw attention to the fact that Section 2 defines a habitable house as a house which, in the opinion of a housing authority, is fit for human habitation.  So, when we are dealing with any house described as a habitable house in this Bill we have to take it as a house which, in the opinion of a housing authority, is fit for human habitation.  There is a question of an opinion of a local authority there first of all.  I think that is a very wide discretion to give to a local authority and in practice I suppose what will happen is that the county manager will exercise that discretion.  &ldquo;Housing authority&rdquo; has been defined but on a last analysis it comes down to the county council in most cases or the council of an urban district.  I take it that this is possibly an executive function and that in actual fact it will be <Col N="467" /> the county manager who will exercise it.  Otherwise, I presume the whole battery of formalities will have to be complied with to have the corporate opinion of the county council on such a matter which, I understand, would not be exactly feasible or, if it were feasible, I would strongly urge on the Minister to alter it.</P>
      <P>But, even granted that it is going to be some officer such as the county manager who will exercise that discretion, I think it is highly undesirable that the appeal from him should be to the Minister because the county manager is under the control&mdash;the very definite control&mdash;of the Minister in many respects, and there is only a show of an appeal in such provisions.  The Minister's decision can be final.  For that reason, I would again urge on the Minister the desirability of considering an appeal provision in the case of such a section as this as is provided in Section 27 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not so much concerned with the demolition provisions because it will be only in exceptional circumstances that the demolition provisions will be invoked and the demolition of a house is a sufficiently big thing to draw such attention as will give it publicity and prevent any injustices.  Though I sympathise completely with the Minister on his intention&mdash;and I hope he understands that my criticism is directed towards helping him to achieve the end he wishes&mdash;the part of this section I do not like in its present wording is where it says &ldquo;in whole or in part or use otherwise than&rdquo;.  The words &ldquo;use otherwise than&rdquo; can cover a multitude of matters.  A general power&mdash;which admittedly gives the Minister the power he seeks, but which, I am afraid, gives him a great deal more power than the power which he overtly seeks here before us&mdash;coupled with the provisions which gives the county manager discretion to decide, coupled with the provision that the only appeal therefrom is to the Minister, makes this section much more sweeping than he intends.  Whereas I am quite prepared to take from the present Minister the assurance that he <Col N="468" /> does not intend to do more than he says, on principle I think it is bad to legislate in this way on such open terms, which conceivably at a later stage of our history might do damage. It is better for us to be explicit in our legislation.  I have not put down an amendment, but I would ask the Minister to modify the words &ldquo;use otherwise than as a dwelling-house&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Take the case of a professional man who is a local doctor and who uses his house as a place from which he operates his business, he has a surgery and he sees his private patients there and might even perform small operations there.  Take the case of many country solicitors who have offices in various towns, but who may have, in their own private house, what amounts to a local office.  Take the case of many commercial travellers who would have some of their wares in the house. These cases, within the strict wording of the section as it stands, could be held to be using the premises otherwise than as a dwelling-house and therefore it would be competent to have the permission therefor refused.  It would be competent for a county manager to say: &ldquo;No, you may not do your solicitor's business in the house&rdquo;; or &ldquo;You may not have your surgery in that house and may not see your patients there&rdquo;; or &ldquo;You may not keep your samples in that house and may not have a typist there to look after your correspondence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That illustration in itself is sufficient to show the danger of the section, as worded.  We all sympathise&mdash;at least I do&mdash;with the Minister and we approve wholeheartedly of what he wants to do. He wants, first of all, to prevent demolition.  That is clear.  There is no danger, so let the county council or county manager decide that, with an appeal to the Minister in each case.  My objection there is on principle rather than in apprehension of results.  What I do not like is the one provision about &ldquo;use of house&rdquo;.  Many of us who carry on our business partly in our houses might suddenly find ourselves confronted with such a decision, which would be, in the last analysis, completely at the whim of the people given that power.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="469" /> I would ask the Minister, purely as a matter of drafting, first of all, to modify that all too sweeping phrase, &ldquo;or use otherwise than as a dwelling-house&rdquo; and to define precisely what he means in his own mind; and, secondly, that on the question of appeal, the appeal should be to an independent judicial tribunal as was provided in the 1931 Act.  Again I am not worried on the demolition question.  Those are single big acts that will get publicity, where nothing can go wrong; but in that case an appeal to an independent tribunal is again essential.  Therefore, both on the principle in general and on the potentialities of the particular section itself, I think the terms of the section&mdash;notwithstanding the Minister's amendment, which brings in a compulsory review in 1950&mdash;deserve reconsideration and the Minister would be well advised to reconsider the drafting. What he wishes to do is perfectly clear and legitimate, but these things take on a different complexion when they are considered purely as questions of law.</P>

      <P>First of all, I wish to join with Deputy O'Sullivan in an expression of appreciation for the introduction of this section in the Housing Bill.  We in Dublin appreciate it very much, for the reason that there have been so many evictions brought about as a result of the demolition and conversion of various kinds of houses.  I suggest to the Minister that in the case of this appeal, which has been dealt with on the same lines by Deputy de Valera, there should be some provision to prevent demolition pending the determination of the appeal by the Minister, so that a person shall not proceed to demolish in whole or in part any such premises or use them otherwise than as a dwelling-house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the legal approach to this matter which Deputy de Valera has made, I think we must look at it as practical men of affairs who have to deal with a very practical problem.  If we were to concede the principle which the Deputy has urged, we should find ourselves from an administrative point of view <Col N="470" /> in a completely impossible position, since we should deny the utility of an appeal to a Minister in any circumstances in relation to any statute.  We should say that, where a local authority performs an executive function which seems to militate against the private interest of any individual, the only appellate tribunal open to him would be the courts of the land and not, as hitherto has been the case in matters of administration, the Ministerial and responsible head of the Department concerned.  I think that would make normal administration in this country quite impossible, as everybody would have the right of appeal to the district justice, to the Circuit Court or High Court.</P>
      <P>So far from the aggrieved person being benefited, he would probably find himself at a very great disadvantage. Whatever may be said about the merits or demerits of an appeal to a Minister, at least it is a cheap and comparatively expeditious procedure. In general it does not cost the appellant anything more than the time taken by himself to state the grounds of his appeal and the cost of a postage stamp. It could be far otherwise if the appeal had to be carried to the Circuit Court. There he would, of course, have to appear in due form, represented by a counsel, instructed by a solicitor, and pay all the expenses incidental to the litigation.  If we were to accept as an established fact the principle that there is no reality&mdash;that is what underlies the suggestion&mdash;in an appeal to a Minister, we should apply it in relation to every other provision in every other statute enacted or adopted by our legislature in which a similar right of appeal is given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera is under a complete misapprehension as to the position of the county manager.  County managers are not the officers of the Minister.  The county manager is the officer and servant of his local authority.  He is there as the executive officer of that authority; he is there to exercise the executive functions of that authority, and it is to that authority, and not to the Minister, that the county managers are responsible. They are, in certain circum- <Col N="471" /> stances, responsible to the Minister. If the Minister, having held an inquiry, is satisfied that their administration has been mal-administration, if he is satisfied that their acts have been <i>ultra vires</i> the law, then, of course, he may deal with them by suspending them or by dismissing them.</P>
    <P>Similarly, if the local authority are satisfied that the manager's administration is not what it ought to be, and has not been in the best interests of the ratepayers, they may, by resolution, suspend him, and may ask the Minister to confirm that; but the manager is the officer of the local authority.  He does not take orders from the Minister and, wherever it is possible, I have reprimanded those managers who have not been prepared to accept and to discharge fully the responsibilities of their office, and who have tried to constitute themselves officers of the Minister. We do not want that type of county manager.  The man who acts thus, in my opinion, is not fit for his job, and that has been conveyed very forcibly to the existing body of county managers.  Nor, is it true to say either, that an appeal from the manager, or from the local authority, to the Minister is a mere formality.  There must be Deputies &mdash; members of local authorities &mdash; who have knowledge of town-planning cases, and of other cases, where an appeal has been taken from the decision of the county manager to the Minister, and they must be well aware of the fact that the appeal has been upheld, and the decision of the County Manager reversed by the Minister.  There must be Deputies sitting on all sides of the House who are members of local authorities and who must know that to be a fact.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think it is quite wrong to try to create the impression in the public mind that the right of appeal which is given in this section, and the rights of appeal which are given in other statutes, are mere formalities, put in there more or less to hoodwink and deceive the public.  That is not so.  I would like to hope that no Deputy is under any illusion as to what the real position is.  When <Col N="472" /> the Minister approaches these cases&mdash; many of them come up for personal Ministerial decision &mdash; he realises that he, in fact, is in the last resort the guardian of the rights of the individual citizen and that, if there is any doubt in the matter, so far as this Minister is concerned at any rate, it is the individual citizen who will get the benefit of the doubt.  I think, judging by what I have seen of the decisions of my predecessors, that is the general principle upon which Ministers act.  We realise that appeal provisions of this sort are inserted in statutes primarily for the protection of individuals, to ensure that no injustice is done to them and, therefore, unless it is quite clear that the public interest is the paramount and predominating interest and must prevail on its merits, not merely of its nature&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about an appeal to the Minister.  I am sure the county managers would also act reasonably, but if they do not, and an appeal is taken to the Minister, I am pointing out here that, in my view at any rate, it is the Minister's duty first of all to consider it judicially, and if there appears to be a complete balance of interest then, since a decision must be given one way or the other, I think that the rights of the individual should prevail.  The position, so far as I am concerned, is that if there is an equal balance of merit and a decision has to be given one way or the other, then in my view, by reason of the fact that an appeal provision is put into the statute for the protection of the rights of the individual, the Minister must decide in favour of the individual.  Therefore, an appeal from the county manager or from the local authority is a reality <Col N="473" /> and is not, as Deputy de Valera has suggested, a mere formality put in to copper-fasten the decision of the local authority.</P>
      <P>I think, furthermore, that Deputy de Valera's apprehensions in regard to the wording of Section 7 are not justified by experience.  In the explanatory memorandum it was pointed out that what was being done here was to revive certain powers which were vested temporarily in local authorities by Section 6 of the Housing (Additional Powers) Act, 1919.  That is to say, there is nothing novel being done under this section.  The fact is, so closely does this section correspond with the provisions of the Act of 1919, that exactly the same words have been used: that is to say, we have the same phrase &ldquo;in whole or in part or use otherwise than as a dwelling-house&rdquo;. The phrase which is to be found in Sections 7 and 8 of this Bill is to be found in precisely the same terms, with one minor exception, in the Act of 1919. In the Act of 1919 we have the same phrase &mdash;&ldquo;in whole or in part&rdquo;&mdash; the only difference is that where we use the singular they use the plural &mdash;&ldquo;or uses otherwise than as a dwellinghouse&rdquo;. Now, there have been no cases, so far as I know, or at any rate very few cases, in which there have been appeals under the Act of 1919. After all, we have to assume that, as we would act reasonably in our everyday affairs, so would authorities who are entrusted with the administration of a provision of that sort act reasonably. They sometimes, I concede, may not, but in general they do.  We know that hard cases make bad law.  We cannot legislate just simply for the hard case or for the abuse of authority. We are legislating here for a position which is very general; we are legislating for a position which has to be dealt with expeditiously because, as has been pointed out by those concerned with that position and with the state of affairs as it exists in Dublin, the Corporation of Dublin have been presented with an aggravation of their housing difficulties by reason of the fact that people have been demolishing dwelling-houses or converting them to other uses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, we have to take these <Col N="474" /> powers and give the authority and power to prevent that sort of thing. Having put a general stopper on it, if any person who wants to do it is prevented unreasonably and appeals to the Minister to be allowed to do it, if he wishes to do it reasonably in the existing circumstances, he will be permitted. I suggest that we cannot assume in view of the history of this type of legislation that it is going to be abused now or in the future.  I do not believe that anybody will say that it has been abused in the past.</P>

      <P>Before I pursue these points further, I would like to make it quite clear that I am in complete agreement with the Minister's intentions on this section.  I agree, however, with other Deputies that while the prevention of demolition is highly desirable, the county manager and the Minister, under the County Managerial Acts and the structure of the local government law, are cogs in one administrative machine.  Whatever the formal relationship of the county council may be, the manager is independent in a number of his functions of the county council.  He is answerable to the Minister through the prevalent condition in Local Government Acts that the sanction of the Minister must be obtained and that many matters are subject to the sanction or approval of the Minister.  According to the Managerial Act, whatever the formality the county manager is explicitly independent of the county council.  Those are the facts.  I am not suggesting that there is anything wrong but I am arguing on principle that it would be desirable to make the appeal independent of the administrative machine.  I do not want to be misunderstood and I am not in any way disputing what the Minister has said, but on principle I would like to see an independent appeal.  In regard to the mechanism of appeal the Minister by the very words he uses &ldquo;may come for personal Ministerial decision&rdquo; betrays the weakness inherent in it.  &ldquo;May come&rdquo; but why not all?  For the reason that so many of those people are not included.  This appeal is therefore exercised, as far as the public is concerned, by an anonymous civil servant.  I cannot see anything wrong in the system as it is <Col N="475" /> worked, but time goes on and the principle is wrong and I think in a situation like that that the machinery provided under Section 27 of the old Housing Act is preferable.  Let us take the facts at their face value.</P>
      <P>The real point of the difficulty is &ldquo;may come for personal Ministerial decision&rdquo;.  Appeals are multiplied not only under the new section but under the old Acts providing for Ministerial appeal.  If the Minister is going to deal with them all in that way there are bound to be delays and I am informed that even at present the Department has difficulty in dealing with the appeals which come in.  There is going to be no choice in the matter of expedition as between the appeal to a court or to the Minister.  The only way that the Minister could speed matters, when the number of appeals does multiply, would be to divide them among the officers in the Department, and that, I think, would be objectionable. I am taking this opportunity of bringing up the principle on this Bill. I have nothing to say in regard to demolition.</P>
      <P>Now, in regard to abuse, I agree with the Minister that nothing has happened up to date, but time goes on and circumstances change in regard to the interpretation of the law.  The danger in making legislation like this is that it opens up the way later to tighter controls.  The fact that there has been no abuse up to date is not, to my mind, a sufficient safeguard for the future.  Here is a case in which I would be definitely apprehensive.  Suppose that you have an area in the City of Dublin where the housing problem is acute and where the housing authority is trying &mdash; as they have been in many cases &mdash; to get people into every room and to use all the available floor space.  Now there is a serious temptation for a commercial or professional man, who is using his dwelling in part only, to make the other part available for housing.  Would that temptation be resisted?  The Minister has said that no such situation was intended.  Again, I repeat that my criticism is directed to the question of draftsmanship.  I am not contesting what the Minister says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="476" /> In fact I am in complete agreement with him.</P>
    <P>On the question of appeal &mdash; and here I am thinking of legislation in general &mdash; it would be wiser, in my opinion, to make use of the judicial machinery which is already in the State rather than to hamper the Administration by giving it a judicial function which it could not discharge any more expeditiously than the courts, if the volume of appeals is increased.</P>

      <P>From my personal experience, I agree with Deputy de Valera against the Minister and I think that the Minister appealed to Deputies who had experience in local administration. It is perfectly true that the county manager in his executive functions is largely independent of the local authority. The local authority only provides the necessary finances and the manager has the power to expend them provided that he expends them under <Col N="477" /> the proper sub-heading for which they are provided.  The Minister knows that very well.  The manager is a servant of the Minister and carries out the Minister's policy.  In this particular matter, as far as demolition is concerned, if an appeal went to the Minister the Minister would be almost certain to sanction the decision of the manager because the manager would be carrying out the Minister's policy. I think that a very good case has been made by Deputy de Valera to have the appeal to an independent tribunal.  That should be a part of the machine.</P>
      <P>There would not be very much difference in a managerial decision and a Ministerial decision because they would both be part of the scheme.  We are all aware of the fact that managers are occasionally called to the Custom House.  There they get full information about Ministerial policy.  That is why I say they are carrying out the Minister's policy.  In this particular matter the manager would be carrying out the Minister's policy.  There might be an issue as to whether the demolition of a particular house would be advantageous or beneficial to a district from the local point of view.  The county manager would be concerned with pleasing the Department and the Minister.  That would be his first concern and, in that respect, he would carry out the policy of the Minister. An impartial decision on an appeal in such a case could not be given so far as the Minister is concerned.  He could not turn down his manager if the manager was carrying out his policy. From my experience I agree 100 per cent with what Deputy Major de Valera has said.</P>

      <P>When this scheme becomes law, all flats will be subject to the control of the local authority, or the housing authority, as it is described. Unless the flat or flats comply with any recommendations or directions the authority may make, so far as alterations or repairs are concerned, the person occupying the flat, or the owner, may be ordered to comply with the directions given or else permission may be refused to use the flat as a flat.  There is, at the present time, a great shortage of building materials and a shortage of skilled labour.  Builders in general find it difficult to get either materials or labour to carry out repair work.  It is common knowledge that builders prefer, at the present time, to do construction work.  In fact very many of them will not undertake repair work. There is so much construction and house building work available that they are obliged to deal with the big work and to leave repairs on one side. Consequently, a number of people find it extremely difficult to get repairs of any kind carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Sections 11 and 12 unless these repairs are carried out, and unless the owner or occupier complies with the instructions of the local authority, he may find himself dispossessed.  I think some safeguard should be provided whereby a person who complies with certain minimum requirements should <Col N="480" /> not be obliged to carry out repairs which may not be strictly necessary and which, while desirable in normal circumstances, cannot in view of the present position be reasonably expected from people.  The people should not be put to the trouble, particularly during the present acute shortage of houses and flats, of seeking alternative accommodation. I would ask the Minister to consider a safeguard whereby, unless the flat is either uninhabitable or does not comply with the sanitary by-laws, no such alterations or repairs should be demanded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some remarks to make, additional to those made by Deputy Cosgrave, on Section 11.  I want to refer to a point which I indicated generally to the Minister on the Second Reading of this Bill.  Parsing sub-section (1) of Section 11 as it stands in the Bill we have: &ldquo;After the coming into operation of this section&rdquo;&mdash; that is, after the Act is passed &mdash;&ldquo;the owner of a premises shall not permit the premises to be used as a tenement house.&rdquo;  The Minister's amendment to that is, &ldquo;a person,&rdquo; apparently, line 42, page 5.  That really means that a person shall not permit the premises to be used as a tenement house, whether or not the premises were so used at such commencement or were previously so used without the permission, in writing, of the housing authority in whose functional area the premises are situate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, a tenement house shall not be used as a tenement house, where it was so used before, after the passing of this Act, without the permission of the housing authority.  I think that is a fair construction of the section. That is plainly what it means.  Therefore, let us take a case which I can conceive of as being anything but an exception.  We have a number of houses in Dublin at the moment which are sub-divided into flats or rooms.  They are tenements &mdash; they are used as tenements. Being used as a tenement at the moment, in many cases the flats are apportioned and they have the protection of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1946.  In other words, we have a house that is used as a tenement, occupied by <Col N="481" /> tenants who are protected by the Rent Act and who, under the authority of the Rent Act, 1946, are entitled to retain possession of their rooms and flats as against all comers, including the Minister for Local Government. Now what happens?  The housing authority refuses permission, for some reason or other, to the person or the owner &mdash; because in my humble submission that is what the section means and, if that had been used, it would have made the section a little bit clearer.  Probably what the Minister means is the landlord.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In one case it would be the owner.  In the hypothetical case which I am making it would be the landlord.  He is refused permission to let his tenement in flats. If he is refused permission, he is liable to a penalty.  The only way in which he can avoid that penalty is by taking steps to render that house no longer a tenement house: he can do that by clearing out his tenants.  But by another Act, piloted through this House by the Minister for Local Government, the tenants can say: &ldquo;We are staying here&rdquo;, and here is this landlord or owner caught between two fires.  He is liable under the Housing Act to a fine and he cannot get himself out of his difficulty by another Act.  I have mentioned this point before.  I mention it again now.  It is more than an academic point.  It ties up with what Deputy Cosgrave has said.  Under Section 7 the housing authority can refuse permission.  The housing authority may in its absolute discretion from time to time refuse permission for the purposes of Section 11 of this Act.  There is not even an appeal to the Minister.  There is absolute discretion and the word &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; there means &mdash; the housing authority in Dublin would be the city manager, if I interpret this aright&mdash; that the city manager can in his absolute discretion, with no appeal to the <Col N="482" /> Minister or to any other tribunal, decide that a house let in tenements shall not be so let in the future, and refuse his permission.  I am not suggesting that that absolute authority would be wrongly used.  Under sub-section (2) of Section 12 a housing authority granting permission may attach all or any of certain conditions to that permission &mdash; a condition as to repair, the number of dwellings, the maximum number of persons, and so on.</P>
      <P>It is quite certain that in the interests of sanitation the city manager, acting <i>bona fide</i> in pursuance of the powers conferred on him, would in the City of Dublin refuse permission in the case of a number of tenants.  That is one condition under this section.  I would ask the Minister then what is the position of the owner.  He seems to be forced into the automatic position of incurring the penalties provided by sub-section (2).  I think that is a serious thing for Dublin as a whole because a tenement house is actually defined in that section as a premises let in parts to two or more tenants.  That certainly covers flats.  A serious case occurs where you have overcrowding in certain slum areas, but they are protected.  I can quite conceive of cases arising under town planning where the town planning authority may say that they object to certain residential houses in the suburbs being let into small flats. We know that the town planning authority objects to that practice. There again the permission would be refused.  Whether the owner or landlord was personally responsible he would immediately find himself up against that refusal of permission and would be quite impotent to do anything about it.  He could not remove his tenants because they would be protected by the 1946 Act.  The 1946 Act virtually applies to all premises except a few specified in Section 2 of that Act. It applies to all houses erected before the 7th May, 1941, except for certain furnished lettings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one possible loophole. Under Section 37 something might conceivably be worked in there.  The landlord might find some ground detailed in Section 37 for an order of ejectment and the court would probably consider <Col N="483" /> ejectment reasonable in such a case. But I think it is much too chancy to rely on that.  The conflict to which I draw the Minister's attention is likely to be a very real one.  It cannot be met by amendment or by deleting &ldquo;whether or not the premises are so used&rdquo; at the commencement, or &ldquo;were previously so used.&rdquo;  Even if you wipe out that retrospective provision and make it prospective the difficulty still remains.  You might have a case where a house is permitted to be let in flats, and where at one stage that permission was desirable but at a subsequent stage undesirable. The problem arises there.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to avoid that anomaly.  If the provisions of this section are put into effect I would ask the Minister to do something to nullify that conflict.  Naturally enough we are all desirous to avoid slumdom in the future but at the moment in the City of Dublin there is a very serious housing deficiency.  The Rent Act of 1946 throws the owner or landlord of premises into an utterly impossible position.  I would ask the Minister to do something to avoid that without, of course, defeating the object he has in mind.</P>

      <P>I want to bring to the Minister's notice the fact that the Dublin Corporation are very vitally interested in sub-section (3) of Section 11 in so far as the definition on the Order Paper goes.  They are afraid that as it now stands it will lead to a certain amount of confusion in administration in the future.  Because of the housing shortage families are moving out from the centre of the city.  There is no longer room for them in the city and they are moving out into the suburbs. They are large families.  Simply because they are not in houses scheduled as tenements the local authority is precluded from housing them even though overcrowding definitely exists. At every other meeting of the Housing Committee of the Dublin Corporation some member brings up a case in a particular area where a family of five, six or seven children are housed in one room.  Because they are not within the regulations in so far as tenements <Col N="484" /> are concerned, the corporation is precluded from housing them.  They would lose the subsidy.  I would be quite satisfied, and so would the corporation, if that definition is made of general application so that families, no matter where they are, if they are overcrowded in the same way as they are in purely tenement areas, will come within the scope of the section and the local authority will be in a position to house them without loss of subsidy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that what is wrong with sub-section (3) of Section 11 is that it is intended to apply to tenement houses but that under this definition flats are also included.  I do not think the Minister intends that flats should be licensed or that they should come in the same category as tenement houses. I do not believe that the Minister cannot find a definition which would exempt flats from the provisions of this section and yet give the corporation what they want.</P>
      <P>It is absurd to say that a flat which may be let at a higher rent than the rent of the house itself is to be rated and come under the same regulations as a tenement house.  I believe that if the Minister thought over the matter between this and the Report Stage he could bring in a definition which would put flats outside the scope of this section.  There is no doubt that the provision of flats has tended to relieve some of the acute housing shortage in the cities.  Fourstorey houses which are far too big for an ordinary family nowadays are being turned into three or four flats, each storey becoming practically a self-contained flat.  I suggest to the Minister that that is a desirable provision and I do not see why such a house should come under the definition of a tenement house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to reinforce what some of the previous speakers have said about a person who finds that he is the owner of a tenement or a person who has allowed a house to become a tenement house without a licence from the housing authority.  Very many houses in the City of Dublin have become tenement houses absolutely against the wishes of their owners.  Coming along <Col N="485" /> to a house which is occupied by several families and saying to the occupants: &ldquo;No authority has been given by the local housing authority for this to become a tenement house and you will all be evicted,&rdquo; is something that just cannot be permitted to occur in present-day circumstances.  One could bring the Minister round and show him houses which are in process of decay.  When a house has got to a certain stage of decay, some person is left in charge.  Sometimes that person occupies a certain portion of the house and sometimes he does not.  The house is let to some person who proceeds to let other people into it.  One would want a private detective force going round these houses continually to detect what houses have become tenement houses.  I do not think that the Minister or the corporation can do away with this practice.</P>
    <P>For instance, it is well known to everybody that the Dublin Corporation themselves are in difficulties with tenants and, with the housing shortage as acute as it is, apparently no power can prevent a parent, say, from taking in a married daughter or son into his house, or in other cases, where a person's means are very attenuated, letting a single room in a dwelling to another person who will practically pay the entire rent of the premises.  I think the Minister ought to become a realist and try to bring in some definition which will exclude flats but include tenement houses.  I make him a present of his efforts to prevent houses becoming tenement houses.  I only wish to join in the protest made by previous speakers in regard to the luckless individual who is in charge of a premises and who is presented with a <i>fait accompli</i> and is then hailed before some court for allowing something to occur which occurs naturally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that this section would be all right if the date at the end of it were changed.  Everybody would agree with the principle of it if there were sufficient premises available to house the people who may be dispossessed if the housing authority attempts to enforce its rights.  There must be many thousands of ordinary semi-detached <Col N="486" /> houses in Dublin, apart from tenement houses, where the owners have rented a flat to enable them to pay the expenses of the house.  All such houses will be affected by this section.  I can foresee great difficulty if owners of houses are told that they cannot any longer have a sub-tenant in a flat.</P>
      <P>The question will arise: where are the people in these houses to go? It is well known that there is not even one vacant room in the City of Dublin at present.  I can see that there will be great inconvenience caused to people generally if this section is properly enforced after the 1st July, 1948. If the date were left open and it was stated that the section would come into force on such date as the Minister may appoint, I think that would meet the case.</P>
      <P>I also suggest that there should be a right of appeal to the Minister similar to the right contained in Section 7.  It is giving too much discretion altogether to the housing authority to give it an absolute right to decide when premises can be used for more than one dwelling.  In order to safeguard both the occupiers and the owners who may suffer loss and inconvenience, I suggest that the Minister should include a sub-section giving a right of appeal to the Minister similar to the right of appeal under Section 7.</P>

      <P>I agree with what the other speakers have said. From the point of view of the Dublin Corporation, unless this section is altered considerably to define exactly what a tenement is and to make a distinction between what is commonly known as a tenement &mdash; namely a house which is occupied by many families in a poor district &mdash; and the definition given in sub-section (3) of this section, the job that the Dublin Corporation will have to do will be nearly impossible. They will have to compile a register giving particulars of every house in the City of Dublin which is occupied by more than one family.  Under this section a house which is occupied by only two families will be a tenement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether any local authority working over a large area, such as Dublin Corporation, will really <Col N="487" /> be able to carry out that work in an efficient manner.  I think we shall have the unfortunate experience of finding that, immediately this Bill has gone through, it in fact will never be put into operation because it simply cannot be put into operation.  The whole section bristles with difficulties. Another difficulty, what I might call a contingent difficulty in large areas, is to know who is a member of the working-class or what rent such a person should pay in connection with sub-section (2).</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

      <P>Might I suggest to the Minister that where a family is residing in a house, not described as a tenement, and paying perhaps 30/- for one room in an outlying district, he should withdraw the ban on such a person getting a corporation house merely because he is not in a house described as a tenement?  A number of cases of that type come before the corporation. A young married couple with one, two or three children occupy a room in a house because the owner of the house let it to them through kindness or was compelled through financial circumstances to let the room.  The room is let at £1 or 30/- a week, and the young people who occupy it eventually apply to the corporation for a cottage or other accommodation.  Although they occupy only one room, because the house is not described as a tenement, they are not permitted to come under the various headings which would qualify them to get a corporation house.  How this section will be worked I do not know.  Whether it is that the corporation will not get a subsidy if they give a house to such a person I cannot say. The point I want to make clear is that where a young couple are paying say 30/- a week for a room in an ordinary house, because it is not described as a tenement, an application from them for a new house cannot be considered by the corporation.  I appeal to the Minister to withdraw that ban.</P>

What about certain people who have already done it, and who have already, as far as the actual act of commission is concerned, committed an offence?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;After the coming into operation of this section a person shall not permit a premises to be used as a tenement house, whether or not the premises are so used at such commencement or were previously so used.&rdquo;  That house is already occupied by these flat dwellers, these protected tenants.  The act is already done.  When this Act comes into operation, he is already permitting these people to reside there because he cannot do otherwise.  It is a continual permission.  You cannot interpret that word &ldquo;permit&rdquo; in different ways.  It would always be interpreted as the first act of permitting. Within the meaning of the section, it is permitting the occupation of the flat as a tenement, in spite of a refusal of permission and he is powerless to discontinue that permission.  I see what the Minister is going to say.  He is going to say that he is continuing this permission no longer because he is in actual fact coerced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is what is in the Minister's mind, I think it should be made clear because where you leave two statutes in conflict, such as these statutes are, you are leading the way to trouble.  If that is what the Minister wants to do he should incorporate in the Bill a provision withdrawing the protection of the Rent Restrictions Act from tenants in cases where this permission has been refused.  If that is done, however, it opens up immense possibilities.  It is giving a right of appeal under the Housing Acts to a local authority.  In my humble submission, this whole section needs reconsideration.  Interpretation will be <Col N="490" /> rendered a little more difficult in view of the fact that there is an explicit reference to the Rent Restrictions Act in Section 13 in the draft Bill, but the Minister now proposes to delete that section and he provides a definition under Section 13 which is on all fours with the definition in the Rent Restrictions Act, with the significant exception or modification that the determining authority is the housing authority.  Instead of the opinion of the court it is now the opinion of the housing authority.  That should be taken into consideration on the question of the construction of the statute. I think there is a potential conflict between the two statutes, and that should be dealt with by the House.</P>
    <P>In order to do what the Minister intends, in a straightforward way, we should incorporate a sub-section in Section 11 pointing out that, upon the refusal of permission, the protection afforded by the Rent Restrictions Acts in regard to recovery of possession is withdrawn and shall not apply.  That would be the direct and proper way of doing what the Minister intends.  But I would even object to that, too, because it brings in the whole question of how a housing authority could be used to get over the Rent Restrictions Acts. In order to evade their provisions it would only be necessary to make an application to the housing authority and manoeuvre it so that in Dublin the county manager in his absolute discretion would refuse.  For that reason that direct method of approach to the section is dangerous.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter.  It is by no means clear that there is protection for the unfortunate landlord who has, so to speak, already committed the offence, and there will be any amount of potential trouble in the courts later between the two Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with the simpler issues first, I think the apprehensions which Deputy O'Sullivan expressed on behalf of the Dublin Corporation as to the effect of sub-section (3) of the section are not very well founded.  The definition of &ldquo;tenement house&rdquo; is confined to the section <Col N="491" /> and it does not affect the definition which appears in any other statute or regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the definition given now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It relates only to the purposes of this section and does not go outside that.  It does not amend or alter any definition of &ldquo;tenement house&rdquo; which may be embodied in any other statute or regulation.  Therefore, I think the apprehensions or fears of the Dublin Corporation in respect of that are not well founded.</P>
      <P>As to the point made by Deputy Dockrell, Senior, about the unfairness of applying the term &ldquo;tenement house&rdquo; to better-class dwellings, which are generally described as flats, I am prepared to go into that.  The problem of finding a definition which would cover our whole purpose has given us great concern.  We devoted a great deal of attention to it, but we have not been able to find anything so comprehensive as the term we have used here. You could not use &ldquo;apartment house&rdquo; and I do not think we could use &ldquo;a house already used for flats&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In order to meet that particular point, we shall have this matter examined again to see whether we cannot, so far as the definition of the premises to which these sections are intended to apply is concerned, get one more generally acceptable than the term used here.  Even if we do reexamine this question of the designation of the premises, it will still be necessary to exercise control over the creation of flats and over the conversion of dwelling-houses into flats in Dublin City.  Very often a flat is a half-way house to a tenement.  A district, the houses in which have been converted in an improvised, hurried and unsatisfactory way into flats, very quickly degenerates into a slum.  That is an aspect we cannot lose sight of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing we must face up to is that we cannot just discuss these problems in an abstract way; we cannot discuss these sections in that form. We have to relate them to the very serious problem which exists in Dublin &mdash; the slum problem &mdash; and we have to <Col N="492" /> bear in mind the manner in which these slums came into existence.  They were brought into existence in two ways: first of all, the pressure of persons who were without accommodation looking for accommodation, and then, again, the pressure of economic circumstances upon other people who happened to have accommodation which they found too large for their requirements or too expensive for their incomes.  It was in that way, through the operation of these two factors, that our present Dublin slums were created.</P>
    <P>We have exactly these circumstances beginning to operate.  We have many districts which, prior to the war, were first-class residential districts, rapidly losing their character in that regard, and we find houses formerly in the occupation of one family now being adapted for the occupation of other families.  We are, in fact, in the first stage in the development of new slum districts in Dublin.  Unless we do something to curb and check that, we shall have as extensive slums in our first-class residential districts as we have already in those quarters of our city which were the residences of the governing classes 120 or 130 years ago. We shall reproduce in the suburbs of this city perhaps the same conditions as exist to-day in the very heart of the city.  It is in order to prevent that development, if we can, that these sections have been introduced.  You cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but, when a public purpose has to be served, and when a social problem of this magnitude has to be dealt with, I do not think we can allow our judgment to be entirely overborne by our sympathy for the egg, no more than the Deputy would regard the hen as a bereaved mother when he was eating her off-spring, even in the form of an egg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>A very biological kind of argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is, of course, a very difficult one by reason of <Col N="493" /> the fact, as Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy de Valera pointed out, that the problem we are trying to deal with has already developed to a very great extent and many houses which were not designed for the purpose of being utilised as flats have been converted into flats.  Some of them have been converted much more skilfully than others, but, in any event, there has been an element of improvisation in relation to the whole, and attempts have been made to adapt, for the purpose of housing a considerable number of families, structures which were originally designed for the habitation of only one.  As has been pointed out here, that has developed to quite a considerable extent in the City of Dublin, but the point is: are we going to allow that to continue, merely because it will inconvenience a great number of people if we try to stop or curb it?  That is the real issue. The choice is a choice, if you like, of two evils, but which will Deputies regard as the greater: the creation of new slums in Dublin or the inconvenience to which some people may be put, if we try to restrict that development?</P>
      <P>I think that, bearing in mind the eyesores which the slums already constitute, the reproach which they are to past and present generations, we certainly would not be justified in allowing new slums to be created to stand as a reproach to us in the eyes of those who come after us.  That is the position and I think we shall have to decide for ourselves that, even if it does inconvenience and perhaps inflict hardship upon those who have already allowed their residences, their houses or their property to be converted into flats, we shall have to endeavour to ensure that, so far as the future is concerned, the existing flats and those which it is proposed to create in future will be brought under control.  There is no way in which you can exercise that control, unless you give the local authority, in addition to the power to grant or refuse permission for the conversion, the power to grant or refuse permission for the continued occupation of existing flats where the conversion has taken place without the permission of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> I think there is a great deal of merit in the arguments advanced by Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy de Valera and I have been considering how we might mitigate the consequences of these sections in so far as existing owners and tenants of flats are concerned.  I do not think, for the reasons which I have already given in dealing with Deputy Sheldon's amendment No. 8, that there is anything to be gained by deferring the date upon which this section will come into operation.  If we were to defer the date we should simply encourage the conversion of premises into flats and we should have this conversion carried through at an accelerated rate in order to make certain that, if you like, the harm would be done when the section began to operate.  Therefore, I do not propose to do as Deputy O'Connor suggested &mdash; postpone the operation of this section to some indefinite future date&mdash;we will stand by the date we have in the section.  Nor do I think that I could meet the problem in the way which Deputy de Valera has referred to, that of depriving the tenant of the protection of the Rent Restrictions Acts in any case in which the permission of the housing authorities has been refused.  This, as the Deputy pointed out, would simply mean that persons would try to avail of the provisions of Sections 11 and 12 in order to relieve themselves of the restrictions imposed upon them by the Rent Restrictions Acts.</P>
    <P>I think, subject to further consideration, that perhaps the position might be met if, in line 45, we were to insert after the word &ldquo;authority&rdquo; or perhaps after the word &ldquo;permission&rdquo;, the proviso that the permission should not be unreasonably refused, and then give to a person who felt that the permission had been unreasonably refused a right of appeal to either the District Court or the Circuit Court. In present circumstances that is as far as we could go to meet the objections raised by Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy de Valera.  While not committing myself specifically to that remedy, I shall look into the matter between now and Report Stage to see whether we can draft an amendment embodying that proviso.</P>

I intend to deal with that matter on that section, but there would be a potential contradiction, if that sub-section were not amended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but I refer to it as arising out of the Minister's reply to my general criticism.  Everybody agrees and sympathises with this effort to prevent the growth of slums. There is no question about that.  There is another point in this connection. What exactly is meant by the term &ldquo;owner of premises&rdquo;?  Dwelling-houses and tenements are defined in the Bill and then it suddenly speaks here of &ldquo;owners of premises&rdquo;.  Sections 7, 8 and 9 deal with habitable houses and dwelling-houses, but now we have this word &ldquo;premises&rdquo;.  What is the purpose of using that word here and what is the distinction between &ldquo;premises&rdquo; and &ldquo;dwelling-houses or habitable houses"?  Presumably, it is intended to cover business and other sorts of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also another matter which would be material in relation to the Minister's proposed amendment on Report Stage.  This section has some implications in regard to the general principle of subletting.  At the present moment, except in the case of a statutory tenant or a tenant forbidden by contract to sublet, a tenant is entitled to sublet his premises or he is entitled to sublet part of his premises. <Col N="496" /> This appears to me to alter very materially the law in regard to the subletting of premises.  I have not examined very closely what the general consequences of that are, but it may be desirable to consider that aspect when considering the potentialities of the Rent Act.  For instance, a provision that would make a statutory tenant under the Rent Act unable to let without permission may come into question on this section as it stands.</P>
    <P>All I can say in conclusion is that the Minister would be forced, on the viewpoint he is now adopting in this regard, to recast the section but I want to make it clear that I am asking him to do nothing in regard to its context.  The context is very proper; what he wishes to do is very proper; it is merely a question of doing it without coming into conflict with other branches of the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a great deal of what Deputy de Valera has said.  Nobody, I think, disagrees in principle with this section.  The section is unworkable as it now stands and will need recasting for Report Stage. I would like to put this point of view to the Minister, that its unworkability mainly lies in the fact that in the section he is trying to cover conversion and present use of tenements.  I would submit to the Minister that it will be very difficult to do that in one section.  He will want two sections. Speaking from the point of view of the Dublin Corporation, I think conversion is adequately covered by the present town planning rules and regulations. No premises can be converted into use as flats without plans being lodged and passed by the city architects and without coming before the town planning committee and town planning authorities generally.  In connection with what I might call the present use of tenements, which is the big problem, we have found in the corporation time and time again that we would like to alter conditions in various tenements but we are up against the problem that the owners of these bad slums in many cases have no money and cannot do a thing to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the corporation step in, they must either purchase the property or try to <Col N="497" /> get the owner to carry out the necessary improvements and repairs.  What is to be done with the tenants while the premises are undergoing repairs?  We cannot clean up the present tenement system in Dublin faster than we can build houses.  That fundamental fact will make this section absolutely inoperative, notwithstanding that every authority, the local authority and the Minister's Department, wish all the good in the world to the principle contained in the section.</P>
    <P>In brief, what I want to put to the Minister is that we all agree with the section but, unless it is very considerably altered, it will be completely unworkable. If it is completely unworkable the end we all have in view will not be achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems strangely approprivate that the Minister for Local Government should be responsible for so completely a Marie Antoinette section as this.  In effect, what this section is, is a claim on the part of Oireachtas Eireann to go down to a potential tenement like those in Lower Dominick Street and to say to the wretched people who are living in these nauseating warrens: &ldquo;You must not live here.&rdquo;  What one amongst them wants to live there?  What has them living there?  It is that they have nowhere else to live.  How many people would live in the three tenement houses at the foot of Dominick Street, on the east side, if there were any other place in God's creation that they could live? But this twentieth century Marie Antoinette is going to go down to them and say: &ldquo;You have not got bread; you must eat cake.  It is quite intolerable for you to go on living on plain dry bread in a tenement room in Dominick Street.&rdquo;  He has not yet learned that what brings people into tenement rooms is that they have nowhere else to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is not it humiliating to be passing legislation in this House giving the local authority power to prohibit householders from turning their houses into tenements so long as there are potential tenants for such tenements?  There is only one way to stop houses becoming tenements, that is, to provide <Col N="498" /> houses into which people can go when they want somewhere to rest their heads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Public Libraries Bill has its origin in two sources&mdash;first of all, the pressing need to improve the library services in certain areas and, secondly, the necessity to make permanent arrangements for the carrying on of the Irish Central Library for Students and for the administration of that body. Perhaps the House would like to hear a few brief words on the history of library legislation leading up to the present Bill.</P>
      <P>The Public Libraries Act of 1855 enabled urban authorities to strike a penny in the pound rate for library services.  The 1902 Act extended that power to rural district councils.  The 1920 Public Libraries Act raised the maximum rate to be struck for library services to threepence, and in the case of county boroughs to sixpence.  The Local Government Act, 1925, transferred the powers from rural district councils to county councils and enabled county councils to absorb or administer urban council library services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time, there are library administrations for county boroughs and for all county councils&mdash; in one case, there being a joint library council.  The Dún Laoghaire Corporation has its own library service and there are services for the Clonmel and Bray municipal bodies.  Until recently, the limitation upon the expenditure of the library service has constituted a hampering factor.  Under the Local Government Act, 1946, the limitation was removed.  Library authorities are <Col N="500" /> now enabled to spend such sums as they consider advisable for the service. As a result of the removal of these impedimenta to the extension of the library service, the salaries of librarians have been very largely increased&mdash;in some cases by nearly 100 per cent.&mdash;and new improved scales of salaries for librarians have been adopted in every county.  Arising from that, it will be possible to stipulate higher education standards and greater training in library service when new appointments are being made.</P>
    <P>I have referred up to now to what might be described as the negative impedimenta to the improvement of the library service.  I should like to give the House a few facts about the present state of the service.  Taking a typical county where the service is fairly well organised, there were 75,000 books issued in one year, of which 15,000 were non-fiction, i.e., 20 per cent, which is not an unsatisfactory proportion, having regard to the general habits of the reading public. It will be interesting to note that of the 15,000 non-fiction issued, 10,000 related to travel, biography, history and social science, showing there is a very keen interest in those subjects among the reading public.  Again, 5,700 books were issued to young people, juveniles, of which about 8 per cent. were non-fiction.  The variation in the reading of the non-fiction class in this particular county varied from 10 to 38 per cent, showing a very great difference in the habits of the reading public in different areas.</P>
    <P>The general proportion of non-fiction books read is interesting, when one considers the desirability of improving the general education.  It varies from 12 to 20 per cent. and the number of active borrowers per 100 of the population in a county area varies from 7 to 15, a few counties having still higher figures.  It is quite obvious that there is great room for improvement in the library service when that percentage is borne in mind.  In Dublin, the figures for the issue of non-fiction books are very satisfactory, being one-third the total issue.  Another remarkable fact is that the high percentage of non-fiction issues to juveniles, in the <Col N="501" /> case of Dublin, is one-fifth of the total number of juvenile books issued.</P>
    <P>In the country at large, there are about 2,600 book centres and the rate struck varies &mdash; with a few exceptions&mdash; from 1d. to 3d. in the £.  The total expenditure in a recent year for the library services for the whole country was some £90,000, of which approximately half was devoted to the salaries of the officers and about one-third was expended on books.  It is the object of any local authority to increase the percentage of expenditure on books and one can judge in some ways the efficiency and the activity of a library service by the proportion of money spent on the purchase of books, compared with the total expenditure on service.</P>
    <P>I should like next to deal with some of the advances that have been made in recent years by librarians, in the way of making improvements in the library service and in the ancillary activities that go with it.  In a few areas, librarians who, by reason of their particular qualifications and their personalities, and by reason of the co-operation they received from the local body, have been able to go ahead and make progress with their work.  In some counties they have instituted travelling vans to bring books to people in remote areas.  In certain counties the librarian has been able to found a society for studying the history of the locality or has been able to make a collection of the books relating to the history of a town or city.  He is encouraged to give lectures in his local area.  In some cases, the librarian has actually written, for public perusal, the history of famous personages born in the area over which he exercises control.  In certain areas the librarian has made a collection of photographs of famous historical monuments, churches and places of interest. One librarian, and I think there may be more than one, has a stock of gramophone records which are given out on loan to individuals or societies.</P>
    <P>There has been a development in the way of providing pictures as the nucleus for an art collection and art exhibitions.  Art exhibitions have been held in many places, and in these the librarian has played a notable part as <Col N="502" /> organiser.  Lectures on the subject of education, and of general cultural, local and national importance have been given in one or two areas, sometimes with indifferent success.  In one county during last winter, despite poor climatic conditions, 40 lectures were given, and the attendance of 3,040 persons indicates the desirability of providing further facilities for an extension of that particular activity.  Of very great importance has been the work of a number of librarians in preparing lists of books for farmers, books on the theoretical side of farming as well as books by practical farmers dealing with new processes and new methods.  Some librarians have cooperated very closely with the Young Farmers' Club movement by providing lectures for members and suggesting books that are suitable for farmers, as well as making lists of books available for such bodies as Muintir na Tíre. Active librarians have also prepared special book lists to encourage readers, who read only fiction, to extend their reading to non-fiction.</P>
    <P>A further activity has been the close co-operation that exists between the librarian and the local dramatic societies. Everybody knows that the Little Theatre movement is spreading very rapidly throughout the country.  The librarian can be a very great help to dramatic societies by suggesting plays, by providing copies of plays and in other ways.  I mention all that in order to demonstrate that a librarian can be endowed with many qualifications, and that he can act as a very important educational influence in his area.</P>
    <P>The need for an extension of the library service will be apparent to everyone.  First of all, there is very great need to provide books for children, books which they can bring home and read during the long winter nights. That will tend to increase the sphere of what may be described as general education for children.  Secondly, everyone will agree that anything that can be done to teach people, living in a local community, the history of their particular area can be of great advantage to the country.  Thirdly, I need hardly advert to the growing importance of what may be described as adult <Col N="503" /> education&mdash;the capacity of people to understand the complexity of the world in which we live, to understand sociological problems, foreign affairs and the history of countries when they reach adult age.  In many cases they only begin to do that when they reach the age of 25 or 30.  Until such time as we can all have facilities for adult education the present library service will provide an alternative.  One may say that at present the history of Ireland and of Europe is rooted in the past.  We can no longer be isolationists, since what goes on in China is indirectly of importance to this country, so that the more one learns about foreign countries and their customs and ways the better.  It will be better for us all, better from the standpoint of our facing future problems.  It is, therefore, desirable that, as far as possible, the library service should be a vital centre of self-education.</P>
    <P>In saying that I am not decrying the value of fiction.  Fiction has an educational value, and, therefore, what we need in many areas are more books and a greater number of book centres with better buildings, better facilities for juveniles, improved catalogues and improved methods of advertising so as to bring good reading to the people.  We need to bring books to the people on a far more extensive basis than before.  I should say that admirable work is being done in many areas.</P>
    <P>There have been difficulties, which were hard to overcome, such as shortages of books, and with regard to the binding of books damaged by borrowers, while in many cases the buildings are inadequate.  It is nobody's fault that that is so.  The local authorities have pressing problems to deal with, such as housing, sewerage, health and water services, and they have found it difficult to devote attention to a sphere of activity such as this, having regard to its special character, and the fact that very few people in this country have the training or qualifications to administer a library service.  There has been a great extension in reading.  I suppose 50 per cent. more books are being borrowed from the local authority public libraries to-day than there were 15 <Col N="504" /> years ago, but there can be still greater advantages.</P>
    <P>At some recent date the Library Association of Ireland presented a memorandum to the Minister for Local Government making suggestions for an improvement in the library service. Many of the proposals made by the association have been adopted and are now in the Bill before the House.  I must now say a few words about the Central Library.  It was established in 1923 at 53 Upper Mount Street, Dublin, by the Carnegie Trust.  Its purpose was to strengthen the resources of the local libraries by providing them with a reserve of special and expensive books, not read very often except by students.  That saves a great deal of unnecessary expenditure by the local libraries, since the Central Library acts as a reserve bank for other libraries throughout the country. The Central Library can borrow a book for a student in the most remote part in Clare from another library.  It can borrow books from the National Library, from the universities, from the Royal Irish Academy, from the Royal Dublin Society, and from two English libraries and can loan that book to a student who otherwise would be unable to procure it or pay for it.  In return for that, the Central Library loans books to those institutions, so that there is a backward and a forward movement of books dealing with special subjects.  The library has been in operation for 24 years and at the present time costs about £3,000 annually.</P>
    <P>As many Deputies know the Carnegie Trust encourages the establishment of bodies and institutions for widening and broadening culture and other sociological purposes.  Primarily, its function is to establish new institutions and help some new services, and then hand over the enterprise at a later date when it has been placed on a sound footing.  It is high time that the Central Library was taken over by the country, bearing in mind the general tradition of the Carnegie Trust in such matters.  I should add that we owe a debt of gratitude to the Carnegie Trust for the interest they have taken in the library service in general in past <Col N="505" /> years.  We have been assured that when this Bill is passed and they cease finally to contribute to the Central Library, that will not mean a diminution in the income to this country from that source.  In actual fact, they have already been in contact with young farmers' clubs and visited this country recently with a view to seeing to the expenditure of additional moneys.</P>
    <P>The Carnegie Trust desire to hand over the Central Library as a gift; to hand over the books, equipment and capital assets.  They have agreed to contribute to the expenditure incurred in the administration of the library on a diminishing basis.  In the first year they will contribute an amount equal to that which the Central Library cost in the current year.  In the second year, they will contribute 20 per cent. less and so forth until finally they will cease to contribute any funds whatever.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to establish a permanent body who will co-ordinate and assist the library service of this country and who will manage the Central Library.  The members of the House will notice that, in providing a council for the new body, a fair balance has been struck between the &ldquo;academic&rdquo; and the &ldquo;local&rdquo; elements.  As well as representatives of local authorities, it will also comprise persons nominated by the universities and by the National Library who are specially fitted to assist in the improvement of the library service. We felt that it was eminently desirable to have a statutory authority other than a Government Department to administer the service and to help its improvement.  We hope that the members who will be appointed will be specially qualified to deal with the various problems which may arise.</P>
    <P>The universities, the County Councils' General Council, the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland and the Library Association have expressed their willingness to co-operate in the work of the council.</P>
    <P>Sections 16 and 17 deal with the financing of this council.  There will be two kinds of expenditure.  There will be the expenditure involved in the normal running of the Central Library, which is estimated at £5,000 a year.  The Minister for Finance <Col N="506" /> has agreed to contribute £2,500 or half the cost, whichever is the less.  The moiety will be assessed on the county councils and the county boroughs in proportion to their valuations, following the precedent of the Local Appointments Commissioners and the combined purchasing section of the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>The Carnegie Trust will contribute in a diminishing degree for a number of years.  One of the first functions of the Central Library will be to appoint surveyors.  We hope that they will travel to one or two countries where conditions are similar to those obtaining here, particularly to countries which have a largely agricultural population, in order to acquaint themselves with the way in which library services are organised outside this country.  They will also survey the existing library service.  They can make general proposals to the Library Council, who can then make them to the Minister.  They will give advice to existing local authorities and try to raise the standard of the service, in order to get the most perfect service possible.  The local authorities will be perfectly free to accept or reject their advice.  It is hoped that in areas where the service is inadequate there will be a gradual improvement as the years go by.  The Minister for Finance, under this Bill, can contribute to the local authorities such sums as are considered desirable for the improvement of the service.</P>
    <P>Most of the sections of the Bill are self-explanatory but I should like to run through some of them.  Section 1 is the usual definition section.</P>
    <P>Section 2 establishes a body to be called &ldquo;An Comhairle Leabharlanna&rdquo;, the functions of which will be to run the Central Library for Students and to assist the local authorities to improve the services.</P>
    <P>Section 3 sets out the functions of the Central Library, that is, the kind of library that will be run directly by the council.  It is the type specially directed to students and its issue of books will continue as heretofore.  It is not confined to local libraries but will be prepared to assist other libraries and individuals directly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="507" /> I have already referred to Section 4, sub-section (2), which is linked to Section 16 and which empowers the council to receive a grant.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) of Section 4 is intended to enable the council to continue the fruitful co-operation with the Hospitals Library Council.  It is not, of course, contemplated that the council will take over the functions of the Hospitals Library Council.  The purpose of sub-section (3) is simply to enable the two bodies to co-operate if they think it desirable.</P>
    <P>No further comment is necessary on Section 5 except to say that each person nominated by the County Councils' General Council and the Association of Municipal Authorities must be a member of a local authority and he must cease to be a member of the council if he ceases to be a local representative. In addition one of the representatives of the Association of Municipal Authorities must be a member of the corporation of a county borough.  Apart from the four county boroughs, very few urban authorities have library services independent of the county council. It is also provided that the representative of the &ldquo;approved association&rdquo; shall be a member or officer of a local authority and the library association will be asked to nominate a member under this provision.  The membership of the Library Association of Ireland is not confined to local authorities and in view of the fact that there will be six representatives from the two universities and from the National Library, it is thought well to ensure that there will also be six representatives of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Sections 6 and 7 call for no comment.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Section 8 is to deem the council to be a local authority for the purposes set out in the Schedule, that is, the appointment, remuneration and removal of officers and servants, their superannuation, travelling and subsistence allowances, auditing of accounts, the removal of members and the various legal provisions relating to those matters, so far as they would be applicable to a body of this sort.  The effect is to put the council on all fours with the local authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> Section 9 enables the council to make by-laws for the conduct of the Central Library.</P>
    <P>Section 10 transfers the staff now employed by the Carnegie Trust to the Council of the Central Library and safeguards the pension right of two existing pensionable officers.  The Carnegie Trust has agreed to contribute a portion of the pensions just as if the trust had been a local authority.</P>
    <P>No comment is required on Sections 11 to 15 except to say that Section 12 relating to insurance does not conflict with No. 7 of the Schedule which also deals with insurance.  The provision in the Schedule is to enable the council to take part in mutual assurance.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to Sections 16 and 17 of the Bill.  Of the remaining sections only Section 19 calls for comment. This section repeals Section 89 of the Local Government Act, 1941, which enabled local authorities to contribute to the funds of the Central Library for Students.  In fact no local authority did so contribute and now that the Central Library is being transferred to the council the provision is obsolete.</P>
    <P>I hope that the House will agree with the provisions of this Bill.  The library service has frequently been called &ldquo;the Cinderella of local services&rdquo;.  It started from small beginnings, it progressed very slowly and needs improvement to a very great degree in some areas.</P>
    <P>This Bill will enable experts to assist every local authority.  The action of such local authorities is purely voluntary and for the first time the Minister for Finance has declared his willingness to assist local authorities in regard to improvements.  I cannot help feeling that this is one contribution to various measures taken by the Government to encourage people to remain in the rural areas.  In a country with our climate and with the long winter evenings, nothing is more necessary than to make available to people books of every kind. It is not an expensive service.  Any Deputy who is a member of a local authority will know immediately that a total expenditure of £90,000 in the year is very small compared with the total expenditure of all local authorities <Col N="509" /> on all services.  An immense amount of good can be done everywhere&mdash;in the remotest hamlet and up in the hills&mdash;by improvement of the services at what, inevitably, would be a very reasonable cost, coupled with such capital expenditure as may be necessary for the improvement of buildings.  In that connection these moneys could, under suitable conditions, be borrowed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  I think that any measures which may be taken to increase the library services throughout the country must be of benefit to the country.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has said, it is particularly necessary, if the drift of the rural population is to be stemmed, that there should be proper library services.  The only criticism I would offer is that, possibly, the Bill does not go far enough.  It depends largely on the energy and activity of the particular council appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be more suitable if the administration of this Bill were left under the Department of Education rather than under that of the Department of Local Government.  It might then be easier to have arrangements made whereby the local school-houses throughout the country could be used as depôts for books&mdash;in the first instance as small lending libraries for children's books and in the second instance as depôts for other books sent out by the local authority.  It might be worth considering whether the whole of this scheme should not be operated by the Department of Education rather than by the Department of Local Government.  The library services in the country have done a tremendous amount of good work.  As the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned, they are not limited entirely to the provision of books.  They include, also, the organisation of lectures, showing of films, and so on.  In that connection it occurs to me that it might be worth considering the inclusion in Section 3 of the Bill of a provision which would enable the new Central Library to organise lectures, in other words, not to limit their functions purely and <Col N="510" /> simply to the provision of books.  A small sub-paragraph in Section 3 could empower the new body to organise or make provision for the organisation of lectures, showing of films and even concerts.</P>
    <P>In sub-section (3) of Section 4 it might be well to include provisions which would enable the council to arrange for the supply of books to prisons, to the Army and to other institutions of that kind.  The Parliamentary Secretary explained that the purpose of Section 3 is to enable arrangements to be made in relation to the supply of books to hospitals which is an extension of the existing arrangement which is under the care of the Minister for Health.  It might be well, if the provisions of the Bill are not sufficiently wide, to make specific provision which would enable the Minister to organise the supply of books to the Army, prisons, industrial schools and so on.</P>
    <P>There is one paragraph in Section 5&mdash; paragraph (h) sub-section (3) of Section 5&mdash;which I do not quite understand. Possibly the Parliamentary Secretary might enlighten us as to the exact purpose of it.  Section 5 provides for the appointment of the council.  Then provision is made for the appointment of nominees of the governing bodies of the different universities, of local authorities, of the Association of the Municipal Authorities of Ireland, and finally, &ldquo;one on that&rdquo;, namely, of the nomination, &ldquo;of an association approved by the Minister, the objects of which include the advancement of the work of public libraries in the State.&rdquo;  I do not know what particular organisation this was intended to cover.  I think it might be useful if some information were forthcoming in that respect.  I have no objection to a representative of any association, whose aim is the advancement of public libraries in the State, being on this council.  I would suggest that it might be a good thing to widen the scope of the paragraph in order not to limit it to one such organisation.  I have in mind the Central Catholic Library. Possibly a representative of the Central Catholic Library would be useful and the advice of such a representative might be helpful to the council. <Col N="511" /> I notice that sub-section (6) of the same section seems to provide that a person nominated by an approved association, referred to in paragraph (h), has to be a member or an officer of a local authority.  I do not think that is very wise.  I do not see why, if a person is appointed from an outside association, it should be a condition precedent that that person should be a member or an officer of a local authority.  We might find much better material outside the members of local authorities for work of this nature.  We might find some educationists who would be far more suited and qualified to deal with a matter of this kind.  I would urge the Minister to consider to what extent it would be possible to make arrangements whereby the local schools could be utilised, firstly, as a lending library for the children's books, and, secondly, in the country districts, as a depôt wherein books might be deposited by the local authorities for the immediate rural population.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill fulfils an admirable purpose and it is certainly a measure long overdue. I trust that it will have the eminently satisfactory results which the Parliamentary Secretary hopes it will have.  Anyone who is interested in the library service at the moment will readily agree that it is one of the most starved of all the services we have, particularly when one takes into consideration the work it has attempted to do and the results it has actually achieved.  I am glad that the Bill provides for the setting up of An Comhairle Leabharlanna.  I am not, however, quite satisfied about the constitution <Col N="512" /> of that body.  I do not think the representation given to the public bodies is adequate.  In view of the service that is at present being rendered by the public bodies, through the library committees which they have established, a bigger representation should be given to them.  They are practically the only people in the country who have made any efforts towards supplying library services, particularly in the rural areas where they are most needed.  There is a big reading public in the country and that public is growing in numbers day by day.  It is both necessary and desirable that the primary aim of this new body should be to provide that reading public with the best and most suitable material that can be got.  I would also like to see greater representation given to cultural associations on this new body, particularly cultural associations like the Gaelic League or Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaedhilge.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the library services to which I would like to refer and I trust that, as a result of this measure, something will be done about it.  I refer to the terrible state of disrepair into which many country libraries have fallen at the present time.  These libraries were built by the Carnegie Trust.  In County Limerick they took advantage of that trust fund and libraries were built in certain parishes there.  Naturally these libraries were a great boon to the people.  I understand that the actual libraries were built by the rural district councils and were known as the Carnegie free libraries.  I do not know whether these buildings are common to other parts of the country but certainly in County Limerick there are quite a number of them.  some of them have fallen into a very serious state of disrepair and there seems to be no fund available for the purpose of putting them into proper order.  Some of them were demolished.  During the Black-and-Tan régime some of them were burnt and subsequently restored. But the general position with regard to the libraries seems to be that &ldquo;what is everybody's business is nobody's business&rdquo; and no definite responsibility seems to rest with the county <Col N="513" /> library committee or any other committee to see that the buildings are well kept and in a proper state of repair.  In one library the roof fell in. I think some effort should be made under this measure to make arrangements for the upkeep of these buildings. Possibly we want, too, a better civic spirit.  In some cases there seems to be no local responsibility or no proper civic spirit in regard to them.</P>
    <P>A suggestion has been made to use the schoolhouses in the rural areas as depôts.  Of course the Minister for Education has not complete control in that matter.  The schools belong to and are managed by the school manager.  I know that in a number of instances the schools are actually used as depôts for the distribution of books under the library scheme at present in operation. I think the Department of Education could do something in this respect by bringing the publications of An Gúm to the attention of the local librarians rather more than they have done up to this.  Many of the suggestions made by the previous speaker have already been carried out.  In County Limerick, for instance, the librarian there has given gramophone recitals and I believe films have been shown. These have proved very successful.  In other areas lectures have been provided. That could easily be done under the present scheme.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say again that I think more representation should be given on the council to the public bodies who, after all, will provide most of the money spent on these libraries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of this Bill will give general satisfaction no doubt, as would anything that tends towards the improvement of the present library service in the country. After reading the Bill, however, I am wondering whether it is meant to improve the library service in the large urban areas, specially in the City of Dublin and in the university cities of Cork and Galway, or whether it is meant to improve the library service for the rural community.  So far as I can read it, its main function seems to be to improve the library service in the <Col N="514" /> university centres and not so much the library service in rural Ireland.  All over the State, I think, we have a library service at present but, outside the principal towns and the large centres of population, that library service is very mediocre, in fact very, very poor.  Anything that will tend to improve the library service for the rural community, who have not the service to which they are entitled, will be welcomed.</P>
      <P>In the proposed constitution of the governing body I notice that local authorities, as Deputy Ó Briain pointed out, are given a very small representation. The General Council of County Councils are given a representation of three.  I do not agree that members of the General Council of County Councils are not fully capable of being members of this body.  I cannot agree with the Deputy who said that officials of local authorities instead of members should be on this body.  Members of a county council are just as qualified to be on the central library board as members of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that the General Council of County Councils and the municipal authorities should have an increased representation.  They will have to pay the piper and provide all the funds outside of the grant to be provided by the Government of £2,500, or whatever it is.  The county councils will have to provide 75 or 80 per cent. of the money and the urban authorities probably 20 or 25 per cent.  On a valuation basis, I think it would be 25 per cent. for the urban authorities and 75 per cent. for the rural authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that it would be more equitable to have the taxation for this purpose on a population basis, because the population in the built-up areas up to now has got the lion's share of the library service and the sparse rural population in some areas has been getting little or no service.  To my mind, these built-up areas in the large centres of population will not be contributing a fair proportion of the cost of this service.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should look into that matter and that a more equitable basis for the <Col N="515" /> local authorities' contribution towards the central service would be a population one.  I am sure the Bill will be welcomed and that it will do a lot of good.  It appears to me, however, that, in the main, it will provide a service in the university cities.  They will have a large representation on the governing body.  I do not object to that, because they should be represented on it.  But while there is to be a very large representation from the universities on the governing body there is to be a very sparse representation from the people who will have to pay the piper.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will give that matter consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Any measure for the promotion of a better library service for the country is to be welcomed.  Incidentally, I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his introductory speech. Is the Parliamentary Secretary satisfied that the representation on this council which it is proposed to set up is adequate?  We have representatives from, I think, four university colleges and from members of county councils and other local authorities.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary not consider giving representation to people such as publishers and booksellers?  After all, these are more directly connected with the general public and have a better idea as to the likes and dislikes of the ordinary public in the matter of reading.  That is their business and I think it would be a decided advantage if such people were represented.  I do not know if there is an association or organisation of which such firms as Browne and Nolan, Easons and Gills would be members. If representation could be given to people of that kind it would be an advantage to this council.  I agree with Deputy Allen that we should not concentrate mainly, as I think we have concentrated mainly in the past, on providing good library centres in the urban areas and cities.  The rural population of Ireland is not very well catered for in the matter of library services. In Wexford we are a little more fortunate than most counties as we <Col N="516" /> have what the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned, a van service.  Even in County Wexford that is not adequate.</P>
      <P>I should also like to mention the question of Irish books in the libraries. Some few years ago, when I was a student, I looked for certain Irish books for the matriculation or leaving certificate course, or whatever course it happened to be at the time, and invariably I found that the ordinary local authority libraries did not have the Irish books required for these courses.  To my mind, it would be a very great help in the promotion of the Irish language if such books were provided.  The House knows my views on the question of the revival of the Irish language and my objections to the present system.  I see, however, in the library service in this country a means by which the Irish language could be advanced.  If we had attractive books in the Irish language and not some of the tripe we are used to it would make for the advancement of the Irish language.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I did not hear the Parliamentary Secretary's introductory speech.  As I read it, this is a Bill to establish a council and to regulate public libraries in this country.  I think that is very good.  Deputy Allen thought that there might be too large a representation of the universities on the council, but I take it that this council will be mainly a cultural body and, as the universities are the apex of the educational establishments of the country, it is only fitting that their advice and encouragement should be utilised to the full in a matter like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Corish's remarks that there should be one representative of the book trade generally.  I do not <Col N="517" /> know whether that would be best achieved by having representatives of the publishing companies or of the book sellers, but I think the advice of one or two persons such as those would be of very great assistance to the council. Speaking generally, from my knowledge of libraries in this country, what they stand most in need is money.  As I said, I unfortunately did not hear the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary and I cannot find anything in the Bill to suggest that the grants are going to be increased.  Certainly the libraries in this country have been starved for money and I hope that, in conjunction with this new council and perhaps a newer attitude towards libraries and cultural amenities generally, we shall also find the handmaiden, finance, marching in step with them and at least sufficient money to carry out those schemes in connection with libraries which many well-meaning people have wished to see carried out for years but which have not been possible owing to lack of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Domhnall Ua Donnchadha</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to hear that the numbers of people who are reading books are increasing day by day and year by year. It would be interesting also to know what the outcome of this increased reading will be.  I could see eye to eye with the reading of books by millions of people if, as a result of that reading, we could get an extra person to write a new book because a person who writes a new book is an artist and an artist is a person who does something to enrich the age in which he lives.  Furthermore, if we are to believe that one of the objects of extending these services is to encourage people in the rural areas to remain on the land, I think that something more than the mere reading of books should be developed amongst the people.  The books circulated in the rural areas should be such as would encourage handicrafts.  Side by side with the circulation of these books there should be lectures and an extension of the technical side of education in such areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have an idea that our young men and women in the country areas were formerly as usefully occupied during <Col N="518" /> their spare hours in attending to home comforts&mdash;the making of articles which they learned in the carpentry classes by the young men and knitting and sewing by young women&mdash;as in reading books.  Consequently, I suggest that the books to be circulated in rural areas should have a bias which would tend to encourage young men and women to engage in these activities because to my mind the young man or young woman who produces something is, in his or her own way, an artist, since he or she does something which will help to enrich the age in which we live.  Anybody who comes across the beautiful pieces of crochet made in the rural areas 30 or 40 years ago must admit that the girl who devoted her time to the making of those things was as usefully employed &mdash;I would say more usefully employed than if she had spent her spare time in reading books.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest for one moment that people in the rural areas should be denied recreation but I feel there is a danger that in extending library services we might be overdoing it.  If we banish from the minds of the people the idea that they can be as usefully employed in their spare hours in helping to beautify their homes as in reading, then we shall regret having extended the library services.  I have had experience myself of the working of a library.  I have seen a few mothers who became so keen on reading that they kept their children away from school while they themselves read.  I have seen one local library in a school closed down because of what happened in that respect.  I am glad that Deputies on all sides of the House are inclined to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on the introduction of this measure but when one sees everybody around him praising a measure, one is perhaps to be pardoned for wondering whether something is not wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Bill in general has been commended by all sides of the House.  I should like to deal with a few points raised by certain Deputies.  Deputy MacBride raised the question whether local library services could not provide books for the prisons <Col N="519" /> and for the Army.  There is nothing to prevent a local authority from making available books for prisons, or making available books for members of the Army stationed in the area, whether by way of creating a special book centre in the barracks or encouraging the soldiers to go to the local library and borrow books.  Schoolmasters throughout the county are assisting the library service by acting as voluntary distributors of books and, in areas where there is a juvenile library service, the schools are frequently used as the book centre, and numbers of volumes are brought at regular intervals to the schools so that the children can take them home.  There is no reason why that particular feature of the library service should not be extended through the advice and help of the Library Council.</P>
      <P>The Library Council is not intended to supersede the work of the local library and, in connection with the organisation of lectures and films, the local libraries are already empowered to indulge in this type of service.  There is nothing to prevent the Library Council from preparing lists of lectures and co-operating with the National Film Institute and other bodies in making known the existence of films and giving assistance to local authorities that may need technical data in reference to films, and advice on the best way to organise lectures, particularly on subjects of a complicated character.  In these matters the Central Council will be prepared to give all the assistance possible.</P>
      <P>The experience of local authorities in regard to lectures is very divergent.  In some cases the lectures were absolute failures; in other cases they succeeded admirably.  That was the position last winter, in spite of the appalling climatic conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies referred to the proportion of the members of the Library Council as between the local authorities and the cultural bodies.  If we increase the total number of members the council is likely to be unworkable.  If we increase the number of cultural representatives the local authorities' representatives will have less influence.  We <Col N="520" /> have tried to balance the two elements by having six representatives of the cultural interests and five representing the Irish County Councils' General Council and the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland.  Then we stipulate that the representative of the approved association which, in fact, will be the Library Association of Ireland, will also have to be a member, or an officer of a local authority. That means that local authorities have six representatives, cultural representatives six, and an independent chairman.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any danger of the Irish language being neglected by the Library Council.  The universities can contribute information likely to help local authorities in developing propaganda for the Irish language.  I think, so far as that is concerned, there need be no doubt felt.  There is nothing to prevent the Irish language societies from approaching the Library Council and giving them advice and help, and I feel sure the Library Council will be willing to form a subcommittee of its own body to deal with matters relating to the Irish language. I have no doubt that, having regard to the general policy of the State, there will be a moral obligation imposed on the Library Council to give all the help it can in that regard.</P>
    <P>So far as library buildings are concerned, Deputy Ó Briain referred to the present lamentable condition of some.  That is a matter for the local authority.  The Library Council will send a surveyor around to every local authority.  He will report on the condition of buildings and the need for their extension or repair.  The report will come back to the local authority and the local authority will decide whether or not it can afford the necessary expenditure.  At the same time, the Department of Finance will make known what grant it will be prepared to give and in that way there should be great moral encouragement, not to speak of financial assistance, for the improvement of buildings.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen misconceived the nature of the Bill when he suggested we might help university libraries or <Col N="521" /> reading in the universities more than in the rural districts.  The council administers the Central Library and there is a mutual exchange of specialised books between the universities and the Central Library.  But, so far as the organisation of reading is concerned, the Bill makes it clear that the advisory and consultative service is directed towards local authorities' libraries, and it it is quite evident that the Library Council will have to direct most of its activities towards improving libraries in rural areas, because theirs is the greatest need.  It is equally obvious the Dún Laoghaire and Dublin libraries have certain natural advantages which rural libraries lack, such as the concentration of people and so forth.</P>
    <P>My principal object in recommending this Bill is almost solely with a view to helping rural libraries and getting books to people in the furthermost hills and mountains.  I found that one of the things that interested me most when making a study of this subject was the fact that in certain counties the best books are read in the most remote rural areas.  In the county town&mdash;I will mention no names&mdash;a very high proportion of extremely light fiction is read.  Away up in the hills among the people living on mountain farms a very much higher proportion of excellent literature is read.  But, of course, more books are needed, more encouragement is needed, more advertising and more reading are needed, in order that the work will continue.</P>
    <P>The library service will remain wholly in the hands of the local authorities. They will have to give sanction to the expending of the extra money involved in recommendations from the Library Council.  Therefore there is no absolute need to have the representation of local authorities exceed that of the cultural bodies.  It is not mandatory on any local authority to undertake any improvement whatever, and having a fifty-fifty representation seems to be fair under the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish suggested that representatives of booksellers and publishers should be nominated to the <Col N="522" /> Central Library Council.  My own belief is that when books become plentiful, and even before, booksellers or representatives of the Book Association of Ireland will be only too glad to give advice when asked about the kind of books read by various categories of people and to give advice on what is the market for books in general.</P>
    <P>One of the most valuable ways of improving the library service is to encourage the reading of non-fiction by preparing lists of the kind of books the person who ordinarily reads fiction would like to read in order to experiment upon non-fiction.  I feel sure the Book Association or individual booksellers will be only too willing to give advice on that matter.</P>
    <P>So far as Irish books in the libraries are concerned, in the two libraries I visited, there was a special section of Irish books and every librarian I have talked to tries to maintain a good section of Irish books.  These books are asked for in connection with examinations and by those who are enthusiastic in regard to the language movement. As I have already indicated, there is nothing to prevent constant consultation between the Library Council and the language societies.  There is nothing, for example, to prevent the Library Council advising any other association on how to popularise the Irish language through the libraries.  If, for example, an experiment were instituted in encouraging the showing of films in Irish, the Library Council could give assistance, could make recommendations to the National Film Institute in regard to the kind of Irish films which have proved popular.  It can do an immense amount of work of that kind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell referred to the financial contribution which would be made available to the library service. As he admitted, he was not here for the opening part of my introductory speech and so did not hear me say that, for the first time, the Minister for Finance would be enabled to contribute moneys towards a local library service.  Deputy Ó Donnchadha discussed the library service from the standpoint of its effect upon the domestic activities of people in the remote <Col N="523" /> countryside.  I think he spoke rather pessimistically.  I think that, on the whole, the extension of reading increases the general standard of living of people, and that, for every one person who might neglect domestic duties as result of reading, there will be 100 who will want to improve their lives, their households and their ways of living. I do not think we need worry about that.  Certainly, in the long winter nights, there is plenty of time to do crochet and read good books.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming to that, the librarians in certain areas are already co-operating with the Irish Countrywomen's Association, which, like the Young Farmers' Club movement, is extending its activities and they provide books suitable for the occasion. There is nothing to prevent a librarian from co-operating closely with the technical instructors in connection with vocational education instruction and suggesting books to people who are doing carpentry, for example.  There is nothing to prevent a librarian from making a list of books on the history of furniture, domestic arts and crafts, for anybody doing work of that kind.</P>
      <P>I am very glad that this Bill has got such a sympathetic hearing because we very rarely speak of the library service on the Estimate for Local Government or any other occasion and yet a number of pioneers have done wonderful work in connection with the library service.  A great deal more can be done and there is no reason why the library service should not extend, until it becomes the nucleus of an adult education movement in a larger sense. That would be of immense advantage to the people in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Heskin is asking me rather too much, because, before the Department of Finance could make any contribution for the improvement of the library service, the surveyors will have to do their work, will have to find out what is a reasonable library service and what can reasonably be afforded by the local authority with the aid of a central grant.  That will take some considerable time because we want to avoid anything impracticable.  It would be most inadvisable for local authorities to start making proposals of a varying character for the improvement of the service before we had created some general standard and before we were able to present each local authority with a blueprint of what a reasonable service should be, so that I am unable to say what contribution is likely to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a good library service in County Waterford.  I believe the provision of that service involves about 2d. in the £ in the general rate. Furthermore, in the Lismore rural district, we have libraries which were built with moneys provided by the Carnegie funds, maintained by the county council, and, in addition, we have the book service provided by the vans.  The point I want to stress is that the county council has gone a long way towards providing the literature which is essential for the rural areas. Now we are confronted with the problem of the improvement and extension of the existing service, and I wanted to raise the point so that the Parliamentary Secretary might consider how far the Department will be prepared to go to meet the local authority in areas in which such a service is operating at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be difficult for the Minister for Finance to make any contribution to the Waterford library authority, until he has some <Col N="525" /> idea of what the general improvement is going to be.  That is really the only answer I can give.  If the Waterford County Council, inspired by the knowledge that the Minister for Finance was taking an indirectly active interest in the library service, asked quite suddenly for a contribution for an expansion of the service which they themselves contemplate, I think he would say: &ldquo;Wait until the surveyors have done their work and have reported back to the Library Council and until the Library Council prepares its report on every county in Ireland, presents that report to the Minister and sends the reports on the various areas to the local authorities concerned.&rdquo;  Then, we shall know the extent of the problem and what the total financial contribution is likely to be.  I do not anticipate that the Minister for Finance will be able to make available very large sums.  The service is not very costly in any event, and I ask Deputy Heskin to bear patiently with me and await the report of the surveyors.</P>

Twelve months is a very short period.

All that the persons concerned will have to do is to make application for permission every year and we may assume that, if permission has been granted in certain circumstances and if the conditions have been reasonably fulfilled, it will not be withdrawn unless the circumstances have materially altered in favour, shall I say, of the owner of the property.</P>

      <P>May I draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that this amendment sets out that the permission shall remain until the housing authority is advised that the conditions on which the permission was granted have materially altered?  If the position did materially alter, I think somebody would bring the fact to the notice of the housing authority and permission could be withdrawn.  It should not be necessary for the unfortunate owner to have to repeat application at such frequent intervals.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cogan does not need to put the section as far as this amendment puts it to do what he wants.  I agree with the Minister that if he is to maintain the provision that he has in Section 12, the amendment as put down would mean that once permission was granted he would be virtually tied until the housing authority was in a position to establish to the satisfaction of the court that there had been a change in circumstances.  That, the Minister feels, is going too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, I feel that there is some substance in the point made that it seems, shall I say, unnecessary, and savours of red tape, to have a provision of automatic expiry of permission every 12 months, causing the person in question to renew his or her application.  Take the practical problem in the City of Dublin where you have so many tenements, where you have on the best possible showing, a very large number of licensed tenements. <Col N="529" /> If these are to be the subject of renewal applications every year to the city manager, I can see a separate department being established in the Dublin Corporation to deal with that alone.</P>
    <P>I would like to suggest to the Minister that there is an easy middle course to adopt here.  It is unnecessary to press it as far as Deputy Sheldon's amendment presses it, but it is unnecessarily troublesome as it is.  Would the Minister not consider an amendment in the following form: &ldquo;the permission shall commence on the date specified in that behalf therein and shall continue until withdrawn by the appropriate housing authority&rdquo;, or something of that nature?  Let the permission continue until it is withdrawn. There is an onus on the housing authority to withdraw it.  Under Sections 11 and 12 at the moment, they would have ample power to withdraw it.</P>
    <P>If this amendment is to be considered at all&mdash;and this is on the assumption that Section 12 stands because the Minister has already indicated that he will consider making some alteration in the structure of Sections 11 and 12&mdash; the simple recommendation I would make to the Minister is, after &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, to delete everything and simply say &ldquo;until withdrawn&rdquo;.  That would meet the case and save the unfortunate owners from a series of vexatious annual applications.  Apart from that, I can see enormous administrative difficulties arising in Dublin for the city manager if every year the renewal of tenement licences has to be considered. In Dublin City, this Bill will mean that we are going from the system of free tenements which we have at the moment to a system of licensed flats and tenements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said he will not accept the amendment. An owner of a tenement in good, bad or indifferent condition will be obliged to apply to the corporation every 12 months.  Unless that application is to be a pure formality and completely useless, some sort of inspection of the premises will have to be carried out; otherwise the application for renewal is not fulfilling any purpose beyond that of a <Col N="530" /> purely administrative kind.  The Minister should look into this matter and see if he could accept Deputy de Valera's suggestion, which seems closer to the ideal than the amendment standing in Deputy Sheldon's name.  All renewals after the original application which puts the tenement on the register will eventually depend on the state in which the tenement house is.  That can be ascertained only by an inspection.</P>
      <P>Again, supposing the owner does not apply for permission or forgets to apply annually, is he to be liable to a fine of £100 and £5 per day and six months' imprisonment?  In other words, what liability will the owner have if he does not carry out this annual application?</P>

      <P>I suggest that it is most unwise to tie the local authority down to a definite period in this way. Cases may arise where it would be considered desirable to give the permission for more than 12 months and, on the other hand, cases may arise where it may be desirable to give it for less than 12 months.  If the local authority wished to give permission for six months, they would first have to give it for 12 and then withdraw it.  I suggest that the period of the permission should be left entirely to the discretion of the housing authorities and I would suggest something like this: &ldquo;or such period not exceeding three years as the housing authority shall determine.&rdquo;  That would be a safe period.  There would be cases, such as that of the Iveagh Trust blocks of flats, where the officials would consider it desirable that they should not have to apply every year.  A period of three years would be reasonable.  On the other hand, there should be a provision for giving permission for less than 12 months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in complete disagreement with my friend and colleague, Deputy O'Connor, for the good reason that it is unnecessary, and savours of red tape, to put in a time limit.  It is obviously contemplated, on the wording of the section, that the housing authority can withdraw permission at any time <Col N="531" /> As it stands, the permission is for 12 months, subject to withdrawal at any time before the 12 months expire. What is the objection to letting that permission run indefinitely, with a similar power to withdraw?  All it means is that the housing authority has to take the initiative, but that would probably be more suitable to them.  They are not tied to time any more than the landlord.</P>
      <P>If it is let run indefinitely and the housing authority, in the course of an inspection, finds that, in the case of a particular house, it is desirable to withdraw the permission, they have only to serve a notice of their intention, through whatever machinery is provided, and that is an end of the matter.  By putting in this provision, there will be excessive administrative difficulties every year and a threeyears' period will not even out the administrative burden very much. Apart from that, the administrative burden will mean a new section of the corporation in Dublin and eventually a new licensing department in the corporation, with further overheads and a further increase in the rates.  For that reason, I would urge the Minister to reconsider this purely as a matter of draftsmanship.  I am not in any way questioning what he intends to do; I am accepting unreservedly the principle that this permission should be revocable at a moment's notice by the housing authority, where they deem it necessary.  Is not the simplest and the most straightforward thing to do to let the permission, once granted, run indefinitely with an equally unlimited power of withdrawal at any time? That would be the simplest way from the Minister's point of view and the most justifiable way.  It would certainly be the least expensive way for the people who make the application and the least expensive way for the people who have to pay for the housing authority, namely the ratepayers.</P>

      <P>There is a lot in what the Deputy says, but let us take the case of Dublin.  The city manager in Dublin will grant permission, presumably in writing.  Under sub-section (2) of this section he can include in that conditions as to various items&mdash;(a), (b), (c) and (d).  There can be conditions, with a time limit, with regard to repairs, alteration of premises and so on. He puts in a time limit of six months or twelve months, or whatever is reasonable and, similarly, any other conditions as to time for the performance of these conditions.  All that can go into the document.  The Deputy agrees with me there?</P>

      <P>If the owner fails at the end of 12 months from the time specified in the document to perform the conditions imposed on him as conditions precedent to his getting the permission, then you can make the permission automatically expire.  In practice, it will not make any difference if you simply leave it to the housing authority to come along to terminate it.  In actual practice, the effective termination of that permission will be when the housing authority takes action, and that will be when it comes to the notice of the housing authority. It is immaterial whether you cause the moment of the cessation of that permission to be the moment when the housing authority takes action or whether you cause it to cease at some anterior time ineffective until action is taken.  For these reasons, and in the interests of economy and simplicity, I think that the amendment and the 12 months' provision can be there and at the same time that the earlier provisions in the section will give ample scope to the people giving the permission to put in their conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that, in considering this problem, we have first of all to make up our minds as to whether we wish to make the control of tenementing effective.  If we wish to do <Col N="533" /> that then we must devise machinery which will ensure that inspections will be made periodically, and that the premises will be brought under notice periodically.  If we were to give licences for an indefinite period we have no guarantee&mdash;at least we have no guarantee so far as the statute is concerned&mdash;that they would ever be reviewed again: that they would ever be brought formally to the notice of the officers whose responsibility it would be, if they were made aware of them, to review them.  For that reason, I think it is highly desirable, whatever we may do, that the permission should be given for a definite period.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera argued in reply to Deputy Coogan that we could attach to the permission conditions that certain things would be done within a specified period.  But, would it not be desirable, even if these conditions were fulfilled, that the matter should again, as I have said, be brought under review, and that a further inspection should be made to ensure that the reconstructed premises or the renovated premises were being maintained in a proper condition; because it is not merely a case of doing these things once and of being finished with the matter for ever?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, too, that the Deputy ought to have some regard for the position of the property owner.  The amendment which Deputy Sheldon has proposed, and the suggestion which has been made by Deputy de Valera, would put him in a most uncertain position.  He would not know for what period he was going to enjoy this permission; he would not know whether it was going to be for 12 months, 18 months or two years.  It might be withdrawn at a moment's notice.  So far as Deputy Sheldon's amendment is concerned, I think it is defective for a number of other reasons apart altogether from that fundamental objection to it.  If Deputy Sheldon's amendment were carried, the property owner would not know who was going to advise the housing authority that the circumstances had materially altered.  He would not know what were the particular <Col N="534" /> circumstances, the alteration of which would induce the housing authority to withdraw permission.  He would be living in a state of complete uncertainty. If Deputy de Valera's suggestion were to be adopted, I think that the condition of the property owner, so far as uncertainty was concerned, would be very little better.  He would get his permission, as I have said, for an indefinite period, but it could be withdrawn almost arbitrarily.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that in a moment.  Deputy Sheldon's amendment, and the suggestion which has been made by Deputy de Valera, apparently emanate from a concern for the position of the property owner.  In fact, I think Deputy de Valera used the phrase &ldquo;the unfortunate property owner&rdquo;.  I know that at the present moment in the City of Dublin there are many people who are drawing a net four figure income out of one house, the total outgoings upon which do not amount to perhaps more than £200 a year.  I do not think there is anything very unfortunate in that position, and I do not think that we are imposing any undue hardship on such persons. At least we are imposing no greater hardship on them than we impose on the 130,000 or 140,000 individuals who have to apply for a wireless licence every year and pay for it.  I do not know how many publicans there are in this city, but there are some thousands who have to apply for wine, spirit and beer licences every year and pay very substantially for them.  Nor do we inflict any undue hardship on those who hold a tobacco licence, an entertainment licence, a hackney licence or even an ordinary private vehicle licence.  They all have to apply every year and they all have to pay substantial sums to secure them.  Probably not more than a few of those who apply for a taxi licence, a tobacco dealer's licence or a hackney licence, draw as substantial an income as the majority of property <Col N="535" /> owners draw from the property which they possess in the City of Dublin.</P>
      <P>I think that we should not adopt these sections at all unless we are prepared to make them, to some extent, a reality.  One of the first things which we ought to do to ensure a periodic inspection is to ensure by statute that the position of these premises will be brought periodically under the notice of the municipal authorities.  When we have taken that first step, we can in the ordinary course of supervision by the municipal administration, endeavour to ensure that the premises are adequately inspected periodically.  That is primarily the responsibility of the municipal authority, and it is the municipality which has asked and pressed for this and has been endeavouring to get it since 1890.</P>
      <P>Remember, there is a very long history behind these sections to which I did not think it necessary to refer while discussing Section 11 or to deal with on the Second Stage of the Bill. We must remember that the first endeavour to secure a system of control over the Dublin tenements was introduced in 1890.  In 1906, and subsequently in 1914, attempts were made to tighten up the system of nominal control then instituted.  Private Bills have been promoted to try to do that.  A commission was set up to inquire into the housing of the working classes in Dublin in 1914 and recommended that some such system as this should be introduced.  Our own Commission of Inquiry, which was set up in 1939 and which sat until 1943, made a similar recommendation, and it is as a result of the consideration of these recommendations and the whole history of the matter that we put these proposals into the Bill.  On every occasion on which it was endeavoured to make them effective the same criticism as we had to-night in regard to red tape and the hardship on property owners was raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid that we have lost sight of the major problem that we have here in this city, that is, that so many families are living in one room in tenements and that a state of affairs is developing <Col N="536" /> which, if it were left unchecked and uncontrolled, would create tenements in residental districts now regarded as very desirable. For one reason or another, but particularly for the reason that a large number of houses, without the knowledge of the corporation, have been converted into what are euphemistically described as flats, these highly desirable residential areas are now speedily deteriorating until they are only one or two stages removed from ordinary tenements and ordinary slums.  That is the problem, and let us face up to it and let us not be unduly concerned with the hardship which is going to be imposed.</P>
    <P>Naturally, if the provisions are going to be made effective, machinery will have to be set up under the Corporation of the City of Dublin and the other municipalities concerned, in order to ensure the effective operation of these provisions.  We probably will have to recruit a number of inspectors and we will certainly have to set up a register and employ a staff to maintain that register and, if we are going to make the provision a reality, we will have to provide for the periodic inspection of premises.  But the cost of that is surely not going to deter us from adopting the provisions if we think that the circumstances of the present-day warrant them.  The cost, in any case, is not going to be very heavy.</P>
    <P>There are about 6,000 tenemented houses in the City of Dublin.  I do not know how many inspectors would be required, but I assume that one inspector could deal with perhaps ten such houses in a day and two or, at most, three inspectors would be able to inspect all the tenemented houses at least once a year.  We may assume that they would get £500 or £600 a year. That would be £1,800 roughly, and allowing another £600 or £700 for clerical and other administrative expenses, the whole thing would cost less than £2,500 in a year, that is, less than a farthing in the £ on the rates of the City of Dublin in order to check the abuses already existing and to prevent them from being aggravated and increased.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="537" /> As I have said, I think that, first of all, from the point of view of the owner himself, it would be much better that he should know that permission had been given to him for a definite period and that he should know that before that permission was renewed his property would probably be inspected. The onus should be put on him, as it is on every other licence holder in the State, to apply to the corporation for permission to continue to utilise his property in a tenemented way.  I do not see any great objection to that, but I will say that, if it is going to satisfy those who think that the permission should be given for a period longer than 12 months, I am prepared to consider the proposal made by Deputy O'Connor.  It seems to go a long way to meet any criticisms which have been made and gives the property owner a longer period than 12 months if his property, when he applies for permission, is in such a condition that the corporation would be warranted in assuming that the property would not deteriorate too far over a longer period than 12 months.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if the property, at the time when the permission is granted, is not in such condition, it would be desirable that the permission should be given only for a comparatively short period, sufficient to enable the owner to carry out the reconstruction necessary to put the house in a fit condition to be occupied by more than one family.  I am not so certain, however, as Deputy O'Connor is, that the three-year period proposed would not be excessive.  However, if it would, on the whole, meet the point of view of those who have criticisms of this kind to offer, I would be prepared to accept three years as the maximum period during which permission may be given by the housing authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble I see in the 12-months' limit is that, presumably, the bulk of the cases of the 1,000 tenement owners in Dublin, immediately this Act is passed, will come up for the grant of permission.  We will assume that they will get it.  During the course of the year other cases will <Col N="538" /> be accruing but, within 12 months from that date, this bloc will all come in at the one time for renewal.  There will be a kind of peak, and it is because of that possibility that I think unnecessary expense is likely to be incurred. The matter is so completely indefinite from the owner's point of view&mdash;the permission can be withdrawn at any time as the section stands or even under the proposed amendment &mdash;that I do not see in what way the Minister's argument about the property owner having more security by this 12 months under this section has any substance in it at all.  What more certainty has he of the fact than that he has to make an application at the end of 12 months?  The only certainty that is given to him is the certainty that he must apply at a certain date. I do not think that is of any advantage to him.  He is still at the mercy of the will of the housing authority as to the withdrawal of that notice and permission at any time.  I am pressing this point purely as a matter of smooth administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, from the Minister's reference that the property-owner should take the initiative, it is painfully evident that such a procedure is directed mainly towards easing the lot of the public officials who have to administer this Bill, when passed, and that it is not in favour of the private citizen who is involved.  I would be much more inclined to put the onus of taking action on the housing authorities themselves.  Let them go out and find out for themselves whether permission should, or should not, be granted and let them withdraw their permission when they are satisfied it should not be granted.  If the private applicant has to come to them there is a danger, as Deputy Dockrell says, of the matter becoming a pure formality.  So long as there are no complaints, so long as there is nothing to ruffle the smooth surface of the waters, the permission will be automatically granted.  The fact that these people have to apply annually will be a complete answer to any criticism. On the other hand, if the matter is let run indefinitely, if the onus is on the housing authority and their officers to review and they do nothing <Col N="539" /> under these circumstances it will become more apparent.  Questions will be asked as to how many houses have been inspected, how many premises have, in fact, been reviewed, and there will not be the omnibus cover-up that there is under such a provision as this. This House, as trustee, so to speak, for the ordinary private individual in the State, is entitled to ask that the onus shall be put on public officials.  I am not suggesting for a moment that there has been any laxity by any housing authority in the past.  There is no question of that.</P>
    <P>I am looking at this matter from the worst possible angle with a view to criticising the Bill and with a view to helping the Minister with the draftsmanship. I am putting the arguments strongly in order to put them into better relief and for no other reason. I am still of opinion that it would be cheaper and more economical in every way to let that permission run indefinitely, leaving the onus on the housing authority inspectors to find out the cases they should review.  I can see no practical or possible advantage in the present system of making the burden lighter on the officials responsible for inspection and for the carrying out of this section. The Minister frankly says that this is a system of licensing.  I agree.  But there is a very great difference between this type of licence and, say, a tobacconist's licence.  Let me take the Minister on this question of licences.  In most cases, where he has mentioned tobacco licences and such other licences, I would point out that they are really only revenue provisions.  The only social interest involved in these licences is the collection of revenue. If the tobacconist, for instance, pays his duty, or if the owner of a motor car pays his duty, that is all the State is interested in.  There is no review of fitness and it is quite correct that it should be automatic. The State's real interest is in the collection of the fee.  The Minister also referred to public house licences. There, something much more than revenue is involved.  The licensing of a public house involves suitability, proper conduct and other considerations <Col N="540" /> very much akin to the licensing of a tenement.  In that case it is not automatic.  It comes up for annual review before a court.</P>
    <P>The Gárda authorities and other people interested inspect, and there is a real review.  That condition is feasible in these cases because, when all is said and done, the number of licences involved for public houses is relatively small and they are spread over a wide area.  In Dublin, however, we will have a density of licences for these tenements.  Each one of them, if this scheme is to be effective, will require a thorough examination and an inspection by officials of the corporation.  It is undesirable that they should all come at the one time, as would seem to be inevitable under the 12 months' review. On the other hand, if there is no time limit, then the inspector of the public authority can adopt a systematic scheme of inspection.  There is no hampering time limit.  For that reason, I oppose this amendment <i>in toto</i> and I urge its rejection.  I suggest to the Minister that he should consider an amendment on the lines I have suggested rather than the threeyear one.  That would go some way towards providing a solution though it still does not give an adequate solution to the complexities which would be introduced.</P>

      <P>On Section 12 there is one matter to which I would briefly like to draw the Minister's attention, taking into account the definition of habitable house in the opinion of a housing authority, taking into account what we propose to pass in Section 7 of the Bill, and taking into account sub-section (1) of Section 12 under which a housing authority may in their absolute discretion from time to time <Col N="541" /> grant or refuse permission.  There you are dealing with a right of property.  I have some doubt as to whether the strict interpretation of an absolute discretion here is quite constitutional.  It might be that the Minister runs some risk of conflict if this matter were to be brought before the courts.  On Section 11, he said that he would consider the question of an appeal for this particular purpose and that, I think, gets over the difficulty there.  If he is to consider an appeal under Section 11, I would ask him to bring Section 12 within the ambit of that appeal also.</P>

      <P>Naturally, if I am going to make it a condition under Section 11 that permission shall not be unreasonably refused, I cannot allow a local authority absolute discretion under Section 12.  But let me say, in regard to the point raised by Deputy de Valera, that if we were to embody these words in a statute we would be in danger of coming in conflict with the Supreme Court in relation to the constitutionality of the phrase.  The fact of the matter is that the draftsman has been compelled by a decision of the Supreme Court in a notable case to insert these words in all statutes where it is necessary to ensure that they shall not be construed in a mandatory sense.</P>

      <P>Before Section 13 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>13.&mdash;(1) In ascertaining, for the purposes of Section 11 of this Act, whether premises are a tenement house, a part of the premises which is the subject of a furnished letting shall be disregarded if, in the opinion of the housing authority, the rent thereof is greater than the rent which a person of the working classes would be likely to pay for a letting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) In sub-section (1) of this section, the expression &ldquo;furnished letting&rdquo; means the letting of a dwelling at a <Col N="542" /> rent which includes payments for board, attendance or the use of furniture, or for the supply to the dwelling of heat, hot water, fuel, electricity or any other commodity or for the rendering of any services in connection with the dwelling, unless, in the opinion of the housing authority, the portion of the rent attributable to the dwelling alone equals or exceeds three-quarters of the rent.</P>

      <P>On amendment 10, I would say that it is something more than a drafting amendment.  A good deal of principle is involved in it.  There are two points at issuefirstly, the question of a person who is described as a member of the working classes and, secondly, the question of disregarding part of the premises which are intended to be let as furnished apartments.  When the term &ldquo;member of the working classes&rdquo; was first used in legislation it had a particular significance and referred to people who were in receipt of a low wage&mdash;possibly £1 or 30/- a week.  But the meaning of that phrase has changed in our changing circumstances and at the present time a man in receipt of £5 or £6 per week may quite obviously be worse off than the man who was in receipt of £1 or 30/- per week some years ago.  I find it difficult to provide a solution myself and the local authority will be faced with the rather invidious task, as it has been on a number of occasions, of trying to find out where to draw the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The circumstances of a man earning £5 or £6 a week may be such as to warrant him for immediate consideration. A man earning £8 or £9 per week might quite easily, because of his family commitments, have to be regarded as a member of the working classes.  There was a notable case in the courts some time ago.  The Minister will identify it as the &ldquo;Boland case&rdquo;, where the Dublin Corporation by a covenant in the lease endeavoured to ensure that certain houses built under the house-purchasing schemes should continue in perpetuity for members of the working classes.  The court overruled the corporation in that particular <Col N="543" /> case and another individual was deemed to have a right to purchase an interest in the house.  I merely draw attention to that to show the House the difficulty in which the local authority finds itself&mdash;it is not easy to propound a solution&mdash;and I do so in order to ensure that if they step above what is termed the normal line their position in that respect will be understood.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this amendment which is rather interesting. I refer to that part of it which relates to furnished apartments.  I am afraid, with the best intentions in the world, the Minister's resolution will be very largely defeated in this particular instance. We have just been discussing regulations which will ensure registration and so on as far as compartments are concerned.  Here you are going to give a certain amount of freedom to the owners of property.  A compartment may be described as furnished, but there is no indication as to what that furnishing should be.  It may very well be a few musty old curtains, a couple of chairs, and a strip of linoleum in order to comply with the terms of this particular section.  The Minister's answer to that is that it is largely on the lines of the Rent Restriction Act, but I suggest that we should do nothing in this House at this particular stage to aggravate a position which is already exceedingly grave in this city in regard to furnished apartments.  We have been promised legislation to deal with that particular question.  I am afraid that this amendment will in fact and in effect defeat its own purpose.</P>

      <P>I would like to support what Deputy O'Sullivan has said.  I can envisage the enormous difficulty the Dublin Corporation will have in trying to arrive at the definition of &ldquo;member of the working classes&rdquo;.  Even if they do arrive at such a definition I do not know how they will decide as to what rent a person of the working classes would be likely to pay.  The whole problem bristles with difficulties and I would be glad if the Minister could clarify the situation for us.</P>

      <P>While not going into the question of the desirability of <Col N="544" /> dealing with furnished lettings here, there is the fundamental difficulty that under Section 11 the Minister seeks to discriminate between furnished and unfurnished lettings.  Taking it by and large, is there any good reason why furnished lettings should be put in a particular category at all under this Bill?  Adopting the Minister's own argument on the last section I do not see that it makes very much difference if a house is a furnished letting.  The fact that the Minister says he is implementing in this Bill what has been requested by the Dublin municipal authorities for a long time, leaving it to their discretion to operate in that way, will not in any way affect in fact the operation of this Bill which confers such wide powers on them.  It is going to cause a good deal of trouble because we again talk about the &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; of a housing authority.  This is really somewhat worse than the definition section because it proceeds to define the standard upon which the housing authority will judge.</P>
      <P>There is a vast difference between laying down certain conditions to which a housing authority must conform and, on the other hand, laying down a guide for its opinions.  In one case, you are giving mandatory orders to an executive, which is a proper thing for this House to do.  In the other case, you are giving a general direction to a body who, in effect, will be exercising a judicial discretion.  In my humble submission, a housing authority is no fit recipient of the power of judicial discretion.  Again, I have some fear as to the constitutionality of pressing the provision that far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may question me when I say that it is giving them judicial discretion. Let me put it this way.  In the Rent Restrictions Act there is practically the same standard laid down as in sub-section (2) of the Minister's amendment for the court's discretion. The phrase used is, &ldquo;in the opinion of the court&rdquo;.  That, of course, is in keeping with all legislation which is intended to be the subject of judicial discretion.  Here very nearly the same phraseology is used and, instead of the word &ldquo;court&rdquo; the words &ldquo;housing authority&rdquo; are substituted.  In regard <Col N="545" /> to the determination of the effect of a furnished letting and the rights exercisable under Section 11, it places the housing authority in exactly the same position as the Circuit Court is in under an analogous provision of the Rent Restrictions Act.  As I have said, I have some doubts about how far that will be allowed to operate in practice, but I am not pressing the point as an objection here.</P>
    <P>I see further administrative difficulties. The housing authority, in refusing or granting its permission, if there is, as Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out, even a bit of oilcloth or a stick of furniture, must consider this problem. The question as to whether a housing authority has exercised its discretion properly, having relation to the wording of sub-section (2) of the Minister's amendment, will arise.  I think it would not take an awful lot of ingenuity, even granting that the housing authority had the discretion, to force the housing authority into a court to test the question as to whether the housing authority lawfully and properly exercised the discretion given to them under this section.  Therefore, as I see it, there is likely to be a considerable amount of difficulty arising from this provision in regard to furnished lettings. When you have such drastic and such omnibus powers of granting or refusing permission for the letting of tenement flats, it is questionable whether it is wise not to take the more or less crude course and include furnished lettings and leave it to the discretion of the housing authority to grant or refuse permission, as the case may require.</P>
    <P>That argument is further enhanced by the point that Deputy O'Sullivan made as to what a person of the working classes would be likely to pay for the letting.  As he pointed out, certain things are in a fairly fluid state.  It is quite conceivable, under present changing conditions, that certain tradesmen who are highly paid may be quite prepared to pay more than certain people in clerical grades who might not be classed as working class within the contemplation of the term which Deputy O'Sullivan <Col N="546" /> mentioned.  That also is likely to cause difficulty.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, it is wise to give this absolute discretion as to the control of slum property which the Minister has so eloquently pleaded for on the other sections of the Bill.  But, if he finds he cannot accede to what he would perhaps call refinements, such as were advocated by myself and others earlier in respect of Section 12, because of the seriousness and the urgency of the slum problem and the necessity for dealing with it in a practical way, then I suggest to him that he should delete Section 13, withdraw amendment No. 10, and leave the furnished lettings stand in the same relation to this problem of permission for tenements or otherwise as the unfurnished ones are, leaving it to the discretion of the local authority.</P>

      <P>It is true that the administration of these rather contentious sections must create difficulties for everyone concerned with their administration.  Deputy O'Sullivan asked who is to determine who is a member of the working classes.  I think the executive officers of the local authority of which Deputy O'Sullivan is a member are probably much better judges as to who should be regarded as a member of the working classes than a professional man sitting on the bench who is concerned mainly with the proper interpretation of points of law, because this is a matter of fact and not a question of law.  It is not a question of judicial discretion.  It is simply a question of coming to the same sort of conclusion that ordinary practical men of business have to arrive at in the conduct of their everyday affairs and which members and officials of the corporation have to <Col N="547" /> determine in the conduct of the public affairs of the citizens of Dublin.  I do not see how, by any stretch of the imagination, this is a question which should be left to the discretion of judges to determine while it is admitted that, so far as the law is concerned, judges have nothing to guide them at all.  There are no sumptuary laws in this State; there are no hierarchical laws determining that people are born into one grade of society and not into another. There is no clear class distinction between members of the working classes, members of the professional classes, members of the shopkeeping class and so on.  The decision as to whether a man is or is not a member of what I might describe as the commercial classes or a member of the working classes is a decision which each of us is as well qualified to take for himself as any other person in the community, in relation to that particular matter.  So far as the majority of us are concerned, perhaps we might claim to be in a much better position to determine that than any judge sitting on the bench with no statute to guide him.</P>

      <P>Accordingly, I think the whole of the elaborate argument which Deputy de Valera has based on the assumption that, when we ask a local authority to decide who, in its opinion, are to be regarded for the purpose of this section as members of the working classes, we are calling upon that authority to exercise a judicial discretion, falls to the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan attacked this from another point of view.  In connection with the criticism of Deputy Dockrell and Deputy O'Sullivan, I think I should remind them both that, in fact, these provisions have been introduced very largely at the instance of the Dublin Corporation.  It is true that they would probably have been introduced in any event because the commission of inquiry which we set up into the housing of the working classes in Dublin&mdash;I wonder how we could have conducted that inquiry if we were not able to determine the type of persons <Col N="548" /> which should be included in the category of working classes&mdash;recommended that these provisions should be incorporated. I understand when the inquiry was being conducted the representatives of the Dublin Corporation pressed very strongly that provisions of this sort should be embodied in the statute.  It seems to me that the members of the local authority which was foremost in asking for some legislation of this sort should not shirk the responsibility of determining for itself, no matter how invidious it may be, this question as to who is to be regarded as a member of the working classes. All who seek public position have to make invidious decisions from time to time, and I think if we have to do that we ought to face up to the position. I do not see why in this case the members of the corporation should be chary about accepting that responsibility because, in fact, it will be discharged for them I think by the city manager.</P>
    <P>Those who are administering the Bill will have to determine who are to be regarded as members of the working classes.  It may be inconvenient for the officials of the Dublin Corporation to have to do that.  It may be, as Deputy O'Sullivan said, invidious, but they are there to accept responsibility in their sphere as we are in ours and I do not think that there is anything we can do to get them out of that difficulty. I do not think there is anything we can embody in the Act for that purpose. There is no phraseology that can adequately and exactly define the term &ldquo;working classes&rdquo;.  We, all of us, claim to be regarded as workers of one kind or another.  The only clear line we can draw in that regard is that we can say whether a man, because of his economic position, is or is not in need of the sort of assistance which the Housing Acts are intended to provide. That is the rough-and-ready line which is taken by the corporation itself.  They have something like 20,000 tenants, all of whom are supposed to belong to the working classes and as they have been able to determine that fact in relation to the 20,000, I do not think they should have any great difficulty in coming to a conclusion as to who is a member of the working classes and what flows from that in the terms of this section.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" /> I go a little further.  I do not see that we have imposed any very difficult obligation upon the local authority in asking them to determine what would be the rent which might normally be payable by a member of the working classes.  We have in fact given a fairly good guide.  We have said that,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the expression `furnished letting' means the letting of a dwelling at a rent which includes payments for board, attendance or the use of furniture, or for the supply to the dwelling of heat, hot water, fuel, electricity or any other commodity or for the rendering of any services in connection with the dwelling, unless, in the opinion of the housing authority, the portion of the rent attributable to the dwelling alone equals or exceeds three quarters of the rent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely the officers of the local authority can determine for themselves what would be the normal rent of these apartments unfurnished?  They can then look at the furniture which is supposed to be covered by the letting and they can say to themselves: &ldquo;The rent of this apartment unfurnished should be so much; the rent of this apartment with the strip of oilcloth and the picture on the wall is 50 per cent. more than that or is perhaps 100 per cent. more than that and therefore this is quite definitely not a furnished letting.&rdquo;  I think it is not beyond the capacity of any competent official of the Dublin Corporation or of any other local authority to determine that question for himself in the light of the specific guidance which is given to him by sub-section (2) of Section 13.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I, straightaway, say a few words to relieve the Minister's mind of any suggestion that the corporation were not prepared to face up to the task of deciding the question at issue in this particular section? Actually I am glad that the discussion has taken place and, in the light of the Minister's own pronouncement, may I say that the position will be considerably eased as far as the Dublin Corporation is concerned.  He has said, and very properly, that the matter can be decided on broad common-sense lines <Col N="550" /> but unfortunately those who have had experience know precisely that that was just what could not be done in some cases in deciding the class of persons who should secure a tenancy.  At least there was hesitation on the part of the local authority in including individuals who, in their opinion, because of their earning capacity or family commitments should normally be included.  The discussion on this particular section is interesting and useful because it assists the local authority when faced with difficulties of that character.</P>
      <P>I should like to take advantage of this occasion to remove any wrong impression which the Minister may have that the officials of the Dublin Corporation might not be prepared to face up to their responsibilities in this respect. It may interest the House to know that whatever may happen elsewhere, so far as housing is concerned, the Dublin Corporation have a very happy arrangement.  As a result of sound common sense on the part of the person concerned, the Housing Committee of the Dublin Corporation is very largely left, shall I say a free hand in so far as its housing policy is concerned. When I say a free hand, at least its recommendations in nine cases out of ten are implemented, so that there will be no question of the officials not facing their responsibilities so far as this is concerned.  The air is much clearer by the discussion in this particular case and the local authority, contrary to what the Minister infers, will be only too pleased to give decisions on such cases when they arise in the future in the light of the discussion that has taken place.</P>

      <P>I would like to make quite clear to the Minister that in this particular matter, in the desire to control licences, he has my sympathy. My remarks may seem annoying to him, but they are repeatedly aimed at draftsmanship in order to head-off possible difficulties in the future.  When I spoke about possible legal implications in the section, I spoke with a view to bringing possible difficulties to the Minister's notice, not with a view to advocating a contrary state of affairs. I agree that the direct practical approach to this problem of licences is <Col N="551" /> the correct one, but my object mainly was to bring the possible defects to the Minister's mind.</P>
      <P>If the section is enacted as it stands, it will not be very long before somebody finds an excuse, particularly arising out of the words &ldquo;in the opinion of&rdquo;, to make it a matter of law where the Minister means it to be a matter of fact.  The Minister suggested that I was advocating a change to another point of view.  I am not. I still suggest the section would be better left out.  The discretion would be relatively absolute and there would be nothing to impede the executive&mdash; that is, the housing authority &mdash; acting, whereas if you put in this provision as it stands you will leave yourself open to the difficulties I have mentioned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>While I do not know exactly what Deputy Sheldon has in mind, I think that it really is desirable that we should not have the type of inquiry that is set out in this section.  It might be difficult for a person to state accurately his income from any sources whatever.  While a person might be very well able to give his weekly income and answer the other points laid down, to state accurately any small sum that he might receive in the course of the year from any source would be putting a very serious obligation upon him because, in the event of the information not being correct, he would be exposed to a very severe penalty.  It would be advisable to leave out the <Col N="552" /> words to which Deputy Sheldon objects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we must look at the section in the light of what we are very often urged to do.  There are numbers of people who feel that houses in public ownership should be related to the total income of the family in occupation and that that is the fairest and most equitable way of distributing the public benefits.  We should not let a house erected very largely at public expense at less than the economic rent to a person in receipt of a good income.  We should not let a house at less than the economic rent to a person in receipt of a good income, having regard to the fact that the erection of that house has been heavily subsidised by the ratepayer and the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the object of these Housing Acts is to provide people with good homes at rents which are within their means and, accordingly, we do not wish to charge an economic rent to any person who is unable to pay it.  We wish, in fact, to relate the rent payable for his home to the tenant's ability to pay.  We cannot do that unless we know the full measure of his ability to pay, and for that reason we have to ask him to disclose his full income from any other source whatever, whether it is in assistance benefit or allowances received from public or private funds, because there are quite a number of people who will be in recipt of continuous allowances from charitable organisations and friendly organisations of one sort or another.  It is all money which they have in their possession and which they can use for their own benefit and advantage. But they should not be permitted to use it for their own benefit and advantage at the expense of the public funds, the expense of the taxpayer and ratepayer if, in fact, it is of such a size that, taken in conjunction with what accrues to them in other ways, they could be justly required to pay an economic rent for the house. For that reason I could not accept Deputy Sheldon's amendment.  If I did, it would probably drive a coach and four through the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point which I may consider <Col N="553" /> between now and the Report Stage.  I refer to the case of a person who may receive a temporary allowance from a charitable organisation to tide him over a temporary misfortune. I may, between now and the Report Stage, try to meet that case.  I am not so certain that at the present stage it is necessary to try to meet it, because it will take some time to get these returns made and when we have a little experience of the type of difficulty that may arise we shall be able to amend the existing provision to cover it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not now.  Perhaps the Deputy is not aware of the fact that the Cork Corporation let houses on a system of differential rents, rents supposed to be related to the income of the family occupying the house.  It has been recommended by the Committee of Inquiry into the Housing of the Working Classes in Dublin that such a system should be introduced in Dublin City.  There are one or two cases in the country where a system of differential rents prevails.  The principle underlying the system is that the rent should be related to the income of the family occupying the house.  In order that proper effect may be given to that principle, it is necessary that we should know the true income of the families occupying the houses.  We have had the experience, in one instance, where that income was grossly understated and where families in quite comfortable circumstances were living in houses at nominal rents.  It is important, therefore, if this system is to be introduced, that we should be in a position to compel people who want to enjoy that system to make a full disclosure of their family income.</P>

If a person is giving that information and if he has received a sum of money from a charitable organisation or some other source during the previous year, there is nothing, so far as I can see, to indicate whether he is to record that or not. What I want to know is whether a person is supposed to put down sums he may have received at some irregular intervals of time.  So far as the weekly income is concerned, there would be no difficulty but, in the case of other sums received at irregular intervals, such as gifts from relatives abroad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="556" /> In sub-section (1) to delete all words and figures after the word &ldquo;reconstruction&rdquo;, in line 32 down to and including &ldquo;November, 1947&rdquo;, in line 33, and substitute &ldquo;commenced on or after the 1st day of November, 1945&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In this amendment, I am seeking to come to the rescue of people who built or reconstructed houses in the past two years.  Many of these people built because they were in dire need at a time when costings were at their very highest.  When they decided to build, they did not foresee that these costings would reach such a high figure.  The position now is that many of these houses which they sought to reconstruct or to erect are in an unfinished condition.  I have in mind the case of a man, the father of 15 children, who were in dire need of shelter, who started to build.  The grant of £80 to which he was entitled would not purchase enough timber for the house and he found that he was unable to finish the roofing of the house, with the result that the house is unroofed yet.  I have in mind also other cases which I know very well of men who, because of their desperate need for shelter for their families, had to erect new houses and do their best to complete them and who, in many cases, had to sell off their stock or portion of their stock, and in other cases had to go to the bank and borrow money which probably will not be repaid for a generation.  Building costs went up so fast, especially in the past 12 months, that these people found themselves in a terrible difficulty and were compelled to borrow, whether they liked it or not.</P>
    <P>It may perhaps be said that the value of the houses went up accordingly, but it does not matter what the value of a house is if a man requires it to shelter his family.  He cannot sell it after building it.  I do not know at what point in the last two years building costs reached their present level, but I am sure the experts in the Department could work that out.  I think there is a good case for coming to the rescue of these people who reconstructed or built in the past two years.  The numbers are very small. <Col N="557" /> No man attempted to build or reconstruct unless he was in very dire need.  All Parties in the House welcome the Bill and I can assure the Minister that it is also highly appreciated in the country.  The agricultural labourers and small farmers who attempted to carry out such work in the past two years are surely entitled to the consideration of the House.  The great effort they made should be appreciated. I appeal, therefore, to the Minister to give favourable consideration to the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the amendment on behalf of Deputy Beirne.  It was unfortunate that the Bill was not introduced at an earlier date.  Immediately after the termination of hostilities, when building materials began to come on the market again, many people who were in very great need of housing accommodation proceeded to erect or reconstruct houses.  During the war period it was difficult, if not impossible, to undertake such work because of the absence of building materials.  The enterprising and deserving people who proceeded to erect new houses or to reconstruct houses when materials came on the market should not be left out of the scope of this Bill.  In their case we should at least go back to the same date as is set out in the section dealing with persons building houses for letting. A person who builds a house for letting is usually a person of considerable means and can hardly be regarded as being so deserving as the small holder or private individual attempting to reconstruct his house or to erect a dwelling for his family.  Definitely, the same date should hold good in the two cases. If that is not done, there will be a feeling of hardship and injustice.  It will be particularly unjust in the case of those people who had begun the work of erecting or reconstructing before the 1st November last and who have not yet received a grant.  Such persons will have a grave sense of injustice when they find that the grant they will receive is immeasurably lower than the grant payable in the case of persons who started work after the 1st November. There ought to be no hesitation <Col N="558" /> on the part of the Minister in accepting this amendment.</P>

      <P>In that case I should like to support the amendment.  I cannot understand the reason for the differentiation or discrimination between the private person building for his own accommodation and what may be termed the speculative builder.  It may be argued that the speculator is doing a good deal to case the housing prolem in investing his money in housing, but I agree with Deputy Cogan that he is investing his money in the hope of making a profit.  In making that profit and letting the house he is not relieving the very acute problem, because the person to whom he lets is a person who is capable of paying him a decent rent. In one case it is a matter of investing money for profit.  In the other, it is a matter of erecting or reconstructing a house to provide accommodation for a family.  There should be no discrimination and the grant should apply equally and as and from the date mentioned in the section dealing with the person who builds for letting, namely, the 1st November, 1945.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, this section may lead to a little abuse and the Act itself may be defeated.  I would not like that temptation to be there.  For instance, if two people in a locality build houses convenient to each other and they started the work subsequent to the 1st November, 1945, is there anything in the Bill to prevent them letting to each other and drawing the full grant?  That is a point I would like to put to the Minister.  It is extremely difficult to understand why there should be this differentiation. The Minister is being very generous, <Col N="559" /> in the main more generous than anybody anticipated or expected and, for what it would cost, he should go the step further and give the benefit to those who had the courage to start before the operative date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the amendment.  There is a good case to be made that the Minister should be consistent.  There is no consistency in having one date for the speculative builder and another date for the private individual.  As a matter of fact, I think the better case can be made for the private individual.  There is some chance of the speculative builder getting back his money.  The other man builds a dwelling-house for himself only once in a lifetime and there will be a great hardship on him if the Minister is not prepared to concede the same terms to one as to the other.  I have no doubt the Minister sees the point and I am sure he will look into it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Hughes is not, perhaps, quite aware of the basis of that.  As I understand it, the Minister had some delay in being able to produce this Bill, as everyone can understand.  I believe that representations were made to certain builders and contractors, urging them, because of the urgency of this problem, to prepare sites and to do everything that could be done at that stage in anticipation of building when supplies opened up and when the Minister was ready to give his grants.  I think that actually what is activating the Minister in giving this particular concession in the case of these bodies is simply that these people acted on representations and were pressed by the Government as a whole to do everything they could to expedite the preparation of sites and that it is in keeping his word to them that the Minister has put in the provision.  That, I think, is sufficient explanation for the terms of the Bill as it stands.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>At first sight but, when you look at it in another way, there is no anomaly.  There is no anomaly for this reason: it is one thing <Col N="560" /> for a person, without any assurance or any holding-out of a promise to go of his own accord and build or reconstruct a house.  It is another thing for a man to undertake reconstruction or building or preparation of site on a positive representation.  They are two totally different cases.  What has happened is, on one hand you have these private persons who, without any such assurance, without any probability of getting a grant, to suit themselves reconstructed or built a house.  They are one class.  Are they entitled to retrospective consideration?  On the other hand, there are people who would not have done this work were it not for the pressure and the representations and the implied promise &mdash; as far as a Department can promise &mdash; that is involved. They are all separate cases, so I do not think Deputy Hughes is quite right that the cases are equal. I would like to know what it would cost to embrace the houses that are referred to in Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment.  If the cost is reasonable and we can bear it, then for the sake of uniformity let us bring them all in for the one date in 1945; but that is subject to what we see on the question of costs, as it may not be feasible.</P>

      <P>Two Deputies have referred to the generosity of the Minister, anticipating that he would supply further moneys to meet this. If such were the case, the amendments would not be admissible, as involving a charge.  There are four amendments &mdash;Nos. 13, 14, 21 and 24&mdash;which the Chair permitted because, under Section 22, there is an overriding maximum amount of money.  Within that, Deputies were allowed to move amendments to devote some of the money so set out in Section 22 to go back to 1945 for certain people; and I thought it proper that they should be allowed so to plead, provided they did not go outside the amounts set out in Section 22, so that whatever it costs will come off houses to be built subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not impressed by Deputy de Valera's argument, because he is making the case for the men who were induced to prepare sites &mdash; induced by the profit motive, pure and simple. <Col N="561" /> The other men are men who should command sympathetic consideration, the men who were living under such wretched conditions, as in the case made by Deputy O'Sullivan, that their houses were almost tumbling down around their ears.  They were forced to construct new homes for themselves, and there are houses to-day in the course of construction where people were compelled to sell stock and borrow money in the banks to put up these homes for themselves.  These cases should command the sympathy of this House.</P>
      <P>I am not at all concerned about the speculative builder, whose sole motive is profit.  We can be assured that he will get his profit anyway, next year if not this year, as he is in the business for profit.  I know a small farmer whose valuation is under £17 and whose house was burned down a few months ago.  His family had to live in the barn.  He had a big family on that small holding and felt he was doing well if he was able to pay his way and meet his weekly budget. That man was forced to provide a home.  He had to go into the bank and borrow and had to sell off stock. Now, just because he started a couple of months too early, he is going to lose this grant.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the matter.  I am not concerned with the cost.  The House ought to provide money for cases of this sort and we should encourage individuals who through their own private enterprise provide homes for themselves.</P>

      <P>He wanted to bring these houses within the ambit of the measure and make some of the money provided in the overriding sum available for allocation to those houses which had to be started before 1st November, 1947.  I think there is an unanswerable case for these.  I do not know anything at all about the other <Col N="562" /> types of houses that are referred to by Deputy Hughes.  We are dealing only with the houses in rural areas which were started prior to the 1st November, 1947, and Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment wants that date changed to 1st November, 1945.  I ask the Minister to meet this amendment No. 13 if he can possibly see his way to do so.  I have referred to this already in the Second Reading debate. There is a very strong and just case to be made in the case of houses of this type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>A good case can be made for this particular amendment, which is similar to one I had down myself. Many people who embarked on building schemes prior to the coming into operation of this new Bill will find that, having provided a certain amount of money, due to the increased cost of materials, they are unable to finish the building.  It is only reasonable that those who had the courage to embark on a building scheme, even for their own accommodation, should not be debarred because of the date fixed in the Bill for qualifying for the grant.</P>
      <P>Some of those individuals were forced to build because of the conditions that prevailed.  Because they may be 12 months ahead of this Bill, they should not be left without any consideration, when you take into consideration that the Bill makes provision for speculators to qualify under the measure.  After all, the speculators benefiting under the Bill are going to get their money back and will get their profit by drawing on the tenants to provide the amount of money expended on the building scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a note here of one case of a man who wrote to me a few days ago. His licence was issued on the 28th May last, with the proviso embodied in it that he start to build on the 1st July. Now, because he is a few months ahead of the introduction of this scheme, he is denied this grant.  I know two or three other cases in my own area of working men who embarked on a building scheme and who, after carrying on for a certain time, found themselves unable to finish it.  The houses are still unfinished.  We are not objecting to the scheme and the Minister is going a long <Col N="563" /> way to meet these people and the wishes of the local authorities, but surely the number who would be outside the scheme since 1945 is very few, if you take into consideration that people who did embark on a building scheme, for their own purpose or otherwise prior to that date, were substantially wealthy.  I hold that the Minister should give serious consideration to bringing within the Bill the people other Deputies have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera entirely missed the point of the amendment. He tried to relate conditions in the country with conditions in the cities, where you have an amount of building going on which is definitely for profit.  That is not the case with houses that are built in the country.  There, men have to build houses to shelter their families.  The Deputy forgot that they have built those houses for themselves out of their meagre resources. That has been done by agricultural labourers and small farmers, and done almost entirely out of the grant and by their own family labour.  Now, many of them are in the position that their houses are unfinished and shelter cannot be provided for their families because of the abnormal jump in building costs.  I again appeal to the Minister to consider the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment.  In view of the fact that it has got support from Deputies <Col N="564" /> on all sides of the House, I cannot see how the Minister can refuse to accept it.  We all know there is a great clamour for houses all over the country, especially among small farmers and middle-class farmers.  They want to build houses for one reason, namely, to provide their families with shelter.  We all know that during the war years the building of houses was out of the question.  The individuals who decided in 1945 to try and make up for lost time, even though the cost of housing materials had gone up considerably, are, I submit, entitled to encouragement. As several Deputies have pointed out, those poor people in the rural areas set about building houses for themselves out of their meagre resources.  In order to do that they had to sell out stock and borrow money from the banks.  In some cases they have scarcely completed the houses, and indeed some of them are very badly completed.  Now, when we have a good Housing Bill before us it would be very unfair, I think, if they were to be put in the position that they would not be entitled to the same concessions as the speculative builder is. There is no doubt but that he builds for profit.  He would not spend one £5 note on the building of a house but for the fact that he knows well he is going to make a good profit out of the house in years to come.  These speculative builders can be of great use to the country and can be a help to the Government by building numbers of houses.  My submission is that the individual who, two years ago, set out to build a house for himself and his family is entitled to the same concessions as the speculative builder.  If the Minister checked up on the number of people who started to build houses since November, 1945, I do not think he would find that the number is very big.  That is due to the scarcity of building materials.  Even those who were very badly in need of a house were deterred from starting by the scarcity and the immense cost of building materials.  I think that the sum of money involved by the acceptance of this amendment would not be very big, and could be made good from the sum allocated for the provision of houses. <Col N="565" /> In view of the fact that there is general agreement on this amendment from all Parties in the House, I do not see how the Minister can turn a deaf ear to the appeals which are being made to him.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister definitely makes up his mind on this, I want to submit this consideration to him that, owing to the shortage of building materials and of skilled workers, it may not be possible to utilise the full sum to be made available. Therefore, I think he should be influenced by that consideration, and the amount of money provided in the Bill would, I think, be sufficient to make this measure apply retrospectively, in the manner suggested in the amendment.</P>

Anybody who started to build a house two years ago did so out of dire necessity.  It will be a terrible hardship on them if they are now to be denied any help.  I know one man who started to build a house last August and another who started to build a house in June.  They have been held up due to the fact that they have not enough money to complete the houses.</P>

      <P>I cannot give the Deputy information in that way.  We have heard quite a lot about the position of the small farmer.  We did not hear so much about the position of people in the urban areas.  Those who built in the urban areas got no grant whatever.  The people in the rural areas did get a grant amounting in some cases to £80.  Another fact that we must take into consideration is <Col N="566" /> that whether a man builds for his own occupation &mdash; if he is driven by a necessity to build &mdash; or not, nevertheless if he did build in the year 1945 the value of his house has considerably appreciated since then.</P>

I am perfectly certain that the Deputy seldom makes a bad bargain of any sort in a market, whether as a buyer or as a seller.</P>

      <P>Do not let us run away from these plain and simple facts which, naturally, have to be taken into consideration in a matter of this sort. As I was saying, it is not merely one part of the community that we should have to deal with if we were to accept this amendment.  We should have to deal with persons in urban areas also. Now, it has been argued that where a farmer builds a house for his own occupation he may not be in a position immediately to realise the value of that house if he wants to sell it.  He could scarcely sell it without the land attached to it, I presume, although I have heard of some cases where it has been easier to sell a house without the land than with it.  I have heard Deputies on the other side say that that is the general rule.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will concede this much: the rural householder may not be able so readily to realise the present market price for a house as the urban owner, but if we were to give this concession in the form in which we are requested here, to rural areas, how could we stand up against a <Col N="567" /> similar demand from the owners of houses in urban areas?  The plea would be made to us that we had given the urban owner nothing over these years.  No assistance has been given to him to build since 1938, while we have given &mdash; as I would remind the House &mdash; some assistance over the emergency period to persons in rural areas who were building for their own occupation or for whom houses were being built by public utility societies. If we give the concession in the form in which it has been asked here we will inevitably be asked to give it in the case of urban owners.  The urban owner has already secured the advantage of his enterprise if he built a house in 1945, for, in fact, the market value of that house is considerably higher to-day than it was when he built it.  Accordingly, we would have to make this very general and the cost would be very great.  I have made some calculations and, if I were to accept this amendment, we would have very little left after the sum spent on Section 22 to cover the other proposals in the Bill.</P>
      <P>It has been argued that we were making some differentiation in favour of the rich man, the speculative builder.  When we talk of the speculative builder we do not in general mean the man who builds houses with the idea of letting them, but the man who builds houses on chance for anybody to come and purchase them.</P>

      <P>A person who builds a house for letting is an investor and in the sense that every investment is a speculation he is a speculator, too, but the man or the company who builds houses under the terms of this Bill is a public benefactor.  There is a vast difference between a speculative builder and a person who builds a house for his own occupation.  A man who builds for letting under the terms of this Bill cannot sell the house; he cannot realise its value and he cannot take advantage of an appreciation in the value of the house.  I think that is a very distinct <Col N="568" /> difference.  I do not know whether the Deputies who have talked about the people who are building houses for letting have read the section dealing with this, for not merely can he not sell the house, but the rent is going to be controlled.  The person erecting a house must undertake with the housing authority that he will not sell such house and will let it only under such conditions as are prescribed by the section.  The man who builds for his own occupation can let it as soon as he has fulfilled the terms in relation to occupancy, but the person who builds for letting and gets a grant under this Bill cannot do that.  The Deputies who have been talking about the amount that is going to the man who is building a house for letting will see another difference.  The person who builds for his own occupation gets a lump sum grant and the house is then his own and he has full control over it, but the person who builds for letting under this Bill gets a grant in instalments paid over ten years, the grant to be provided partly by the local authority and partly by the Minister.  The reason for that is that we quite frankly recognise that the person who builds for letting under this Bill is in fact doing something that could not be done by the local authority in the present circumstances but which is essential for the public benefit.  I think that these facts must have been overlooked by those who talked about rich people building houses.</P>

    <P>What Deputy de Valera says is quite true.  The position here is such, in relation to the classes who are not catered for by the Housing Acts, that owing to the strict system of priority laid down by the Housing Act, they would not have a chance of getting a house to rent for themselves and their families.  Where people are prepared to go in and build in a reputable way under acceptable conditions we ought to encourage them in order to meet what is here in Dublin and in other urban centres a crying need, that is, the need of artisans, with the comparatively small families who are healthy and who are not living in one room, to find accommodation.  There are thousands of people in the City of Dublin clamouring for that accommodation. <Col N="569" /> As we have made it primarily the responsibility of the housing authority to deal with the poorer class, those who are not so well off economically, we have had to try to stimulate private enterprise to cater for the needs of other workers who are not in the lowest ranges of income but who are in the lower middle class ranges of income.  For that reason we have given this encouragement to people who build houses for letting. Looking at it in an objective way, we ought to realise that there are thousands of families of industrious, thrifty artisans and clerical workers in this city who are living in one room or two rooms, or who are living on the consideration of relatives, neighbours, or friends, and instead of making a case on the grounds that we have been doing something to meet that problem we should stimulate other people to meet it and we should realise its gravity.</P>
    <P>The Deputies who spoke upon this Bill ought to encourage us and they ought to have praised us for having encouraged the people who are providing houses for letting to go forward and try to provide them.  That is the manner in which I think those Deputies ought to regard this situation. They could have made a case without reference to the fact that we were honouring commitments that had been given to enterprising people in regard to this matter.  We gave no commitments to private individuals who were building houses for their own occupation. As I have pointed out, throughout the years of the emergency when the urban dweller who was not covered by the ordinary housing operations of the local authority was getting nothing done for him, something was being done for the rural dwellers.  I think that, in fairness, that fact ought to have been adverted to, and the more fortunate position of the rural dweller in that regard ought to have been taken into account by some Deputies. I am prepared to concede that probably every builder, whether in a rural or an urban area, whether a private individual, a public utility society or a local authority, experienced difficulty in securing materials and labour.  I am <Col N="570" /> also prepared to concede that because of that difficulty in securing materials and skilled and semi-skilled labour in many cases his progress in building a house or houses may not have been as rapid as the builder anticipated when he began the undertaking and that the construction of the house has been prolonged and dragged out, and dragged out particularly over the year 1947.</P>
    <P>I say &ldquo;particularly over the year 1947&rdquo; for the reason that prices in 1945 did not show any very great increase over 1944 and 1943 and 1942, nor did the prices over the year 1946 show any great increase over the prices which ruled in the preceding years since 1942. However, undoubtedly, in the present year building costs have shown a sharp upward trend.  Therefore, people who may have begun their houses and have not been in a position to complete them before the 1st November may have been badly hit.  I am prepared to face the facts and to concede that. In the light of that fact I will bring in, on the Report Stage, an amendment which, I think, will go far to meet that particular situation.  At least it will go as far as I am able to go.</P>

      <P>To delete subsection (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to bring under this Act in so far as it relates to reconstruction, people who received grants for reconstruction, say, pre-war.  It may seem at first glance rather unfair that a person should receive two grants.  I want, however, to stress this particular point.  When those reconstruction grants were provided, those grants of £40, a number of people availed of them for the purpose of building an additional room to their houses.  Many of those people who provided that additional room were people living in old thatched houses&mdash; very old buildings which were inadequate in size to accommodate their families, but which were also of a very old construction.  Some people availed of those grants ten or 12 years ago.  They built an additional room, but with the passing of time the older building has gone into disrepair.  A thatched house, built, perhaps, 200 or maybe 400 years ago cannot be expected to last indefinitely.  As a result of the <Col N="572" /> climatic conditions we have experienced during the past year, I have in mind a number of these houses which have seriously deteriorated.  It would not be unfair to bring such people under the scope of the reconstruction grant.  Perhaps, if the Minister thought that to give these people the full grant provided under this Bill would be overgenerous, he would be prepared to give them at least a substantial portion of the grant.</P>

      <P>Do I take it, A LeasChinn Chomhairle, that sub-section (2) of Section 21 relates to the same point as that with which we are dealing with under Section 15.  My amendment to Section 21 is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Residents of houses in respect of which grants have been made under previous Acts shall be entitled to receive on application the difference between the former grant and what they would be entitled to under the present Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>To my mind it is the same as the amendment moved by Deputy Cogan. My point is that where people received grants under the previous scheme, the £40 grants, it might be possible for the Minister to consider the feasibility of allowing such residents to benefit under the scheme.  After all, with the passing of the years there probably have been changes&mdash;marriages and things like that.  I understand that where grants were sanctioned formerly an application cannot be made for a further grant.  Would it be possible, under this heading, that such applicants would be considered, at least to the extent of 50 per cent. of the existing amount?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid Deputies will have to rest contented with the fact that I am not in a position to do anything which would impose any additional charge on this Bill.  The Bill, in present circumstances, is tightly drawn. I cannot concede the point which Deputy Heskin has been making and I cannot accept the amendment of Deputy Cogan.  I could not, in any event, accept the principle that the same <Col N="573" /> house should be entitled to benefit under two separate Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister bear in mind that what I am suggesting is not the provision of a grant for the work that was done some years ago.  I do not suggest that a smallholder who received a grant some years ago to put a roof on his house would now be entitled to remove that roof or in any way interfere with the reconstruction work already done under the previous grant.  What I have in mind is the case where a grant was given to build an additional room and where the main building has, with the passage of time, fallen into dilapidation.  In that case, I think the owner should be brought within the scope of this Bill.  What is happening is that in such cases the people are living in the room which was built under the previous grant and the rest of the house is unoccupied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate the Minister's point in this matter because of the tendency of people in the country to avail of all kinds of grants and I think it is a sound principle that the two Acts should not operate in favour of one particular individual. That is as to the general application of the principle.  I think the Minister will find, however, that there is a good case to be made for Deputy Cogan's amendment even if it is only for the purpose of improving on the work done under the original grant to enable people to put up some kind of habitable accommodation instead of the mud hovels and ruined houses.  In many circumstances the room built under the previous grant is practically standing alone.  If any advantage is to be derived from that grant it is absolutely essential that provision should be made in the present Bill for the repair of the original dwelling-house.  I think the proposition is sound enough.  Whatever was given under the previous Act could be deducted and taken into consideration under the present Act and the work done should be separate and distinct.  If something is not done along these lines the utility of the previous grant will be completely wiped out and the whole house will fall down for want of repair.  Now that the <Col N="574" /> time has come when the main buildings should be examined for the purpose of subsequent repair and reconstruction I think the Minister should do something in the matter.  There are exceptions to every rule and I think the exceptions in the present case are sufficient to warrant consideration on this point.  The remainder of the houses must be made habitable.</P>

      <P>To insert a new sub-section (4) as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  Grants under this section shall be applicable to houses of a poor law valuation not exceeding £60.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reason for putting down this amendment is because I think the figure in the Act too low in so far as poor law valuation is concerned.  It would be a good thing to increase the valuation figure from £35 to £50 or £60. Another point to which I would like to direct the Minister's attention is that where a building grant is made under the Acts the total valuation is taken into consideration.  I suggest to the Minister that where an application is being made on a separate holding, where there is no dwelling at the present moment, the complete valuation should not be taken into account, but only the valuation of the holding in question, provided that the holding is suitable for building purposes.  In some cases the holders are now in a position, through improved circumstances and family help, to erect a separate dwellinghouse on a separate holding and it is a pity that in this type of case the holder is debarred because of the valuation figure.  I would ask the Minister to give that matter favourable consideration.  It <Col N="575" /> would do something towards encouraging the people in the rural areas to build.  I would appeal to him to increase the figure from £35 to £60.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy is under a misapprehension or not.  So far as the erection of a house is concerned there is no limitation.  The limit only operates in the case of a reconstruction grant.  I am not prepared to increase the valuation for the purpose of a reconstruction grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit to the Minister that a £35 valuation is rather low.  As the Minister knows there are a number of farmhouses throughout the country in a very bad state of repair.  The farmer naturally tries to improve his house and put it into a proper state of repair but very often he has not the capital or the means to do the necessary work efficiently and well.  Possibly that is equally applicable to the farmer over £60 valuation as to the farmer over £35 valuation; but the large farmer has more resources available for the purpose of raising money and he has some chance of doing the necessary work.  The farmer between £35 and £50 finds it extremely difficult. Another consideration is that on a number of these holdings, say, under £60 valuation there are very old houses. When you come to the higher valuation holdings you will probably find a better house on them.  That is a matter which the Minister should bear in mind.  In a motion tabled by Deputy Heskin and myself some time ago we set out a valuation limit of £50 as being necessary and desirable and if the Minister would accept that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose if I put that in the Bill the Deputy would come along with an amendment to raise it to £100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We would not.  As I pointed out, a farmer with a large valuation has more opportunities and resources for raising money.  In the last analysis, if he wants to build a house, he can sell portion of his land and still have an economic holding.  He will also have a larger quantity of stock <Col N="576" /> and might possibly be able to dispose of some of them for the purpose.  But the man of £35 to £50 valuation has not these resources.  I ask the Minister to raise this limit, if not to the amount suggested by Deputy Heskin, at least to some larger amount.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been the Minister's <i>bête noire</i> to-night, but this is a purely drafting point.  He will pardon me if I draw attention to paragraph (c), subsection (2) of this section, which was the subject of the unmoved amendment by Deputy Sheldon.  That paragraph is similar to a paragraph in the 1932 Act which provides against the selling of a house which is so built: &ldquo;The person erecting the house undertakes with the housing authority that he will not sell such house and will let such house subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by regulations made under this section.&rdquo;  It is quite clear that what the Minister wants to ensure is, if he gives a grant for the building or reconstruction of a house, that the <Col N="577" /> house will be genuinely and <i>bona fide</i> let and that the person who gets the grant cannot cash in on or capitalise that grant straight away by selling it. Therefore, what the Minister wants to ensure is that the house is in fact let. Everybody agrees with him that that is the proper and correct thing to do. But the wording of this section goes a little further than that.</P>
      <P>Supposing I am a builder and build a house and it is let under these conditions to Deputy Dockrell.  What the Minister has in mind is completely fulfilled once that takes place.  The relation then is of landlord and tenant. The relation of the person who receives the grant and who erects the house is that of landlord and his interest is the rent that he receives.  As the section stands, he is prohibited absolutely from selling that interest.  In other words, he is made permanently landlord of that house and he cannot part with his landlord's interest.  I can see nothing in allowing him to part with his landlord's interest that would in any way conflict with what the Minister wishes to do.  Provided the house is let to a tenant under the prescribed conditions, why should not the landlord whose interest is the rent not be able to sell that interest?  In certain cases that may be desirable, but the wording of the paragraph is, &ldquo;that he will not sell such house,&rdquo; and he cannot sell his interest in the rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not prepared to suggest straight away an appropriate amendment to the Minister, because there are always difficulties in drafting an amendment of that kind.  But, if he could provide that the house will not be sold absolutely in the sense in which he wishes to provide against, that the house is duly let to a tenant, but that the landlord can sell his interest in the rent if he is so minded; in other words, that he can capitalise his rent, so to speak, and let somebody else take the payments and the continuing grant, that would be all right.  For instance, what will happen supposing a man dies?  The property will descend to his personal representatives or to his next of kin if he does not make a will.  If it descends to his next of kin, if he has not made a will, the title of that house, <Col N="578" /> subject to the tenancy that has been created, will be vested in a number of people as landlords in common and they will have no power of getting rid of it.  Therefore, while I do not in any way want to go away from what the Minister wishes to do, ensuring that the house is erected for the purpose of letting and that it is duly let, the possibility of assigning the landlord's interest in receiving the rent should be provided for.</P>

      <P>The Minister under this section wishes to encourage the building of houses for letting purposes. It is strange how the wheel always keeps turning.  Hitherto the law was very much against certain types of landlords.  Now we have to introduce legislation to encourage people to build houses for the purpose of letting.  Of course, I entirely agree with that, but it is a peculiar situation in which we now find ourselves.  I do not know why the Minister does not include under this section the builder who builds the house as well as the man who lets it.  Supposing I buy three houses from a builder and then proceed to let them, I take it that I will benefit under this section, but the builder, who may have taken all the risk, will not get anything under this section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand precisely what Deputy de Valera's point was.  I can conceive a case where a person, having built houses under this Bill and having entered into an obligation under it, might say: &ldquo;Well, I had better sell these houses because I can get a much higher price for them.&rdquo;  Of course if he did that he would forfeit the grant.  I think he is <Col N="579" /> perfectly free to do it but he would not be free to dispose of his landlord's interest and to get the grant at the same time.  That seems to be the particular point at issue.  The fact of the matter is that we would frown upon the absolute disposal of these houses for any purpose except in circumstances which would render the transfer of the ownership inevitable.  The person we are anxious to encourage, as I have already said, is the type of man who is prepared to build houses for letting because there is in large urban areas&mdash; perhaps in all urban areas&mdash;a crying need for houses of that kind which can be freely let without any of the restrictions which the local authority could hedge around houses which it had to let.  Accordingly, as I have said, if this sort of practice were to develop, that people could come along, get grants for a substantial period and then proceed to dispose of their houses, we should have to bring in legislation to deal with that because I would regard it as an abuse of the section.</P>
      <P>In regard to the case of the builder, who builds to order for a person who wants to let a house, I think we can assume that the builder before he entered into the contract, fully safeguarded himself.  You may be perfectly certain that the terms he made with the person who commissioned him to build were, from his point of view, fully satisfactory.  Whether they would be such as would encourage a person to go ahead and try to avail himself of the terms of Section 16, I very much doubt as I think once the speculative builder had got his cut out of it there would be very little left for the person who had given him the contract.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not see what an enormous advantage it would be to enlist the whole resources of the house building industry, especially those of the speculative builder, under this section?  If he can envisage that situation, there would be a tremendous amount of houses built for letting purposes.  The largest section of the building trade would be enlisted on the Minister's side in order to carry out what he wishes to do under this section.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister misunderstood my point. There is no question that these houses are built for letting and that they should be let.  There is nothing to prevent that being done.  Once they are built they are available for letting and once they are let, what the Minister wants to do has been achieved.  Under those circumstances there are two parties involved.  There is, on the one hand, the person to whom the house has been let, the tenant, and there is the person who made the letting, namely the landlord, the person in receipt of the rent.  Under the terms of the section as it stands, he cannot sell his landlord's interest which is nothing more than his rent.  It does not affect the availability of the house for letting at all; it merely affects his right to dispose of the annuity which he is receiving.  I merely mention the matter here to point out the implications of the word &ldquo;sell,&rdquo; that this man is not only constrained by the wording of the section to let but he is constrained to remain as landlord of the house in perpetuity.  I am merely drawing attention to the wording of the section.</P>
