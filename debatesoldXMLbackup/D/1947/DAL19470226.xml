      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the grave dissatisfaction felt in Cork and the south of Ireland by motorists and motor traders at the unsatisfactory arrangements for the distribution of petrol, resulting as it has been, in frequent famines of petrol; and if he proposes to compel the distributors to carry out suitable arrangements for prompt petrol deliveries in future.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in view of the serious position prevailing in Cork City and district arising from scarcity of petrol and of the inconveniences and hardships caused to clergy, professional, commercial and other interests and of the hold-up in deliveries of fertilisers and seeds to farmers and grain growers, he will take the necessary steps to ensure that such a position will not recur, and that in future deliveries of petrol to this important distributing centre be more regular.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the frequent serious shortages of <Col N="1322" /> petrol and kerosene in Cork, he will make arrangements for the direct supply of both by ocean-going tankers; if he is aware that Cork Harbour Oil Wharves Company, Limited, have five large tanks on Haulbowline capable of storing 16,000 tons of oil; and whether, with a view of saving rail transport and preventing the hold-up of urgent spring work by farmers, he will take all possible steps to keep these tanks full.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 1 to 4 together.  In reply, I would refer the Deputies to the statements I made in Dáil Éireann on the 22nd January in reply to questions of a similar character in relation to kerosene.  I explained that the delays in the delivery of petroleum products were due to the fact that, while the supplies available had increased considerably, there had not been a corresponding increase in the facilities at the disposal of the oil companies for distribution purposes.  In particular, I referred to the shortage of tank cars and to the difficulty of arranging for sea-borne deliveries to Cork and other ports.</P>
      <P>As a result of representations which I had made to the appropriate authorities in Great Britain, it has been arranged that extra rail tank cars will be provided for the oil companies but, owing to transport difficulties due to weather conditions in England, delivery of these cars has been delayed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had representations made also with a view to arranging for sea-borne deliveries to Cork and other ports, and I have been informed in reply that, although there is a shortage of the smaller type of tanker for which there are berthing facilities at Cork and these other ports, every effort will be made to facilitate us.  In fact, deliveries have been made, on several occasions recently, by tanker to Cork and also to Foynes and Sligo.  I understand from the oil companies, whose responsibility it is to make these arrangements, that a small tanker called at Cork on Thursday last and that further deliveries will be made by <Col N="1323" /> this tanker.  As regards the possibility of arranging for ocean-going tankers to call at Cork, I am advised that, while storage accommodation is available at Haulbowline, the jetty at which tankers would have to discharge is unsafe and in need of repairs.  I am having inquiries made to see whether it would be possible to carry out these repairs expeditiously, with a view to arranging for deliveries by a large tanker.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Cork distribution depôt, I am advised by the oil companies that the stocks at this depôt have now been replenished and that deliveries are being made throughout the area served by this depôt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>In times of scarcity, would the Minister consider directing the oil companies to utilise their own lorries for carrying the oil from here instead of having them idle?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the substantial increases in the price of meat in many provincial towns make it impossible for poor people to purchase it; if he has received complaints in this connection; and if, in order to safeguard the consumer, he will fix a price for meat which will enable the workers and the poorer sections of the community to purchase it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a seasonal increase in the prices of cattle and sheep throughout the country, with a consequent increase in the prices of beef and mutton.  I have no reason to consider, having regard to the prices of cattle and sheep, that meat prices are excessive, nor have I received any appreciable number of complaints regarding meat prices in provincial towns.  Between August, 1939, and February, 1947, the average live weight prices of prime cattle and sheep increased by over 100 per cent. and 200 per cent. respectively. Between the same dates, the retail prices of beef and mutton increased by 60 per cent. and 120 per cent. respectively. It is not possible to fix prices for meat without reference to the price of cattle and sheep.  An attempt to enforce prices lower than present cattle and sheep prices would require would merely result in the stoppage of sales which would benefit nobody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in many provincial towns, mostly <Col N="1326" /> in the Midlands, the price of meat has been increased by butchers within the last fortnight or three weeks from 4d. to 7d. per lb. which puts meat altogether beyond the reach of the ordinary workingman?  Would the Minister look into this matter in view of the seriousness of the situation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the amount of moisture in turf, arising, to a great extent, from the system of sale by weight, he will consider requiring turf to be sold by measure, thereby discouraging hasty harvesting of turf fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply on the 9th May, 1944, to a similar question then asked by him, to which I have nothing to add.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the turf supplied to the town of Dungarvan has a very high moisture content and that quite recently some people in the town were able to get supplies of turf of very good quality outside Fuel Importers Limited? Would the Minister be prepared to pay the subsidy on turf procured in this way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsidy is paid only in respect of turf obtained through Fuel Importers Limited subject to the ration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will make regulations, analogous to those which obtain in determining the price of wheat according to moisture content, <Col N="1327" /> requiring that the fixed price at which turf may be sold by fuel merchants will be reduced proportionately according as the moisture content of the turf rises above 25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's proposal is not practicable.  Every effort is made to ensure that the turf supplied to fuel merchants is of the highest possible quality.  Last year, however, turf was saved under very unfavourable weather conditions and there has inevitably been a deterioration in quality.  The recent inclement weather has occasioned further difficulties in regard to both the quality and quantity of our turf supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that a sum of £200,000 was deducted from the farmers of Ireland last year in respect of the extra moisture content of their wheat.  Are the fuel merchants to be allowed to get away with 50 per cent. or perhaps 75 per cent. water in the turf which they supply?  If it was good enough to make a deduction in the price paid to farmers for wheat in respect of the moisture content of that wheat, I say that the fuel merchants should be nailed for the extra moisture in turf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that many towns, within 20 or 25 miles from Cork City, are, at the present time, in urgent need of fuel, as they are distant from the nearest bogs, and are unable to avail of such timber fuel as is in their localities as this timber fuel is taken to Cork City where the fixed price is £3 a ton as against 50/- in the towns referred to; and if he will consider making a flat rate price for such timber so that these small towns may get an equitable share of the timber fuel available in their own areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not correct when he states that the controlled price of firewood in the Cork City area is £3 per ton as against 50/- outside that area.  The respective prices are £2 10s. per ton and £2 per ton. The differential in price between the <Col N="1328" /> rural areas and the city area is 10/- per ton and this is intended to cover the extra cost of transport to the city as well as extra handling and distribution charges.  The fixing of a flat price for the whole of the Cork County area as the Deputy suggests would be detrimental to the interests of consumers in the city area, and it is not proposed to adopt this course.</P>

      <P>The Indian Government have advised that for the half year ending 30th June, 1947, this country has been allocated 2,550 tons of raw jute and jute goods.  This represents an improvement on previous allocations and, notwithstanding a falling off in imports of secondhand sacks, the position should be easier, during the coming months, than for several years past. The demand for sacks for grain, seed, sugar, etc., is, however, far greater than in pre-war years, and it will still be necessary for traders to exercise strict economy in the use of sacks.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Offaly County Council have received notice to vacate the existing dispensary premises, which are not owned by them, and are providing alternative dispensary accommodation at the old workhouse buildings, portion of which is being adapted for the purpose.  It appears that the new premises are the most suitable now available and that the general arrangements and equipment will be superior to those in the former dispensary.  While the new dispensary will be situated on the outskirts of the <Col N="1331" /> town, its location should not cause undue inconvenience to persons who will attend it.  In these circumstances it is not proposed to ask the local authority to reconsider the arrangement.</P>

      <P>I am aware that by the operation of Section 8 (4) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, discharged members of the Defence Forces will cease to be entitled to unemployment benefit in respect of contributions acquired by them in the Unemployment Fund for service in those forces if, for reasons other than illness, no contribution is paid during an insurance year.  The payment of 12 further contributions would, however, restore their previous credit in the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that by reason of the operation of Section 8 (4) ex-members of the Defence Forces who return to agricultural or other work which is not insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts may, if they become unemployed, be unable to obtain unemployment benefit in respect of their Defence Forces contributions.  In this respect, however, they are in the same position as persons who, having been insured contributors for a period, <Col N="1334" /> become engaged in an uninsurable occupation.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the various organisations of civil servants have agreed to accept consolidated salaries in lieu of the system of basic salaries and bonus hitherto obtaining in their case and that these consolidated salaries are being calculated at a higher bonus figure than the stabilised figure which previously obtained, but as far as I am aware, all the details of this arrangement have not yet been finally settled or announced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The teachers and other officers mentioned come under the terms of the Local Authorities (Cost of Living) (Amendment) Act, 1945, which limits the cost-of-living bonus that may be paid to all local officers, and it is not possible, therefore, to increase the rate of bonus that they receive at present. It is proposed, however, to permit the vocational education committees to offer to the teachers and other officers in question consolidated salaries calculated on the same lines as the new salaries that are being introduced at present for existing civil servants.  This arrangement will apply as from the 1st November last, and it will be brought into operation as soon as possible, but I am unable to say at present when the preparations for the purpose will be completed.  It will be necessary to obtain the approval of the vocational education committees and of the officers concerned, and steps will be <Col N="1340" /> taken to consult them regarding the arrangement without any avoidable delay.</P>

      <P>There is a site already which was quite adequate for our needs up to about half-way through the emergency, but as there was a great deal of development in telephones and the demand for them increased, the present buildings have become inadequate.  I have the matter under very active consideration lately. The officers were to have been down on the site during the last month, but owing to the weather conditions that was not possible.  They are to go down to investigate the whole problem at once.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is, that in 1938 we entered into an agreement on the basis of paying a rent.  The rent was reasonable and the premises were quite adequate for the purpose then. Now the question is whether we have to take an entirely new site or whether we can take another site beside the present building.  What I am a little afraid of is that these questions may mean that we will be held up to ransom and have to pay too big a price.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that, if the matter is going to be dealt with in the easy-going way which manifested itself during the last 12 years, the Minister will lose the site entirely.  Is it correct to say that this site was offered to the Post Office Department for £1,100 in 1935, and that due to haggling over £200, it is still in the possession of the owner, who now wants for it a much greater sum than he was prepared to sell it for in 1935?  Will the Minister take steps to ensure that, on this occasion, the matter is not handled in that unsatisfactory way?  The site was then lost to the Post Office, and can only be obtained now by paying a substantially higher price than would have had to be paid if the Post Office and the Board of Works had acted with normal alacrity in 1935.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is entirely wrong.  I may add that his remarks are not going to make it easy for us to get a site at a reasonable figure.  The position is that the agreement which was made in 1938 was adequate for our needs in 1938, and as far as could be foreseen for our future needs.  It was only during the emergency that it became more and more apparent that the accommodation was inadequate.  The rent actually paid, as an alternative to buying out the site at £1,100, was £80 a year, plus rates.  We took it on that favourable basis, and it would have been perfectly satisfactory except for the unanticipated development of telephone demand.  Now, we have to go out and look for a site.  I am sorry to have to say that the fact that the Deputy is pressing these questions will not make it easier for us to get a site.</P>

Will the Minister now deny that because the Post Office failed to buy this site at £1,100, instead of £900, they have had to pay £80 a year &mdash;for a difference of £200&mdash;over the past 12 years, and does he regard that as good business?</P>

The alternative, as I said before&mdash;perhaps I may repeat myself as the Deputy has repeated himself three times&mdash;to buying the site was to take it at a rent which we thought was reasonable and fair&mdash;£80 a year, plus £29 in rates.</P>

The original provision of £8,000 was based on 24 sittings for the entire year; actually there have been 25 sittings already to the middle of February.  In addition, Deputies have been using their own motor cars to a greater extent than previously; a further increase in expenditure under this head will probably result from the present cut in rail services.

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to raise a question that I commented upon recently and that I think ought to be brought to some kind of conclusion.  I indicated that, while we have as good a verbatim reporting staff as there is in any Assembly in the world, we are in the position, and it seems to be getting worse rather than better, that nobody can speak in the Irish language in this House and have his remarks recorded in the way in which it is contemplated that speeches in the House should be recorded.  Anybody who intervenes in the debate in the Irish language finds himself compelled later on practically to write out what he has said.  The matter was raised comparatively recently here and, from remarks made by the Taoiseach on the subject, we are supposed to be in the position that machinery cannot be provided, at any rate in the ordinary way, by which the Irish language can be used in a natural way in this House.  The result is that the position of the Irish language in <Col N="1347" /> the House has been reduced to this, that Ministers come to the House on particular subjects&mdash;the Department of Education principally and cosmic physics in addition&mdash;with prepared statements which are read out here and these statements are enshrined in the records of the House, so that the language is degraded and demeaned to the position that it cannot be satisfactorily or naturally used in the House except in that particular kind of way. That cannot continue.</P>
      <P>We are supposed to have a precious linguistic heritage in the language spoken continuously by our people as their native language, going back for thousands of years, and a language which, as well as being the vernacular of our people, was the literary instrument of our people back to the time, you might say, when writing began here.  That vernacular was the literary language of our people back to, say, the earliest records of writing here. Both as a literary medium and as a medium of thought it has the value, the strength and the development of a language which has been so used.  In scattered remnants of glens, mountains and islands in the west and south it still remains.  One of the great flag-wagging ideas we keep in front of us is that we will maintain that language, spread it over the country as a whole, and that some day or another the Irish language, which has been preserved in the minds and on the lips of our people for so many centuries, will again be the language of business, the language of thought, the language of education and the language of general public use in this country.  It is nothing but a fraud to be attempting to persuade ourselves of that and to be holding that up either as an ideal or as representing a piece of work which we are positively and constructively engaged upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had it demonstrated here yesterday that it is possible for some of our people who are traditional Irish speakers to die unattended on islands served by a second-hand broken down telephone that is out of order for as many days in the year as it is in order, that there is an utter refusal on the part of the Government to amend in <Col N="1348" /> any way the landing facilities on the mainland from these islands.</P>

      <P>The position of the Irish language in the House is a matter of importance.  It is a matter of importance because we have a national language.  I only speak on this matter because it is of importance in the preservation of the language as a language carried with respect and love on the lips of our people so that it would have an honoured and practical position in this House.  It has not such a position and it will not get such a position in this House so far as we know by any steps that are being taken to make provision for it.  I suggest that it is vitally necessary that steps should be taken, because where the language does exist it is fading out of existence and passing into disrespect and disuse as nothing is being done either here, where in order to restore its position properly in the House it is necessary that something should be done, nor on the islands where people are left without any assistance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The general position of the Irish language has become more and more serious from every aspect during the last couple of years. It has become very serious here during the last couple of months, as we have been told by the head of the Government that it is not possible, so far as he is concerned, or so far as the Government are concerned, to make any arrangement by which people who wish to speak the national language in this House can speak it in a way in which it will be recorded and, being recorded, will demonstrate to the country as a whole that the national language is respected and used in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the responsibility that lies upon us to know why we cannot <Col N="1349" /> get this machinery provided and why the national language cannot have its respected place in this House, I submit that we are bound to take cognisance of the fact that it is fading out of our glens, off our mountains and out of our islands, and that nothing is being done to see that it is maintained there, at any rate.  It is there we are concerned with having it, but we cannot have it and we cannot get it used as long as it is ostracised from this House.  Every time we listen to a Minister reading out a prepared document, any hope as to something being done for the language goes down, and we begin to despise ourselves and our Parliament. It is so futile and so impotent that it cannot do anything except to treat us to some odd dissertations read here which simply make us realise that the language is in a despised and futile position.  For that reason, I raise the matter, and I ask those who are presenting this Estimate what is going to be done, whether those people in the House who want to make use of Irish in a natural and easy way as others make use of English will be allowed and permitted to do so.</P>

If a Deputy could give previous notice of his intention of speaking, some arrangement might be made to have some one of the reporters capable of reporting in Irish present on such an occasion.  It is not possible to have one of the limited number of reporters who are capable of reporting in Irish present on all occasions.  That is the cause of all the difficulty.  Everybody, naturally enough, would wish that the Deputy's point of view could be met and that we would have a complete staff capable, each and every one <Col N="1351" /> of them, of reporting speeches in both languages but in existing circumstances that is not possible because they cannot be obtained.</P>

If we have perfectly competent reporters, why not take even the limited number now capable of doing it and give them special duties and <Col N="1352" /> divide them between the Dáil and the Seanad and make special financial provision for them and leave them entirely free to be in attendance to watch whatever part of the proceedings in either House in which they may be on duty takes place through the Irish language and get additional reporters who may only be able to do the reporting work through English, who can be utilised in the ordinary way?  Such reporters as we have who are competent to report in Irish ought to be given a different type of duty from that which they have at present.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,030,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1947, for the increase of the Grant to Local Authorities in Relief of Rates on Agricultural Land (No. 35 of 1925, No. 28 of 1931, No. 23 of 1939 and No. 36 of 1946).</P>

      <P>(1) The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to provide the additional sum required in the current year to enable the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1946, to be implemented.  As the House knows, that Act made provision for a substantially increased measure of relief from rates on agricultural land for two years (1946-47 and 1947-48) and for a simpler method of determining the primary, supplementary and employment allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) A firm estimate of the cost for the current year of the new allowances could not be made before 1st February, because claims for employment allowances could be made up to that date.  The total amount now estimated to be required this year for the Agricultural Grant will be approximately £2,900,000, which represents an increase of £1,030,000 over the original figure of £1,870,000 (of which £1,270,989 has been provided by means of the Vote <Col N="1353" /> for Supplementary Agricultural Grants already passed by the Dáil, the balance of £599,011 being borne on the Central Fund).  The allocation of the increased grant as compared with the allocation of the grant for 1945-46 is estimated as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>(3) Under the Act, the amount of the grant will no longer be fixed in advance either in total or as regards the sum allocated to each county, but will vary in accordance with the amounts required to give the new rate reliefs which, in turn, will depend, as regards the primary and supplementary allowances, on the different general rates struck by rating authorities throughout the country.  The employment allowances element will depend on the number and amount of claims made before the statutory date (1st February).</P>
    <P>(4) The new scale of allowances provided for in the 1946 Act is as follows:&mdash; (a) the primary allowance rate on land valuations up to £20 and on the first £20 of higher valuations will be three-fifths of the general rate struck in the rating area concerned; (b) the supplementary allowance on the part of the valuation above £20 will be one-fifth of the general rate; and (c) in addition to the supplementary relief on valuation above £20, an employment allowance of 10/- in the £ will be made on the excess of the valuation over £20 where men are employed full-time on the holding, subject to the limitation that the allowance shall not in any case exceed £6 10s. 0d. for each man at work on the holding throughout the preceding calendar year or the balance of the rates on the valuation over £20, whichever is the less.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be recognised that this contribution forms a substantial portion of the income of each local authority and it plays an important part in the finances of all local authorities.  Local authorities utilise for their finances a system very different from that utilised by the national Exchequer.  They derive their income mainly from rates which are collected in two half-yearly moieties. The difficulty which most county councils experience is that there is a lean period in the early part of the year, before the first moiety is collected. The financial year starts on the 1st April and from then until August or September there is very little collected in the way of rates. The result is that a local authority has either to accumulate a big credit balance to carry it over the first six months, or, alternatively, to borrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be desirable if this substantial grant was made available to local authorities earlier in the year, say, in the first quarter.  It would assist them during the summer months. We must remember that it is during that period county councils have the biggest outlay; there is a big amount of work to be done on public roads and elsewhere, and the outlay of the various councils is usually very substantial during the early part of the year.  It is unsatisfactory that during that particular period the finances of all county councils are in a precarious position.  If these grants were made available to the local authorities during the first quarter of the year local administration would be helped and it <Col N="1355" /> would make for higher efficiency, because the county councils would have money in hand to carry them along, instead of having to struggle for the first three or four months upon a very small income.</P>
    <P>No provision is made with regard to employment allowances for casual workers.  During the spring and harvest, the busy months, it is necessary to employ a large number of workers on the land, a number in excess of those who are in permanent employment. I suggest the employer should be given the benefit of that casual employment.  It is a very serious thing, particularly for large farmers and employers, to find that because they are unable to keep men all the year round in permanent employment they will lose a substantial portion of this grant.  It is all the more serious for the farmer, in view of the fact that the basic rates are now much higher than in former years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the points made by Deputy Cogan, it would not be possible to have the grants made available as he suggests, because of the fact that people can claim the employment allowance up to 1st February and, because claims may come in up to the very last date, the amount cannot be ascertained in advance.  It is not quite correct to say that local authorities are not provided for.  A percentage of the grant is made available in May in order to tide local authorities over the lean period until the rates begin to come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the percentage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>It is about one-sixth. With regard to the other point made by the Deputy, to have these grants made available in respect of casual employees, the whole purpose of these grants is to encourage farmers to keep their men permanently.  The idea is that a farmer may be encouraged to keep an extra man, or, in the case of large farms, two extra men, constantly in employment rather than have casual employment during the busy period.</P>

      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary consider reducing the valuation <Col N="1356" /> level from £20 to £15 for the abatement in respect of agricultural labour?

I asked him what were the districts which, for the purpose of his Department, were regarded as the Irish-speaking districts.  He indicated in his <Col N="1361" /> reply that the Irish-speaking districts, so far as his Department were concerned, were those enumerated in the schedule to the Housing (Gaeltacht) Act, 1929, with the newly established colonies in County Meath.  Continuing his reply, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mainly through historical causes, the scheduled Gaeltacht districts present special economic and social problems, the alleviation of which necessitates measures not applicable to the rest of the country.  The need for such differentiation has for long been acknowledged, as is evidenced by the activities of the former Congested Districts Board, whose work in the fostering of employment and the improvement of housing and general conditions has been continued and expanded by the branch of my Department dealing specially with the Irish-speaking districts, viz.  Serbhísí na Gaeltachta, and the Land Commission.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether, in carrying on Gaeltacht Services now, attention is paid rather to the fact that there are districts there with special economic and social problems than to the fact that there are special districts which are supposed to be Irish speaking.  It is desirable that we should get clear as to why Gaeltacht Services are being carried on.  If they are being carried on simply in relation to special economic and social problems in certain parts of the country, we ought to be clear about that.  If they are being carried on because there are special districts which are regarded as Irish spealing and the economy of which it is deired to strengthen in order that they may retain their normal use of the language and that the language may be continued there as the ordinary vernaular of the people without being disturbed by economic difficulties which would require those people to look outside for the purpose of earning their livelihood, then we should be clear about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rase the question because it has been definitely indicated by the Department of Education that there are certain districts covered by the Minister's operations under Gaeltacht <Col N="1362" /> Services where Irish is fading out and wasting away.  That has been declared in respect of certain districts in Kerry. Mayo and Donegal&mdash;that the Irish language is no longer substantially the language of the homes in those areas. I want to know whether the Minister, in the administration of Gaeltacht Services, is required, inside his responsibilities, to take cognisance in any way of whether Irish is being spoken or used in the district which he is administering.  I raised previously the question of Dunquin area and I have been raising very recently, in a way which has disturbed the Ceann Comhairle very much on a number of occasions, the position of the population on the Blasket Islands.  I hope there will be a suitable opportunity of driving some of those facts home with a view to getting proper recognition of them and proper decisions in relation to them.  The question which I want to concentrate on now is: has the Minister for Lands, in the administration of the moneys voted for Gaeltacht Services, any responsibility for ascertaining whether the Irish language is, in fact, being used at all in the areas in which these services are being administered?  If he has all the machinery, does he use it for ascertaining that and has he found in some of these areas facts such as the Minister for Education says he finds in some of these districts?  When he finds these facts about the language wasting away and being less used, does his Department do anything to arrest that wastage or does his Department take any cognisance of it in any way? I should like to ask further whether this administration takes place entirely in respect to social and economic weaknesses or whether it takes place also in relation to conditions affecting the use of the Irish language as the ordinary language in these districts.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister what was the stock in hands at the close of the year in the Central Marketing Depôt as opposed to the stock on hands during the previous year.  I do not see why some attempt should not be made, theoretically at any rate, to regard this Estimate as coming within the scope of an ordinary <Col N="1363" /> business in which the Central Marketing Depôt distributes the goods as a sales organisation for a number of scattered industries throughout the Gaeltacht which require help and guidance.  I think the sooner we approach the matter in that way the better.  A number of years ago, I think, there was a feeling that the goods in the Central Marketing Depôt were out of date, and I can recall the Parliamentary Secretary of the time telling us that ties had to be sold at 1d. apiece.  If Deputies here each year could ascertain the amount of goods in stock, some check would be kept to ascertain whether goods were being manufactured and sold as desirable commodities or whether they were being merely planked into an increasingly large store, people being paid to look after them, when it would really pay the Department to throw them out.  I notice, for instance, that there is an increase in the item for packing materials, stationery, freight and postage.  Surely one would think that at the present time, when practically any garments that are being made can be sold quite easily, something near the cost of manufacture could be recovered from the sale of these goods? I am not saying that the parts of this industry that cannot be made to pay should be closed down, but the idea should always be kept in mind that you are educating people in the Gaeltacht for the purpose of enabling them to make goods that are attractive and in keeping with modern fashions.  There is no use in manufacturing articles of clothing which people have ceased wearing.  That is the point I wish to make and one of the best methods of achieving that from year to year would be to know what the stock in the central depôt was each year.  I ask the Minister to tell us that when he is replying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>One important way to try to strengthen the Irish language in the Gaeltacht, in my view, is to endeavour to remove social and economic disabilities.  While what I said on the 20th November to Deputy Mulcahy still remains perfectly correct, I have been wondering if the Deputy was suggesting that, if the Irish language does lessen in its use in any particular district, Gaeltacht Services should not continue to operate in that particular district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be perfectly clear that I made no such suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to be quite clear on it.  We have a district, which was possibly designed many years ago under the chairmanship of the Deputy in the Inquiry into the Gaeltacht, which still remains our area of operation and, even if the conditions did not remain the same, I think it would be unwise to remove factories that have been for a long time established in any particular area.</P>
      <P>It is a responsibility of every Department and every Deputy, of course, to try to be helpful in the development of the Irish language and its retention in the Gaeltacht, but this Department has not any specific responsibility in regard to that.  We have the responsibility of employing, as far as possible, no employees, or officers controlling those employees, who are not fully conversant with Irish and do not utilise it as their every-day language.  We do that. Sometimes, in a very odd case, it is not possible to fill a particular post with an Irish speaker, but whenever we have any employees in any particular post they are 99½ per cent.  Irish speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not quite understand Deputy Dockrell's point.  The development of industries in the Gaeltacht, while it is a business and is operated as far as possible on business principles, is altogether different from an ordinary business in Dublin City.  It was something <Col N="1366" /> that had to be done in which commercial people had no interest.  It was quite natural to suppose that, when the work was started, mistakes were made and, even if no mistakes were made, dress materials of various kinds go quickly out of fashion.  I can assure the Deputy now that the Gaeltacht Services are so organised that there is no material that is likely to be sold at a lesser cost than the cost of its production.  We have not been in the position of having to sell any of our production at a loss in recent years.  That possibly did obtain when the organisation started first, but it does not operate now.</P>
    <P>The amount of the original Estimate was roughly £14,000, yet the amount spent by the Department is roughly £350,000.  All this comes in by way of sales of material which we produce. Very valuable service is given to the people in the Gaeltacht, a social and economic service and a service that is bound to be very valuable in the retention of the Irish language in those areas, at very little cost to the State. Therefore, I recommend this Estimate to the House.</P>
    <P>I regret, a Chinn Chomhairle, your ruling in regard to Deputy Murphy's reference to Gaeltacht housing, as I was most anxious to know what exactly the criticism of Gaeltacht housing was, apart from any other type of housing in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £6,500 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1947, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Marine Service (Merchant Shipping Acts, <Col N="1367" /> 1894 to 1939, and the Foreshore Act, 1933 (No. 12 of 1933); for certain payments in respect of Compensation, including extra wages of seamen and the cost of medical treatment; for payments in respect of the provision of certain Protective Equipment for Ships; and for payments in connection with the rescue of certain Shipwrecked Seamen.</P>
    <P>The main reason why a Supplementary Estimate was required is that there was a substantial falling off in the proceeds from the sale of wreck. Unclaimed wreck is, as the House knows, sold by the local receiver of wreck to the best advantage and the proceeds of sales are credited to this vote.  Since the end of the war there has been a substantial diminution in the amount of unclaimed wreck and, consequently, the estimated receipts under that heading of £11,349 will not be realised.  The deficiency is estimated at £6,200.</P>
    <P>The other items are all of small amount.  Under sub-head I (4), a claim arose in respect of a seaman who was maintained and treated in hospital abroad on various occasions since 1941, but whose claim to assistance out of this Vote did not come to notice until this year.  Under sub-head I (5), claims in respect of seamen who had been detained abroad were met, the reason for the delay in making these payments being the settlement of a claim by a foreign Government which had advanced money to these sailors during their detention.  Under sub-head J two claims in respect of the equipment of ships for protection against magnetic mines arose during the year.  One case was delayed by reason of certain unusual features and in the other case the claim was held in abeyance by the company concerned.  Under L, provision is made for payment of £680 to the owner of a Spanish fishing vessel which rescued the crew of an Irish ship, the <i>City of Bremen</i>, which was sunk by belligerent action in 1942.  The crew of the <i>City of Bremen</i> were taken ashore and fed.  The owner of the fishing vessel is being compensated for the loss of catch and for the food supplied to the rescued crews.  These are the <Col N="1368" /> only items for which additional moneys are required.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £55,240 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1947, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, including certain other services administered by that Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increased provision is necessary to provide for additional expenditure amounting to £70,450 on sub-heads A, <Col N="1369" /> B, C, E, G, H and M of the Vote. Savings are available on other sub-heads of the Vote to the extent of £300, and these, together with a net increase of £14,910 in Appropriations-in-Aid, reduce the extra provision required to £55,240.</P>
    <P>Sub-head A.&mdash;The provision for bonus in the original Estimate was calculated on the basis of a cost-of-living figure of 210 and provision was also made for the payment of emergency bonus.  The consolidation settlement which has recently been agreed to is based on a cost-of-living figure of 270 and the additional sum of £57,700 required under this sub-head is due solely to the extra cost of consolidation.</P>
    <P>Sub-head B.&mdash;The additional requirement of £400 arises in consequence of the payment of increased rates of disturbance allowances sanctioned for unattached officers of customs and excise.  These allowances are payable to officers who are sent on temporary duty from one station to another.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C.&mdash;The sum of £320 is required to meet the cost of arrears of billeting allowance sanctioned in the case of an official in the Conjoint Office, London.  This officer was evacuated to Llandudno and the allowance was on the lines of billeting allowances payable to officers of the British service who were also evacuated to Llandudno. Provision is also made in this sub-head for additional expenditure (£280) incurred by way of lodging allowances to officers who, on transfer, were unable to secure housing accommodation at their new headquarters.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E.&mdash;Of the total of £3,900 required under this sub-head nearly £3,000 is due to the application of the consolidation settlement to collectors of taxes; the balance is due to increased remuneration to collectors owing to increased numbers of income-tax assessments and to increased remuneration to banks and stockbrokers in respect of income-tax work arising out of the negotiation of dividend warrants.</P>
    <P>Sub-head G.&mdash;The requirement of £4,250 is due to the cost of a new printing machine for use in the Stamping Branch of the Office of the Revenue <Col N="1370" /> Commissioners.  Provision for the purchase of the machine was made in 1945-46 but there was a delay in delivery.</P>
    <P>Sub-head H.&mdash;The further provision of £400 is required to meet the cost of certain telephone accounts which, owing to delay in certification, were not ripe for payment in 1945-46.</P>
    <P>Sub-head M.&mdash;The additional sum of £3,200 is required mainly to meet increased expenditure in connection with rewards for the detection of attempted illegal exports and imports.</P>
    <P>Sub-head R.&mdash;A net increase of £14,910 is anticipated in receipts under this sub-head.  To this sub-head are credited receipts which, for the most part, represent reimbursements to the Exchequer for extra Departmental services rendered by the revenue staff to various public authorities, the trading community and others.</P>
    <P>The estimated appropriations under the following four headings have been increased:&mdash;(a) Moneys received from merchants, etc., for special attendance of officers, £4,200; (b) fines, forfeitures, law costs recovered, etc., £5,000; (c) proceeds of customs sales (seizures, etc.), £4,700; (d) charge for administrative expenses in connection with widows' and orphans' pensions, £1,010; total, £14,910. (a) is due to increased demands for the extra attendance of customs officers in connection with the clearance of goods from the ports.  In (b) and (c) the improvement in the supply position which was anticipated at the time the original Estimates were framed has not materialised and the volume of arrears effected in connection with attempted illegal exports and imports continues at a high level.  In consequence, increased receipts are expected from fines, etc., and from the sale of seized goods.  (d) is due to the increased amount to be recovered from the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Fund in respect of salaries of investigation staff as a result of the consolidation settlement which has already been referred to.</P>
    <P>Sub-head K.&mdash;The saving of £300 is under this sub-head and is due mainly to reductions in the price of petrol.</P>

      <P>It was mentioned <Col N="1371" /> on previous occasions that the Revenue Commissioners would appear to be one of the bodies that were affected by the disclosures contained in the letters sent by Dr. MacCarvill to the Taoiseach in connection with the affairs of the Monaghan Curing Company, Limited, and published in the Dáil on the 5th June, 1946, and also by the facts disclosed in the report of the tribunal that was set up to inquire into these matters.  I would like to ask the Minister for Finance what representations, if any, he has made to the Revenue Commissioners with regard to the facts disclosed there, and what exactly has happened as a result?  For instance, in column 1325 of the Dáil Debates, for the 5th June, 1946, in the letter addressed by Mr. Darach Connolly to Dr. MacCarvill and forwarded to the Government, we read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I should perhaps point out that the company has never paid any dividends as such, but the directors drew from the company, by way of salary and otherwise, in exact ratio to the amount of capital held by each.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In an earlier part of the letter, it said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The audited accounts for the years 1938 to 1944 show that the company, on the average, has made extremely good profits especially when considered in relation to the amount of the capital invested.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Later in the letter it is stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Following is a summary of the amounts drawn&mdash;(by Dr. Ward; it only referred to Dr. Ward)&mdash;in salaries during the periods stated: during ten months of 1938, £916 13s. 4d.; during the year 1939, £1,000; during the year 1940, £1,750; during the year 1941, £2,000; during the year 1942, £2,000; during the year 1943, £1,000; during three months of 1944, £250; total salaries during six years and one month, £8,916 13s. 4d.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It can be inferred from that letter that the other directors of the company drew similar amounts by way of salary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out that we had disclosed in the letter of Mr. Darach Connolly, solicitor, to Dr. MacCarvill, which was forwarded to the Taoiseach, and the full terms of which were given to the Dáil on 5th June, 1946, that in the case of the Monaghan Curing Company, Limited, over ten months of 1938 down to 1944 a sum of £8,916 was drawn by way of salary by one of the directors of the company and, being drawn by way of salary, would be drawn as earned income and would, therefore, be liable to taxation at a particular level, whereas the implication of the statement there is that, at any rate, some portion of it was certainly drawn by way of interest or payment in respect of capital invested in the company and could, therefore, not be regarded as earned income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know whether the Minister has drawn the attention of the Revenue Commissioners to the implication of the matter stated in that part of the letter; whether the Revenue Commissioners have taken any cognisance of that; whether they have had any special expenses arising out of the necessity for investigating these matters and who has been charged with the expenses; whether if the actions implied there are penal <Col N="1374" /> actions, any penalties have been imposed.</P>
    <P>Again, in paragraph 17 of the report it is disclosed:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The proceeds of the cash transactions, including therein comparatively small sums representing the price of bacon and other products sold to the directors for use in their respective households, amounted to the sum of £4,739 11s. 4d.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is, that moneys to that amount, which were withheld from the company's accounts, were, according to paragraph 19 of the report, not disclosed by the company or the directors personally for tax purposes.  What investigation has been made into these matters; what expenses have been occasioned to the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the inquiries that it was apparently necessary to make in order to investigate these matters; what penalties, if any, have been applied; are there any other matters arising out of the report and the facts found in the report that the Revenue Commissioners have found it necessary to inquire into and what have been the results of their inquiry?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister one or two questions in connection with this Supplementary Estimate.  The increase under sub-head A in salaries etc. is quite understandable and the same would apply to sub-head E.  When we come to sub-head R&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid &mdash;the Estimate for these Appropriations-in-Aid was £49,090.  The revised Estimate is £64,000 and I presume that the present revised Estimate is something more than is usually understood by the word &ldquo;estimate&rdquo;.  That means that there is a sum £14,910 more than was estimated for.  Under the headings the Minister mentioned where those increases occurred, but he did not give any explanation of this increase in Appropriations-in-Aid, nor did he give any explanation as to why there should have been what amounts to a mistake in estimation of 34 per cent.  That is a very big error to make in an Estimate for the year.  I grant you that it is an error on the right side.  But it is always easy for a Government Department <Col N="1375" /> by under-estimating its Appropriations-in-Aid to come here at the end of the year with a very happy picture of the year's work of that Department.  It is not necessarily the best accountancy, in fact I think it shows a very inaccurate estimate and I would like the Minister to give us some further explanation of how an error of 34 per cent. occurred in the Estimate of this Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say in relation to the provision under E that the increase there of £3,900 was caused by reason of the fact that there had been an increase in the number of income-tax assessments and I want to know if amongst the additional assessments which the officials of that Department had to make what additional assessment was made in respect of Dr. Ward, Mr. Corr and Mr. MacCarvill, of the Monaghan Bacon Company, in relation to the proceeds which they pocketed of the illicit transactions in bacon.  The total sum of these transactions amounted to £4,739 11s. 4d. Of that sum Dr. Ward pocketed £2,962 3s. 8d., leaving a balance between Mr. Corr and Mr. MacCarvill of £1,777 7s. 8d., and I take it that was divided between these two gentlemen in proportion to their shares in the company.  I have not time to calculate the figure, but it would appear that on that basis Mr. Corr would have received a fraction of 9/32 of that sum and Mr. MacCarvill would have received 3/32 of that sum.  In the findings of the tribunal, paragraph 19, it is stated these sums were not disclosed in the books of the company and were not brought to audit.  The proceeds were not disclosed by the company or by the directors personally for tax purposes.  I put it to the Minister yesterday that we should have some information from him of the action taken by him, in the first place, on that finding; and, secondly, of the action taken by the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the three directors who had pocketed these moneys without disclosing them in the books of the company or declaring them for tax purposes. <Col N="1376" /> Ordinarily, I understand the policy of the commissioners is not to prosecute: that they have some form of penal assessment or additional assessment which they impose on the tax defaulter and that they compel him to pay heavily for his offence in that way.  I think in fairness to the House, we should know if such action was taken in the case of these three gentlemen, and if so, what additional moneys they were compelled to pay by way of income-tax.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister for Finance if anything is being done for the old age pensioners, the blind pensioners and the widows and orphans.  Surely if we are going to squander money these unfortunate people are entitled to relief.  The old age pensioners are asked to exist on 10/- a week, widows on 7/6 a week with 2/6 for each child.  I think it is about time that the Government should wake up and think of the promises they made when seeking power in 1932, when they said that if they were returned to power there would be no people in the country either poor or hungry.  We seem to find money for everything and everybody except for the unfortunate poor.</P>

I congratulate Deputy Mulcahy on his helpers in this campaign. The <i>Irish Times</i> not only regard themselves as Sudetan-British but they regard themselves still as active Black-and-Tans. They are carrying on the fight upon the honour of this country <Col N="1377" /> and they have got the help of the dirt-throwers of Fine Gael.  The principal one of them, of course, was absent from this House for six months but he was sure to be here yesterday.  I refer to Deputy McGilligan.</P>

I also told the Deputy, and he knows it perfectly well, that the Revenue Commissioners are as independent in their assessment of income-tax&mdash;as independent of the Minister for Finance&mdash;as are the judges in carrying out the ordinary law.  I rely upon them and I think the people of the country know perfectly well that the Revenue Commissioners will do their duty and collect all the money which they can prove is due from Dr. Ward or from any other citizen and that the matter can be safely left in their keeping. Deputy Mulcahy of course, knows that as well as I do.  He only wants to get another couple of columns in the <i>Irish Times</i> to-morrow, in his campaign to drag down the honour of this country.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £45,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1947, for Grants to Universities and Colleges (8 Edw. 7, c. 38; No. 42 of 1923; No. 32 of 1926; No. 35 of 1929; and No. 27 of 1934), including certain Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The statutory grants for the general purposes of the three university colleges provided for on the current year's Vote amount to £82,000, £40,000 and £30,000, for Dublin, Cork, and Galway, respectively. The amounts were fixed as far back as 1926 in the cases of Dublin and Cork and 1929 in the case of Galway. Further recurrent grants have since been authorised for particular purposes. viz., £3,000 a year for the Department of Modern Irish Language and Literature in Dublin and £380 a year towards the cost of certain lectureships through Irish in Galway; there have also been occasional lump sum payments to the colleges from time to time for purely <i>ad hoc</i> purposes, oftentimes for the extinction of temporary debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 1946, each of the three colleges made representations to the Government that the amount of its annual grant from the State should be increased having regard to the higher costs and changed monetary conditions generally.  After prolonged investigation and discussions with the president and officers of each of the colleges, the Government decided that the grants <Col N="1379" /> for the current financial year should be increased by the amounts set out in the Supplementary Estimate.  The extra amounts represent increases of something over 25 per cent. all round.</P>
    <P>The separate grants for the Faculty of General Agriculture in Dublin and the Faculty of Dairy Science in Cork, which are borne on the Vote for Agriculture, will be similarly increased this year and the necessary provision is being included in a Supplementary Estimate for that service which the Minister for Agriculture will be presenting to the House some day soon. The amounts are £7,255 for Dublin and £3,775 for Cork.</P>
    <P>The total extra provision being made for university colleges in this financial year is, therefore, £56,030.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is not an inappropriate preamble to the discussion of this Vote to point out that the extra amount now given, £24,570&mdash;I am specially interested in the college here in Dublin&mdash;represents 12 times the sum we voted yesterday to a man adjudged guilty by a tribunal, in order to defray the cost he was put to to defend himself. His offence led to his disappearance from the ranks of the Government, but he has been safeguarded by a particular pension.  One could make other interesting comparisons between the sum that gentleman got away with in connection with his position as Parliamentary Secretary and his profits as a bacon curer, in which he was completely inexperienced, as well as the undisclosed profits for which he will be one day brought to book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the university matter proper, we are being given an extra £45,000 as between the three colleges.  I have not the advantage of knowing the situation in Cork and Galway as well as I happen to know it in connection with Dublin. My information in connection with Dublin is derived from one of the finest reports on the whole situation with regard to university education that has been produced in this country.  That report has been produced by a group of professors and some of the lecturers of the University College, Dublin, on a reference given to them by the governing <Col N="1380" /> body of the college through the President of the University College, Dublin, in May, 1944.  They prepared a report which they signed in January, 1946.  Right through the year 1946 there were discussions going on with the Government on foot of that report. The report was presented in full to the Government.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons I am mentioning these dates is because I find it hard to understand the reference by the Taoiseach in connection with the Cosmic Physics Vote that he had been seeking from the universities information as to what they require to put them into a position that would seem to be adequate to the duties they were carrying out, and he appeared to be complaining that he had not got this information. Nobody who had the benefit of reading this report could complain that he was without information on the matter.  I understand the report was in the hands of the Government quite soon after it was signed and presented to the college.  I presume some time was occupied by having it considered by the statutory bodies connected with the college.  There is quite a considerable review of the whole process of university education in Ireland which is not all relevant to this Vote but very little of it can be considered completely irrelevant.</P>
    <P>As far as the Dublin College situation is concerned&mdash;and I will take it as my example this evening&mdash;I am pretty certain that what I say in connection with the University College, Dublin, can be paralleled by similar remarks in connection with the two other colleges, because they are suffering from the impact of the new currency that we have here.  I think I should fit this matter into the general framework of life in this country. What we are now suffering from is the result of possibly the best intentioned efforts of the Government during the war, efforts that, no matter how well intentioned, produced the most deplorable results.  It is only in recent months it has become recognised how much we have suffered from what has been done.  We used to have our rewards in life measured by what we <Col N="1381" /> knew as the pound sterling.  We know there are pounds of other types; there is, for instance, the pound Egypt, the pound Turkish, and certainly the pound Australian.</P>
    <P>Here I come to the chief author of our present discomforts, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  We have, so to speak, the Lemass pound here and we measure our standards in Lemass pounds.  We measure them in ten shillingses of the old rate.  That is the value that, under the policy adopted here for five years, is now associated with what is still the monetary unit for measuring incomes and rewards in this country.  This country, within the past two or three days, has been held up to public odium in the report issued by the International Labour Commission as being one of four countries which, during the war, succeeded in lowering its wage rates beyond what its wage rates were at the start of the war.  It is pointed out in the International Labour Office Report that in nearly all countries monetary rewards were increased, but the purchasing power did not increase in relation to the moneys paid.  This country is picked out as being in the group of four countries in which purchasing power lapsed below what it was at the start of the war.</P>
    <P>When one considers the company we are in, it certainly cannot be alleged to be a very creditable performance on our part.  We are grouped with France, Japan and Czechoslovakia, and when one thinks of devastated France, of overrun and destroyed Czechoslovakia, we get a definite idea of how little good, and, in fact, how positively bad, were the efforts made in this country to try to preserve people against the impact of war conditions.  We are the only neutral country put into this group, and if Japan was not over-run during the greater part of the war, she certainly suffered at the end, and, as a matter of fact, her currency, I should imagine, shows even a greater depreciation than our own.</P>
    <P>In any event, we start on that basis in considering any Vote which we have to consider here, that the moneys paid to all sections of the community would have to be doubled before we could <Col N="1382" /> arrive at a situation in which people would be getting the same reward in purchasing power as they got pre-war. I open on this new Vote for University College, Dublin, by saying that, with this addition, the staff of University College, Dublin, will not be put in the same position in relation to the purchasing power of the rewards they get for their services to the community as that in which they were in pre-war years, 1937-38 and 1938-39.  There is nothing in the Vote in respect of capital endowment and the trouble from which University College, Dublin, suffers is that, from these annual grants, it has to take something to put against the debt which has been accumulated because of the deficiencies in capital endowment.</P>
    <P>When the universities were founded, the original grant given to University College, Dublin, was £32,000.  The building grant was £110,000.  It was recognised that that would not be sufficient for the buildings which were plotted, and it was decided that the best thing to do was to put up as respectable a facade in the way of buildings as could be put up, along the Earlsfort Terrace frontage and to leave the wing around by Hatch Street uncompleted, to spend the money available to us in getting as much building done as possible and leaving the rest to be completed from the later grants which we hoped for. Unfortunately, before the buildings which were to be put up out of the grant of £110,000 had been completed, the 1914-18 war broke out.</P>
    <P>The contractor found that he could not carry out his contract, and in any event the value of money went down to a particular point, with the result that even the amount of building originally intended for that sum of £110,000 had to be reduced.  Some buildings were, however, completed, but the college was left with a debt of £39,000, part of that debt having to be financed out of the annual grants, these having been intended originally for the maintenance of the staff, for the provision of the amenities necessary to a college and for payments to the administrative staff who also had to be accommodated there.</P>
    <P>In 1920-21, a sum of £20,000 was given to the college and eventually, in 1926, <Col N="1383" /> a special grant was given, and, in addition, the building known as the College of Science, which, when put up, cost £200,000, was given to University College, Dublin, as one way of easing the tremendous difficulties under which the college laboured because of the fact that the student body had grown out of all proportion to the original buildings&mdash;the class rooms were overcrowded and every room used for staff or students was completely and entirely inadequate to the ordinary needs of these people and the services they were supposed to give.  Since then, debt has still accumulated and eventually a non-recurring grant of £70,000 was given in 1943, but the result of all that is that University College, Dublin, still finds itself paying out of its annual grants, or else running into debt with a bank, for the deficiencies in the amounts given towards its proper equipment by way of buildings.</P>
    <P>The total sums which have been calculated as expended by way of capital outlay on buildings, alterations in buildings and on the playing fields at Belfield, come to about £250,000, and, in capital grants, the college has got £155,000, plus one non-recurring grant of £70,000, part of which was not for building.  Suppose they are all taken as being building funds&mdash;they left the college in debt by over £30,000 and the interest in respect of that debt has to be found out of the annual grants.</P>
    <P>At this point, the comparison may be made which is contained in this report. The number of students in the college at present is 3,200.  The original number with which the college started was 500 and, in 1926, when the College of Science was handed over, the number of students was in the neighbourhood of 1,200.  It had grown from the original group of 530 to 1,200, and it is now 3,200.  When looking for comparisons, we do not take the older well-endowed English universities, but two of the more modern universities, Birmingham and Manchester, give a basis of comparison.  Birmingham University has something less than 1,500 students.  Its capital grants, between the university proper, the student union and halls of residence, amount to £1,300,000.  Manchester University <Col N="1384" /> student body is about 1,700 and the capital grants given to that university to date amount to £1,100,000.</P>
    <P>As I said, the repercussion of the capital endowment deficiency on our annual grants has only to be mentioned to be realised.  The college has to devote some part of the grants it gets to maintain its staff and provide all the equipment of a modern nature which is of an annual type, to meeting the debt which has accumulated over the years, a debt which is paid off from time to time and then starts to grow afresh. The original grant for the university was £32,000.  That was increased because it was found to be hopelessly inadequate, even in the early years, and, up to 1925-26, the college had got an additional £20,000.  University College, Dublin, therefore, was maintaining itself, or was supposed to maintain itself, on an annual grant of £52,000.</P>
    <P>In 1926, the scheme worked out&mdash; although it did not work out with absolute accuracy&mdash;was that the original grant was to be doubled. University College, Dublin, was to be given an additional sum of £32,000 which did not raise the total grant to the full £84,000 but did raise it to £82,000.  In 1926, an additional grant of what was almost the equivalent of the old grant was given and the college was then told to carry on on the basis of an £82,000 grant.  Again, I want that regarded in relation to the number of students.  In 1926, the number of students was about 1,200, and, in 1944-45, it was 3,037, and, in the present year, it is just short of 3,200.  The number has more than doubled, and yet no moneys by way of annual grant have been given until now, when we are giving an additional £24,000.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, on account of the growth in the number of the student body, the new faculties which have been founded and the additions made to existing faculties, considerable extra work has fallen on the staff.  In recent years, in addition to the fact that the emoluments they got were reduced by the heavy income-tax which had to be paid, the pounds they got, which used to buy 20/- worth of goods, had <Col N="1385" /> slumped to the point at which each £ was worth 10/-.  It is quite clear in these circumstances that the university required additional sums to be paid to it and, as I say, it is now being given this sum of £24,000.  With that sum of £24,000, it would be possible to make some improvement in respect of, I think, all the staff.</P>
    <P>Here, again, I should like to make a comparison.  The average salary of a senior professor in University College, Dublin&mdash;I am speaking of a man of many years standing in the college&mdash; was, pre-war, between £800 and £900. It will be possible with this grant to put some of these people up to £1,400. That means that they will have a purchasing power of £725 as against the £800 or £900 they used enjoy.  It will be possible to put only five members of the staff on that basis.  Three more will be put on a basis of £1,300, now equivalent to £650.  The bulk of the full-time professors will be allowed £1,200, with a present purchasing power of £600.  Although this addition is very gladly welcomed, it must be viewed in proper perspective.  The proper perspective is that it does not even put the staff of the college back, so far as real purchasing power is concerned, in the position in which they were in 1938-39.</P>
    <P>We have been asked, I understand, to increase students' fees.  The situation at the moment, with regard to the revenue of the college, on which it has to maintain its whole staff, is that £82,000 comes from these grants and £72,000 or thereabouts from students' fees.  The entire expenditure is not exactly on a 50-50 basis but it is somewhere approaching that&mdash;£82,000 from the State and £72,000 from students. Our fees have been lower than those of the great majority of university institutions in Great Britain but they amount roughly to about £23 per head of the student body.  We are now asked, I understand, to raise the fees by 50 per cent.  That will make the average cost of university education to the student £34 per annum.  It must seem iniquitous to have to raise students' fees at a time when every item which has to be counted in the cost of getting a student educated in the university has gone up.  Lodgings in <Col N="1386" /> the city, when it is possible to get them at all, are not affording the same standard of life as even students were accustomed to have.  At certain times of the year, students are being compulsorily evacuated from their lodgings to make room for tourists.  Everything in the way of equipment which a student has to buy&mdash;scientific equipment, books and other things&mdash;has increased in price, while the cost of clothing to the parent has increased. In these circumstances, I understand that we are asked, as a condition of getting this grant, to raise the student fee from about £23 per head to £34 per head.  I suppose it will have to be done but there will be repercussions, possibly in the way of reduced numbers, which will again seriously disturb whatever equilibrium was ever achieved in connection with the finances of the college.</P>
    <P>Many comparisons can be made with the university situation elsewhere. The booklet in front of me gives a comparison with a group of universities in England and Wales and with the solitary university institution in Belfast.  It is an amazing thing that, since 1926-27, the State grant in every case except that of University College, Dublin, had increased.  Even since 1937-38, there has been an odd increase here and there.  If you take the whole university grants for Great Britain and Northern Ireland, they used to amount to about £2,500,000.  The present Chancellor of the Exchequer in England, being a university man, has some appreciation of university difficulties and some appreciation of university development, and he has promised the universities already that the State grants will be increased from £2,500,000 to £7,000,000.  Since he made that statement about the £7,000,000 a year ago, he has told in the most generous way those who made representations to him that whatever the universities require he will give to them.  He agrees that the system they are inaugurating on the other side for raising the school age in respect of the primary schools, the re-equipment they are doing with regard to their secondary schools, the invitations they are giving to boys to remain longer at secondary schools and the way in <Col N="1387" /> which they are making the path easier for the secondary school pupil to go on to the university will mean better university education&mdash;or, at least, the equipment of universities in a better way and the provision of more staff and, probably, better staff.  Even since he mentioned £7,000,000, he has told university groups that they need not consider £7,000,000 the ceiling, that he will expand the amount so long as a case can be made to him that the moneys are required.  That means that he is increasing by £4,500,000 the old-time grant of £2,500,000.  Again, may I stop to make this comparison. The staff in England are not suffering from one of the matters of which I have spoken in connection with the staff here.  Money has not lost its value in England.  Rates of wages have increased since the 1939 period by about 65 per cent.</P>
    <P>The cost of living has not gone up by more than 25 points.  The actual value of their money has increased.  They are not allowed to spend it as freely as before but, if not, they are certainly not running into debt, as people here are.  They can have a bit of a nest-egg and a definite promise was given in Parliament that these moneys, placed to the credit of small people, will be released to them.  A beginning was made last year in that regard.  Taking into account the increase in cost of living, which would decrease the value of their money, and the increase of wage rates over there, the value of money has improved.  The International Labour Office calculation, to which I referred a moment ago, measured that improvement at about 45 per cent.  Our currency has depreciated to the point that, as I said before, the Lemass £ is worth only 10/-.  We are endeavouring to pile up more of those ten shillings in an endeavour, for instance, to make the money being given to the professors represent the old purchasing power which they got as their reward.  In addition, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in England has pointed out that, in the first five years after the war, £10,000,000 is to be provided for the universities, to enable them to enlarge and equip their buildings.  What they have promised is&mdash;in the first five <Col N="1388" /> years, £10,000,000 and actual grants, in so far as the State contributes to them, to be raised from £2,500,000 to £7,000,000, that sum to be increased further if a case can be made for it.</P>
    <P>In Great Britain and Northern Ireland there is this amazing situation further to be considered.  As far as University College, Dublin, is concerned it has only two sources of revenue.  The State gave it, before this Vote was introduced, £82,000, and it receives about £72,000 from fees.  So far as those other universities in Great Britain and Northern Ireland are concerned, their fees were about 30 per cent. of their annual income.  The State grant was only 36 per cent. of their income so that about two-thirds of the income was contributed by the two sources from which University College, Dublin, draws all its income.</P>
    <P>The other one-third in England was made up from a variety of sources.  In England there are many local authorities which give grants&mdash;not payments for students, but actual grants&mdash;to the universities.  They have donations, very valuable donations, amounting on the average to 15 per cent. of their entire revenue.  The non-State endowment is about 15 per cent., and further donations bring that 15 per cent. up to 17 per cent.  In England, between the local authority endowment, private endowment and bequests, they get one-third of their incomes.  The £2,500,000, which is to be raised to £7,000,000, only counts or only did count as one-third of the moneys which these colleges get.  Their fees give them about one-third and they get another third from the sources which I have described.</P>
    <P>There are many comparisons in this booklet that could be made with the university system here, and they are all put in a most conservative way because they do not pay any great attention in any detail to the depreciation in the value of money.  They do not weigh to any great extent the fact that most of these universities which are brought into comparison have a body of students, I should say on the average, not more than half the number of students attending University College, Dublin.  The <Col N="1389" /> average would not be more than 1,600 in any of these places, while University College has to accommodate 3,200 students.</P>
    <P>When this money is paid the university will find it possible to make certain increases in remuneration in regard to their staff.  These increases will not in relation to the present day value of money put these people in the position, poor and all as it was, in which they were before the war.  As far as the junior staff are concerned their position will be relatively bettered by the fact that they will get a greater percentage of an increase, but on the whole when this money is divided up in the way suggested, and when one takes into consideration the extra work which is borne by the limited number of people who will benefit, although they have gladly, welcomed the increase now given to them, it must be pointed out that it does not meet the requirements.  I understand that some consultations are going on with regard to the allocation of some additional sums.  I do not know how far they have gone, but I do know that the college is lingering on in almost exactly the same position in which it found itself in 1918 after the previous war.  Some additions have been made.</P>
    <P>An anatomy department was built and other buildings were renovated and repaired but, in the main, whatever buildings there are at Earlsfort Terrace are very nearly in the position in which they were in 1918.  The university has been granted the use of the College of Science but whether it is proposed to continue to give them the use of that building I do not know. They have got the use of about 90 per cent. of it at the moment and its original cost was supposed to be a couple of hundred pounds.  It should be remembered that with added buildings go added costs of maintenance which have to be supplied out of the ordinary grants.  Unless there is a completely new view taken of university education the college will not be in a position to give to the students the help the students are entitled to expect.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I would like to refer&mdash;the matter of <Col N="1390" /> pensions.  The pension fund with regard to the staff of University College, Dublin, is, I understand, in quite a bad way.  Not all the staff have rights on the pension fund.  I should imagine that it is confined almost in its entirety to those who achieve the rank of professor as a full-time office.  I am not sure if even the investments that have been made out of the moneys granted for this purpose would meet the calls that might fall upon it. Again, I am given to understand that some statement has been made or some hope has been held out that the pension matter will be looked into in the near future, but now that the preliminary matter of an immediate grant is being dealt with, I should like to put this to the House and to the country in connection with the professorial staff of University College, Dublin. The persons who attain to that rank do so generally in their middle years, if not in their late middle years.  There is an age at which they are compulsorily retired.  If you take the average age at which a person enters the college staff and take the age at which retirement is made compulsory it will be seen that a man cannot have many years' service.  As the pension is related to the number of years that a man serves, the amount that can be earned by the ordinary holder of an office there is very small.</P>
    <P>Take the position of a professor in the old time.  He had £800 a year and he achieved that rank about the age of 45.  Most of them would achieve it about that time after being what is called a statutory lecturer or an assistant for many years before.  Whatever service is given as a lecturer or as assistant does not count towards pension; no pension is allowed because of earlier years' service as lecturer.  A man who goes out at the ordinary retiring age and who had £800 a year would get ordinarily on retirement £200 a year, if he took the gratuity of one years's salary on retirement.  If he opted for the other system which is known to be the superannuation fund and took no retiring gratuity, he would get a sum of about £250 or about £5 a week, with a present purchasing power of 50/-.  Fifty shillings a week are what a university professor has to <Col N="1391" /> look forward to at the end of his days. This Estimate, of course, makes no provision by way of bettering that situation though I understand some provision is to be made in that respect. I would like to get some indication of what is in the Minister's mind in regard to what any member of the staff could look forward to on retirement and how this £250 or £5 a week is likely to be brought by any special arrangement up to the purchasing power of that original £5 a week they used to have.  I again point out that the number of people who qualified on these ranks on the full-time scale is very small indeed.  I believe that the entire staff of University College, Dublin, is under 100 and of those some 25 would be on the part-time scale and would not be on the pensionable grade at all.  That leaves something in the neighbourhood of 75, which can be divided again, as two-thirds of them are professors on senior staff and one-third is junior staff.  That is the body which has to be attended to and the particular body on whom, as far as University College, Dublin, is concerned, the highest type of education in this country depends.</P>
    <P>A comparison was made with certain salaries paid to people in other walks of life for the purpose of seeing what would be an adequate and reasonable sum to pay to men of the type who become university professors.  A comparison was made with the Civil Service, which I think was not an unreasonable comparison.  Civil servants are also people who are supposed to be opting for stability in life instead of for the hazards of the commercial world. Civil servants, of course, have been tricked by the bonus arrangement which was promised to them and which has now been taken from them.  They were told they should stick fast to it, that it was going to be their sheet-anchor in times of rising prices.  Unfortunately, they stuck to it when prices were going down and they suffered, and it was taken from them by Act of the State when it was supposed to be of any benefit to them. The consideration of that bonus matter somewhat complicates the comparisons made in this document.  When the comparison was made, it was thought not <Col N="1392" /> to be unreasonable to take the retired type of person who might be supposed to be looking for professorial work in comparison with a member of the Civil Service who retired from the buffetings and hazards of commercial life.  We discovered, when the comparison was made, that if you went down through the salaries attached to secretaries and assistant secretaries of Departments and came to the grouping known as principal officers, you found that the principal officer rank had attached to it a salary of about £700 rising to £800. The bonus, at the rate in force when this matter was being considered, which was the stabilised rate, showed that he would get £954, rising to £1,100.  Only ten people in the whole of University College, Dublin, were getting as much as the initial salary of a principal officer&mdash;only ten out of the whole staff were put on the grading of the initial payment of the principal officer grading.  The principal officer had at least the promise of a bonus and he had prospects of promotion, of rising possibly to some of the higher ranks, of assistant secretary or secretary. The professor who goes on the salary that we have apportioned to University College, Dublin, starts there and stays there, he gets the maximum at once and gets no improvement in his conditions.</P>
    <P>I have only made extracts from this document&mdash;which is a most valuable contribution to the seamy side of university life&mdash;and any other matters that might be discussed here possibly would be better discussed on the main Vote for Universities later in the year. But the extracts I have given, when shown to anybody interested in university life or anyone who appreciates the work that is being done in the university or anyone who has any conception of the value of the university as an institution in the life of the State, are surely enough to make them realise that the way is not very inviting or alluring for anyone who wants to take up this type of work.  One does not need to give very much thought to this matter to understand how many of our good people could be usefully employed at a very small increase of expenditure by the State, but who have to seek their livelihood elsewhere and have to <Col N="1393" /> give the benefit of their training and gifts to students in other countries.</P>
    <P>The student body, of course, is not mentioned in this document.  As far as they are concerned, they will still have to put up with the grimy conditions of life to which they have become accustomed.  I have often thought it would be wise to go to some of those societies like the Old Dublin Society or the various philanthropic societies who go around investigating the conditions in Dublin and ask them to call in and investigate the conditions in the university, to look at what one of the professors once called the interior slum conditions in some parts of that building. Some of the buildings which the university took over in 1900 when it was first founded are still there, because it is too expensive to take parts of them down, although they are rotting to decay and there are some parts which are at times very dangerous to those who use the building.</P>
    <P>University College, Dublin, as set before us, has a grand facade facing Earlsfort Terrace, but the interior is not so pleasant.  Students who go there may have very pleasant memories afterwards of the people they met and their student associations and the type of life allowed to them and the freedom that goes with university education, but they certainly will not be able to tell anyone that any great provision was made to make their lives more pleasant or more coloursome than they themselves made it.  The main place for students to congregate is the central hall.  There is no special room for them.</P>
    <P>There is some provision made for them in a basement&mdash;I believe there is some place where they can hang up their overcoats and there is a system of lockers.  It is a cheerless sort of place and none of them go there, so the main place for meeting is the central hall.  In the change over between lectures, in the forenoon when lectures are finishing, the hall is as crowded as a small town on a fair day. The students stand about most of the time, as there is no place where they can sit down.  They are not served with any amenities in the way of rooms, with furniture, chairs, tables, books and periodicals.  Their life is <Col N="1394" /> entirely empty of that, though surely they would not object to it.  On the whole, they are not given to looking for much in the way of luxuries, as they have been educated by very many years of experience, in hearing from students who have gone before them that they are not to be looked for in the college.  I am making no reflection on the staff in speaking in this way, as I think as much has been done for the student body as could be done, but the other element that is supposed to make up university life is entirely lacking in the college.</P>
    <P>I referred a moment ago to the universities in Birmingham and Manchester. Birmingham, with a capital expenditure of £1,300,000, has spent about £150,000 on a students' union and halls of residence.  Two or three of the ecclesiastical colleges have set up establishments for young students, and there are two or three places where they may congregate and enjoy the opportunities of life in a very limited way, a life that is supposed to be most appropriate and most valuable in the university.  The majority of our students are scattered through the city in lodgings&mdash;and very indifferent lodgings, in the present circumstances. There are occasions for meeting other students at class times, during lectures or in the five or ten minutes between lectures.</P>
    <P>There is no general social life for these people outside the occasion of a meeting of a university organisation. There are no real occasions on which they can meet as an ordinary matter of course, and there are lamentably few occasions upon which the members of the staff get an opportunity of meeting the students or on which the students get the opportunity of meeting them.  A professor or a lecturer goes to his class and attends there for a particular period.  The only time the majority of the students see any member of the staff is when he is carrying out his official duties, lecturing or demonstrating. The social contacts and the ordinary human contacts that the students might like to have with the staff and which, possibly, would be beneficial to them, are entirely precluded by the particular set-up in the equipment <Col N="1395" /> of the university.  Anybody who has visited some of the older English universities, as I have, could not but be struck by the association there is between the people who live in the different colleges in which so many of the staff and of the students are housed.  Both have their rooms in the same college buildings.  The staff and the students have their meals together. They meet in the ordinary recreation rooms, in the lounges and in the smoke rooms.  As a matter of course, a member of the staff will turn in and allow the students to enjoy his company while he enjoys their more youthful and more vigorous viewpoints.  Anybody who has had that experience could not fail to get a tremendous appreciation of what all that means in university life, what a valuable part it plays in it.  There is that association there between students and staff.  We have not got that here, and cannot get it, and it is not possible to provide it under the new grant.</P>
    <P>There is a sort of antagonism&mdash; perhaps I should not use the word &ldquo;antagonism&rdquo;&mdash;but there is supposed to be an indifference as between the staff and the students here.  I think the students think that is the situation. I do not know that there is any member of the staff who would not welcome an opportunity of meeting, not only his own students, but the students in any of the other faculties.  The occasions for meetings between the staff and the students are limited.  When they do occur they are of a rather ceremonious type, so that free and easy intercourse is not always possible.</P>
    <P>These are all matters which, I suppose, lie for amendment in the future.  Outside the non-recurrent grant of £70,000 in 1943, this represents the first approach to the university system since the increase in the endowment was given in 1926.  That is to say, 20 years after.  The way in which the new grant is being given will not bring the moneys which the professors used to enjoy back to their old purchasing power, but, at any rate, this increase is gladly welcomed.  Most of the staff have asked that I should definitely state their appreciation of what <Col N="1396" /> the Government are doing at this time, even though we may complain of delay and, with some justice, say that it is not what was expected and is certainly not what is required to put the university on a proper footing.  Yet, when all that is said, it is an approach in the right direction.  One thing it does is this, it shows that the authorities have wakened up to the scandalous and sordid conditions in which the universities have been left.  We hope that it will lead to a bettering of the situation, and that when the authorities have now entered along this path, they will go further and pay some attention to what I referred to as the students' needs.</P>
    <P>I hope that something will be done to try to arrange, now that a grant is being given to the college, that some provision will be made over and above that to meet the human needs of the staff, and so enable the university to become a real meeting place where the students and staff can come together, enjoy each other's company and have benefit of what is everywhere regarded as a most valuable part of university life&mdash;the clash of mind on mind.  As far as the big majority of the 3,200 students are concerned, you have among them people with varying points of view.  Many think there is value in their points of view, and that every opportunity should be given for the exchange of views between students and staff.  I am not using the language of exaggeration when I say that there is none of that to-day.  As long as that is so, a most valuable side of university education is being lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan has referred to the fact that it has been suggested that, while the university moneys are being increased by grants from the State, that the fees for students should be raised.  I would like to know what the Government's attitude is in regard to that.  To some extent it might not be unreasonable, when the State is reviewing the position of the universities, that it should suggest that an increase in certain fees should take place.  If, however, the fees to-day were to be increased by 50 per cent. it would be a very serious blow to a large number of young people <Col N="1397" /> attending the university and to their parents.</P>
      <P>Some of those students may have done one year out of three years or two years out of four years or two years out of five years.  I think it is fairly well known that most parents who have set out to give a university education to any of their children have mortgaged their own financial position in order to do so.  They have had to think very carefully as to whether it was possible for them to undertake that burden.  If university fees were now to be increased it would be a terrible blow to parents who had one or two or three children at the university.  I think that, whatever is done with regard to raising fees, it certainly ought not to apply to those who are already at the university. They should not be saddled with a substantial increase which was not contemplated when they entered it.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan discussed generally the financial position in which the professors in the university find themselves. I think most people understand that no professor in any of the colleges here can ever hope to reach, say, the salary of a secretary to a Department of State.  We must realise that if we are going to raise the standard of our general public thought we must look to the universities&mdash;to the fructifying power of different minds in the universities operating on one another. It is that more than anything else that can help to raise the general standard of thought and of general education in the country.  That cannot be done except men who devote themselves to a life of learning can do so with the feeling, at any rate, that they will be able to maintain a comfortable home and educate any family they may have.  The student's side of the matter also requires a considerable amount of consideration.  In the early days, when scholarships were first made available&mdash;I think they were called bishop's scholarships in the old Royal University&mdash;they were worth £50 a year.  At that time, boys and girls who were able to secure a bishop's scholarship were able to add to that scholarship by prizes and scholarships inside the university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1398" /> When we compare what £50 meant 30 years ago with the £80 now which the Dublin Corporation gives for scholarships, we realise that there is a very vast difference.</P>
    <P>Whereas the scholarships given in these early days were fully capable of maintaining a young fellow at that time, the scholarships given now are not.  That is particularly the case within the last few years during which the cost of lodgings in the City of Dublin has gone up to an enormous figure. Very few people realise the hardships that students from the country have to undergo in the city at present, not alone owing to the lodging conditions, but also to the disturbance of their mind by the fact that the cost of their lodgings is placing an enormous burden on their parents.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether anything is being done or considered to help in any way to improve the scholarship position.  Our universities will lack something very great if they do not open their doors to real talent from among our poorer classes.  The position of the poor man's son to-day in relation to university education is, I think, an absolutely impossible one; at any rate, it was never worse.  I do not think conditions were ever more unfavourable for the children of the less well-off section of our community to get into the universities.  That is a matter that should be fully gone into and adequate opportunities should be given to the talented ones among the less well-off section of our people to get a university education.  They ought to get a university education in circumstances in which they would not have the affiction of mind that comes from being regarded as a kind of poor scholar.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan has adequately shown what association with various classes of students, each pursuing a different line of study in the university, means in the development both of outlook, on the one hand, and the fostering of education and extending of thought on the other; how important it is, not only to take part in the ordinary studies of the university, but to take part in the more voluntary university <Col N="1399" /> pursuits in societies of one kind or another.  It has in fact been found by students in certain sections of the university that they are so scattered away from the main body of the university that they lack a certain element which is necessary if they are to have a university education.</P>
    <P>I think it will be found that engineering students, whose days are spent more in the College of Science than anywhere else, find themselves practically detached from anything like university life.  I have known young men from the country coming up here for an engineering course who, feeling the lack of touch with ordinary university life and movements, have in their third year deliberately left aside part of their study in engineering subjects in order to take part in general college society life so that they might, by making contacts with other students, say, of medicine or arts, touch university life generally.  I have known them to jeopardise their success in engineering examinations in order to extend their minds and to get some of that wider personal and human touch without which real university education is not possible.  Therefore, except our talented students are given a certain amount of freedom from care they will be stultified in their work in the university and cramped in the devotion of their energies to university work generally.</P>
    <P>It has been indicated that substantial building plans are to be faced up to.  If that is so, it would be well if more complete thought would be given to the scheme of studies we want to have in our universities, the standard we want to set up for our professors, and the opportunity the country would like to offer to real talent in the universities. It would be a foolish thing to start off on a rather elaborate building programme without seeing that our educational aims and ideals for a university were clearly and firmly stated. Otherwise, I feel that, with the difficulties we may have, economically and otherwise, we will be tempted to halt in the work of providing adequate hostel and study halls for the university students.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1400" /> It is a matter of satisfaction that the Government are facing up to the position in which the professors find themselves. Not since 1926, I think, have any of the professors had their emoluments increased in any way.  It is time that something should be done about it and it is good to see a start being made.  But, in making a start now, I suggest that these other matters require particular consideration.  Particularly, I should like to ask the Minister what he has in mind with regard to requiring universities to increase their fees and whether he will give special consideration to the case of people who have already embarked on commitments for the university education of their children and who are only struggling at present to give that education to them.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan made an interesting speech upon the National University College in Dublin, and outlined some of its needs.  I just want to say this, in regard to his opening remarks in which he referred to two other debates which we had in this House yesterday and to-day, that if anybody thinks I was unfair to him and unfair to the <i>Irish Times</i> all they have to do is to buy or get a copy of it and compare its report with that of other papers or with the Dáil report.</P>
      <P>With regard to this question of the universities.  I have gone into the matter of increasing their grants.  Undoubtedly the staff, like all other people in the country on fixed salaries or wages, have had to suffer a diminution in their real income during the war.  With regard to this proposal in the Supplementary Estimate, these additional grants this year were meant to enable the authorities of these three colleges to make increases for this year in the salaries of the professors, lecturers, assistants and so on back to the 1st November, the date from which increases in the Civil Service date. Next year in the main Estimates we shall provide for very substantial increased grants to all the universities in the country.</P>

The Book of Estimates will be circulated within a week or two and Deputies will see that we are making very substantial increases in the grant to all the universities in the country.  Deputy McGilligan has pointed out that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he is going to increase the £2,500,000 State grant to the universities to £7,000,000.</P>
      <P>I have calculated that when the next year's increases, which are already decided upon, come into effect, our people will be paying as many shillings per head of the population for university and higher education as the British people will pay when the British Chancellor gives that £7,000,000.  Up to recently they were only giving £2,500,000, so that here our people have been paying, per head of the population, more out of the State purse for university and higher education than the people in England.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy wants to know what I think of an increase in students' fees. I think that the State grants, even on a population basis, are higher here than they are in England, and if they are not sufficient to run the universities, the universities should charge their pupils the cost of their education. We cannot afford to make every boy in the country a university graduate and I think it is only fair that those who get the advantage in life of a university education should contribute a fair share of the costs of their education, of getting their degree.  Other demands are made by Deputies from time to time upon the Government.  These demands are not met out of the Minister's private pockets.  They have to be met out of the pockets of the ordinary people in the country and it is upon these ordinary people that taxation bears in the long run.  It finally settles on their shoulders and we have to collect the taxes from their pockets.  I think, therefore, that if the State is bearing or is going to bear this university and higher education, as much per head of the population as they are in England, the university authorities should look to the parents of the students for a reasonable share of the costs of university education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1402" /> Deputy McGilligan spoke to-day about the small salaries that university professors have been getting.  Judging from what I could see of the proposal for increases in university professors' emoluments in the coming year, and from what I saw of lists of emoluments of professors in other countries, I think that they will be getting as much actual cash per month or per year in the way of salary cheques. Deputy McGilligan will allege that, even if they are getting the same salaries here as they are in England, it does not mean as high a standard of life.  I contest that absolutely.  The first thing that comes out of a professor's monthly cheque or annual cheque is income-tax and the man in England is paying twice as much as the professor here, so that a nominal £1,200 given to a professor in England, when he pays his income-tax, is a few hundred pounds short, and very many more pounds shorter than his opposite number here who is getting a salary of £1,200.  That is my first point.</P>

      <P>I will deal with everything if Deputies will give me an opportunity. Deputy McGilligan compares the small portion of a higher salaried official's income that is spent on the essentials of life and he suggests the difference between that small portion here and in England is applicable to the total salary.  That is not true.  As a man goes up in salary, a smaller and smaller proportion of it is spent on the absolute essentials, such as food and clothing, upon which the cost-of-living index figure is based.  In England the cost-of-living figure is applied to a workman's basket.  At the moment they can fill only one corner of that basket with real goods.  If a person in England wanted to live at the same standard of life as he could live at here on the same amount of money, the same number of pounds, or if he wanted to buy in England what he could buy with a certain number of pounds here, he would have to pay a very big number of pounds extra.  He can get in England 1 lb. of meat for 1/2.  If he wants 2 lbs. of meat he has to pay an extra number of shillings for the second lb. that he would get in the black market.</P>

I hope to be able to spend a greater percentage of our national income increasing capital buildings for the universities in the next five years than the British Chancellor of the Exchequer proposes.  We have proposals from our various universities for large sums for capital development, for building some of the essential buildings and the amenity buildings Deputy McGilligan alluded to.  I hope that the supply situation will be such that we can make a <Col N="1406" /> reasonable start on that vast work inside the next couple of years.  Not only is there building work to be done in Deputy McGilligan's college, but the other colleges are in the same boat. They all have more students than they were originally built to accommodate. The classrooms are overcrowded and accommodation of every kind and description in the colleges is limited.  We are hoping to get ahead with that work as quickly as the supply position will enable us to do it.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £559,620 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1947, for the Army and the Army Reserve (including certain Grants-in-Aid) under the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts, and for certain administrative Expenses in connection therewith; for Expenses in connection with the trial and detention of certain persons (No. 28 of 1939, No. 1 of 1940 and No. 16 of 1940, etc.); for certain Expenses under the Offences Against the State Acts, 1939 and 1940 (No. 13 of 1939 and No. 2 of 1940) and the Air-raid Precautions Act, 1939 (No. 21 of 1939); for Reserve Medical Supplies for Civilian Hospitals; for certain Expenses of the Local Defence Force, 1941 to 1946; for Expenses in connection with the issue of Medals, etc.; for Expenses in connection with the Production of certain Chemicals for Sale; for certain Expenses in connection with Blood Transfusion; and for the Expenses of the Bureau of Military History.</P>
      <P>The explanation for this Supplementary Vote of £559,620 is briefly as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under sub-head A, we require an additional sum of £335,500, partly to meet the increase in Army pay which became operative on September 1st, 1946, partly to meet a sum of £33,500 in respect of arrears of deferred pay, and partly to meet increased expenditure due to the fact that many men, especially those on the higher rates of pay, asked to have their demobilisation deferred until they had made suitable arrangements for their resettlement in civilian life.  The increased <Col N="1408" /> rates of Army pay for all ranks have already been promulgated and are about 25 per cent. over the previous rates.  In the case of deferred pay, for which £33,500 is required, this is a relic of the increase in pay granted to the Army during the emergency.  That increase was six-pence a day for all non-commissioned ranks as from 29th September, 1942, but was not payable until the date of discharge or the end of the emergency. When framing the annual Estimate for 1946-47 in December, 1945, it was thought that this problem would be almost solved by 31st March, 1946, and accordingly in that Estimate we provided a sum of only £1,000.  Actually, however, claims totalling about £34,500 have had to be dealt with during the financial year.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head A (4), which deals with emergency gratuities and re-enlistment bounties, we have the main cause of the Supplementary Estimate. In the original Estimate of £770,000, it was considered that a sum of £755,000 would complete, for all practical purposes, the payment of emergency gratuities, in addition to the balance of £15,000 for re-enlistment bounties.  Further, owing to the deferment of demobilisation during the first three months of 1946, we surrendered under this heading on 31st March, 1946, the sum of £91,267, so that in effect that unexpected amount had to be met out of the £755,000 provided in the current annual Estimate. Owing to the same factor of deferment of demobilisation, the rate of gratuity payable was higher than anticipated, so that we now find that an additional sum of £426,000 is required.  I might mention that against the £755,000 for emergency gratuities for which the Estimate provides, we have expended up to the end of January, 1947, £1,163,927, so that for the last two months of the year only £17,073 is being sought.</P>
    <P>The increase of £77,000 on the sum required for the payment of marriage allowance under sub-head B is due partly again to the deferment of demobilisation and partly to the increased rates of marriage allowance which became operative on 1st September, <Col N="1409" /> 1946.  In this connection, it will be appreciated that many married men elected to remain in the Army until they were in a position to provide for their families in civilian life.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C provides for the payment of civilians attached to units and here a sum of £83,500 is required.  In this case, the increase is due to tradesmen and technicians leaving the Army more quickly than we had anticipated.  With the resumption of industrial activities after the emergency, these men obtained civilian employment and, accordingly, left the Army as soon as such employment offered.  Meanwhile, barracks had to be maintained, and works in progress completed, so that there was no alternative but to use civilian in place of military labour.</P>
    <P>The main cause of the excess under sub-head E, pay of officers of medical service, was the payment of arrears to certain officers of that service following an agreement reached with the medical association.  A dispute existed for several years regarding the interpretation of the regulation dealing with the pay of such officers, and the agreement arrived at involved a payment of arrears totalling £20,471.  The balance of £3,779 now required is due to the new rates of pay consequent on the agreement.</P>
    <P>Of the £42,500 required under sub-head E for provisions and allowances in lieu, £20,000 is what may be described as a book-keeping or accounting entry, because it represents a purchase of supplies issued on repayment, and a contra compensating entry for the same amount appears under sub-head Z as an Appropriation-in-Aid of the Vote.  The remaining £22,500 is due to the increased cost in the price of rations and in the amount of ration allowance payable.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head M, clothing and equipment, two factors operated to form the increase of £34,500.  The first was that men on demobilisation or discharge took a cash allowance in lieu of clothes and, hence, an additional sum of about £20,000 is required for such allowances.  The second factor is that we are providing, tentatively, a sum of £14,500 for the purchase of new walking-out uniforms for other ranks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1410" /> As things stand at the moment, it is not certain whether it will be possible to obtain delivery of the uniforms during the present financial year.  The sum of £14,500 does not, of course, represent the total cost of such uniforms when all the men are fitted out with them.</P>
    <P>The £14,900 required under sub-head F is really a revote.  In 1941-42 we ordered a quantity of ammunition which was not delivered.  When framing the original Estimate for 1946-47, we did not expect that delivery would be made during that year, and, accordingly, provided only a token sum of £10.  During the year, however, delivery was effected.  I might mention that this indent was one of the few not cancelled at the termination of the emergency.</P>
    <P>The sum of £300 set out under sub-head P (3) represents outstanding claims in respect of services rendered in connection with blood transfusion. Thus we owe the Office of Public Works £277 for rent, adaptation and repairs to the premises used for the purpose, and the balance for various other items.</P>
    <P>Sub-head R deals with expenditure on fuel, light and water in kind.  This sub-head has always been calculated on a capitation basis and, for many years, the cost was fivepence a head for all ranks of the Army.  Owing to the fact that during the emergency the soldiers cut their own turf, the amount per head was reduced from 5d. to 3d. and this was followed in the original Estimate. Army-won turf is now exhausted, however, and, consequently, any turf required will cost more.</P>
    <P>The £9,400 needed under sub-head U is a relic of the emergency and represents an amount additional to that provided for and actually paid to owners of private property damaged or commandeered during military occupation.</P>
    <P>The excess under sub-head X (Incidental Expenses) is mainly due to advertisements in connection with the drive for additional recruits for the Army.</P>
    <P>The token sum of £5 asked for under sub-head Y represents a new service, the establishment, under the Department, <Col N="1411" /> of a Bureau of Military History, 1913-1921.  The Government has decided to establish such a bureau for the purpose of collecting material relating to military activities in securing national independence during the period 1913-1921.  This will include: (1) the examination of existing records (including material furnished in connection with applications for military service pensions, if and so far as such material could properly be made available); (2) collection of additional material; (3) the arrangement of material so as to make it readily available for use in due course in the preparation of a history or histories of the period.</P>
    <P>The bureau, which will be assisted by an advisory committee, will consist of a director, three full-time members, and one part-time member, in addition to a small clerical staff.</P>
    <P>Of the £16,300 required for An FÓrsa Cosanta Áitiúil under sub-head Y (3) £15,000 is really a revote.  In a Supplementary Estimate for the year 1945-46, the House approved of a sum of £15,000 for the Force, but, owing to the fact that the reorganisation was not fully completed before the end of March, 1946, the payment was withheld and has now to be met during the current year.</P>
    <P>The expenditure on the 14 sub-heads mentioned thus amounts to the gross sum of £1,103,830, but this is offset by credits or savings in two other directions.  The first is a surplus of £48,640 in respect of appropriations in aid of the Vote.  These receipts arise from a variety of sources, but, in the main, they represent the sale of boots to members of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and a refund in respect of military stores overcharged in a previous year.</P>
    <P>The second offset is from savings on other sub-heads of the Vote, and represent a large and varied number of items.  Speaking generally, however, they may be summarised under five headings, as follows:&mdash;(1) the deferring of the purchases of stores, £261,020; (2) the reduction in certain services, £65,850; (3) saving on the Construction Corps, £40,900; (4) savings on annual training of reserve, £64,800; (5) unemployment insurance, <Col N="1412" /> £63,000.  Total: £495,570.  Hence the net amount required is £559,620.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Inasmuch as the sum required in this Vote is to be devoted largely to the payment of increased salaries and allowances, I am not opposed to it.  I have always urged that the first essential in connection with the Army, irrespective of its size, was that it should be adequately paid.  In that way, we should have a contented, happy and satisfied body of officers, N.C.O.'s and men.  I am glad that the increases which are payable from September last have at last been decided upon.  At another time, disagreement may be expressed with the total amount required for the purposes of the Defence Forces but, as the sum now asked is required largely in respect of increases of pay and betterment of conditions, I think it can be supported.  During the closing stages of the emergency, officers and men were informed that it was desirable, in their own interest, to make provision, wherever possible, to secure employment outside.  Of course, some of them had employment available to them at the end of the emergency and had not to worry about securing alternative employment.  That referred to a considerable number of men who had been employed in Government Departments and banks and to a large number who had been in the service of private employers.  In so far as those affected did at that time take that advice, they rendered not merely a service to themselves but, inasmuch as the majority of them would not re-enlist for permanent service at the end of the emergency, they rendered a service to the State.  That being so, I feel that these men have been treated unfairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officers and men who retired prior to the 2nd September received smaller pensions than those who remained on and retired after that date.  I think that the Minister was unfair in not making it quite clear that a specific date would be fixed on which increased pay would come into operation and that a definite date would be laid down for those taking their retirement and, consequently, their demobilisation gratuities.  Quite a large number of <Col N="1413" /> officers and men acted in a patriotic manner in retiring as soon as employment was open to them.  Those affected feel seriously aggrieved that they had not prior notice and were not able to partake of the higher pension rates or of the higher rates of pay for whatever additional period they might have served.  I feel that the Minister should explain to those men why no definite date was laid down.  In May, 1945, a White Paper was issued which dealt with many matters, including gratuities, and which laid down specific details concerning men who wished to retire. It also mentioned that those who, owing to circumstances, could not retire at that time would be obliged to remain for a further period.  In the middle of last year, a change was made in the terms and conditions under which these men were serving and I feel that the men who retired earlier were unfairly treated.  The Minister should make some explanation and apology to them.  The best form of apology would not be verbal.  It would take the form of increased gratuities to those who retired in response to Government appeals.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I desire to refer.  The complaint I have to make is of long standing.  Its causes are operating far more severely at present than they did in the past.</P>
    <P>That is the fact that the last meal of the day in Army circles is at 4.30 p.m. or in certain cases at 5 o'clock. As the Minister is aware, the bread rationing in operation at the present time and the consequent reduction in the rations available for soldiers as for everyone else, mean that the last meal is smaller than it was heretofore.  It also means that because there is a reduction in the amount of bread available for the evening meal, soldiers are obliged to secure another meal in the evening after they leave barracks.  At the present time, catering establishments at the Curragh and other centres are already overtaxed and I would suggest to the Minister that some substitute should be provided for the evening meal and that a later evening meal should be added.</P>
    <P>The particular complaint I have received is that a number of these recruits who have gone into the Curragh <Col N="1414" /> depot have to undergo long and fairly arduous physical exercise and that, consequently, they have keener appetites and greater capacities.  Yet, these men find themselves, so far as Army rations are concerned, finishing their last meal at 4.30 p.m., or 5 o'clock.  Many of them are young people and this cold weather has sharpened their appetites.  The result is that they are obliged to provide themselves out of their pay with a meal later in the evening.  I would suggest that as rations are part of the pay and allowances to which soldiers are entitled, although in present circumstances it is difficult to increase the bread ration, some substitution should be made by providing a meal of potatoes or some other foodstuffs.  Recruits, who had no previous experience of Army life and who were not accustomed to finishing their meals at 4.30 or 5 o'clock in the evening, should be provided with a meal at a later hour. While these recruits may have been made aware of the conditions under which they would have to serve, they did not realise the hardships they would have to undergo by the fact that they would receive no meal after 4.30.  Of course, most of them have to provide themselves with meals outside at later hours but I would suggest to the Minister that if recruits are entitled to expect that rations should be included in their pay and allowances, then the rations should be adequate.  Though it may mean a departure from precedent and practice as obtaining in the Army, there should be some arrangement other than having the last meal at 4.30 or 5 o'clock.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister has at last come to an agreement with the medical officers and that the dispute which hindered harmonious relations and which operated to the detriment not merely of the officers concerned but of the Army in general has been satisfactorily solved and that it has now been decided to pay certain moneys which were formerly withheld.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few remarks on the situation suggested by this Estimate. The total figure for the Army for the current year is raised to £5,135,930.  The Minister indicates <Col N="1415" /> that the increased provision now asked for arises largely out of the fact that the pay of officers and men has been increased and that certain gratuities that should have been paid last year are being paid now instead.  What we cannot afford to lose sight of is that, although the cost of the Army has been raised now to above £5,000,000, that is the cost of even a smaller Army than the Minister told the House he was providing for when introducing the Estimate last year.  He indicated last year that he was estimating for a force which consisted of 1,504 officers, 9,270 other ranks, 146 cadets, a Construction Corps of 1,775, 21 chaplains, and 153 nurses&mdash;a total of 12,869.  What I want to call attention to is that whereas the Minister estimated for 1,504 officers, the fact was that on the 31st December last the number of officers in the Army was 1,115, that is 389 less than the Minister estimated for, and that instead of having 9,270 other ranks he had 7,574, that is, that he had 1,696 less men than the Estimate provided for.  The demand for five million odd pounds therefore is for a substantially smaller Army than the Minister estimated for.  That brings us to a consideration of the Minister when he brings his new Estimate before us in a very short time now.</P>
      <P>During the discussions that have taken place on the Army in the last few weeks the Minister has insisted that we have tried to mix up Army policy and external policy. I want to say that in facing the bill which this Supplementary Estimate suggests we shall have to face for the Army next year, we shall have to be realists in discussing the fact that men are going to be asked to spend their time in the Army and that they have to be organised, trained and equipped for a certain purpose.  We must be prepared to face in a realistic way every question that arises to people of commonsense and responsibility. I suggest to the Minister that we cannot dissociate the idea of our keeping an extensive Army here, absorbing the time and the energy of the men in that Army, from our relations with the outside world.</P>

If we are going to have a number of men and officers, even to the extent of the Army in existence on the 31st December last, occupied in military organisation and military training, we want to know in what way they are going to be organised and what they are going to be trained for. I hope that when we reach these discussions we shall have more of the ordinary members of the Minister's Party speaking about these matters.  I welcome the fact that Deputy Major de Valera intervened to a considerable extent in the discussion of these matters during the last few weeks, much as I disagree with some of his ideas, but this is the place to hear ideas of various kinds and reconcile them and challenge them one against another.  He told us that it would be premature to think of discussing here the equipment of our Army.</P>

      <P>It is not sufficient to tell us at this hour of the day that we are spending £31,000 on ammunition ordered some years ago.  On the general question, it is ridiculous to be voting even this additional amount of money for an Army, the equipment of which we are told, and told sensibly enough, it is premature to discuss.  I hope that we will be discussing it when the main Estimate comes before us.</P>
      <P>Under Section Y, the Minister told us he was setting up a bureau to write history.  For many years I have been pressing him to set up a bureau of a different kind, one that would be the soldiers' friend, to whom ex-members of the national forces could go with their difficulties, so that they would have expert assistance to help them to get their rights in regard to the regulations and laws that existed for them and, outside their rights, to assist them in a human way to link themselves back into ordinary civilian life.  It could help them with regard to employment for themselves or their children and with regard to housing.  It is tragic and disgraceful to-day to meet ex-members of the National Army, men of 47 or 50 years of age, with families just growing up, who have completed 24 or 25 years' service, some of them occupying Army residences on Army premises and unable to leave them, as they cannot get housing accommodation anywhere else. They find themselves, with all their moneys due to them from the Army held up, with an Army bailiff, as it were, standing at their door, to push them out into the street or, if they cannot leave, to get them to sign documents saying that they are refusing to obey the Army authorities' request to get out.  There is quite a number of families in that condition here in this city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are hundreds of men who gave 25 years of their lives in a National Army and now, having finished their <Col N="1418" /> services, are unable to find work.  Perhaps they could get work if there were some kind of machinery on the edge of the Army to which they could go and which would see that men of their character, ability and training would be shepherded into work which must be available for them.  We cannot have any kind of national self-respect if we take up the attitude that, when men spend their lives in an army, under the regulations and conditions prescribed by an Irish Government, they are going to go out on a paltry pension, some of them on pension rates fixed before the value of money was deflated so enormously during this war.  They find themselves now with a family not yet reared up, a responsibility on their hands, in very difficult economic and social circumstances here, unable to get work or housing of any kind.</P>
    <P>I think it is typical of the kind of futile self-adulatory spirit in which we approach some of our past history that the Government are able to set up a bureau and get a committee round it to write up our history, while the men who helped to make that history are coming out of the Irish Army, broken down in spirit and without hope, with distracted wives and children dependent on them and no chance of getting a home at all.  I plead again with the Minister, if he has any pride or wants to take any pride in what a bureau may do to write the history of our Army, to do something to-day that will prevent our putting a postscript to that history to say that the men who, after the formation of this State, gave their full lives to the Army, found that they came out into a State which could not provide them with work or even with a helping hand to get over their difficulties.</P>
    <P>I know it is difficult for the Minister for Defence to find himself with families living in the barracks, in the case of men who have now left the Army. However, they are families of a particular type, whose men have given valiant work to the Army of to-day and the Army of yesterday.  At any rate, there ought to be some kind of machinery, or some representative of the Defence Forces or of the Government, to deal with them in some kind of <Col N="1419" /> human way and let them feel they were not outcasts on the side of our streets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate, but there are some matters which the last speaker raised upon which I would like to comment briefly.  On the question of purchasing, there is a sum allotted for warlike stores, which the Minister says is ammunition.  The last speaker referred to statements that have been made that it was premature to commit ourselves to an equipment programme at this stage.  These two things are not conflicting.  We went into this matter in another debate recently. An equipment programme for the Army of the future, in conjunction with an organisation programme, is at this stage premature, for the reasons that have been given.  I think I gave some reasons myself in the debate on the last Temporary Defence Forces Bill.  That fact is so and that fact remains.</P>
      <P>In the future, it will be the Minister's inevitably difficult task to decide at what stage it is right to embark on an organised equipment and organisation programme and to proceed with it.</P>
      <P>I think we are agreed that it is premature to embark on that particular stage for the moment.  Now, that is so, but, as against that, one has to consider that in this interim period while the Army staffs are, so to speak, assembling and reorganising themselves at the end of the emergency and in the post-war period, the Army has to carry on.  It has to be maintained as a working organisation and with such, equipment as it has got.  The change-over to new equipment, if that should be decided upon, will have to be dove-tailed with the old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies, I am sure, are aware, and the last speaker should be aware, that in regard to certain equipment we have been equipped with weapons that are in danger of becoming obsolete from the manufacturing point of view.  In that case there is a very specific problem for a country like this which does not manufacture its ammunition.  I think that the purchase of this ammunition is to be justified on the grounds that it is necessary to keep the equipment <Col N="1420" /> which we have effective and useful until such time as a comprehensive equipment programme for the future is drawn up and put into effect.  That ammunition is necessary for training and for other such purposes.  In regard to our artillery weapons, for instance, a lot of that ammunition is not, I understand, being manufactured any more.  Therefore, it is highly desirable that our Army should have this purchase in order to carry on through the interim period.  It does not affect the general argument at all, as to the prematureness of a general equipment programme at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want, in the first place, to express my astonishment at the interest which Deputy Mulcahy has developed in the welfare of the Army, in his suggestion that the members of it are being more or less thrown aside and being forgotten.  I would like to remind him that the pensions which were given to the Army in 1937&mdash;pensions which were not given during the Deputy's period as a member of a former Government&mdash;have been increased on a number of occasions.  The pay of soldiers and the allowances to their wives and children have been increased on two occasions, and increased considerably during the last two years. With regard to the Deputy's remarks about the Bureau of Military History and the men that, he suggests, we should be looking after rather than worrying about a military history, he knows&mdash;I do not think I need enumerate them&mdash;all the things that we have done for the men in question, not only 1916 men, but men who fought during the Black-and-Tan period.  The Deputy must also be fully aware of the fact that we arranged that men, who were unable to give proof of sufficient service to the Pensions Board to enable them to receive a pension, could be considered for a special allowance by reason of the fact that they had service which was not regarded as active service, but yet which was regarded as service.  The result is that, far from throwing these men on the roadside, any man who is in a position in which he is incapacitated and unable to work and make a living for himself can receive, if he is single, £78 a year, and if <Col N="1421" /> he is a married man he can receive £97 10s. 0d.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I know this from my experience of Deputy Mulcahy, that, if I were to bring in a pensions Bill to give the men that he is talking about £5 a week, he would not regard that as sufficient.  I know that he divided the House no less than 13 times on a Bill which I brought in here to improve the conditions for soldiers.  When the Deputy's Party was the Government they gave 26/- to the men for whom the Deputy is now shedding tears.  When I brought in a measure to give them 42/-, and not 26/-, the Deputy divided the House no less than 13 times in order to show his desire for the welfare of these men, and he then wanted more money.  If it were possible to dole out money in the way that we would all like the Deputy would have another tune to play.</P>
      <P>That is the position in regard to the Deputy's desire to lend aid to these men.  He also spoke about having a soldier's friend.  I do not know what he means by a soldier's friend, whether he wants to have someone like a wet nurse waiting on these men, but the Deputy must not be aware of the fact that we have established at the Department of Defence an office to which men are invited to come and explain their difficulties.  They have come in hundreds to do so.  The Deputy is unaware of that fact.  I am forced to the conclusion that his interest in these men is not real.  It is rather for the purpose of standing up in this House and of opposing anything that we bring in.  The Deputy literally interprets the word &ldquo;opposition&rdquo; to mean opposition to everything and anything that we bring into this House, whether it is good, bad or indifferent.  That is the attitude which the Deputy takes up in regard to most of the Bills and matters which are discussed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of the period of the emergency, we went to the trouble of printing a booklet and of sending the Deputy a copy of it.  It carried all the information that any soldier's friend <Col N="1422" /> could give.  It gave every particle of information that any man could require if he was looking after his own interests.  I do not know what the Deputy wants beyond that.  The Deputy went on then and talked about the cost of the Army.  Actually, the cost here covers this&mdash;that we were carrying 11 officers and 411 N.C.O's more than we anticipated in the original Estimate.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave talked about an injustice that had been committed by the Minister for Defence.  He may not have called it an injustice, but he said that the Minister was unjust in forcing men out of the Army on the plea that they could get work.  The people to whom we appealed to get into employment were not members of the regular Army or regular officers.  They were men who had come in from patriotic motives to lend their aid to the State in the difficult period we were passing through.  Large numbers of them left employment and came into the service of the State and many of them had positions to which they could go back. We made an appeal to that type of individual to get back to his employment. We could not in any circumstances have appealed to a regular soldier or officer to leave the Army and get back into employment, because his employment was naturally the Army.</P>
      <P>I am rather surprised to find that this matter is being raised at the present time, because the individuals concerned are all members of the regular Army whose pensions are based on the pay they were receiving.  The position is that when we decided to raise the pay of the Army as an added attraction to secure recruits, whatever individuals joined the Army and received that pay would be entitled to these increased rates of pension. Automatically, any person who remained in the Army subsequent to the date fixed would also be entitled to receive that pension.  The individuals who left after that particular date, I think it was 1st September, were entitled to the increased rate.  Those who left before that date were only entitled to the old rate.</P>

      <P>It was not necessary to give it.  If the man had service in excess of the period that he was entitled to serve, he should have gone any time after the 11th May, 1945, the date on which demobilisation began, and a large number of them did.  A large number of men appealed to be released from service, and where they were able to secure employment or where there were certain family conditions, these men were released immediately.  On the other hand, other men with families appealed to be allowed to remain in the Army and these men, perhaps through luck or something else, did better than the others.  That is all it was.  The point is that we cannot do anything about it, because if you are going to fix any other date you will have to go right back to 1937 and you will have to admit large numbers of men who went out since that period.  Not only would it have that effect, but a number of other Departments would be affected as a result of whatever we might do.  From that point of view, it is out of the question for us to do anything.</P>

    <P>In regard to the question of meals, the hours are the old-established ones for meal times.  During the emergency I know that a meal was always available <Col N="1425" /> at 7 or 8 o'clock made up from the surplus rations.  I could not say whether that is continuing or not.  But there are canteens available which have been very greatly improved both from the point of view of accommodation and the meals which are supplied.  As the Deputy knows, they are supplied at a ridiculously cheap rate.  A man who wants to have an extra meal late in the evening can go into one of these comfortable canteens and get a meal for a couple of pence.  I cannot say whether the system which was operative during the emergency still operates or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Producers generally all over the world are demanding security and stability, and I think it is appreciated in most countries that they are necessary if the world is to be fed. According to the survey made by the Food Agricultural Organisation, there is considerable leeway to be made up in the food requirements of the world. It is not generally appreciated that more than 50 per cent. of the world's population is under-nourished in so far as they are unable to secure a properly balanced ration and adequate nutritious food.  The majority of the people of the world have sufficient calories and carbohydrates but they lack proteins and vitamins to protect the foods that are so essential to good healthy diets.  We have a world international organisation now looking after that, known as the F.A.O., and I think, if the aims and objects of that organisation are implemented, that it will have a very good effect so far as the primary producers of the world are concerned.  As a matter of fact, I believe that unless they are implemented the world will be unable to fulfil the ultimate goal of production That is what the Almighty intended when the world was created and when it was peopled by mankind.  Surely the Almighty intended that there would be sufficient capacity in the world, and in the soil of the world, to fulfil the requirements of the human <Col N="1427" /> race, if that capacity were properly and efficiently worked.  There does appear to be a keener appreciation of what is necessary, what ought to be done, and to what the human race is entitled according to a Christian civilisation.  Let us hope here that that end will be implemented eventually.</P>
      <P>No matter what we ask for in the way of a tribunal and price fixing and all that sort of thing, a depression in one country almost inevitably has its repercussions not merely in the particular country but outside the country as well.  It has its repercussions on the markets of other countries.  It must be appreciated that, if the standard of the primary producer is to be raised, if he is to get a fair margin and if he is guaranteed security, it cannot be done in isolation: it must be done internationally.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased that the Government here has joined that international organisation.  I would like to say that agriculture is and ought to be a long-term policy.  If we are going to raise food production, the man engaged in that work must feel satisfied that there is going to be a long-term market for his produce over a period of years, because, as a matter of fact, it takes two, three, four or five years to get into production, and it is essential that he shall have stability, security and the knowledge that in the coming years he is going to get a fair margin.  I would like to make it clear, Sir, that I think a wrong impression is created abroad among the general community in regard to this whole question.  Many people appear to think that farmers believe in dear food.  I do not believe in dear food.  I do not think that we should stand for a policy of dear food. We should stand for a policy of a fair margin for the primary producer: that he should be guaranteed a fair margin for his work.  I wish to say that where stability or security is guaranteed by the State, there is a responsibility on the farmer to become, as far as possible, efficient.  We cannot have better conditions, decent markets and fair standards if the primary producer is not efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1428" /> With regard to efficiency and low output, I say that a man with a low output cannot expect a good margin of profit, so that in considering this whole matter we cannot divorce one from the other.  We must consider efficient production, high output and a fair margin as well.  If we do that, and if we secure that, I believe that no section of the community can have a grouse.  I believe the primary producers would be doing their duty to the community as a whole, and I believe that there is no other way of attaining success.  I suppose the farmer Deputies and the Department of Agriculture are taking a great interest in the White Paper, which is in course of passage through the House of Commons, and in the methods adopted there to give security and stability to the primary producer: to stimulate production, to see what is given to the farmer, what is asked of him, and what is demanded of him in compensation for the security and stability given.  As a matter of fact, we might be amazed at the sacrifices that the farmers of Britain are prepared to make in order to ensure that they will get fair margins in the future, because their experience has been a damn bad experience.  In an industrial country like England, agriculture has been neglected, and for many years the farming community took little or no margin of profit; possibly they took a debit on some of their production.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that Deputy Corry did not go further with his motion and set out the sort of tribunal required.  If we do not get an independent, autonomous tribunal, it will not be satisfactory.  I would rather be without a Civil Service tribunal.  If we get a Civil Service tribunal, a tied tribunal that will not be empowered to act independently, I do not think it will be a success. I submit that this tribunal must have full power, must be absolutely independent, and must be in a position to base its decisions on the evidence put forward.</P>
    <P>If the Government will implement the sort of tribunal that is envisaged, then <Col N="1429" /> the agricultural community must get down to the job of preparing costings, and that is a very big matter.  If we were doing costings it might have many benefits other than securing a good price.  It might show us where we are making mistakes, what particular branch of agriculture is not paying or is not efficient, and possibly we would be in a position to compare one area with another and in that way be able to determine the type of agriculture best suited to the soil and weather conditions in different districts.  There is an extraordinary difference in the conditions that operate in different areas.</P>
    <P>The amendment moved by Deputy Heskin merely stresses what has been brought to the Minister's attention at various food conferences all over the country.  Judging from the reports of these conferences, it has been represented by the delegates in attendance that, in the conditions under which we are producing various commodities, the present prices are not sufficient.  We have to take into account the cost of production, the cost of labour and the anticipated increase in costs.  I am glad that Deputy Heskin has put down this amendment, which brings to the Minister's attention the seriousness of the problem.  Already his attention has been directed to it at conferences down the country and it is only proper that his attention should be directed to it here.</P>
    <P>The British agricultural community have been promised that, in the price arrangements for the coming season, the bad conditions of last year will be taken into account.  It is only fair that the same should be done here.  It may be suggested our farmers got voluntary help.  I do not think there is any such thing as cheap labour.  We appreciated the voluntary labour very much, but the farmers were very generous with the volunteers.  It was a question of getting the labour at the right moment.  I believe the farmers were pretty generous with every man who offered his services.  Although the voluntary help was there, it cannot be said that the farmers got cheap labour through voluntary help.</P>
    <P>From a Parliamentary Question I asked a few weeks ago, it appears that there has been a substantial reduction <Col N="1430" /> in the amount of wheat delivered to the mills.  The quantity was 92,000 tons on 1st February last.  The Minister could argue that the country has suffered by that amount, but there is another way of looking at it.  The income of the agricultural community has suffered by that amount and the cost of the bad harvest can be calculated from that figure&mdash;92,000 tons at 55/- per barrel.  That will give us some idea of the reduction in the income of the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>I am giving the Minister a precedent, if he is prepared to take one from another country.  Usually we are not prepared to do that.  In a neighbouring country the responsible Minister indicated that the bad harvest of last year will be taken into account in the price to be fixed for cereals in the coming year.  Let us face the difficulties that exist.  We have had a very late spring; we are still snow and frost bound; little or no ploughing has been done.  A tremendous effort will be required if a good job is to be done. It would be a great incentive if the Minister announced that there will be an increase in the price of wheat.  It will be a powerful incentive to the agricultural community and they will put their backs into the job.  They will have to work, not eight hours a day, but night and day during the coming weeks the moment the weather clears up.</P>
    <P>There is no tractor fuel at the different depôts in the country.  If the weather clears up next week, the farmers will be shouting for fuel.  It will be a shocking state of affairs if the tractors are to remain idle the first fine day that comes.  The matter is an urgent one.  The farmers should be stimulated to make the very best effort within the next few weeks.  I am sure the House will help the Minister in every way.  We will all co-operate as far as we can.  In view of the disappointments of the past 12 months and the hardships the agricultural community has suffered, an incentive now would have a tremendous effect on what will be done in the way of national effort during the next month.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree that a tribunal should be set up to inquire <Col N="1431" /> into the cost of production of all types of farm produce, but I can see that even if such a tribunal were established it would take a very long time before its findings could be submitted to the proper authorities.  I suggest that while such a tribunal would be considering the problem the Minister should make every effort to encourage production in the country.  We all realise the position that exists.  There is very little wheat, but that is due to the very bad crop last year.  The ration of butter has been reduced to 2 ozs. per week per person, and the sugar ration is down to a ½ lb. per head per week.  The Minister is a young man and a farmer, and I am sure he will face the position with courage and determination in a effort to save the agricultural industry from the ruin which it is facing at present.</P>
      <P>What I suggest he should do is to summon a conference of producing farmers&mdash;not a conference of professors or people of that type&mdash;of farmers who are actually producing and delivering goods for the people, and of representatives of the agricultural workers who have to work shoulder to shoulder with the farmer in the great effort to produce food for the nation in this emergency, presided over by experienced economists from his Department, and let that conference arrive at a reasonable price so that, first, a decent wage may be paid to the worker to encourage him to remain on the land, and, secondly, that the farmer will get a reasonable profit, a reasonable return on the capital he has laid out.  That, to my mind, is the approach to the position as it presents itself to us to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reason for putting down the amendment was that I feel that if we want to secure an adequate supply of wheat for the nation, a price which will be an encouragement to the farmer must be given.  We know well that, due to the fact that in many areas there was no tillage tradition, the farmers there did not have the equipment necessary for such a huge production of wheat.  Now, as Deputy Hughes has pointed out, because of the terribly bad weather during the winter and the frosty weather of the past five or six <Col N="1432" /> weeks, tillage in all areas is two months late.  I estimate roughly that at the moment not 15 per cent. of the ploughing has been done.  How are the farmers and their workers to face the situation? There is no use in asking a horse to pull a load he is not able to pull and there is no use in asking the farmers and their workers to produce their quota of food unless they get some encouragement to do so.  The horse must be fed and the farmer and his workers must be fed by way of cash return.</P>
    <P>We know that the farmers have a duty to make this great effort but we also know that they must be compensated like every other section of the community.  In the newspapers every other day, we see reports of trade disputes all over the country.  If he farmer sat down and refused to do his work, he would be a criminal.  If he refuses to till, he is brought before the court, and, if it is so decided, he may be imprisoned for refusing to do his work.</P>
    <P>Quite recently, we discussed a motion in relation to wheat which was designed to secure a reduction of the tillage quota by a very small margin, and I should like, in discussing this matter, to touch upon that motion.  I believe that the Minister should exercise his common sense, and should instruct his inspectors to use their common sense, and not enforce the Tillage Order in areas where the farmers are not able to produce an economic yield of wheat per acre.  By increasing the price of wheat to £3 per barrel, the man with good land will be induced to grow more wheat and he will make good the loss caused by the failure of the uneconomic holder to grow wheat.  That uneconomic holder can grow another commodity much more suited to his land than wheat, a commodity which is very essential for the people, oats or barley.  Potatoes are another essential crop which he could produce and I suggest that it be left as a matter of choice to him.  Leave the man with the land which will not produce grain economically to produce his own crop. That is the best way of doing it and will prove to be the most successful way in the end.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Minister for Industry <Col N="1433" /> and Commerce gave a rough estimate of the yield from the 1946 wheat crop and I was amazed by the figure he submitted to the House.  It represents less than three and a half barrels of wheat to the acre.  Surely there must be something wrong.  This year, I had between 50 and 60 acres of wheat, and I recently calculated what I got from that acreage as around nine barrels to the acre.  I thought I got a good yield this year.  In other years, I considered, and I even argued here, that the average was around the seven-barrels mark, and I am greatly surprised that the Minister's estimate should be so low.  It represents 2,160,000 barrels when it should be well over 5,000,000 barrels.  For that reason, in view of the arguments put forward and the lateness of the season, I appeal to the Minister to be courageous and determined. If he will face the music as a farmer Minister should, he will put courage and determination into the farming community and they will produce the goods.</P>
    <P>With regard to another crop, barley, I should like to point out that, in my view, we are following an unwise course in encouraging the importation of this grain.  In reply to a question I asked in 1944, I was told that the imports of barley were 36,449 tons or 368,490 barrels, representing at our price £1,123,000.  For the three-year period, 1944 to 1946, it represented a total of over £9,000,000 on the export price. That brings me back to the matter of the uneconomic land.  Barley is a crop which can be produced on this land, and, if you give a price for barley, you will get the goods produced.  If we are to pursue the Government's own policy of producing food for the nation and for live stock, it would be sound policy for the Minister to encourage these people with this uneconomic land to produce the barley which we are importing from our cross-Channel neighbours and to give the farmer at home &mdash;I do not ask him to pay a price of 61/- per barrel&mdash;an economic price so as to encourage him to produce.  I suggest that 50/- a barrel should be paid for barley and, with that price, I believe that you would get sufficient barley without being under the necessity of importing it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1434" /> As regards the manure subsidy of 2/6, the Minister stated, in reply to a question, that the voucher would not be exchangeable until next autumn. That means that a man who produced wheat in 1944, for instance, will be without any remuneration in cash or kind for three years.  Take the case of a man producing ten acres of wheat, with an average of seven barrels to the acre.  That would be 70 barrels, which, at 2/6 per barrel, would amount to £8 15s.  If the ordinary rate of interest payable in the post office&mdash;2½ per cent.&mdash;be added, that would be 4/4½ in addition.  The farmer is entitled to his interest as well as everybody else. In the second year, the amount owing him would be £17 10s., plus 8/9 interest. In the third year, the amount would be £26 5s. 6d., plus 13/1½ interest. That sum of £26 would be of assistance to the farmer in meeting a liability or in clearing his rent or rates.  I think that it is unfair to withhold the vouchers for so long a period.  The vouchers should be cashable in the year in which the crop is grown.  If the same is to apply this year, the farmers will be three and a half years waiting.</P>
    <P>Take the case of a man who is growing 40 or 50 acres of wheat and consider the cash value of the vouchers over a three-year period.  It does not follow that because a man is growing a large acreage of wheat he is well off. The amount due to him in respect of subsidy would, perhaps, meet his rates or help to pay his labour.  He is entitled to consideration more than most other people, because he has to face greater liability as regards cost of production&mdash;implements, labour, rent, rates and taxes.  It is very unfair that a man should be kept so long out of his money, and I think the Minister should take into consideration the loss which the ordinary producer suffers in this respect over a period of years.</P>
    <P>As regards labour, Deputy Hughes referred to the voluntary labour available last year.  There is no doubt that those who came voluntarily from the cities and towns did their best throughout the country.  Farmers everywhere appreciate the effort made by them and <Col N="1435" /> the spirit with which they worked, whether skilled or unskilled.  In nearly all cases, the men and women were entitled to a wage, as many of them lost their employment during that period.  Whether they did or not, the farmers paid them and paid them well. I do not think that the farmer is as selfish as many people would lead one to believe.  He will pay his wages and, in nine cases out of ten, he will pay through the nose.  He has to pay if he wants to keep going.  The farmer has to cater for a market and has to hold that market.  For that reason, he cannot go out of production.</P>
    <P>Take the case of the farmer who is producing milk.  The position in that regard speaks for itself.  In a country where the people always had plenty of butter, they have to-day only two ounces per week.  I believe that the whole cause of that is that a sufficient wage is not being paid to the worker on the land to encourage him to stay there.  If you want to have that wage paid, you will have to increase the price of the commodities which the farmer sells.  When I refer to a sufficient wage for the workers, I include in that term the members of the farmer's own family.  I do not see why they should be slaves to the nation.  The farmer himself might like his day, or two or three days, out but sooner or later the family will get tired of that.  They will want to know why, if their co-worker during the remaining days of the week can go off on Sunday afternoon to a hurling match or other amusement, they should have to remain at home to milk 15, 20 or 30 cows.  I hold that the members of the farmer's family are as much entitled to a wage as are the sons and daughters of industrialists who work in their offices.  The farmer's family do not want office pay.  All they want is a reasonable rate of pay by way of an increased price to the farmer to encourage production.</P>
    <P>How many people in this city and in the villages of rural Ireland are paying 4/- and 5/- per lb. for butter?  We are told that that is black-marketing. Whether it be black-marketing or white-marketing, the people will try to get butter at any price.  Why should those who have power to fix a price <Col N="1436" /> prevent the producer from getting a reasonable price?  I hold that the price of milk at present should be at least 1/5 per gallon during summer and 1/8 during the winter period.  That would increase the price on the average by about 5d. per gallon.  Taking the value of that in butter, it would represent an increase of about 1/2 per lb.  That added to the current price would make 3/6 per lb.  How many people, even amongst the poorer sections of the community, would refuse to pay 3/6 per lb. if they could get a sufficient quantity of butter?  I say without fear of contradiction that nobody would have objection to a reasonable price being paid to the farmer in order to get the article they so badly need and which is so essential to-day.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with one other point in connection with family labour on the farm before I pass away from this matter.  We are told very often that the farmers have millions of money on deposit in this country. Where did these deposits come from? They represent the slave wages of the farmers' sons and daughters of 50 or 60 years ago.  These sons and daughters worked on the farms until they reached the age of 40 or 50 years, and could not get married.  They all lived together on the farm until it was eventually passed on to a young nephew or niece.  Their earnings, the produce of their slave wages, have been lodged in the banks almost since the time banking institutions were first set up here.  These are the deposits belonging to farmers which are so often referred to by other people throughout the country.  They are the slave wages as I say of the forefathers of the present occupiers of the farms.  Thank God, to-day, the young boys and girls are not going to live under such conditions.  They are going farther afield.  Years ago a certain sense of pride attached to them but to-day they are satisfied to knuckle down and to take jobs in factories, to go as maids or enter some other employment in order to get a reasonable remuneration which will enable them to partake of the ordinary pleasures afforded to the youth of the modern age.</P>
    <P>Take the workers on the land <Col N="1437" /> to-day.  Three years ago, in a debate on agriculture, before the present Minister ever appeared as Minister for Agriculture, I had the courage to say that the wage of the agricultural worker should be 45/- a week.  That was three years ago and his wage even yet is not 45/-.  I say to-day, even though it may be unpopular in my constituency and elsewhere, that you must have a levelling up, that you must bring the wages of the rural worker within a reasonable distance of the wages of the rural industrial worker.</P>
    <P>I shall not say that his wages must be brought up to the level of those of the city worker but they will have to be brought up to a reasonable level, that of the rural industrial worker.  I hold&mdash;I am not afraid to mention the figure again to-day&mdash;that the agricultural worker if you want to keep him on the land should be in receipt of 55/- a week.  In order to give him that wage and to encourage production it will be necessary to increase the price of milk, wheat, beet and barley.  As I said in my opening remarks, the present Minister for Agriculture is a young man, who is himself a farmer.  Face up to the situation that presents itself to you.  The picture is painted and the picture is ready to be exhibited at the moment.  You know what it is. Instead of operating compulsory measures against the farmers, face up to the situation.</P>

      <P>I have not much to say on this motion except that I wish to support it in its entirety.  All we ask for is that a tribunal or a commission should be established to inquire into the costing of all farm produce.  I think that such an inquiry is long overdue. It was pressed on the predecessor of the present Minister for quite a considerable time but met with no success.  We have now arrived at the time when we shall have to face up to the situation as it is.  If such a commission were established and its findings put into effect some years ago during the emergency, we would have avoided many of the serious food shortages that we are experiencing to-day. We have a definite shortage of food at the present time.  It is a strange thing that in an agricultural country which in former years had not alone sufficient food for itself but also an exportable surplus to dispose of, we should now be facing a shortage of primary products. Bacon has completely gone off the market, sugar is scarce and the butter ration has been reduced to two ounces per person.  Where the butter has gone is a mystery.  The average person in the country does not believe that our butter reserves have been reduced to the extent which allows only of a two-ounce ration per person per week.  We want a tribunal established to inquire into the cost of producing farm produce, and which will give adequate representation to producers.  Some years ago the predecessor of the present Minister established the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  We had a flourishing bacon trade at that time.  The strange thing is that, since that commission came into being, the pig population dropped to about one-third of what it was formerly.  The reason for that is plain for anybody to see.  The members of that commission were not producers themselves and did not understand producers' difficulties or the advantages which a commission composed of producers coming together and discussing proper ways and means of maintaining a certain pig population in the country, could confer on the general body of <Col N="1439" /> producers in the country.  I understand that Deputy Corry favours a tribunal composed of civil servants.</P>

      <P>The farmers of the country demand a price for their produce sufficient to cover the cost of production plus a margin which will represent a fair wage for the labour expended in producing that food.  That is a perfectly fair demand.  If a factory or industry is set up in this or any other country, the promoters float their company, get in capital, install machinery, estimate output, make a very close survey of their market and they fix a price for each particular article which that factory will produce which will return to them the cost of production and a fair margin for profit. One of the greatest causes why coercion has to be used in connection with certain farming operations is that farmers are constantly discouraged by the fact that no matter what labour they put into the land, they do not get a price for their produce which will permit them to pay a decent day's wages for work on their land.  What we ask in this motion is that means will be <Col N="1440" /> provided by which they will be guaranteed a price which will leave them, over and above the cost of production, something which will enable them to pay a reasonable day's wages to those engaged on the land.</P>
      <P>The question of the production of food in the coming 12 months is one of paramount importance at the present moment.  We had very inclement weather in January and the last five weeks' frost which has made the ground as hard as iron has held up work very seriously.  I urge that the Minister should go into consultation with other Ministers concerned to devise ways and means of facilitating farmers in every possible way.  Even if the frost cleared off now, there is just as serious an emergency before the country as confronted it in the harvest of last year.  The work that would normally be done in the months of January and February in other years, will now have to be done in the next three or four coming weeks, in the month of March.  Practically no wheat has been sown in my part of the country, and it is just as well, as the fierce frost would have killed it and the ground would need reseeding. If the wheat crop for next year is to be safeguarded, every effort will have to be made.  One of the previous speakers mentioned that no tractor fuel was available at the depôts to allow the tractors to work if the weather cleared up.  That is a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  In reply to questions here this week and the last week that the Dáil was sitting, he did not feel very hopeful and did not seem to grasp fully the gravity of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other factor I would like to bring before the Minister, which concerns his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to some extent also.  I see that we are promised this week-end 34,000 tons of coal from the United States.  I would ask him to ask his colleague to ear-mark a certain amount of that coal for blacksmiths.  When we start work in the spring, the blacksmith is our best friend.  Horses have to be shod, tools and implements altered, parts repaired and new parts made.  Even if you get a complete set of new equip- <Col N="1441" /> ment from the factory, you always need the blacksmith to stand by.  In nearly every case, they are trying to work on turf, charcoal or timber.  I am sure the Minister is quite familiar with the run of things in his own constituency and knows that no blacksmith can work properly without good coal.  If the farmers are held up for two or three days, it will be a serious handicap, so I ask that that matter be dealt with and that, if there is any of this consignment of coal suitable for blacksmiths' purposes, it be given to them.</P>
    <P>The farmers are depressed as a result of the bad harvest last year.  It was an act of God and there is no human being to blame for it.  Very often it happens that after their very best efforts the weather takes away half their profits and is the equivalent of robbing them.  That has depressed them seriously and this severe spell, to the end of which I hope we are now coming, is not improving their tempers. On top of that, we had the farmers' excellent effort last year to produce sufficient beet, but the sugar factory strike had disastrous effects on the production. Many farmers in my part of the country, even in spite of persuasion from me, have refused positively to grow beet, although they were making a little margin of profit from it.  Without taking the big growers into account the whole labour in the case of the small growers is generally in their own families.  Even then, it is a very costly crop, costing anything up to £35 a statute acre to produce, regardless of the output from that particular acre. That is a rough estimate and I might be pounds wrong, but I would say it is not less than £35 a statute acre.  Then I hear a lot of talk in my constituency regarding the profits of the sugar company, although there is not a sufficient price paid for beet.  A good deal of notice is taken of the enormous profits made by the sugar company and the farmers ask themselves why they should produce beet so that the company may have those enormous profits. That is a matter for inquiry.  I do not profess to charge the company with making excess profits.  I do not want to see them working without leaving some certain sum aside to meet contingencies <Col N="1442" /> and pay the shareholders, and so on, but if it is a fact that the profits are too high, that is not tending to induce farmers to grow beet.</P>
    <P>In some people's minds, this talk of prices may create the impression that the farmers want to increase prices too much and that the goods they produce will be too dear for the consumers in the cities and towns, who will not be able to purchase them.  During this year at least, owing to the general world shortage, the farmers of this country must go all out to provide the necessary food for ourselves.  We do not intend to shelter the lazy good-for-nothing who produces only half the normal return of his land.  That is another point.  In addition to inquiring into the cost of production, we need and demand from the Government every help and assistance in increasing production per acre over the whole country, since then and only then can we afford to sell our food more cheaply to the consumers in the cities and towns.  We could afford to sell it more cheaply and yet make a fair profit for ourselves, if we could grow one and a half times as much on each acre, since we could sell that total product at exactly two-thirds of the price.  The consumer would benefit as well as the farmer.  That is our aim.</P>
    <P>Under the present Government policy, we are definitely not making the average acre of land produce as much as it should.  There should be more attention to fertilisers and to other points that would help the farmers to get bumper crops this year.  If that is not done, we will be in a very serious situation.  I hold it was the policy of the Government in the past and the policy of the Minister's predecessor which left food as scarce as it is to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion we are discussing asks that the Government set up some authority to inquire into the cost of production of all farm produce, with a view to ensuring that farmers shall obtain an economic price for it. No one could take any objection to that proposal.  The farmer is surely entitled to an economic price for the goods which he produces and with that I am in full agreement.  However, <Col N="1443" /> listening to the debate and to the suggestions made this evening, it is pretty obvious that those who speak for the farmers and know the farming conditions are convinced that the present prices are not sufficient and that the motion, if put into operation, must mean that the economic price referred to, if established, would increase the price of practically every piece of produce coming from the farm and thus automatically increase the cost of living.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes suggests a remedy, an increased price for wheat, while Deputy Halliden wants increases for wheat, barley, milk and farm workers.  It seems that the only solution is to consider this agricultural problem together with the general problem of prices.  All the disadvantages which we suffer to-day &mdash;low production and lack of interest on that part of the community to participate in farm work&mdash;are due to the fact that the conditions of living offered to the farmer for his work are not comparable to the conditions offered to operatives in other industrial undertakings in this country.  I believe that is true, but if we are to make this survey, which must result in an increase in the cost of all produce that is requisite in our daily lives, we must make a much wider survey than has been suggested in this motion.</P>
      <P>We will have to make a survey covering workers in all our industrial undertakings.  Farming cannot be segregated and made a separate unit in the life of the country.  All our workers comprise one unit.  The work of one should dovetail into the other. The reward should be in proportion to the work that each operative puts into his work whether in an industrial or manufacturing concern or on the farm.  We have set up here a court which now examines the question of wages for workers.  The wages are fixed, I assume, on the cost of living to-day.  There can be no question but that every worker is entitled to a substantial increase in order that he may have the purchasing power which was his on the wage he had six years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1444" /> I do not know whether the increases which farmers have got for their produce would give them a 50 or a 60 per cent. increase on what they were getting six years ago.  It is pretty clear that conditions will be made worse than they are unless the survey embraces all engaged in industry, and unless a standard is fixed that will be comparable, one with the other, or as near comparable as conditions will permit.  The result of that survey should be to give a fair reward to all for their services.</P>
    <P>If, however, you proceed to set up a tribunal to make a survey in regard to agricultural prices and leave out of consideration altogether all other industrial occupations, then there is no doubt but that the prices based on it will cause greater hardships and unrest amongst other sections of the community. My suggestion is that we should have a general survey and enforce it generally.  I am not disputing at all the claims made by some speakers that the prices paid for our farm produce are below what they should be.  I do not think, however, that the adoption of some of the suggestions made is going to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>There is talk about increased prices for wheat, beet and milk.  Among certain groups of farmers we now have a monopoly established as regards certain types of agricultural production. Those engaged in beet production are able to demand, year after year, an increased price for beet.  They represent a comparatively small section of the community, but yet the beet producers can threaten the community with a strike and up goes the price of beet.  Similarly we are moving into a kind of corner in wheat growing. Wheat is not a crop that can be grown generally.  It has to be remembered that the land on which beet and wheat can be successfully grown is the best in the country.  The people engaged in growing wheat are fast creating a monopoly for themselves and are not slow in exercising the power of that monopoly.  But what about the position of the small farmers living on the poorer land in west, south and north? They represent a majority of those <Col N="1445" /> engaged in agriculture.  They enjoy no monopoly and never can.  They carry on a system of mixed farming which includes poultry and pig rearing, a certain amount of dairying and the growing of general crops.  These crops are not cash crops.  They are grown mostly to supply the household needs and to produce food for the feeding of a few pigs and some poultry.</P>
    <P>Those people are not in a position to threaten a strike or to demand that the price of their produce must move up from time to time.  You have there a disadvantage and an inequality which is being suffered by a big section, so far as numbers are concerned, of the farming community.  Their position requires a thorough investigation, because they are carrying on their work under very unfavourable conditions from the point of view of soil and climate.  They should get a fair deal out of the proposed survey if it ever takes place.  I do not know how it is to be done.  It is a big problem.</P>
    <P>I have every sympathy with any proposal that aims at the betterment of those engaged in agriculture.  I think that more could be done for them by the Department of Agriculture.  It should give more attention to the application of scientific methods for the production of agricultural products. We should have a scientific examination of our soil and its adaptability for growing various classes of crops. Special regard should be had to the treatment of poor soil.  Bad sub-soil should get special treatment, and you have a lot of it in the west, and north of Ireland.  It is non-porous, but perhaps by scientific treatment it might be made porous and could then be employed in profitable production.  The scientific treatment of our soil is an absolute necessity if our farmers are to continue in production under modern world conditions.  Perhaps with the extension of electricity in rural areas it might be possible to provide small farmers with machinery for milking cows.  One of the difficulties experienced in the dairying industry is that of finding workers who will attend on Sunday mornings and particularly on Sunday evenings to milk cows.</P>

      <P>Partly, I think.  It may be that this has been an interesting discussion and it may be that it has not.  After a very depressing harvest in 1946, a wicked winter in 1946-47, and a late spring on top of it, we had some depressing speeches from those who claim to speak the minds of the farming community.  I do not propose to follow that line, nor do I propose to deal with the various matters discussed in the course of the debate. The motions we are discussing deal with the establishment of a costings tribunal in regard to the establishment of which this House got an assurance from my predecessor and from myself.  I explained here on the last evening when we were discussing this matter that I had been given to understand that those who tabled these motions were satisfied with that assurance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a Parliamentary Question, I have given the House <Col N="1447" /> an assurance that I intended to introduce proposals for the establishment of a costings tribunal.  Whether or not Deputy Cogan regards that as an assurance I cannot say, but it seems to convey very plainly, as far as I understand English, that it is the intention of this Department over which I preside to introduce what is sought for here.  For some reason or another best known to the movers of this motion and, as I say, in spite of a sort of understanding to the contrary, we find ourselves discussing a matter that apparently is already agreed to.</P>
      <P>In the course of a discussion which, to my mind, should not have arisen, all kinds of issues have been raised, such as the composition of this tribunal, what will be the attitude of the Government towards its findings, what will the Government do in this eventuality and in that, the wisdom of having producers' representatives, the futility, as Deputy Hughes described it, of having what he called a &ldquo;bound tribunal.&rdquo; Surely these are all matters which would be quite in order on and appropriate to a discussion of the proposals when they make their appearance. As I have said, I have given an assurance that there will be no undue or unnecessary delay in bringing them forward so far as I am concerned. When that stage is reached, it will be quite in order for Deputies to give expression to many of the points of view to which expression has been given here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that I regard this discussion as a complete and absolute waste of time on the part of those who are always complaining of the inability of the Government to provide them with the time to discuss Private Deputies' Business.  I do not want to be an offender in that respect and therefore I can only say that the measure to which these motions refer is in course of preparation.  I cannot give any assurance as to the actual date on which it will make its appearance, but when it is introduced we can have all these points of view brought forward.  Since Deputy Hughes has mentioned the matter, I should like to give him an assurance&mdash;I am not saying <Col N="1448" /> that he will accept it&mdash;when he talks about a &ldquo;tied&rdquo; or &ldquo;bound&rdquo; tribunal, that, so far as I am concerned, this is my attitude towards matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department will, so far as I am concerned, carry out my policy as Minister and the policy that has the approval of the Government. Whatever their own views may be, I will see to it that they will do that. If at any time I find it necessary to call upon any official of my Department to take part in or sit upon any commission of inquiry or tribunal, I want to assure the House that he will not be in any way tied, but will be placed on that body for the purpose of discharging that responsibility in a free and conscientious manner.  If we are to discuss these matters when they come forward, let us not proceed to discuss the wisdom of a particular type of tribunal on the basis that, because it is composed of this particular type of person or that, it will be tied to the Department, to the Minister or to the Government or, because it is loaded in some other way, it will be tied to the farming community.  If a tribunal is to be established it will be free from any control or influence on my part.</P>
    <P>As I said, I do not wish to follow the rather depressing sort of line that has been taken or that has become so popular in this House when discussing agricultural problems.  I meet an odd farmer here and there, just the same as other Deputies.  I have an idea of the type of people farmers are and I think I understand them as well as most other people in this House, and I would be sorry to think that the point of view to which expression is given here, that depressing note which is often struck here, is the farmers' attitude towards the many problems that confront them and the nation and I would be very much more depressed than I am if I thought that note were a true reflection of the farmers' point of view or the farmers' attitude.</P>

      <P>As the Minister has stated, we have had a depressing autumn, a bad winter and a spring later than ever before, some two or three months practically.  The farmers want encouragement, and I would ask the Minister to review the position as regards the price of wheat and the price of milk.  These are two matters on which I should like the Minister's assurance: that he will immediately have the price of wheat and especially the price of milk reviewed.</P>
      <P>I should like also, as Deputy Blowick remarked, that coal would be reserved for blacksmiths, if at all available.  I am aware of the great hardship to farmers up and down the country who want to get work done, horses shod and their implements repaired for the spring.  I have had letter after letter from blacksmiths in various parts of the country urging me to put the matter before the Dáil.  I hope that the Minister will keep this in mind and if anything possible can be done in the matter that he will make representations to the proper quarter.  That is all I have to say, and I have no reason to doubt that the Minister for Agriculture will expedite the setting up of this tribunal as quickly as possible and that we all shall be satisfied with the personnel of that commission and with its findings.  It is eminently desirable that the farmers' sons and daughters should get a fair crack of the whip. As some Deputy has remarked, they have been kept working day in and day out, year after year, with no means of settling down in life, as getting married is out of the question for economic reasons.  I think, Sir, there is no necessity for continuing, and I unreservedly accept the assurance of the Minister that everything possible will be done.</P>

      <P>I have been asked, a Chinn Comhairle, for an assurance from Deputy Halliden on two points and I think it is necessary that I should say, in relation to one of them, what my attitude is. These two points are milk and wheat. According to the White Paper, to which he has referred, I am obliged to examine annually the milk position.  As far as the price of wheat is concerned, I have gone to the Government because of complaints I heard in Limerick, Carlow, Sligo, and because of my own belief, and I have asked them to restore the vouchers to the wheat growers for 1947.  That concession has been granted.  It may be regarded as small but it is a concession as far as I am concerned, and it is well that the House and the country should know that the wheat price for 1947 is closed and it is better for us, instead of keeping an agitation of this kind alive, to get out and urge the people to do their job, hard as it is, having regard to the circumstances, rather than keep this thing dangling all the year.  The price of wheat fixed for 1947 is regarded by the Government as a price that is fairly reasonable and generous, having regard to all the circumstances.  I must say that I agree with it.  I want to give the House an assurance that I must, according to the White Paper, examine the milk position.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That in view of the extent of flooding throughout the country this year the Dáil expresses its disapproval of the Government's inaction in failing to operate the Arterial Drainage Act passed in March, 1945, and calls for an immediate statement of the Government's policy in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1452" /> The motion speaks for itself and I think the Parliamentary Secretary can scarcely be ignorant of the hardships that have been suffered by a great many people in the country.  Last summer was an abnormal summer, but every winter that comes brings its own hardships.</P>
    <P>It might be well if we reviewed what has occurred in relation to arterial drainage, so that we can have some idea of the amount of time taken by the Government in implementing the scheme of national drainage.  On the 15th October, 1938, the then Minister for Finance, Seán MacEntee, appointed a commission,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;to consider the whole question of land drainage (excluding field drainage) with special reference to the technical, administrative, financial and legal aspects of the problem, and to submit recommendations as to:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  How an efficient system of drainage reasonably consonant with requirements and calculated to facilitate future land reclamation can best be secured.</P>
    <P>(2)  The provisions which should be made for the proper maintenance of existing and future drainage works.</P>
    <P>(3)  How the cost of drainage works and their maintenance could most equitably be apportioned amongst the various interests concerned.</P>
    <P>(4)  The changes (if any) in the existing law and administrative system which would be necessary to give effect to the recommendations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That commission set to work on the 15th October, 1938.  It had many sittings and did a considerable amount of investigation.  It took evidence and submitted a report in 1940.  That report lay in the office of the Department of Finance from 1940 until 1944. On the 17th February, 1944, the Arterial Drainage Bill was introduced by the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>He tried to make excuses for the delay in introducing the Bill which was to implement the recommendations made by the Drainage Commission and he summed up by saying (Parliamentary Debates, Vol. 92, No. 4, col. 1320):&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1453" />&ldquo;I make those remarks by way of defence, or by way of meeting any charge which may have been lurking at the back of any person's mind that there was undue delay on the part of those who were charged with that responsibility.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In column 1323, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As I say, the Government were anxious to have these proposals introduced. They are anxious now that the work should start as soon as possible on a scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Every Party in the House welcomed the introduction of that particular Bill. The Bill became an Act of Parliament early in 1945.  All who were interested in national drainage were expecting that the work would start immediately. As a matter of fact, the Drainage Commission in the recommendations it submitted made reference to a possible delay and in its report in 1940 it stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If our recommendations are accepted, the promotion of the necessary legislation may occupy a considerable time.  We suggest that it might be desirable, pending such legislation, to undertake the necessary preliminary survey work in catchment areas selected for prior treatment so that the actual work could be launched with the least possible delay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In 1945 a token Vote of £10 was all we provided, and in last year's Estimates, under sub-head J (4), we provided £12,000 for the purchase of machinery; we voted £11,000 for the maintenance of machinery, £7,800 for central repair workshop and stores, and for arterial drainage surveys we provided £4,800.  That is as far as we have gone in the matter of national drainage in nine years.  No work has been commenced anywhere.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to stress the importance of this matter. We must consider the harm done to the country through the flooding of lands. Large areas are continually being inundated.  Through years of neglect, many rivers have become choked and great harm is being done to good pasture land, valuable grazing land. Losses have been incurred through <Col N="1454" /> flooding, not merely by individuals, but by the nation as a whole, all through neglect in the matter of national drainage.  That aspect is bad enough, but I think the worst aspect is the damage done to the health of very many families.</P>
    <P>I have experience of the River Barrow.  Strange to say, this commission looked upon the Barrow as a completed job.  I am well aware of the fact it is not a completed job. Drainage works were carried out down to Athy, but from Athy down the river there has been great neglect.  The work on the upper reaches has resulted in more rapid flooding on the lower reaches and a tremendous amount of land has been inundated, often three and four times during the winter months, and during the summer period of last year.  The serious aspect is the inconvenience and hardship caused to the unfortunate people living in the towns along the river, more especially in the poorer dwellings situated close to the riverside.</P>
    <P>In the town of Carlow the conditions are appalling, and the same applies to Leighlinbridge.  Conditions are equally bad along the river towards Wexford. In New Ross the condition of the river is a disgrace.  Valuable land has been completely lost there.  Some of the land now continually covered with water in the New Ross district was at one time used for the holding of the New Ross Show.  The old show grounds are now inundated because of neglect in the drainage of the river.</P>
    <P>I am sure the same applies to other big rivers in the country.  Deputy Coogan will tell you what has occurred on the Nore.  I have some idea of that myself.  Last summer I was down in Fermoy and I came up against the same problem.  We have to appreciate this, that the configuration of the country and our very high rainfall contribute to a big drainage problem.  It is inevitable that we should have that; but when we look to other countries and see the amount of work they have carried out in regard to drainage, even with a lower rainfall, we realise what might be done.  As a matter of fact, in some cases, national electricity was <Col N="1455" /> utilised for the purpose of pumping by night where sufficient out-fall through gravitation did not exist.  When we consider these activities in other countries, we begin to appreciate the utter neglect of drainage here and the immense national loss not merely in goods but from the point of view of the health of the community.</P>
    <P>One can appreciate that if a young family's dwelling is flooded to a depth of one foot or two feet for ten or 12 days, the condition which results from that flooding, even when it disappears, is shocking and must have a very detrimental effect on the health of that young family.  My attention has been called to the shocking condition of large numbers of poor families who have to put up with these conditions winter after winter.  These people are terribly disappointed and terribly inconvenienced, and their condition inevitably reacts on their health. There are several aspects of the matter.  The social aspect is the worst of all, but from the economic aspect the national loss which results from this inundation of good land must be terrific.</P>
    <P>The Estimate given by the commission that 470,000 acres had been drained under the Drainage Acts, including the 1925 Act, and that there remained to be drained 259,364 acres is, to my mind, an under-estimation. Most of the old drainage schemes were not well done.  They were poorly done because the financial provision was not adequate.  Maintenance has been neglected&mdash;in some cases, completely neglected&mdash;and the work has to be done over again.  It is deplorable that when a drainage scheme is carried out, maintenance work is not properly and efficiently done, because neglect will in a few years involve a further capital expenditure of an amount almost equal to the original sum.</P>
    <P>I know that the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us that he has not got the equipment, and that that will be given as the excuse.  As I have already pointed out, we voted sums for machinery as set out in the Estimates. Why were these amounts not asked for <Col N="1456" /> long since?  In any case, there is any amount of work, very useful work, which could be done on rivers for which no machinery at all would be required.  In reply to that attitude which I anticipate will be the attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary.  I want to point out that Britain, during the emergency, when she was struggling for her very existence, when she was thrown back, to a large extent, on her own resources so far as feeding her people was concerned, could find the opportunity to reclaim 1,000,000 acres.  We have talked a lot here about exporting our young men and I have no doubt that, on the reclamation of those 1,000,000 acres, any amount of Irish fellows were engaged, increasing the wealth and productive capacity of England when we could not find the opportunity to use our own nationals to increase the productive capacity of this island.  Our sterling assets are big enough and useless enough without sending over Irishmen to add further to these very doubtful assets.  In this work alone thousands of men could be employed in doing useful national work, useful from the social point of view and from the economic point of view.  That work has been completely neglected, and because it has been completely neglected, and because rivers are becoming more and more choked every year, the problem is becoming bigger and the damage becoming greater every year.</P>
    <P>I feel that there is no excuse, so far as the Government is concerned.  I feel that a Government facing its responsibilities during the emergency to ensure that an opportunity was given to all our people to find profitable employment at home and looking for sources of employment, would select national drainage as a very profitable source of employment for our young men.  Instead of that, thousands of our young fellows were forced to go abroad, and I have no doubt, as I have said, that hundreds, and possibly thousands, of them were engaged on land reclamation in Great Britain.  Under the 1925 Act, 70,000 acres of this country were reclaimed, but for very many years no reclamation whatever has been done, and <Col N="1457" /> maintenance has, to a great extent, been neglected.  It is shocking that that must be said, but that is the position.</P>
    <P>In face of what Great Britain has achieved under the very bad conditions which existed in Great Britain during the emergency&mdash;as I say, they found it possible to reclaim 1,000,000 acres&mdash;it is a disgrace that we were not able to reclaim a single acre.  Great Britain brought 1,000,000 acres into effective production, and we can easily understand what it meant to her economy that she was able to increase her production during the emergency by 70 per cent.  In complete contrast with that, ours fell by 10 per cent.  Is it any wonder that our production is falling if the one thing which is so essential for good land for productivity, and good soil conditions&mdash;drainage&mdash;is neglected?  In our circumstances, with the very high rainfall we have, we have for many years now utterly neglected this big drainage problem and our neglect has not merely reacted on our economic position but has reacted very severely on the health of large sections of our people.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that Deputy O'Higgins and I tabled this motion in order to bring this serious and urgent matter to the attention of the responsible Minister and to ask for a full explanation as to why nothing has been done.  The House and the country were told, when the Arterial Drainage Bill of 1944 was going through, that the intention was to face this problem nationally, as it should be faced, as a big national problem.  It was stated that something like £250,000 could be spent annually.  The House expressed the view that that was a very small sum, that, on the basis of that expenditure, it would take 28 or 30 years to complete the job and that the job was so urgent that plans should be laid to complete it in a far shorter time.</P>
    <P>I think we got agreement from all sides of the House that that was so. The Parliamentary Secretary responsible for the passage of the Bill agreed that the matter was urgent and assured the House that the Government were anxious to have the Act put into operation at the earliest possible moment. <Col N="1458" /> It seems extraordinary that this delay has occurred.  I cannot accept the excuse that we have not the equipment. Many schemes which would require little or no equipment could have been put into operation.  The commission in their report in 1940 envisaged some delay but recommended that preliminary survey work should be entered upon immediately. They stated that there might be some delay about the introduction of legislation but that, pending that, preliminary work should be carried out.  I believe that there has been utter and complete neglect of this big problem and that we have suffered nationally as a result.  I suppose many young people who were suffering from tuberculosis went to early graves because of this neglect.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will assure the House that something will be done in connection with this matter in the near future.</P>

      <P>I rise formally to second the motion.  Seeing that it is a very simple motion, asking for a statement of Government policy with regard to national drainage, I think that it would be in the interests of the Assembly as a whole and in accordance with the desire of all members from all parts of the House if the Parliamentary Secretary were to assist the House at this stage by giving an outline of Government policy on the matter.  I am not asking the Parliamentary Secretary to intervene at an unduly early stage because this motion has been on the Order Paper for a considerable number of months and I am sufficiently charitably-minded to assume that there is a policy with regard to national drainage, even if such a motion never went down.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he has any objection at this stage to stating what Government policy is on the matter.</P>

I regard it as a confession that he has got to wait until his brief is prepared by clerks and civil servants.  I regard it as a clear confession that he does not know sufficient about the Department for which he is charged with responsibility to state impromptu his views on drainage.  There has been so little discussion between himself and his Ministerial colleagues that he does not at the moment know what the policy of the Government is with regard to national drainage.  That is clear to all at this point.  I base my remarks on the assumption that what is clear to all can be clearly seen as a patent fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion was put down, asking for a statement of Government policy after 15 years' complete inactivity, after 15 years' contemptuous disregard of the necessity for drainage, after 15 years of increased and increasing flooding of the lands and homes of the <Col N="1460" /> people.  Three years ago full authority and power was given to the Department over which the Parliamentary Secretary presides in regard to drainage anywhere at any time.  The case made for that Bill, which was enthusiastically supported by every section of the House three years ago, was the necessity for speed.  The Government spokesman represented that he wanted to cut out the delays which had taken place under previous legislation, that national drainage was urgent and imperative. To get on speedily with the task of draining the flooded farms and the flooded homes of the people, that Bill was sought from the Dáil.  On that condition, the Bill was passed by the Dáil.  That was three years ago and in those three years not 100 yards of new river have been drained.  After three years, thousands of extra acres of land have been flooded.  After three years, hundreds of people have had to leave their homes because of flooding. Now, we find that the Government spokesman is unable to state to the Dáil what the policy, views or intentions of the Government are with regard to the drainage of the country. Not only the Government as a whole, but the Parliamentary officer directly charged with responsibility for national drainage is unable to make a simple statement to Parliament as to what the policy of the Government is on this question.</P>
    <P>This motion does not ask for details. It asks for a statement of policy with regard to drainage.  We had statements of policy with regard to drainage 15 years ago.  We had statements of policy with regard to drainage three years ago.  But we have had no drainage done.  We want to know why no drainage was done and what the policy of the present Parliamentary Secretary is.  Is it to carry on, like his predecessors over 15 years, sitting over volumes of paper legislation, sitting over rusty and inactive machines, viewing casually the increased and increasing flooding, viewing contemptuously the clogged-up rivers, watching land become more sodden and less arable, watching people fleeing from their homes during the seasonal flooding and doing nothing and saying nothing about it?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1461" /> Is that the intellectual bankruptcy with which this Parliament is faced? Is that the pitch we have reached 25 years after we got control of our own affairs.  Remember the much-condemned previous Government which the Parliamentary Secretary went up and down the country slandering because, amongst other things, they had not done sufficient drainage, because there were flooding and flooded rivers, because the members of the Government were not devoting all their time to intense and active drainage schemes.  The Government at that time were standing and working amongst the ruins of an old Administration, before the foundations of a new Administration had been laid. Despite all the trouble and turmoil of the times, during their short period they carried out the drainage of the biggest river in Ireland&mdash;the Barrow.</P>
    <P>That was done in face of the opposition and in face of the type of non-cooperation that existed then.  But they did not get on with the job quickly enough! They were not doing sufficient drainage! They were not relieving enough flooded areas, they were not reclaiming enough land and because they were not getting sufficient speed into the drainage machine, there were areas of land still subject to flooding.  Another man was called in 15 years ago to get on with the job.  Yet not a bit of drainage has been done beyond that carried out 15 years ago.  I represent a constituency with the Barrow at one end and the Shannon at the other.  Appeal after appeal has reached the Department from both ends of that constituency to relieve flooding, due at one end to a great river being left undrained and at the other end due to the fact that the maintenance on work which had been carried out on a great river did not receive attention.  The river that was drained years ago is gradually cluttering up again.  You get claims for compensation for stock drowned in the flood, for crops carried away by the floods, for seed crops flooded in their early days so that they came to nothing.</P>
    <P>That has been going on, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, for the <Col N="1462" /> long period of 15 years.  Then some years ago people were given hope.  A Bill was introduced to remove all the delaying factors that existed in legislation dealing with drainage.  It was said that there were too many authorities, that there was divided responsibility, that the undrained position of the greater part of the country was such an acute question that new legislation was required in order that the job could be tackled speedily.  Not only that, but considerable sums of money were held dangling before the eyes of the people as the sums that were going to be spent on drainage and spent quickly.  Did the people get the drainage?  They got hope, they got an election, the Government got their votes, but the drainage was not done and the flooding is still there.  Three years after that legislation was passed in the interests of speed, we have the speed merchant opposite so speedy that he is not able to make a statement&mdash;not until he gets a brief.  He does not know what the policy is until he gets overnight directions. This, in an island country with a centre of bog, an island country sparsely populated, which has not the capacity within itself to feed less than 3,000,000 people despite compulsory tillage and all the rest, because the percentage of land that is regarded as arable is too low even to maintain that tiny population.  Where would the nation of Holland be, if the Minister in charge of drainage there was so incapable of making a statement with regard to the policy of the Dutch Government in reference to the drainage of Holland?  Every one of them would be flooded out of their farmsteads and homesteads.  Here we have reached the point, after 25 years of controlling our own affairs, that we have an individual in charge of the important task of drainage who is incapable of making an impromptu statement as to what the policy of the Government or of his Department is with regard to drainage.</P>
    <P>The late Mussolini took over responsibility for Italy many years ago when portion of Italy was suffering from the same disability as we in this island. One of the great achievements that is pointed out to establish his claim to be <Col N="1463" /> regarded as a great man with great ideas, thinking nationally and economically, is that the first task he undertook, and undertook in a big way, in a speedy way, was that of draining the marshes, reclaiming the land and resettling more people on the land, creating new homesteads, producing more food for the Italians from inside Italy. Here we have the opposite.  We have the management of our own affairs but the water, instead of receding, is advancing from each river bed year after year.  Anyone who is in touch with the condition of rivers in the country knows that there is not a single river that is not year by year overflowing its banks to a greater and greater degree.  Presumably, we shall have the outworn excuse that is trotted out time and time again&mdash;the want of machinery.  We shall have that old outworn excuse trotted out by a Government that stood for absolute self-sufficiency.  We shall have that trotted out by a member of the Government, whose colleague desired the day when every ship would be at the bottom of the sea, when nothing would be going abroad and nothing would be coming from abroad, a member of the Government which held out hopes to the people 15 years ago of producing everything and making everything that the heart of man could desire here in Ireland.  Now, 15 years after this fantastic, lunatic, dishonest promise, we shall have trotted out to us the excuse that because John Bull is otherwise engaged he cannot supply us with the simple machinery to deal with drainage and that people will have to continue to suffer losses of crops and stock through flooding.</P>
    <P>Drainage in a big way, drainage on a grand scale was going on in this country through man-power, and man-power alone, before ever machinery for drainage was devised.  The tragedy of recent years has been that, as the waters were extending, the rural population was fleeing the country because there were not sufficient work and wages to keep them at home. Down below there in Banagher and the lands around it, where the Minister's predecessor was in touch with people in distress through flooding, two rivers <Col N="1464" /> joining flooded an immense triangle of land.</P>
    <P>I happened to inquire down there how many people had left, how many young men had gone from that immediate area because of the lack of work, because there were no wages and no living for them there.  The number was amazing and it was enough by man-power alone to drain that immense river.  Machinery is useful and makes for greater speed, but there is a vast amount of work on any drainage scheme that can be done by man-power alone in advance of the machinery. Flooding is increasing, the hope is turning to desperation, the land instead of increasing in productivity is reducing year by year, the crops produced are being lost and the stock reared is being lost.</P>
    <P>All the powers asked for three years ago were given freely and enthusiastically. The money mentioned was agreed to and the argument advanced by the Minister's predecessor for getting these powers was the one of essential speed, to get on with the task immediately.  If any criticism was offered during the passage of the Bill, it was from those who said they feared that particular piece of legislation was so much sham window-dressing, that when passed it would lie on the Statute Book forgotten, that it would collect dust in the office of the Board of Works, that we would be exactly as we were, that one year, two years or three years would pass and no drainage would be done.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary remember those criticisms? Does he remember those doubts?  Does he remember the emphatic way in which those doubts were hurled back and the Parliamentary Secretary then in charge said: &ldquo;Oh, just give me the chance, give me this and you will see a different Ireland in a few years' time.&rdquo;  We have seen a few years' time and we have seen a different Ireland.  There is less of the island to be seen, there is more of it covered with water and the legislation is covered with dust.</P>
    <P>The present Parliamentary Secretary is not long in his job.  If he wants to make an impression in his new Department, <Col N="1465" /> he will get some unemployed men to remove the layers of dust from that particular piece of legislation.  He will at least take sufficient interest in national drainage to read the Act and, having read it, he will be at least capable of getting up here and making an unprepared statement regarding the policy of the Government on this important question.</P>

      <P>I am very much surprised at the Parliamentary Secretary's silence when called upon to make a statement as to the policy of the Government on this all-important question of drainage.  It is three years since the Arterial Drainage Act was passed.  Before that, it was one of the major promises of the Fianna Fáil Government at every election, since they first came into this House, that it was their intention to introduce legislation for a complete drainage scheme for the whole country.  Election after election came and the same promise was repeated. When this House gave the fullest approval to that Bill, it was left aside and was not put into effect.  However, I hope at least now that the Irish people, and especially the Irish farmers who were anxiously awaiting relief as a result of such legislation, will see that this is only another of the empty Fianna Fáil promises which they have no intention of putting into effect.</P>
      <P>The fact of the Parliamentary Secretary remaining silent to-night, when called upon by Deputy O'Higgins to make a statement as to the Government's intentions, is a complete indication that there is no scheme or plan for the future implementation of this legislation.  If there were, the present Parliamentary Secretary would have been delighted to take advantage of Deputy O'Higgins' invitation and would have displayed to the House the Government's intention to relieve the unfortunate thousands of families living in swamps and suffering from severe flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be with pride that he would delight in reading his statement in to-morrow's <i>Irish Press</i> as to the great schemes of drainage it was his intention to put into effect, and thus throw it as a red herring across the trail of those demanding the implementation of <Col N="1466" /> the Act.  It should be with the greatest shame that he sits silently in those benches to-night and his silence gives a complete admission of the failure of his Department to implement legislation which has received the wide approval of this House.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Agriculture &mdash;who was in charge of the Board of Works when steering this legislation through the House&mdash;said, and I have only read his words this evening, that it was his regret that such legislation was not presented and adopted by this House years before 1943.  It was in the hope that great things were going to be achieved as a result of the Arterial Drainage Bill that many Deputies from rural Ireland, like myself, pledged wholehearted and loyal support to that legislation when it was being enacted. But very few of us thought that it was another plan of the Government's to fool the people again and to fool this House.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary knows very little about drainage or realises the need for a complete drainage scheme, let him go to the offices of the <i>Irish Press</i> and find the papers of last September, which show photographs and headlines enough to convince him, from his own newspaper, of the great need for the implementation of the Act. During the end of last August and September and into October, thousands of people became homeless as a result of the very severe flooding, not alone in my constituency but throughout the whole country.  Deputy O'Higgins said he represented a two-county constituency, in one end of which was the Barrow and in the other end Ireland's largest river, the Shannon.</P>
    <P>The Cumann na nGaedheal Government, as has been pointed out, bravely undertook to carry out a comprehensive drainage scheme on the Barrow at a time when it was engaged in laying the foundations of the State.  It was bitterly criticised at the time for not carrying out further schemes on the Shannon and on other rivers by the henchmen, spokesmen, yes-men and back-benchers of the Government Party of to-day who were then holding nook-and-corner meetings and public meetings through the country, demanding <Col N="1467" /> that more drainage work should be carried out.  I did not agree with the policy of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government and could not, but no matter what may be said for or against it, it undertook at that time drainage work on one of the most important rivers in the State.  The present Government can function smoothly.  It has an over-all majority and is not up against hindrances of any kind and yet it absolutely refuses to implement the Drainage Act that was passed three years ago.  It is supposed to be the Bible for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  We were told at the time that it was going through the Dáil that its provisions would be put into operation without delay.  The hopes of those living in the flooded areas were raised at that time, but now we discover that all that was said here about putting it into operation was just so much gas.  The promises that were made have turned out to be false ones.  The Government has failed to do any drainage work under that Act or to implement its provisions.  Not a bit of drainage work has been carried out since the Act was passed in 1943.  One would imagine that since then some indication of Government policy on the matter would be given. I imagine, however, that the present Parliamentary Secretary or somebody else in that office will, say, in two years' time&mdash;about six months before a general election takes place&mdash;make a statement indicating that the Act is going to be operated. That will be done to raise the hopes of the unfortunate people who have been fooled on more than one occasion.  I want to tell the Parliamentary Secretary now that that is not going to be so.</P>
    <P>As regards drainage, we have in my constituency one of the worst areas in the country.  The River Nore causes severe flooding in a large portion of Laoighis.  Its banks burst last year and the year before.  The crops and the adjoining land were ruined. Within the last two months an eminent churchman told me that, due to the flooding in the River Nore, 74 families <Col N="1468" /> in the City of Kilkenny were compelled to leave their homes.  That is a thing which the Parliamentary Secretary, the Board of Works or any member of the Government Party cannot be proud of. It is an appalling state of affairs in any city.  The men responsible for it are silent.  At the other end of my constituency the farmers and the smallholders on the banks of the Shannon are also suffering severely because of the failure to carry out drainage work. They held a meeting and decided to draw the Government's attention to the seriousness of the situation.  The meeting was held in Banagher which suffers severely from the flooding.  I was not able to attend the meeting&mdash; due to illness or an engagement elsewhere. Deputy O'Higgins, Deputy Davin and Deputy Boland were present.  The position with regard to the flooding was fully discussed and reviewed.  It was decided to appoint a deputation consisting of Deputy Boland, Deputy O'Higgins, Deputy Davin and Deputy Beegan, who were to be accompanied by a number of small farmers, to wait on the then Parliamentary Secretary and discuss the seriousness of the situation with him. He is now Minister for Agriculture. The meeting arranged for the deputation did not come off.  The Parliamentary Secretary, in reply to questions at the time which were raised in the Dáil, said that nothing could be done with regard to the Shannon.</P>
    <P>In order to save the supporters of the Government in Offaly from embarrassment in connection with that, the chairman of the Offaly County Council, a member of the Government Party in this House, called a meeting of the Fianna Fáil Comhairle Dáil Ceanntar.  It was held at Tullamore. He personally invited the Parliamentary Secretary to attend and hear the grievances of the Party concerned. The Parliamentary Secretary attended and met Deputy Gorry, a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  A number of local people were summoned to meet the Parliamentary Secretary.  The intention of Deputy Boland, in calling such a conference under the auspices of Fianna Fáil, was to prevent Deputy Davin, Deputy O'Higgins and myself from attending and of expressing our <Col N="1469" /> views on the matter&mdash;of pointing out to the meeting that it is the Government alone that is responsible for the appalling state of affairs that exists there.  Surely Deputy O'Higgins, Deputy Davin and myself were not going to lower our prestige by going into a building where a Fianna Fáil conference was in progress.  That was a wise move, so that the Parliamentary Secretary would not be faced with the awkward position of having to admit failure to three opposition Deputies who have the honour to represent that constituency.  If the Parliamentary Secretary at the time had a scheme prepared for the relief of these unfortunate people, he would have instructed Deputy Boland to invite the opposition Deputies, so that he would be in a position to say: &ldquo;The Government Party are alone responsible for bringing this measure of relief&rdquo;.  That would leave the opposition Deputies with very little to say.  Instead of that, the Parliamentary Secretary was relieved from the embarrassment of having to admit failure, and the usual promise was made of: &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;.  It will be done sometime when it comes to the turn of the Shannon.  If it takes three years to decide whether they should start on this scheme or not, I wonder when it will be finished.</P>
    <P>The Shannon is the largest and most important river in the country.  It needs to be attended to more than any other river.  The lands on the banks of the Shannon in Galway and Offaly are as highly valued as the most fertile lands in Meath, despite the fact that they can only be used for two months in the year.  For the remaining ten months they are under water. The Parliamentary Secretary should know that cattle contract fluke if they are put on waterlogged lands. Therefore, these lands are absolutely useless to the people in the Shannon area.  At the present time live stock are dying from hunger and cold in that area because there is not a fork-full of dry hay to give them in this terrible weather, as the hay crop was swept away completely by the very severe flooding which occurred last autumn.  That state of affairs should bring home the seriousness of the <Col N="1470" /> situation to the Parliamentary Secretary and the need for implementing the legislation which has been passed.</P>
    <P>Previously, severe floods occurred in that area.  In June, 1929, there was serious flooding there and again in 1933.  In 1933, the Fianna Fáil Party promised to have the whole of the Shannon area drained, but the flooding is still going on and the unfortunate people in the area are suffering severely as a consequence.  The chief cause of the serious flooding lies between Meelick and Athlone.  As if the neglect of the Government to have the Shannon drained was not bad enough, on top of that we have the Electricity Supply Board erecting dams on the Shannon to hold the water back, thus adding to the flooding.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary know that, owing to the Electricity Supply Board regulations, the Shannon between Meelick and Athlone can rise almost two feet in 24 hours&mdash;one foot nine inches to be exact?  As I have already pointed out, for ten months of the year these lands are under water&mdash;there is an ocean of water there.  Notwithstanding that, the Offaly County Council do not neglect to send the rate collectors round to demand rates from these unfortunate people on land that is useless to them.  When I was learning Christian doctrine I was given to understand that there was such a thing as restitution.  I say that the Government are bound to make restitution for taking money by way of rates or taxes from these unfortunate people, because it amounts to absolute robbery.  It may be legal but, in accordance with Christian teaching, restitution should be made.  It is absolute robbery to take rates from these unfortunate people for lands that are completely covered with water for ten months of the year.</P>
    <P>When the Grand Canal Company had porter barrels upset out of a boat near Banagher about three years ago, within 24 hours the Shannon was lowered in order to recover the barrels.  Surely when the Shannon can be lowered and the Electricity Supply Board regulations put aside in order to find porter barrels, the least that might be expected is that it could be lowered to relieve the flooding on the lands of unfortunate <Col N="1471" /> rate-payers who are being mulcted in rates and allowed to suffer damage from the appalling state of affairs in that part of the country.  The Parliamentary Secretary may say that this cannot be avoided, that the Electricity Supply Board must hold back the water, but the committee in charge have expert advice that there is a fall of 140 feet between Meelick and Ardnacrusha. I cannot find words sufficiently strong&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They should hide their heads with shame when they see the miserable condition of these small holders who are trying to eke out an existence on these lands in Galway and Offaly.  The Shannon is not the only <Col N="1472" /> river responsible for flooding in the Midlands.  Even the own of Clara, which is many miles from the Shannon, was completely flooded last year.  As a consequence, the workers found it impossible to get to the jute factory. In one district there, the people were compelled to leave their homes, and I saw the flood almost reaching to the top of a churn in a dairy.  Live stock and hay were lost there and there would have been loss of life were it not that the residents of Clara placed their homes at the disposal of the unfortunate people who were flooded out.</P>
