      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that fuel merchants interpret paragraph (6) of Article 3 of the Fuel (Rationing for June and July, 1947) Order, 1947, as prohibiting the delivery of turf ordered, but not delivered, during the previous rationing period; that, according to this interpretation, consumers who were unable to obtain delivery, before 31st May, 1947, of turf ordered by them early in April, 1947, are now unable to obtain delivery of this fuel at any time; and whether he will consider amending the Order so as to permit delivery, in a subsequent rationing period, of fuel ordered in the preceding period, where it is known that the delay in making delivery arises from the inability of the fuel merchants to execute orders promptly.</P>

      <P>The interpretation of paragraph (6) of Article 3 of the Fuel (Rationing for June and July, 1947) Order, 1947, referred to by the Deputy is correct.  The principle involved is well established and a similar provision appears in all previous fuel rationing Orders.  I do not consider it desirable to amend the existing Order in the manner suggested.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed that exceptional weather conditions recently interfered with the normal running of the coastwise tanker which services Cork with petroleum products.  A tanker landed a cargo of oil in Cork on the 4th instant, however, and a further cargo was loaded at an English port last week-end for delivery in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the tanker's services, road and rail transport are used for the transport of oil in the Cork area. I understand that the whole-time service of 30 rail tank cars would be required to deal with the full requirements <Col N="1376" /> of the Cork area.  There are, however, only 80 such cars available for motor spirit for the whole country and it is impossible for the companies to divert additional rail tank cars during such time as the coastwise tanker is operating to the other ports serviced by it, namely Foynes and Sligo.  The companies inform me that they have now received additional coastwise assistance from English ports for Cork City and Dublin and that with the better weather conditions likely to prevail during the coming months improved running will be obtained from the tanker which is permanently at their disposal.</P>
    <P>I have several times impressed on the companies that it is an obligation on them to provide adequate storage and transport facilities to secure the prompt distribution of supplies and I have been assured that they are taking every step towards this end.  They claim that their difficulties are due to the shortage of tanks, which have to be imported, and I have offered to give them all the assistance in my power to secure supplies of tanks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephHallide" hpid="Mr. Halliden Mr. Halliden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that while petrol was extremely short in Cork City and County, it was available in plentiful quantities in Kerry and Limerick?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite likely.  I have explained that the shortage in Cork was due to the fact that the tanker bringing supplies was held up by bad weather.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider it just that one section of industrialists&mdash;the agricultural community&mdash; should be compelled by law and fines to provide essential foodstuffs for the people and they have no guaranteed profits, while the distributors of oil, petrol and kerosene have a guaranteed profit and are not compelled to carry out their functions to the community? Does the Minister think that that differentiation between one class of industrialists and another is just?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether suppliers of milk to co-operative creameries are entitled to a ration of creamery butter; the extent of such ration; whether it is given irrespective of the quantity of milk supplied to the creamery or of the fact that the supplier may retain, for his own use, a portion of his normal supply; the quantity of creamery butter issued, in respect of such rations, during 1946; and the <Col N="1378" /> steps which have been taken to ascertain the extent to which the butter issued in respect of this ration is, in fact, required for the domestic purposes of those to whom it is supplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>To encourage milk suppliers to send the maximum quantity of milk to creamery societies for the production of butter they are given a special allowance of creamery butter in lieu of the ordinary domestic ration.</P>
      <P>Butter permits are issued each month by my Department to creamery societies for a global quantity of butter for distribution to their milk suppliers and there are two bases of allocation for these permits which were agreed with representatives of these societies:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  a maximum monthly quantity equivalent to the sales of butter to milk suppliers by creamery societies in August, 1942, which was adopted as a datum period, subject to a reduction of 10 per cent. in December and a reduction of 20 per cent. in each of the months January to April, inclusive, or</P>
      <P>(2)  where the sales of butter by creamery societies in August, 1942, were below normal a maximum monthly quantity representing an average weekly allowance of 12 ounces of butter per head for each milk supplier and individual members of his household.</P>
      <P>In view of their local knowledge and in order to conserve supplies to the fullest extent possible, the distribution of butter to individual milk suppliers is left to the discretion of creamery societies and I believe that they take all factors into consideration including the quantity of milk supplied to them by individual milk suppliers.</P>
      <P>The quantity of creamery butter allowed under permit to creamery societies in 1946 for distribution to their milk suppliers was 118,000 cwts. and the numerous surveys made by my Department revealed no grounds for thinking that creamery societies do not restrict the issue of butter to their milk suppliers to the quantites required by them for domestic use.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that the proposed closing of the railway stations at Inch and Camolin, County Wexford, is a matter of grave concern to the local inhabitants, as serious loss and inconvenience will result; and if, in view of the fact that Inch Station serves a wide area for dairying and the supply of milk to Dublin, and that Camolin is an important centre for beet-growing and livestock production, he will direct Córas Iompair Éireann to re-examine the position with a view to keeping both stations in use.</P>

I would ask the Minister to use his influence to see that these stations are not closed.  Camolin Station serves an important agricultural district.  A lot of timber leaves that station and if the station is closed, it will result in great hardship to the people of the area.  It is not a sign of prosperity to see stations closing.</P>

      <P>This is a rather serious situation.  I should like to know, if legislation is required, when does the Minister intend to introduce that legislation?  The present position means that the ratepayers are losing £1,200 a year.  It is an anomaly to have a man drawing a pension for a job he still holds.  The fees amounted to £1,200 and he is drawing a pension of £150.  It would be a joke if it were not such a serious matter.  If the Minister says that it is necessary to have legislation introduced to deal with the matter, I should like to know when he proposes to introduce that legislation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, the Presidential Establishment (Amendment) Bill, is being introduced for the purpose of making an increase in the allowance for expenses of the President.  There is no change being proposed in the personal remuneration of the President but it is proposed to increase the personal allowances by 30 per cent. over the figure that was fixed in 1938.  As Deputies are aware, increases have been granted in salaries and wages generally throughout the community.  Deputies have agreed from time to time to certain increases in salaries, ranging from a minimum of 25 per cent. to 60 and 70 per cent.  Last week they agreed to increases for judges of 30 per cent., 25 per cent., 20 per cent., and so on.  We are not asking, and do not propose to ask, the Dáil in this Bill to increase the personal remuneration of the President which will remain as fixed in 1931.  It is considered necessary, however, to increase the allowances that were given to the President in 1938 for running his establishment. Since that date, as Deputies know, the expenses of running any establishment have gone up and, particularly, as the President has duties to perform which he cannot avoid and as it is necessary to have certain staff, the Government thought it wise to propose that his allowance for this purpose should be increased by 30 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We regard the proposal to increase the expenses of the Presidential establishment at the present time as a piece of inflammatory folly.  In announcing their intention as they did, first and only to the Press on Wednesday night last, we consider that the Government were guilty of an outrage <Col N="1392" /> both on Parliamentary practice and manners.  Only through the Press did any Leaders or any member of the House here learn that the Government had intentions in this matter and since the announcement was made by the Government to the Press no Leader or no member of the House outside the Government Party has had the courtesy of any intimation in the matter from the Government.  We know of no circumstances that would warrant the expenses of the Presidential establishment being increased to-day.  We know of no inquiry having been made into the matter that would disclose the necessity for such increase.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office is supposed to be above and beyond Party.  The prestige of that office may be of importance.  That has not yet disclosed itself.  But in the country's present circumstances that the Government should on their own initiative agree to or propose or suggest that the expenses of the President's establishment should be increased, can do nothing but injure the prestige of that office and, perhaps, degrade it in the minds of the people who are suffering very serious disabilities at present.</P>
      <P>So far from proposing an increase in the cost of such establishment to-day, the present general circumstances of the country would rather suggest that an attempt should be made to reduce the expenses of that office, if not as a relief to the people bearing the burden of present-day taxation, as a headline inducing people to a certain amount of commonsense and a certain amount of economy in the carrying on of their affairs.  We consider that the proposal is quite unwarranted, unreasonable and thoughtless.  We oppose a Bill that would do these things.  Again, we protest that the only information we have of what is in this Bill that enables us to object to it at this particular time is that a communication was made on last Wednesday night by the Government to the Press without any reference to any other Party in the Dáil, although the Presidential Office is supposed to be above and distinct from any Party question here.</P>

      <P>This Bill proposes to increase the allowances to members of the Dáil and Seanad by 30 per cent. As Deputies are aware, the allowances to members of the Dáil and members of the Seanad were fixed in 1938.  The Government has thought it wise to make the proposal to the Dáil that these should now be increased, in view of the increase in costs since then on members in carrying out their functions, by 30 per cent.  As Deputies are aware, a recent increase was made in the salaries of civil servants and of members of the judiciary.  This 30 per cent. is considered appropriate in the case of members of the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second purpose of the Bill is to enable members to use their cars more freely than they have been allowed to use them heretofore.  Under the existing law a member could not get more for the use of his car than first-class train travelling would cost, if the train was running along the route to Dublin. It is considered advisable in these modern days that, in the case of <Col N="1395" /> Deputies who have cars and who want to get quickly to Dublin and want to get home quickly to attend to their business, facilities should be open to them to use their cars, and they should get the appropriate mileage allowance. We should not compel them to travel by train or penalise them by giving them only the train level of expenses if a train were running along the route.</P>

      <P>I oppose the introduction of this measure.  The manner of the publication to the Press by the Government on Wednesday night last of proposals affecting the allowances to Deputies and Senators was extraordinary and, from a Parliamentary point of view, was, in my opinion, an outrage.  Neither House of the Oireachtas had the courtesy of any communication in the matter from the Government, and as far as I know no leader, and no member of any other Party but the Government Party, had received any information about the matter.  This is all the more extraordinary when it is recalled that the increases in the allowances of Deputies which were given in 1938 were given contrary to a recommendation of a committee which had considered that matter.  The giving of those increases evoked much disagreement in the House here.  This committee also recommended that Senators' allowances be reduced from £30 a month to £20 a month, a recommendation that was not at that time acted upon, nor has it been acted upon since.  I have not had a single word of representation during the last seven years from anybody that their allowances as Deputies are not sufficient or that their outgoings, arising from their political work, have increased in any way, or had made things any more difficult for them. Even if they had, the present is not the moment to increase allowances, and particularly without any kind of examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is impossible to understand this proposal in view of the attitude taken by the Government on so many questions of distress arising out of to-day's conditions.  At the time when the Government's intentions were being <Col N="1396" /> communicated to the Press on Wednesday last, the Dáil was engaged here discussing difficulties caused by the fact that to-day comparatively heavy income-tax charges fall upon persons with a standard of living not chargeable with income-tax pre-war.  The massed vote of the Government Party went into the Lobby that night to prevent the necessary increased relief asked for in respect to children being given.  This year is a critical one, both in our social and economic history. Everywhere, even amongst those who are happy enough to be employed, there is discontent and there are many evidences of social unrest.  Our Irish Parliamentary institutions of to-day were built up by people who had in their heart &ldquo;the sacred flame of faith, of ideals and of readiness for sacrifice&rdquo; mentioned the other day by Our Holy Father the Pope as being essential if the difficulties in the world to-day are to be surmounted and safely faced.  Our Irish future can only be faced by hard work and by mutual understanding and this is particularly necessary between the representatives of the people in Parliament and of the people as a whole. If Deputies are not going to make some sacrifices to-day&mdash;and it is not particularly clear that they are being asked to face sacrifices very much greater in their work than they were prepared to face pre-war&mdash;how can the ordinary citizens, who assist in political and social work, or who face their own domestic responsibilities, be expected to shoulder with courage and faith the troubles, the inconveniences and the sacrifices that their work, both in the home and in public, undoubtedly involves?  So many people have got rich and powerful through political influence in recent years in Ireland that unless those in the political front line&mdash;Deputies and Senators&mdash;are prepared to show that they can make sacrifices, there will be a tendency to root deeper into the public mind that suspicion which is now strongly, if unjustly, held, that Irish politics has become the happy hunting ground of the mere self-seeker.</P>
    <P>Even if an increase in Deputies' allowances were actually warranted by <Col N="1397" /> conditions to-day, and if they were shown to be so warranted on examination, the circumstances of the time are such that they ought not to be given. It has been repeatedly emphasised both in statements made here in the House and in reports made for the information of the House that there is no clement of salary and no element of compensation for the consequential loss in the allowances paid to Deputies.  If there is a question of public policy, and if anyone desires to raise that question, then it should be raised in the most public way, and it should be given the fullest public inquiry.  There should be an opportunity for the fullest possible public discussion of it.  The proposals as published in the Press by the Government on Wednesday night last are unacceptable to us and they are being opposed.</P>

      <P>I resent very much that a matter of this kind, containing this proposal, should be given to the Press without any intimation even to the Leaders of Parties.  I received none until I saw to-day's Order Paper.  That seems to me to be very high-handed on the part of the Government&mdash;to adopt the attitude that Deputies are clamouring for increases in their Parliamentary allowances and also in their expenses.  I would like to ask the Minister if representations have been made by the members of the Fianna Fáil Party or the members of any other Party in the House that the Parliamentary allowance at present payable is insufficient?  Has the Taoiseach been <Col N="1398" /> notified by any Deputy that he would be forced to resign his membership of this House because his Parliamentary allowance and his travelling allowances were insufficient on the present scale? I have received no such representation from any member of my Party, and I take it from Deputy Mulcahy's speech that he has received none from the members of his Party&mdash;that is, that the present allowance is insufficient.  The Minister has not intimated that he has received any such notice from any Deputy of the House no matter what Party he belongs to&mdash;the intimation that his present allowance is insufficient to meet his expenses.  I want to say to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Finance that, as Leader of a Party, my expenses are heavier, I believe, than the average Deputy's.  I wish to say this that if I thought that the present allowance of £40 a month was insufficient to meet my expenses, I would resign.  I hold that they are quite sufficient, that they are sufficient for the average Deputy, and I only wish that the Minister, when he is adopting the rôle of dispenser of public money, would take into account some other very deserving sections of the community such as old age pensioners and the lowest paid grade of workers.</P>

The Party as a whole has not had an opportunity of sitting on this question, but I have no hesitation in adopting the same attitude as I adopted when this matter was before the House in 1938, and when we had a free vote of the House.  The matter was very dispassionately discussed then and it was agreed that an increase was due to the Deputies if they were to do their duties correctly by the people irrespective of its being questioned whether they were well circumstanced in the world's goods or not.  Some of us then adopted the attitude that lack of other means should not prevent a person from becoming a Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1938.  This Bill proposes to increase the salaries of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries and officers of the Dáil and Seanad.  The salaries of the Taoiseach and the Attorney-General will be increased under the Bill by 20 per cent., the salaries of Ministers and the Ceann Comhairle by 25 per cent. and the salaries of the <Col N="1401" /> Cathaoirleach, Leas - Chathaoirleach, Parliamentary Secretaries and Leas-Cheann Comhairle by 30 per cent.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy and the Leaders of the various Parties have emphasised that they were not consulted regarding these measures and I am glad they have brought out that point.  The Government, in the last few months, have introduced and put through various increases in salaries of servants of the State which they considered wise in the public interest.  As the executive authority, it was their duty to propose and to put these through, and, before arriving at that conclusion, they did not consult the members of the Opposition about them. I thought it was advisable, when the Government decided to make these proposals to the Dáil, and as the Taoiseach had answered a Parliamentary question on the matter a couple of weeks ago, to give certain essential particulars of the proposed legislation to the papers, so that they would know what the Bills were about when notification of their First Reading was given.  It is the Government's duty in the public interest to make such proposals, from time to time as they think wise, and the Government have decided that it is in the public interest that the salaries of the officers in this Bill and in the other Bills should be increased by the amounts I have indicated.</P>
      <P>The salaries and allowances of these officers and of members of the Dáil and Seanad were fixed as far back as 1938. I do not want to make a Second Reading speech on this matter, but the calculations made by Deputy Mulcahy to-day that the allowances of members of the Dáil and Seanad are as good now as they were then is somewhat new in debates on increases of salaries and Government expenses generally.  In this matter, the Government have decided that it is in the public interest to make these proposals and, having arrived a that decision, they do not propose to shirk carrying it out.  As the Government responsible for making propositions in the public interest, they do not propose to share their responsibility with the Opposition.</P>

      <P>The Government Party have up to the present endeavoured to mix a very considerable amount of hypocrisy and concealment with the question of Minister's salaries. Nobody in the country minimises the responsibilities that a Minister bears, or the amount of very important work he is called upon to do, and no one will challenge the paying of adequate remuneration to a person occupying such a responsible office.  There should, however, be no change in Ministerial salaries until the full value of the total Ministerial income, in both salary and emoluments, is ascertainable and clear to the taxpayer.  At the present time, it is not so clear.  The salary of a Minister is £1,700 a year, with certain pension provisions, but, in addition, there is an unlimited transport service provided for any purpose for which the Minister may require it&mdash; public, personal, family or Party purpose. It includes the provision of a car, the provision of chauffeurs, the provision of petrol and other running expenses.  The annual cost of such a service must exceed £1,000 a year.  The Taoiseach, on the other hand, receives but a car allowance of £350 per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1937 Committee recommended that allowances would be paid to the Leaders of two Opposition Parties to provide secretarial and other assistance for the doing of general Parliamentary work of the Opposition.  The Government announced last Wednesday, without any reference to us, that they proposed to increase these allowances. I have not been consulted in the matter.  I consider the proposals are entirely unwarranted.  Somewhere in the general proposals the Government are now making there may be some central idea, but it is very hard to find. If the proposals to make these general increases are put forward thoughtlessly <Col N="1403" /> or just for some rule of thumb purpose, I consider that they should be dropped, but if they are made with premeditation, there are implications in them which must be examined into and explained.  In the meantime, the proposals as published by the Government are not acceptable to us.  We consider that Ministers should be adequately paid, but we consider, as I say, that their income should be clearly ascertainable and should be made clear to the taxpayer.  That is not so to-day.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in moving the First Reading of this Bill, gave a rather lame explanation of why he gave the information to the Press rather than by direct communication to the various Deputies.  I wish to put my view to the Minister that, in overriding the Dáil and giving the Press precedence over the members of the House, he is overriding the people who sent every Deputy here, and I want to emphasise to the Government that such action as that should definitely be discouraged for the future. With regard to pressing this matter to a vote, it appears from what the Minister said that he is determined to steamroll this Bill through with his majority.  I do not know whether the Leader of the Opposition intends to press for a division or not, but I want it to go on the records of the House that I dissent from the introduction of this Bill, as does my Party, and I ask the Leader of the Opposition, if it is his intention to press it to a division, not to waste the time of the House in doing so, in view of the fact that Fianna Fáil are determined to steam-roll it through, but to let us proceed <Col N="1404" /> with the important business before the House.</P>

      <P>In connection with this Bill, as in connection with the legislation introduced last week to increase the salaries of judges, the case, I suppose, will be made that the value of money has depreciated.  If that is the case for the Bill, I think it is not a justifiable one for introducing permanent legislation of this kind, because, while the cost of living may be high at the moment, it is more than likely there will be a substantial reduction in the near future and the value of this increase will, therefore, be much greater than what is proposed.  I think it is an outrage on the taxpayers and on the distressed and destitute section of our community to introduce a Bill of this kind.  It is an outrage on hard-pressed industries and particularly on agriculture.  It is particularly an outrage on agriculture that the very week the introduction of this legislation was announced through the Press we had a drastic reduction in the price of pigs.  The price of pigs has to go down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House adjourned on the last day, I was speaking on this amendment.  The case that had been made on the amendment by the Minister was that, first of all, it is not so significant so far as the amount it brings in is concerned.  The Minister told us the amendment would mean a loss to the State of about £120,000 in the year.  It is quite clear how to make up one-third of that on other measures introduced to-day if they were sent back, so that the loss would be reduced to £50,000 or £60,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Particular attention was directed to excess corporation profits tax, which amounted to very many millions, as confessed in the accounts presented. Those who were liable for that tax <Col N="1407" /> were allowed to pocket a certain amount of the money which they made by charging extra prices.  In addition, there was the question of evasion. There was a considerable amount, but whatever it was, it was last year handed back to those who previously had paid it.  I have even introduced for comparison here the tale of the five drapers in the City of Dublin, some of whom had losses and some gains, but balancing all out, the five had between £5,000 and £6,000 profit for a particular year.  Four years later, after payment of tax, it was discovered that they had accumulated £82,000 profits.  That was after paying tax&mdash;after paying some of the heavier taxes imposed.  They have been enabled to make all that out of the pockets of the public and the Minister last year gave them a present of whatever these firms were paying in excess corporation profits tax.</P>
    <P>In opposition to that we have put a deserving class of people who had been induced to get a stake in the country. The most valuable stake is to have a place in which they can live and bring up families&mdash;a house that will be the centre of their family life.  We ask for the remission of this tax which was introduced simply because it was one more method of bringing in a little more money.  I pointed out the last day&mdash;and I fancied the figures would be questioned&mdash;that previously, before a tax of this type was paid on house property, there had been a statutory allowance for repairs amounting to one-sixth.  Since Fianna Fáil came to control matters, that allowance was removed and people were made pay income-tax, not alone on the poor law valuation of the premises but on that valuation increased by one fourth.</P>
    <P>The difference between the amount which a person pays now as opposed to what he used to pay when he got the benefit of the one-sixth for repairs, and paid only on the valuation, less that, is 50 per cent. up and my calculation on that&mdash;and I do not think it can be gainsaid&mdash;is that instead of at the 6/6 rate, people are actually being asked to pay at the rate of 9/9 on house property.  That is very near the British rate and that is something <Col N="1408" /> scandalous.  Whatever might be said for this in the days when other people were being made pay income-tax, surtax, corporation profits tax and excess corporation profits tax, nothing can be said for it now, when the Government can treat so well people who are better able to bear the burden of taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I proposed this amendment last week and I listened to the Minister's attempt to justify the retention of this tax.  May I recount, for the information of the Minister and those on the benches behind him, that what I am proposing in this amendment is to relieve the owner occupiers of houses of this artificial figure, this 25 per cent., which was added by the Minister's predecessor to the full poor law valuation of houses for income-tax purposes?  The Minister sees nothing wrong in it.  Not only does he not see anything wrong in the principle or in the imposition itself, but it commends itself to him entirely.  If, to-morrow, the Dublin Corporation or any other local authority proceeded to make the occupiers of houses or tenements pay their rates, not on the total poor law valuation but on that valuation plus an imaginary figure of 25 per cent., there would be an outcry in this country and every ratepayer would be up in arms against it.  But in principle it would be no different from the proposal brought in by the Minister's predecessor, and which we are now trying to get wiped out.</P>
      <P>I have in this amendment deliberately restricted this matter to the person who owns and occupies his house.  The amendment, even if it were accepted by the Minister and carried by the House, would not undo entirely what the Minister's predecessor has done. There can be no justification for creating an imaginary valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remember the people you are penalising in the main&mdash;people who have made immense sacrifices to become owners of their own houses and who continue to make great sacrifices to pay off amounts which they borrowed in order to purchase these houses. Remember the circumstances in which <Col N="1409" /> we are continuing to do this, circumstances in which it is utterly impossible for any person to rent a house, in which any person who wants to have a roof over his head, must purchase a house. He is not only paying a very much increased rate on its full valuation but we are continuing to ask him to pay taxes not only on the full valuation but on the full valuation plus one-fourth.  I think as I said in introducing the amendment that this is an outrageous provision.  I do not think it could be justified in any way whatever.  The Minister attempted to justify it but it was a very poor attempt.  That is no reflection on the Minister; I think it would be impossible for any person to make a good or convincing case for it. I only regret that I cannot convince the Minister of its injustice.</P>
    <P>I was always opposed to this provision from the first day it was introduced. My opposition to it has grown as my knowledge of the way in which it bears on people has become greater. Many men in this city who, in order to get a home of some sort, had to undertake the responsibility of purchasing a home, have complained to me bitterly of the many charges which have to be met by the owner of a house, so much so that the average wage-earner or salary-earner finds himself in the position to-day that, having purchased a house, even where he is in a position to purchase it outright out of his own <Col N="1410" /> savings without borrowing, the various costs which have to be met by way of rates, income-tax and so forth are greater than the amount at which a similar house could be rented a few years ago.  I think if we have any belief in the sort of talk we indulge in from time to time about our being anxious to give our citizens an interest or a stake in the country, one thing we ought to do is to make it easy rather than difficult for a man to become the owner and remain the owner of his own house.</P>
    <P>I would press the Minister to reconsider his position in this matter.  The Minister has told us that the amendment would cost something in the neighbourhood of £100,000.  That gives us some idea of the imposition which this additional 25 per cent. puts on house owners.  It gives us an idea of it particularly when we bear in mind that it is going to cost, according to the Minister, over £100,000 to give partial relief from this additional 25 per cent. because my amendment would not cover all those who have had to suffer under that additional 25 per cent. One hundred thousand pounds is, I suppose, even in these days a very substantial sum of money but it is inconceivable to me that if the Minister wanted to make a saving of £100,000 out of £70,000,000, that he would not be able to do so.  I believe he would.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section, in line 41, the following words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and sub-section (4) of Section 36 of the Finance Act, 1941, shall be construed and have effect as if the words &lsquo;twenty-five per cent.&rsquo; were substituted therein for the words &lsquo;five per cent.&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>During the course of the Second Reading of this measure I indicated certain proposals which I thought should in justice be carried out in regard to the provisions in reference to corporation profits tax, particularly in those cases where the employee of a company reached the position of trust and responsibility of being a managing director of that concern.  Under the law as it stands at the moment, if that managing director gives the whole of his time to working in the interests of the company where he very probably or possibly has worked from the ground floor up and where he invests his savings in that company, if he owns more than 5 per cent. of the shares of that company, the amount of his salary is not permissible by way of deduction from the amount of the company's assessment for corporation profits tax. The proposal in this amendment is that a director of that kind who gives the whole of his time to the affairs of the company should be allowed to own at least 25 per cent. of the shares and, if he does not own more than 25 per cent-of the shares, the salary he gets will be allowed as deduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I explained on Second Reading the attitude that I adopt towards excess profits of businesses, whether corporations or otherwise.  I endeavoured to suggest that it is not possible to found in reason any justification for a particular tax like corporation profits tax which in practice has been found to work injustice and has been for the last 27 years abolished in England.  If the Minister thought that the existing provisions of the income-tax code in reference to profits of business concerns, including concerns carried on by a corporation or by a company, were not adequate, then a new tax might be devised which would be more equitable in its incidence than corporation profits tax has proved to be.  Pending an examination of a proposal of that kind, I suggest to the Minister that he ought to allow the managing director who gives the whole of his time to the business in which he is interested the concessions that I ask for in this amendment.  It would appear that the existing provisions are designed to discourage the position of an employee becoming through his own efforts or on his merits the occupant of one of the chief executive or administrative positions in the company because, if he is not a managing director who owns a certain number of shares, then the remuneration he gets is permissible of reduction for income-tax purposes.  On the other hand, if he happens to be such an employee who works his way up to the position of <Col N="1413" /> manager or managing director, who gives the whole of his time in the interests of the concern in which he has such an obvious interest and who has invested his savings to more than 5 per cent. of the business, then the business is hit as against other concerns who adopt a different procedure.  There is no reason that can be ascertained in principle as to why there should be a distinction between a person of that kind and a person who does not give the whole of his time and who owns more shares than 5 per cent.  I suggest to the Minister that these proposals ought to be seriously considered.</P>

      <P>I would have been glad if Deputy McGilligan had answered Deputy Costello on my behalf on this matter.  The basis of this amendment seeks to take something from the tax which the State is drawing on corporation profits.  I know that Deputy Costello and most of the members of the Fine Gael Party were against excess corporation profits.  The excess corporation profits tax was dropped last year.  I was aware that there was a difference of opinion between Deputy McGilligan and the rest of the Party but I did not think Deputy Costello would go so far as to say that we should provide or so amend the application of corporation profits tax that it would be open to the directors by increasing their salaries, taking shares between themselves, to ensure that we would get none.  Deputy Costello is wrong in saying that there is no corporation profits tax in England. There was, during the war, a defence contribution which was applied in a somewhat similar way to our own corporation profits tax.  The name of the tax is now changed to &ldquo;profits&rdquo; tax. A year ago last autumn, in his special Budget, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said he was going to come forward with a new tax in substitution for excess corporation profits tax.  In his last Budget he brought forward a profits tax which is practically on all fours with our corporation profits tax. Deputy McGilligan to-day, and on other days, objected to the abolition here of excess corporation profits tax but if we are going to have a tax on profits that is somewhat fair and <Col N="1414" /> equitable, certainly this corporation profits tax is much fairer in its incidence than the excess corporation profits tax.  The corporation concerned could have been earning 50 per cent. on the capital invested yet have to pay no tax on its profits on foot of excess corporation profits tax.  If a concern that had made no profits prior to the war made a few per cent. it had to start to pay excess corporation profits tax on the excess.  The excess corporation profits tax would be unfair in its incidence if it were kept in being for a long time.  I regard the keeping on of this corporation profits tax in its present form as a substitute for excess corporation profits tax to a certain extent and it is a very much more equitable tax.  If I were to accept Deputy Costello's amendment, it would have the effect that a concern could avoid altogether the payment of corporation profits tax if it was a four-director concern and if each one of them held 25 per cent. of the shares. It would defeat altogether the purpose of the tax which I think is a reasonable and a fair one at the present time If anyone has a better one to suggest &mdash;one that would have a better effect &mdash;I am quite prepared to consider it. I do not think Deputy Costello's amendment would fill the bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it may be taken as an irrefutable conclusion that when the Minister says I say something that is contrary to what Deputy McGilligan says he has no real answer in principle to the amendment I proposed. There is no real difference in policy or detail between anything I say on this. tax and anything Deputy McGilligan has said in reference to profiteers.  I am in complete agreement with everything Deputy McGilligan has said and anything the Minister can say or suggest can in no way bring home any inconsistency between what I am saying and what Deputy McGilligan has said.  I gave the Minister his alternative to this&mdash;if we want to get more money out of business, get a more equitable tax.  I asked on the Second Reading of this measure for some justification in principle of this corporation profits tax.  Why is there a tax on a business that is carried out by a corporation <Col N="1415" /> or by a limited company when an individual carrying on the same business is not subject to the same tax? Why is there a distinction?  Why must a business be taxed which has carried on as a corporation and the same business carried on in partnership not be taxed?  Why is there no relationship between this tax and the amount of capital employed in the company?  I asked the Minister and I ask him again: can he give any principle underlying the imposition of this tax?  The income-tax can at least have some apparent justification by its being urged that those who have incomes can best afford to pay tax that is required for State affairs.  But what is the principle behind this?  What is the principle behind taxing a business that is carried on by a particular machinery when the same business, carried on in another way, is not?  Why is it that there should be, apparently (the Minister has not answered that point), some sort of discrimination in reference to this tax where the business of a company is carried on by a managing director who is an employee of the company and who puts his savings into that company&mdash;it is probably a limited company&mdash;when the same state of affairs would not arise if the person was merely a director drawing fees for doing nothing.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment.  I have listened to the Minister's remarks and it seems to me that the only justification he can find is that the corporation tax is paid by people who are able to pay it.  Deputy Costello wants to know how it is that a corporation is mulcted for this tax when an individual or individuals trading are not subject to the same tax.  The Minister seems to suggest that if he granted this some change could be made in the structure of the company. I would like to point out to the Minister that, in addition to the two classes mentioned, there is the third class, namely, the cooperative society, which does not pay income-tax at all.  You have got, therefore, on this scale the corporation that, presumably, has the thickest fleece.  It is mulcted more <Col N="1416" /> heavily than the individual trading on his own.  He is let off lightly, and the co-operative society does not pay any income-tax.  Is there any sense or justification in having three such variations in the case of people trading under this Bill?</P>

      <P>As regards this matter of excess corporation profits and of excess profits, I have always held it to be a scandal that when legislation was brought into this House by the Government in 1939 a promise was exacted from them that nobody would be allowed to make good out of the exigencies of the war and that the Government after that closed their eyes to the people who were not merely making good but who were advertising themselves as making good.  According to the Minister's predecessor in the Department of Finance and through the Revenue Commissioners' accounts it was made quite clear that those people were making millions.</P>
      <P>Last year we reached the point when we threw overboard the tax which was taking some part of what was called excess corporation profits from them. All that I know is that at the time we were supposed to be taxing these people rather heavily a little company which had made a loss of £1,400 in the year 1939 was discovered to be making a profit of £23,600 in 1943, and that after paying the tax.  Crowe Wilson made a profit of £7,485 in 1939, while in 1943 the profit had reached the figure of £15,777.  Pim Brothers suffered a loss of over £3,500 in the year 1939, but they had reaped a profit of £12,648 in 1943 after paying the tax.  Switzer and Company had a profit of almost £5,000 in the year 1939, and increased that to £12,000 in 1943.  Perhaps the best example of all that can be taken is that of Todd Burns.  They had a loss of almost £1,000 in 1939, but they were able to get themselves into the position in which they were able, even after the payment of this phenomenal tax, to have a profit of over £18,000.</P>

      <P>It does not say and the year does not matter.  I see that the year 1946 is referred to, but what is stated here is that in Eire, France, Czecho-Slovakia and Japan real wages have dropped below the 1939 level. That is a fact, and everybody knows it to be a fact.  We know that civil servants are not getting the purchasing power to-day that they had in 1937 and 1938.  Are the old age pensioners getting it?</P>

      <P>The Minister said that the statement was a statistical lie. I say it is true, and that it is true with regard to old age pensioners, civil servants and the different categories of workers.  The Minister knows that is a correct statement.  You have the contrast to make between the two situations: the workers whose real wages have fallen below the 1939 level, and this other group of people whose profits, after paying all tax, have gone up from £6,000 to £82,000.  Then we give them back part of the tax.</P>

    <P>As Deputies will see, there has been a change in this Vote, an increase of £10,000, which is largely due to the increases in salaries granted during the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the figure in which I am interested.  If the Minister looks at it, he will see that there is an increase of £9,000 over last year's figure of £77,000.  That would seem to be an increase of one-seventh. Is that the full increase to the Civil Service, or is there a further increase which is to be added?  I am interested in this because of the claims made that the £60,000,000 Budget is really only a £30,000,000 Budget.  If the impact on civil servants now is that those who used to enjoy £60,000 are only getting £77,000, I would like some explanation from the Minister, as that is a surprisingly low increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take it that it is 25 per cent.  If one takes the cost-of-living figure on which Civil Service emoluments used to be based, they would have got a much greater rise than the Minister shows here they have got.  There was a contract which the present Government broke with the people who had lived under it and who had been mulcted in part of their emoluments.  When the cost-of-living figure went down, they were made to pay the difference.  They were asked to hold on to that cost-of-living index figure, as being their sheet anchor when the storm came.  Then the rise in prices blew up and the cost-of-living figure disappeared and the contract based upon it was broken.  But leave that aside&mdash;imagine no contract with them, imagine it wiped out because they were the people closest to the Government's hand and the people most easily coerced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows, and official figures bear it out, that the index of wholesale prices shows an advance of a minimum of 100 per cent. over 1938. That shows that prices have doubled, not in this meagre list of commodities taken into the calculation in the cost-of-living index figure, but in the general range of commodities over the whole country.  The figures show more than 100 per cent. increase.  It was a little over 100 per cent. the last time I saw it and has certainly increased since then.  As opposed to the doubling of all items of expenditure, the Minister is content that the Civil Service must be satisfied if he gives them an increase of 25 per cent.  The people for whom I am speaking at the moment are the people most entitled to a fair deal on this point.  One could have imagined a situation developing in which, in order to avoid some sort of inflationary period, through the increased moneys being paid, the Minister would say: &ldquo;We will stop the effect that the cost-of-living index figure has upon Civil Service salaries and we will fund a certain <Col N="1423" /> amount of money for them, to be paid out as soon as we think that might be done without causing inflation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The fear of inflation was supposed to be the reason for this particular hardship put upon civil servants.  At the same time, when we were speaking of civil servants between them getting £1,000,000, we were allowing in over £13,000,000 in emigrants' remittances and £10,000,000 in tourist expenditure. Apparently they were not considered to be inflationary, either of them, but to give the Civil Service £1,000,000 was a type of inflation that was to be feared.  In any event, on an inflation fear being properly expressed and substantiated by figures, one could imagine some resort to a policy of funding the moneys taken from the civil servants, but, instead, we now find ourselves at a point when we are emerging from all the hardships which were definitely imposed on certain classes of the community during the war at which apparently the civil servants have been coerced into accepting some increase much less than what they were entitled to on the cost-of-living figure.  The Minister presents his Departmental service as getting, so far as this Vote is concerned, £1 in £10 of an increase &mdash;I am bulking the salaries together. I consider that that is an injustice and that greater injustice was done to the civil servants than to any other class. There was less case to be made against the payment of the money to them in respect of inflation than to any other class and&mdash;I come back to this&mdash; while all that was going on, while civil servants' wages were battened down, the drapers and all the other profiteers were being allowed to push their hands into the pockets of the people, including the civil servants.  They paid certain taxes the Minister imposed upon them and then blatantly secured for themselves fierce profits, with not a word said about them.</P>

      <P>I understand that a number of commodities are imported into this country the export of which from Great Britain and Northern Ireland is prohibited.  They are nevertheless imported and our revenue authorities give their co-operation and support to those engaged in that import.  That is a bad policy and makes for evasion of the tariff regulations, particularly on the Border.  The Border, as everyone will agree, is a curse from every conceivable angle and the sooner it is abolished the better, but, so long as it is there, the administration of the customs services on both sides will be facilitated by a certain measure of co-operation. So long as you have the officials of the Northern Ireland Govenrment assisting smugglers to outwit the officials of our Government, and the officials of our Government assisting smugglers to outwit the officials of the Northern Ireland Government, there can be no possible hope of dealing with smuggling operations along the Border.  It is a problem which ought to be tackled and tackled very vigorously.  If, as I understand, smuggling is very widespread along the entire length of the Border, it is bad from every point of view.  It may be that as a result of certain smuggling operations we may get into this country certain essentials which are necessary. But I think everyone will admit that smuggling is not a one-way traffic; that there is nobody smuggling commodities into this country who will not at the same time be engaged one way <Col N="1427" /> or another in smuggling certain essential goods out of the country.  Therefore I think that if you close your eyes to one type of smuggling operations, you are closing your eyes to a great extent to all these illegal operations, and I think the time has come, now that the war is over, for more rigid enforcement of the law in regard to the prohibition and the regulation of the transport of goods across the Border.</P>
      <P>I think it is acknowledged that there have been very wide evasions of the customs regulations and I think there has been a very considerable failure on the part of the Minister's officials to enforce these regulations.  There have been even, I think, grave breaches of the law by officials of the Minister's Department.  I should like when the Minister is replying if he would let us know whether during the past year officials of his Department have had to be dealt with in a disciplinary way for breaches of the customs regulations. I think it is a very important matter.  It affects not only the collection of duties and the prevention of illegal exports, but it also affects the morale of our people.  If smuggling on a widespread scale is allowed to continue it must inevitably have a very demoralising effect upon the entire community on both sides of the Border. In addition to that, it will be creating a very strong financial vested interest in the preservation of the Border.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his Budget statement mentioned that he did not fear a very serious illegal export of tobacco and cigarettes out of this part of the country as a result of the differentiation in the price here and the price in Northern Ireland.  I should like to know from the Minister what steps he has taken to prevent such illegal operations. I think it is a very important matter to have the law rigidly enforced in this connection, but I think it will be a very difficult matter so far as commodities like cigarettes are concerned where there is a big profit to be gained by illegal operations, and I should like to know if the Minister has taken any special steps to ensure that the law will be enforced.</P>

      <P>I want again to refer to this matter of salaries. According to this, the increase is £113,000 on a bill of over £1,000,000, that is about one-tenth.  I assume there were increases before.  The Minister tells me that the last increase given amounted to 25 per cent.  In any event, I want to get this clear.  There has been an increase in the numbers employed.  There are some 60 extra shown over last year.  It would appear that in 1938 or 1939 the salaries, wages and allowances were roughly about £800,000.  The sum is now to be £1,157,000.  That sum has a purchasing power of about £580,000.  The 2,500 civil servants employed in this Department have suffered a loss in purchasing power of the difference between £580,000 and £800,000, somewhere about £200,000.  There is no getting away from that.  There may be an argument as to whether we can afford to pay or not, but, in any event, that is the loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a group of 2,500 officials who were brought into the Civil Service on a contractual arrangement that they were to be preserved from the severity of any slump and were not to enjoy any boom.  Their salaries were to be smoothed out; they were to have an equitable course.  The secretary of the Department of Finance on one occasion boasted that the contribution of civil servants to the State under the cost-of-living bonus amounted over a certain number of years to £3,000,000. That is all very well.  We took £3,000,000 from them when the cost-of-living figure went down and we saved that to the State.  But when the cost-of-living figure began to go up, those who had been promised safeguarding from the severity of any slump were simply told that the contract was going to be broken, and broken it was.  For fear anybody would go to the courts to test that, we fortified that by legislation, by the type of legislation which could not be attacked upon Constitutional grounds. They were attacked just because, as I said, they lay nearest to the hand of the Government.  They were under the thumb and the control of those who were running the Government at the <Col N="1429" /> time.  They were simply told without any case being made in respect of these people, and certainly without any consideration of the advantages that previously had been derived by the State from the cost-of-living figure, that it had been decided that they were going to stop salaries being paid on foot of that figure.  There were some negotiations and the civil servants, apparently, have accepted some increase.  But the situation is clear that, without any argument being made, except that one made in the House about inflation, civil servants were told that they were not going to be allowed to get the benefits when they accrued to them from the contract, but they were made suffer when it was disadvantageous to them.</P>
    <P>In the Estimate for 1947-48 we are apparently to mulct them for the year in about £200,000.  I have compared that over and over again with the attitude of the Government not merely towards those who made profits and were told they could make profits, and those who were invited to make profits because they became tax collectors for the Government, but towards those whom the Minister's predecessor characterised as people who were making money out of the exigencies of the war situation, people whom he said he would use his best endeavours to stop.  When challenged in the Seanad as to whether he believed these people had made millions, he said he knew from the revenue accounts that they had made millions.  The case is therefore clear on both sides, that civil servants are being defeated in their just claims and other people were allowed to get away with the increased profits that the Government invited them to take.  That calculation leaves out altogether the matter of evasion. I mention all that because the Minister says when I make this type of speech that I do not appreciate the difficulty of finding money.  It is difficult to find money ordinarily.  But our Minister, who has thrown away the full amount of the excess corporation profits tax, should certainly have no difficulty in finding the odd part of £1,000,000 which is now required to give civil servants what they were entitled to.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1430" /> There is the other calculation which I have made before and which I want to repeat.  If one takes the six or seven years in which profits were made during the war, there was a vast fund of money piled up as earnings by people in business.  On the other hand, there was a very big withdrawal from people like civil servants, from the wage earners of the community, from professional men, and from middle-class people, of moneys to which they were justly entitled.  I think the people from whom the withdrawals were made could properly and justly claim that they should be given part of the moneys back and these should be scooped out of the fund.  These other people have advertised themselves as having made so much, but I will leave that question aside.  Cut the losses and leave the gains, in so far as they have been made in the war years, with the people to whom they were allowed and who got away with so much.  Let us recognise that there is hardship imposed on certain people, and that there has been an undeserved gain allowed to certain others.  Put them in a position of equality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was unfair of Deputy Cogan to make a general allegation against the officers of the Revenue Commissioners.  I think those officers are doing a good job.  They have, over the years, saved our people from the wholesale export of commodities that were in short supply here and they have enforced the law against those who sought to import illegally things that were subject to customs duty here.  If the Deputy has any particular matter in mind, or any information to give me, I am quite prepared to hear it, but I am not prepared to go into a general allegation that runs counter to my general knowledge of the matter.  These officers, rather than trying to facilitate smuggling into or out of the country, are doing their utmost to stop it.  In the year ended 31st March, 1945, upwards of 11,000 cases of smuggling (mainly export) were prevented by them and successful prosecutions followed in 654 cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy McGilligan's <Col N="1431" /> misstatements, we have gone over that ground frequently.  I pointed out that during this particular year we made reasonable increases in the salaries of the civil servants, which brought them to a minimum of 25 per cent. over pre-war. I do not propose to go into all the arguments Deputy McGilligan put forward as to where we should find the money to repay the civil servants what they lost under the standstill Order. It happens in life that changes occur, that certain sections of the community suffer for a while and then other sections of the community suffer for a while.  People in the course of business suffered during the slump that occurred after 1929 and at various other times.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan pointed out that some of the concerns that had been making profit during the war were suffering losses prior to the war.  No matter who they are&mdash;whether they are farmers, shopkeepers, lawyers, doctors or anybody else&mdash;people will not continue making losses.  They are all engaged in their professions or occupations in order to make a livelihood and to keep themselves and their families.  While I would like to stop a person making excessive profits, I do not want to stop anybody making a reasonable profit, one commensurate with the sacrifice he makes to keep the business going or to fulfil his daily obligations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what misstatements I am supposed to have made.  I allow for 25 per cent.  I take £1,000,000 in the column headed 1946-47 and I calculate that as being £800,000. A 25 per cent. increase would bring it roughly to the £1,000,000 that is here. I compare £578,000, which I say is the present purchasing power of £1,176,000, with the £800,000 that I assume these people were getting in the year 1938-39. It is then recognised, because there has been no attempt made to meet what I say, that 2,500 civil servants have suffered between them&mdash;the years have passed and they should have been getting increased emoluments&mdash;a loss of somewhere about £220,000.  I consider that is unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> I have heard only one argument put up about the standstill Order on the civil servants, and that referred to inflation. Questions were put here to find out what did the standstill Order mean, and the answer was given that it meant roughly £1,000,000 a year.  The civil servants, people in a special position, people with whom we had a very definite contract, a contract that we had used against them when the cost of living was falling, had to suffer.  The situation with regard to them was that if they got £1,000,000 extra there would be inflation. That argument went by the board when it was discovered that remittances from England ran to £13,000,000 in a particular year and tourists brought in £10,000,000.  Yet, in a year in which, from outside sources, £23,000,000 was being sent in here to be spent if the recipients decided to spend it, the civil servants were forced to take for themselves, and for the education of their families, whatever funds they had in the way of life insurance and anything else of that sort&mdash;they were forced to take out of these funds the £1,000,000 a year that they had lost.</P>
    <P>The pretence that if £1,000,000 was given to the civil servants it would cause inflation was paraded by a Government which admitted an inflow of £23,000,000 which they did not believe was causing any inflation.  I tried to bring the matter to a head one day by asking if the civil servants could be paid by means of the tourist money, which was somewhere insulated against causing inflation.  On the Minister's part there was first the denial that business people and industrialists were making money.  Then the Minister's predecessor gave that game away and we were given to understand that they had made millions.  He even proceeded by way of legislation to take some of what these people were making, but he made some distinction between the people who were getting increased profits.  As long as certain people were getting only the same rate of profit he apparently thought that was all right and he excluded them and then he put in a special clause with regard to those making extra and extortionate profits out of the exigencies of the war.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1433" /> The Minister has apparently a new excuse now.  Some people were making losses prior to the war and the Minister put forward the point that if a man had made a loss for a considerable period he might go out of business.  Remember all these people were not making losses. Arnott's made a loss of £1,500, but if their business in 1939 showed a loss of £1,500, is it necessary in order to keep Arnott's in business that they should make £23,000 later?  They declared no dividend in 1939 but later they were able to declare a dividend of 27 per cent.  Crowe Wilson's had not made a loss; they had made a profit of £7,000. Again, is it necessary to allow them, after tax had been deducted from their profits, to get to the point of making £15,750?  Todd Burns, who suffered a bit of a loss&mdash;it was not exactly £1,000 &mdash;got to the point of making a profit of £18,000 later.</P>
    <P>The Minister is very benevolent towards business people as he thinks they might go out of business. They are very lucky to have something to go out of.  What can the civil servant go out of?  What can the wage-earner go out of?   He goes out of this: he goes out of the payment of premiums on insurance; he takes his children out of the type of education he had thought of giving them.  He possibly takes, as I know happened in a certain case, furniture out of certain of his rooms and deprives himself of certain amenities.  While the going was good, he sold this furniture, sold some second-hand carpets in order to keep going.  The only other thing such a man could go out of was the ordinary comforts of life, even the necessities of life.</P>
    <P>I made a calculation recently arising out of what the Director of Statistics had pointed out in connection with the last census of production.  He said that the earnings in wages and salaries of the working classes, apart from those engaged in agriculture, amounted to £25,000,000.  Let us take it that that was the pre-war wage.  He was speaking of a date not exactly pre-war but pretty close to it.  I do not think there can be any gainsaying the fact that the £ now buys only 10/- worth as compared with pre-war.  That <Col N="1434" /> meant that these people instead of having a purchasing power of £25,000,000 have only half of that.  To counterbalance that reduction in their purchasing power, they got increases in salaries and wages of between one-fourth and one-third.  That does not bring them up to anything like the old £25,000,000 purchasing power.  The Minister said that Arnott and Co., Pim Bros. and Todd Burns might have had to go out of business.  What do we do to keep them in business?  The Government's attitude was: &ldquo;We will allow you to keep 50 per cent. of anything you make above a certain figure. Pay us half of it and you can keep the other 50 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to stress this to the Minister, that after that tax has been paid, the firm of Todd Burns which had suffered a loss of £1,000 in 1939, were enabled to make such profits that after making provision for whatever increases or bonuses they granted to their staffs and for increased rates, they were able to pay the taxation the Minister imposed on them and had then £18,000 to put away.  I consider that there is no line of equity as between the treatment of the professional class, the middle-class and civil servants on the one hand and this 10 per cent. of the community who have been allowed to get away with enormous profits during the war period.  I am leaving the question of evasion aside and there has been evasion.  Evasion is calculated at not less than 25 per cent. of the admitted profits.  Leaving that out of it, the position is that they have been able to make very big sums of money.  The Minister says that he would like to do better for the civil servants but that he has no fund out of which he could afford to do better.  He has plenty of funds if he looked for them in the proper quarter.</P>

      <P>Well, it has been going on for four years, and at least one generation of youths have passed on and ceased to be youths.  Most of them have passed out of the country. This commission, for which the Minister is looking for money in this Estimate, was set up over four years ago.  I want to know whether the Minister has any knowledge of what that commission has been doing for these four years.  I want to know has he any knowledge as to how far they have progressed in their work.  I want to know has he any information, or has he sought any information in arriving at the sum which it is proposed to provide in this particular Estimate, as to when they are likely to present their report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Have they finished taking evidence? Have they started preparing their report? If so, is the report nearly ready?  I take it from what the Minister has said that it has not yet been presented to the Government.  Has the Minister made any inquiries as to when it is likely that it will be presented to the Government?  We are <Col N="1437" /> not dealing here with ancient manuscripts as we are in other cases.  It may not make very much difference if many of the commissions do not report. There is a commission of one person that has been sitting for 10 years in the matter of Irish in the Civil Service. We are dealing with the youth of the nation.  That is a matter that we ought to concern ourselves about. The Minister ought not deal with that in an offhand way with a cheap gibe across the House to me for asking for information which not only am I entitled to ask for but for which it is my duty to ask.</P>
    <P>The problem is a big one.  It is an important one.  It is an urgent one. One generation has passed from the juvenile into the adult stage since this commission started their inquiries, and one has to say that a big number of them have passed out of the country. The Minister knows as well as I do that that is a very important matter. The Minister is as much aware as I am of the urgency of the matter, and I will give him the credit of being as interested in the matter as I am and in its outcome.  While making full and due allowance for the fact that those who constitute the commission are doing a very important and national work and are giving their time free, so far as I know, and, therefore, cannot be expected to sit as full-time members of a commission, one surely is entitled to ask, at the end of four years, what progress has been made and, in view of the urgency of this matter, the vital urgency so far as our youth are concerned, when we may expect to have a report presented to the Government and, in turn, presented by the Government to the House and to the country?</P>
    <P>That is, in my opinion, the most important matter that comes under this Estimate.  There is a Commission on Irish in the Civil Service, which was appointed in November, 1936, to plan and supervise the task of extending the use of Irish in the Civil Service.  This commission consists of one person.  It does not even consist of one person at the moment because the position is vacant but we are looking for £5 to keep the matter open.  I think the House is entitled to some explanation <Col N="1438" /> as to why space in this Book of Estimates is being occupied in this way.  Am I to take it that the sum asked for in respect of commissions and inquiries not specifically provided for, is for commissions that are in existence or commissions which are to be set up or which may be set up during the remainder of this year, or for both? Would the Minister be so kind as to tell us if there are commissions operating under this sub-head what those commissions are and how long they have been in being?  I want again to ask for information about this Youth. Unemployment Commission.  Four years is a long time.  It is a long time in the life of a youth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The sum asked for in respect of commissions and inquiries not specifically provided for is a sum that may be spent if commissions are set up during the year.  There are committees and commissions of that kind under contemplation.  It has not yet been definitely decided to appoint them but it is normal practice to make some such provision in the Estimate for anything that might occur during the year and any expenses that might be involved.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Irish in the Civil Service was more or less put out of operation owing to the emergency. The promotion of Irish is being carried on by the Departments themselves.  It may be that we would revive it more actively during the year and the provision of the sum of £5 in the Estimate will mean that we will have Parliamentary sanction for some expenditure under this head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey asked about the Commission on Youth Unemployment. The Deputy was rather indignant that this commission should not have reported before now.  From the reports that I have, they have been very active indeed.  The commission held 97 meetings up to the 7th May, 1947, and the various sub-committees have held in all 106 meetings.  I cannot say when the commission will report.  I understand that the collection of evidence is now virtually complete and I expect that it will take some time after the evidence has been collected, to frame a report. <Col N="1439" /> Very often, a commission takes as long in framing a report as in hearing evidence.</P>

I find in the Index to the Estimates a sub-head&mdash;Improvement of Milk Production&mdash;in the Vote for Agriculture but when I turned to that, again there was no inquiry or no expense for any inquiry with regard to milk.  I wonder has this inquiry faded out without making any report?</P>

      <P>I know it was asked to report on an urgent matter and the judge who presided over that insisted on evidence being produced right away.  If they did not sit four days a week they certainly sat three days a week in an effort to finish, and they were expected to report within a couple of months.  However, I will have to pursue it on some other Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Commission on Youth Unemployment, I am glad the point has been raised by Deputy Morrissey <Col N="1440" /> as to the date on which it was set up and as to the terms of reference of the commission.  I know nothing about what the commission is doing but I have had an opportunity of meeting certain people who appeared before it to give evidence and from what I hear from those sources it would appear that this commission has taken a very wide view of its terms of reference and is going into a very big variety of matters.  That makes me, like Deputy Morrissey, all the more anxious to get a report speedily from the Minister.  At the same time, recognising the extent of the terms of reference, one must always have understood and expected that the commission would be a long time in reporting. I do not think there is any cause for complaint in that connection.  The Minister should, however, have some better and more precise information as to whether they have actually finished the taking of evidence&mdash;of which I have some doubts&mdash;and whether they are preparing reports of an interim type.</P>
    <P>It is a report which I, personally, would not like to see hurried, recognising the amazingly wide terms of reference. One of the advantages Deputies of this House derive from reports of this type is that a vast amount of information is got together which is not ordinarily available to the ordinary Deputy.  The matter is a treasure-house from that time on in respect of such information.  I am hoping for some such results as this.  I hope the commission will thoroughly probe into such matters as the incidence of unemployment and the allied question of emigration which they certainly must consider, the whole question of standards of life in this country, and whether, under the lower value of money we have in the country at the moment, conditions have not steadily deteriorated. They will give us, based upon the evidence they take, information so that Deputies who are inquiring into such matters will not have to go any further than such report.  At the same time it leaves me open to be persuaded that they should not be hurried in attempting a task of the kind set to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that on a matter of this importance the <Col N="1441" /> Minister is not in a position to tell us whether this commission has or has not completed taking the evidence.  Like Deputy McGilligan, I do not wish to see a commission dealing with a matter so important as this hurried.  On the other hand, I do not want to see the commission dealing with a vital and urgent matter like this going so deeply and so fully into the matter that they will not be able to report until all the present-day youths have become middle-aged men, until even the infants of to-day will have ceased to be youths.  As far as the information some of us may hope to get from that treasure-house about which Deputy McGilligan talks, I think most of us will not be here to look into the treasure-house for the information. Four years is a long time.</P>
      <P>The Minister may talk as if he is entirely satisfied with 97 meetings&mdash; less than an average of 25 per year&mdash; dealing with a matter of this importance. Whether the commission confine themselves strictly within the terms of reference or not I do not know nor at the moment am I concerned, but if they have reached definite conclusions on certain aspects and if those conclusions would be of benefit to the Government in approaching even certain aspects of this matter of youths I would wish that we would see even interim reports rather than wait for another two, three, four or six years before we get the final report. We all know&mdash;the Minister as well as everybody else&mdash;that one of the great weaknesses in our national life in the last 25 years is the fact that we have boys and girls leaving school&mdash; boys particularly of 14, 15 and 16 years &mdash;reaching the age of manhood and womanhood without ever having learned to do a day's work, many of them never having done so.  That situation is continuing to the present moment.  We know the demoralising effect of idleness during that critical period of their lives.  It is because we can see that all around us, not only in the city but in the country towns and villages, that I stress the urgency of this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the plea that is being made to the Minister that he should press for an early report from <Col N="1442" /> this committee dealing with youth unemployment.  I understand that they have volumes of valuable information printed that would help to relieve the anxiety of parents who have unemployed boys and girls with nothing staring them in the faces but the emigrant ship.  In the past few years there appears to have been no planning by any authority whatsoever to deal with unemployed.</P>
      <P>Boys leaving school and young men leaving the Army wait a few weeks, knocking round the city or towns, and then they are told to join the Construction Corps or to go turf cutting. That is all that is offered to our young men and if they do not accept the Construction Corps or turf cutting then they go to the Passport Office with a recommendation from some T.D. or Senator to speed up the passport to allow them to leave the country&mdash;in many instances never to return.  I believe the Minister would be well advised to accept the recommendation from this side of the House to ask the commission to make its recommendations known at the earliest possible moment.  All of us in Dublin know that every technical school is overcrowded at the moment and that it is very difficult to get a boy into the particular class that he may select.  Take the case of a boy who wants to do fitting or mechanical engineering.  He must attend the local technical school and he is told in that technical school that the section he wants to join is overcrowded, with the result that, very often, he has to do something else which he does not like.  If we had the recommendations of this commission it would be to the benefit of the Government, the House, the boys themselves, and their parents who are anxiously waiting to get some news from the Government that the future of their boys is assured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of university education, and making allowance for the supplementary, State grants this year will amount to £333,000, while the provision for aviation and meteorological services is nearly £1,500,000.  We are providing one-third of a million as a State grant for higher education.  I wonder does that show any real appreciation of the benefit to the country that may accrue from these two services.  I take aviation because I have been told, over and over again, that we do not expect any real return from the money that we are spending on that service: that it is a matter of prestige.  Apparently, we do not consider prestige as attaching to the moneys that we spend on university colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the extra grant was given to the universities and colleges last year, I referred to a statement which had been drawn up by a committee of statutory officers in connection with the college about which I have some information&mdash;University College, Dublin. There are certain things that emerged from that committee's report that I would like to get set down again even after the new grants have been given. The average salary of a full-time professor <Col N="1445" /> in University College, Dublin, has a present-day purchasing power of about £600.  Between the full-time professors and full-time lecturers there is a staff of 73 to be catered for.  About 24 of them are on salaries of a present-day purchasing level of £600.  Three of them have a little bit more and five a little more than that, but a considerable number more are under that level, and that after the increases had been made to their old-time emoluments.</P>
    <P>In this report that I have mentioned, attention is drawn to the pension situation with regard to the staff of University College.  I am referring now to University College, Dublin, and I am speaking on its behalf because I have some information about it, but I am certain that the evil conditions there are reproduced in the other colleges.  I have not the same intimate association with the other colleges.  It is pointed out in this report that the pension system there has never been adequate.</P>
    <P>If a person is appointed a professor at the ordinary age and serves the maximum period of time he can only hope to retire on a pension of £200 a year which to-day has a purchasing power of £100 or £2 a week.  Even if the pound were to recover its old-time value the pension would be £4 a week. That is what the State thinks fit to do. The State does not, of course, provide all the income of University College, Dublin.  Roughly, one half of its finances comes from students' fees. Therefore the position is that a person who has filled a full-time post to which he was appointed at a relatively early age, may hope to get a pension of £200 a year on retirement.  The professors retire between 65 and 70 years of age. I think 65 is called the retiring age, but it is possible to remain on for another five years.</P>
    <P>In any event, that is the situation even with the extra grants that were given last year.  The average salary of a professor in University College, Dublin, has a present-day purchasing power of £600 a year, and when he retires he will have a pension with a present-day purchasing power of £100 a year.  I consider that nothing short of a scandal.  I think that this small <Col N="1446" /> group have suffered more in the depreciation of money that has taken place in the last seven or eight years than possibly any other class in the community. This country used to pride itself on its attitude towards scholars. I suppose that the full-time professorial staff in our university colleges can claim that they stand in the main as the representatives of the scholarly element in the country, and that is the emolument that we think State benevolence should run to.</P>
    <P>In addition, this report has a statement with regard to the buildings.  It is hard to speak in a calm way on the situation with respect to accommodation in University College, Dublin.  I expressed it here before.  There are 3,000 students there.  If they have an hour between lectures they generally spend the time sitting on the pipes. They do not sit on the pipes to get any heat because there has been no heat there for some years.  They do so because the pipes are the only things they have to sit on.</P>
    <P>The conditions with regard to the classrooms, the library and the other places where they forgather is something beyond description.  It has always been held that the great advantage of a university education is not attendance at lectures or the information that may be derived from attending them but rather that a university provides for a meeting of people with different points of view.  That is a time in their life when youth is rather surging forward and when they are expected to have good viewpoints and a good liberal outlook and, being a picked group, as they are, to have something of value that they can communicate one to another.  The idea of the clash of mind upon mind is supposed to be one of the chief advantages of a residential university, but it has gone very much into the background in the case of University College, Dublin.  If it is only a question of the physical accommodation, the lack of a room, of a place where students can congregate and exchange their ideas, reacts very adversely on the proper value of university training.</P>
    <P>The committee of statutory officers to which I have referred already, called attention to that.  They go into <Col N="1447" /> very great detail on the condition of life in University College, Dublin.  The place has been dogged by fate.  The original contract that was given could not be carried out because of the outbreak of the 1914-18 war, as the contractor went bankrupt.  The whole conditions had to be changed, but in view of the rising costs, even the extra moneys proved to be insufficient to complete the building.</P>
    <P>At a later time, the old building then known as the College of Science was handed over in order to ease the pressure on the Earlsfort Terrace building, by enabling certain classes to be taken there; but the college has grown since those days of 1926 and, with a 3,000 strength at the moment, the conditions under which the students have to comport themselves are something beyond description.  The committee went into all that and put up reasoned estimates.  They can be challenged with being extravagant in current outlay or with suggesting something that the country cannot afford, but at any rate they have presented them in great detail, so that the details can be examined and if there is anything in the way of extravagance it can be pared down.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to one point, on account of a phrase the Minister used, when I spoke on this in regard to the Supplementary Estimates.  I was making a comparison with the situation in England and was told that the full Book of Estimates would show that we would have nothing to fear in comparison with what is being done in England.  All I know is that, at the bottom of page 13 in this officers' report, they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We may glance, finally, at the conditions under which the British universities, with whose standards we must compete, are to recommence their work.  The official Parliamentary and Scientific Committee has recommended that the direct annual Treasury grants of £2,500,000 to the universities shall be increased to £7,000,000 and that a capital sum of £10,000,000 be provided in the first five years after the war, to enlarge and equip the universities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1448" /> That was the report signed on the 28th of January, 1946.  Those in England interested in this matter have been fortunate, in that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is a university man and has a very definite appreciation of university training.  A quotation from the London <i>Times</i> of 11th March, 1947, states as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Dalton, states in a written reply that he has considered a report from the University Grants Committee on the financial needs of the universities for the five years 1947-52.  As the needs of the universities will be on a rising scale, he proposes that Parliament should be asked to provide recurrent grants, £9,000,000 for the academic year 1947-48, rising to £9,970,000 for 1948-49 and rising to almost £12,000,000 in 1952.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Where the statutory officers' report says that the Treasury Grants in England are to rise from £2,500,000 to £7,000,000, that phrase must now be replaced by a reference to £12,000,000. According to Mr. Dalton, as quoted in the London <i>Times:</i>&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In addition to that, there is a Building Site Acquisition Grant and the University Grants Committee estimate that the universities' programme of development will necessitate during the quinquennium nonrecurrent grants amounting to £50,000,000, of which £40,000,000 is for new buildings and £10,000,000 is for acquiring sites, existing buildings and new equipment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Chancellor of the Exchequer accepted that estimate of the need and will do his best to meet it.  He has promised the University Grants Committee generally whatever money is required for university education, as he realises its utility as one of the great weapons they have in order to put Britain in the forefront in the world.</P>
    <P>I want to have that compared with what is done here.  It is somewhat of a scandal that the whole University Vote here, including the Supplementary Estimates, amounts to £333,000.  That is one-third of a million pounds, whereas Vote 56, which I brought in by way <Col N="1449" /> of contrast, Aviation and Meteorological Services, amounts to £1,456,000 this year.  That is nearly £1,500,000 for aviation, compared with one-third of a million for university education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this increased grant to the various universities and, whilst I do not suppose we have arrived at anything like the end of the road with regard to helping the Irish universities, it is a welcome sign that the Government has realised the importance which those institutions bear in our life.  Nowadays, any country ultimately depends on the standard of education of its citizens.  Without a high standard of education, a country cannot hope to survive in the commercial world or make the use of science which it should make.</P>
      <P>For that reason, I am very glad indeed to see that the Government has increased the grants to the universities. University College, Dublin, with the other constituent colleges of the National University in Cork and Galway, has been for a number of years in a very bad position with regard to the housing of its students and the salaries which it could give to its professors. Those men carried on their very important and very good work under grave handicaps.  I do not think that the sums of money which have been given will enable University College, Dublin, to increase its buildings to the size it would like immediately, but I think a scheme is under way in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Trinity College, I welcome particularly the grant which they have received.  Many people thought that that university was a wealthy one and in no need of any financial assistance, but as we all know in these days, the yield from investments has fallen considerably.  They have found themselves in a position in which it is extremely difficult to carry on the work which they have done for so many years.  It gives me personally&mdash;I say &ldquo;personally&rdquo;, because I am a graduate of that university&mdash;very great pleasure that an Irish Government has stepped in and made it possible to carry on the good work which that university has always done in the realms <Col N="1450" /> of scholarship, science and medicine. Although we find taxation a heavy burden, there are nevertheless certain things on which we must not retrench and on which, in fact, as an investment for the future, we must spend money. I regard universities and university education as coming within that category, and it is gratifying to see that it is realised by the Government, and that our citizens will be equipped to face all the complexities of the modern world through the highest forms of university education which this State can give.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan puts on rosy glasses when looking at Britain and the darkest possible glasses when looking at Ireland.  Even if the British Chancellor gives £9,000,000 a year to the British universities, it is not as much as our people are providing for university and higher education per head of the population.  In England, there are 46,000,000 people paying only £9,000,000 per year, while our 3,000,000 people are paying £400,000 per year. Anybody can make the calculation and realise that the British figure is not as great per head of population as our figure.  I am not claiming that our universities are over-endowed.  I agree indeed with what Deputy McGilligan has said about the overcrowded condition of the universities and about the facilities for students and professors being bad, but we cannot improve those conditions overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the talks I had with the heads of the various universities, and particularly the National University in Earlsfort Terrace, I said that we would give them all the help we could to build as quickly as material became available. In the last year, we made available a sum for building to the Earlsfort Terrace College, but it was not able to go ahead with it.  That was not the fault of the university authorities any more than it was the fault of the Government. It was just that they could not go ahead with the work in the conditions obtaining that year.  I am prepared, as Minister for Finance, to find any money that is reasonably required to have university and higher technical education here of a type and in sufficient quantity to suit the needs of our people, and I feel that, even though <Col N="1451" /> we are doing more per head of the population than the British, if the building projects which the university authorities have in mind are carried out during the next five years we will have done very much more than the British, again per head of the population. I hope we will be able to provide buildings which are suitable and I think that the taxpayers, if we are to have university education, should be prepared to put up the money to enable it to be provided in an efficient and healthy way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the Money Resolution, the best estimate we can make out at the moment is that the Exchequer's share of expenditure under the mother and child service will be about £250,000 per annum; under the tuberculosis service, £250,000; allowances for infectious cases under Section 39, £150,000, and for smaller items like medical preparations inspection, consultative councils, staff, etc., about £50,000, or a total of £700,000. That means that the total amount to be spent on the mother and child service will be £450,000; the tuberculosis grant for the current financial year is estimated at £300,000; so that the total cost to the Exchequer when the Bill comes to be implemented will be £550,000.  Then there are the allowances which I mentioned for the maintenance of relatives of those detained for infectious diseases and so on, the total cost of which will be about £300,000, of which the Exchequer will pay half.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1) to delete lines 55 to 57, inclusive, page 6.</P>
      <P>Somewhere or other the Bill excludes the power of administering surgical treatment to a patient except with his consent; but the definition of surgical treatment here would imply that it would be possible under the subsequent part of the Bill to administer a hypodermic injection, inoculation or some process of immunisation to a person or to take specimens of blood or other specimens for examination even though the person objected.  I submit, therefore, that some further modification of the description &ldquo;surgical treatment&rdquo; is intended, because I take it that it is not intended by the Minister to take powers to take specimens of blood or other specimens from persons without their consent or to inoculate or immunise them.  Under this definition of surgical treatment the Minister would have general power to treat persons against their will in the way implied.</P>

      <P>the expression &ldquo;temporary dwelling&rdquo; means any&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) tent, or</P>
      <P>(b)  van, or other conveyance (whether on wheels or not), or</P>
      <P>(c)  shed, hut or similar structure, or</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 3, page 7, to delete the word &ldquo;accordingly&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;as meaning infested to a degree which in the opinion of a registered practitioner is dangerous or injurious&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The paragraph reads very widely at present.  It says &ldquo;the word &lsquo;vermin&rsquo; means any insect, being bugs, fleas, lice or itch mites, and includes the eggs, larvae and pupae of such insects and the word &lsquo;verminous&rsquo; shall be construed accordingly&rdquo;.  My amendment seeks to define more exactly the word &ldquo;verminous&rdquo;.  There are certain powers given to the Minister in verminous cases later on in the Bill, and I suggest that these powers would be a bit too wide except &ldquo;verminous&rdquo; is defined in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what anxiety the Deputy can feel about this.  First of all, we must remember that under this Bill an adult person <Col N="1457" /> cannot be examined for vermin.  He can only be examined for infectious disease.  Therefore, the adult person does not come into it; he is not concerned as to what the definition of &ldquo;verminous&rdquo; may be.  It only refers to people, let us say, who may be brought in with typhus fever, in regard to which vermin is a very important consideration.  We must remember, if we try to get rid of vermin in school-children, that they may be comparatively clean to-day but they may be very bad in three or four days' time.  These vermin are so prolific and multiply so quickly that if the medical inspector sees any sign of vermin at all he should be enabled to deal with the position so that they would not be permitted to develop and multiply, as they will if they get a free rein.  I think it is better left as it is.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 2, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section. There is a definition of the word &ldquo;institution&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the expression &lsquo;institution&rsquo; means a hospital, sanatorium, maternity home, convalescent home, preventorium, laboratory, clinic, health centre, first-aid station, dispensary or any similar institution.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wonder whether the Minister intends. this to mean institutions that are State-aided and whether he would accept an amendment making that clear?  I am not clear whether there are some parts of this Bill which, if this definition of institution is left as it is, would give the Minister power to have control over or interfere with institutions that are not in any way maintained with the assistance of State grants or grants from the rates.  I would like to know whether institutions as covered in the definition are intended to mean institutions which are State-aided or rate-aided only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Bill we are dealing principally with the transfer of institutions from the public assistance authority to the health authority and from the sanitary authority to the <Col N="1458" /> health authority and we are dealing with the provision of institutions by the health authority where they are not already provided, or the closing of institutions.  The only instance where it could refer to an institution such as mentioned by the Deputy is where we say infectious diseases must not be treated along with certain cases. That is the only instance where we would interfere with, as it were, an independent institution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Where he takes those powers it is not clearly specified that it is limited to infectious diseases; in other words, there are powers in the body of this Bill under which the Minister can direct that certain types of cases will or will not be treated in certain institutions.  I think it would be going beyond the Minister's intention if he were to exercise those powers with regard to a purely private hospital, and yet the definition as it stands would certainly leave those powers with the Minister in regard to any private hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

Take the mother-and-child welfare scheme.  It may be possible to commence that scheme in the City of Dublin practically straight away, but it may not be possible to operate it in parts of the country for some time.

      <P>In the Schedule the Minister is repealing the Vaccination Acts.  I think it is due to the Dáil that we should have a case made for that&mdash; if there is a case to be made for it.  I believe very firmly in this Bill.  I think there is an immense amount of good in it and, when it is fully implemented, when the funds are behind it and the machinery established, it will be, on the whole, very beneficial to the health of the people.  Holding those views very firmly, nevertheless I feel that whatever good is in the Bill from a health point of view it is more than outweighed and undone by the repeal of the Vaccination Acts at the present moment.

      <P>Of course, we are in committee and I do not think it would be in accordance with procedure and precedent to postpone a discussion on a matter which arises on a section of the Bill because certain Deputies, or a number of them, happen to be absent from the House.  I am merely stating my view at this point; when we have got the views of other Deputies, then those views could be considered.  As I was saying, I could understand the Minister, advised by the Department, coming in with a Health Bill and saying: &ldquo;I do not approve of vaccination; it is not useful or beneficial&rdquo; or &ldquo;it is dangerous&rdquo;, but in this Bill, or in the White Paper accompanying it, no such suggestion or no such assertion is made.</P>
      <P>What is stated in the Bill is that we are repealing the Vaccination Acts, but the Minister's intention and the views of his Department are contained in the White Paper which says: &ldquo;We are not giving up the power to insist compulsorily on vaccination; we will exercise such powers in the face of an outbreak, in the face of danger.&rdquo; That is neither fish, flesh nor good red herring.  That is faulty and dangerous to the extent of irresponsible recklessness. The Minister knows very well and does not dispute in his White Paper that vaccination is beneficial, is a safeguard against smallpox, but he repeals the Act and he says: &ldquo;If there is danger, if smallpox reaches our shores, then we shall vaccinate in face of the danger.&rdquo; That is tommy-rot. That cannot be done.</P>

With the speed of modern transport, your vaccination is behind the enemy lines all the time and the spear-head of the outbreak is ahead of you.  If you believe in vaccination <Col N="1461" /> as you suggest in the White Paper, this repeal of the Acts is unsound and unsafe.  One of the most important works ever written on smallpox for the benefit of the medical and the nursing profession was written about 1903 by a doctor named Wank. What prompted him to produce that particularly valuable book, which is still a standard work, was that in a club he heard in conversation that Great Britain, with the increased speed of steam vessels, had come within 12 days of Manchuria.  He thought over this and he thought of the incubation period of smallpox which is roughly about 12 days.  It struck him that it would be possible for a person to develop smallpox in Manchuria and to arrive in Great Britain by ship without ever showing a symptom of smallpox, without being ill, without being seedy. Two or three days after his arrival he might throw out symptoms which would permit of the disease being diagnosed but meanwhile he would have infected a number of other people.  Because of that danger, due to Britain being within 12 days of the Far East, Wank sat down and wrote this most valuable book.  It was circulated to the whole medical and nursing profession free so that every one of them would be on their toes, trained, in the methods of promptly diagnosing smallpox when they came up against it.  That was because they were within 12 days of the Far East.</P>
    <P>Last year or the year before we proceeded by way of heavy expenditure to make this island an air link between the eastern and the western world, to bring the Far East within 70 or 72 hours of our shores, to bring as far as we could, all the human traffic between the Far East and the western hemisphere through our territory here.  So far, we appear to be highly successful in our efforts to do that, to bring travellers from the East here, allow them spend a day here, and then take off for the West.  It is simply unthinkable that at the particular time we are doing that and when we hope to develop it further, any Minister for Health would come in and say: &ldquo;This is the moment I select to remove from the people of this country the safeguard of vaccination.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1462" /> I want to say to the Minister that as far as I could secure authoritative medical opinion on this&mdash;I do not put myself forward as anything in the nature of an authority&mdash;I have sought the opinions of as many people as possible who have had experience and who claim to be authorities on this question.  The Minister has his own organisation.  He and his predecessors have been at great expense to establish a public health service in Ireland whose whole function is to safeguard public health.  He has an elaborate State organisation who specialise in public health matters, in preventive medicine, and unanimously they are against the repeal of the Vaccination Acts as being unfair to the people and dangerous to health.  I want to know has the Minister any volume of medical opinion behind the course he proposes to take, either inside his Department or outside it.  We know very well that smallpox is a disease that was very prevalent in these islands&mdash;both here and in Britain.  We know that when most of us were children many of the old people we saw were pock-marked.  We also know that whereas there is very little risk in vaccinating an infant, neither vaccination nor inoculation should be lightly taken when you are dealing with adults.  If you had to choose between either inoculating or vaccinating a person, obviously, if you are thinking of health, you choose the period of greatest safety and you select the period of minimum danger.  If you select the period of greatest safety, you will select the earliest possible age.</P>
    <P>If you want to select the period of greatest danger you will select adult life for either one or the other.  That is very well known, and yet we say that we will repeal the Vaccination Acts, but will vaccinate in the event of danger.  In the event of a passenger who has been in contact with a case of smallpox either prior to departure or en route, landing at Rineanna and proceeding to Dublin, remember his fellow-passengers will be in Chicago before the disease can be diagnosed in their case.  Some of the passengers may land in Rineanna, stay in an hotel in Limerick for a day or two and then come on to Dublin, perhaps stay in a Dublin hotel and later go on to the <Col N="1463" /> Curragh races or Punchestown.  Where are you going to vaccinate ahead of the infection in that case?  Is it not common sense that it cannot be done?  If the Minister believes in vaccination as a safeguard, then the time to safeguard our people is before the germ enters our midst and not after.</P>
    <P>I could understand a Minister coming in and saying: &ldquo;I am advised that vaccination is not safe, that it is not a protection and, therefore, I repeal the Vaccination Acts.&rdquo; There would be an issue there, an issue that could be understood and thrashed out.  I cannot understand the line taken in this Bill, in association with the White Paper, that vaccination is beneficial and, recognising the fact that vaccination has eradicated smallpox&mdash;I think I am quoting the White Paper&mdash; therefore, we repeal the Vaccination Acts but, in the event of danger, we still have powers to vaccinate people. That is absurd.  There is no ground to stand on in such a contention.  It is a sham from the very beginning.  The conception of such a quibble is offensive to the mind of anybody taking public health as a serious question that must be seriously considered.  It is neither one thing nor the other.  If you want to run away from the Vaccination Acts, repeal the Vaccination Acts and do not have any of this sham about vaccination in the event of outbreak or danger.</P>
    <P>These are my views.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's. (1) Does he believe in vaccination as a safeguard?  (2) If he believes in vaccination as a safeguard, does he think that it is possible to vaccinate when the disease has entered by air or by port or to do it successfully?  (3) Does he think it is sound health policy that people should be vaccinated in adult life in preference to being vaccinated in early life?  Does not he know the big dangers associated with such a course and is he going deliberately to lay the population open to those dangers any time word comes in the future of smallpox contacts or cases having entered this particular country by air or by sea?</P>

      <P>I have had considerable <Col N="1464" /> experience of vaccination as practised for a great number of years under the dispensary system and I am sorry to say that I have to disagree with Deputy Dr. O'Higgins.

      <P>Again, is not it generally believed that the protection conferred by vaccination is only effective for a period of seven years after vaccination is carried out, as has been the practice up to this, in infancy?  The immunity conferred is supposed to last only about seven years.  Consequently, if an outbreak of smallpox occurred at the present moment the entire population would require to be vaccinated.  I think that is the correct medical teaching. Why inflict on unfortunate babies this painful procedure and the danger of septic arms and other complications if after seven years you have to do the job again?  In my experience, it would be far better to allow vaccination to go by the board and, when there is danger of an epidemic, if mass vaccination were carried out it would serve the purpose equally as well as general vaccination up to 12 months of age.  That is what I think about the matter.</P>

      <P>I am trying to learn some medicine, but it is very hard to know. As regards the Bill, the intention was to put all these immunisation and vaccination processes under one clause. That is laid down, perhaps, better in Clause 20 than any other.  I do not think that it is fair that Deputy Dr. O'Higgins should describe the whole thing as a sham.  After all, we are doing what we think is right and to say that we are only shamming is, of course, to give the impression to the members of the House that we are simply putting down things that we think will deceive somebody or other &mdash;which is not our intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this clause we ask the Dáil to give us power to prescribe immunisation or vaccination against any infectious disease and we are putting into this clause that if the person, if he is an adult, or a guardian objects on conscientious grounds, we do not do it. I do not know whether Deputy Dr. O'Higgins will argue against that or not.  If he does, it will be very much out of keeping with the speech he made here on the Second Reading of the Bill. The big objection, as far as I know, and I come from a county where vaccination was opposed more than in any other county, was that when the British Parliament passed the Vaccination Acts they gave a conscientious objection <Col N="1466" /> clause to Great Britain and did not give it to Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we rescind the vaccination laws as they are and put it in under this clause we can re-enforce vaccination with a conscientious objection clause attached.  I do not know what the medical opinion may be.  I may say that the volume of medical opinion that I have got since this Bill was introduced would be in agreement with Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, that we ought not at this stage drop vaccination.  If I am advised in that way by the Medical Consultative Council, say, well it would be my intention to enforce vaccination again but with this conscientious clause which is there for vaccination or immunisation in general. I do not like to enter into the controversy with regard to the effectiveness or to the danger of vaccination to adults or children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was studying medicine I remember it was felt for a long time that some of the infectious diseases should be given to children when they were young.  The theory in my time was that that was all wrong, that first of all if you keep children away they might not get it at all but that if they do, it is not likely to be as hard on them as adults as it would be as children.  That may not be an exact parallel.  It may be different with vaccination or immunisation.  Take the example of the person mentioned by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins who comes to this country by plane, stays in an hotel in Dublin, then goes on to Limerick and from thence to Chicago and who had smallpox.  I am afraid we would have to do the very same thing in existing circumstances if there were no vaccination, to try to look up every contact we could and have them vaccinated. Deputy Dr. O'Higgins says unless it is done within four days, it is not very much use.  That has to be kept in mind.  The clause with regard to infectious diseases lays down that the Minister can prescribe vaccination or immunisation against any infectious disease.  The adult person or the guardian of the child may raise an objection and if so, his objection must <Col N="1467" /> be respected but that is where we do the thing generally.  If there is an outbreak then the Minister may overrule the objection and say that everybody in a particular area must be immunised or vaccinated as the case may be.  That system appears to me to be fair all round.  In conclusion, I would like to say that I have an open mind on this question and that if I find medical opinion is, as Deputy Dr. O'Higgins points out, in favour of vaccination, I shall certainly have vaccination restored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to press my views unduly on the Minister in this particular matter, but I do feel that we are not at the moment acting with a proper sense of responsibility. If I used the word &ldquo;sham&rdquo; I did not mean it in any offensive manner.  It was just a word that came to my lips to describe the hollowness of the safeguard, or what we are putting up as a safeguard in substitution for the protection which we are removing from our people.  The Minister may want to score debating points&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that my general outlook is against any form of compulsion in association with the practice of medicine.  That is my general outlook.  I am very much opposed to medicine being carried on under the threat of compulsion or under the threat of penalties.  On the Second Reading of this Bill I made one exception when I said that there were exceptions to cases such as the ambulatory tribes and that I would allow compulsion, etc., and see a case in it in face of that particular difficulty. Now we are dealing with a process of law that has been highly successful in eliminating smallpox from these islands and we say that because it has been successful we will dispense with it and we say that we will dispense with it at the very time when we are aiming at bringing this country in point of time very many days nearer than it was before to the Far East which is, as we know, the danger point with regard to vaccination. What Deputy Dr. Lynch says, and which was repeated by the <Col N="1468" /> Minister, is true up to a point, but only up to a point, that is, that the protection conferred by vaccination holds for a period of seven years. That is probably true.  It holds only for seven years as an absolute protection but it has protective qualities for the whole of life.</P>
      <P>For instance, if a person vaccinated in infancy gets smallpox at the age of 50 it will be extremely unlikely that that person will die of smallpox.  It will be extremely likely that that person will get the very mildest attack of smallpox.  All figures, all statistics, demonstrate that.  Consequently, if we vaccinate in infancy, the necessity for vaccinating everybody ahead of the point of invasion has not the same degree of urgency as if we left them absolutely unprotected from infancy onwards.  There may be fatalities in connection with vaccination.  Deputy Dr. Lynch seems to have come across a great many cases.  My opinion is that every fatality that ever occurred in connection with smallpox vaccination was very generally propaganded throughout this country and through-cut Great Britain and throughout Western Europe.  I have come across most of that propaganda and I have not read of these fatalities that Deputy Dr. Lynch speaks about.  Be that as it may, there are fatalities following any form of medical treatment.  There are fatalities following every form of immunisation and inoculation.  There are fatalities following every form of operation.  Are we to give up operative surgery, inoculation, immunisation, every form of medical treatment, because there is an occasional fatality? The point is this.  Vaccination in infancy confers a very high degree of protection for the whole of life and at least ensures that if the case gets smallpox it will not be a fatal attack. That is the immunity of protection our people have at the moment if the law as it stands at the moment is respected. We are going to remove that.  We are going to adopt a policy where in the face of danger we will vaccinate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now every authority&mdash;I am not talking of most people in this country as being an authority&mdash;but every authority that has soldiered through an outbreak of smallpox lays this down: that, after <Col N="1469" /> contact with smallpox, you will give them practically complete immunity if you vaccinate the first day.  After contact you will give 90 per cent. immunity if you vaccinate the second day.  If you vaccinate the third day you will only get 30 per cent. immunity.  The other 70 per cent. of the cases will get the smallpox, so that to vaccinate after the fourth day is worthless.</P>
    <P>If there is anything to be learned from the authorities and from the field workers, and assuming that what we have learned is correct, let us apply it to the case where a person disembarks at Rineanna after having travelled from the Far East.  That person goes to the Gresham or to the Shelbourne and then to the Curragh races and then proceeds to the other side.  The person arrives sick on the other side with a rash appearing generally on the third or fourth day.  That case has been moving about this country.  We get back word that it is a case of smallpox. How many adults, children or infants &mdash;of the contacts&mdash;does the Minister think can be vaccinated within four days of the original contact?  It cannot be done and you might as well keep your vaccinators at home.  You may protect them against a subsequent smallpox visitor landing here but not against that particular visitor.</P>
    <P>I do not agree for a moment that it is equally dangerous to vaccinate or inoculate in infancy or early childhood as it is in adult life.  I do not think that anybody will seriously put forward that contention, because even the layman can say this much, that the danger of any vaccination or immunisation is the danger of getting some cross-infection, of some other kind of disease supervening on the disease that you are giving the case by your vaccination or inoculation.  Now, what is the infant range of travel?  From the kitchen to the bedroom.  What is the range of travel of any one of us?  From here to Cork or to Donegal or wherever the whim directs us.  The danger of the infant getting a cross-infection, encephalitis or any other infection is the odds of that infection being between the kitchen and the bedroom. How does that compare with the odds of meeting with infection between this <Col N="1470" /> and Cork?  It is common sense that you multiply the danger as the range of movement becomes greater.</P>
    <P>With regard to immunisation, what is the literature that is emanating from the Minister's Department?  To get it done at the very earliest point of life, not even to wait for school age but to get it done pre-school.  That is correct, and it has learned opinion behind it.  That is the outlook and policy of the Minister's Department and cannot be altered.  We are dealing with something with which politics have been associated in the past.  The Minister knows as well as I do how the conscientious objector clause came to be inserted in application to England and not to Ireland.  It was never clearly understood here.  There was a class&mdash; a religion&mdash;in England of conscientious objectors, of people who objected to blood-letting in any shape or form. They objected to military service.  They objected religiously to blood-letting for any purpose whatsoever, even to save their King and country.</P>
    <P>The term used &mdash;&ldquo;conscientious objector&rdquo;&mdash;was a very unfortunate one because over here we said that if a person had a conscientious objection to vaccination over there and was exempt, why should he not be exempt over here?  Propaganda grew out of that.  The birthplace of it was Wexford but the cradle was Portlaoighise. Both the Minister and myself were equally immersed in that atmosphere. Are we to say in 1947, with aeroplanes roaring overhead every hour of the day and night, that we are going to repeal Vaccination Acts in this country and insert the conscientious objector's clause?  The people who would have a conscientious objection are probably wearing Easter Week medals on their chests.  Have they a conscientious objection to blood-letting and can they be put on a par with the English conscientious objector?</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister, who is now the head of a very important Department of State, that there is a very great responsibility on his shoulders. That responsibility is peculiarly great by reason of the fact that he is himself a medical man.  If he repeals the Vaccination Acts now, and does so lightly or because of unsound advice, <Col N="1471" /> what will be the position if this country is ravaged by smallpox within the next ten, 15 or 20 years?  There would be a certain degree of protection for a span of time, but that will be wearing off. There is even transmitted protection at the moment from the vaccinated parent to the unvaccinated child, but that will disappear little by little.</P>
    <P>The Minister's contention is there has been a change in medical outlook, that when he was a student or a young doctor, people believed in early infection for children, but that now the policy is to keep the giving of the disease as far back as possible, or as late in life as possible.  Of course, that is perfectly sound, and with the study of infectious diseases and epidemiology, it is perfectly rational. Why do we estimate that they will get milder attacks if they get it later in life?  Why do we estimate that when people come in contact in picture houses, in buses and in crowds and get certain mild degrees of doses all through life, they are, in fact, as one year follows another, acquiring a degree of immunity, so that when they get the disease later in life, they have a high source of protection?  That is the argument for early vaccination rather than, as the Minister applies it, an argument for later vaccination.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Corporation <Col N="1474" /> is exceedingly anxious that Dublin City Deputies particularly should oppose the adoption of this particular amendment, on the ground that the building is an exceedingly old one and that its location makes it unsuitable for these particular requirements. The objection by the corporation is not simply because of any extra cost that may result in the change-over, but because of the well-defined decision taken by the corporation that it is utterly incapable of improvement in its present position.  The alternative they suggest at present is that the hospital should remain as it is pending the establishment of a new hospital and that, in the meantime, greater facilities might be sought for the treatment of this particular disease in the general hospitals.  Deputies from the corporation who inspected the hospital were unanimous in their decision that it is utterly incapable of improvement. I need hardly emphasise the implication of its unsuitability when I mention its particular location.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out to Deputy O'Sullivan that there will not be any additional cost on the corporation as a result of this clause being put in, as 75 per cent. of the cost of the venereal diseases scheme under the corporation is met by State grants. That will continue and the cost to the corporation, therefore, will be 25 per cent. and, other things being equal, should not be any higher as a result of this transfer.  Neither will the State gain anything by the transfer, as the State will still have to pay 75 per cent. of the cost.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (1) lays down that the health authority may collect a reasonable charge for the maintenance of patients in any institution. I take it that that includes a fever hospital?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (7) of Section 37 lays it down that, where any case is sent to a fever hospital as a result of an order made by the health authority, no charge can be made. What does that mean? It means that if a farmer's child gets diphtheria and he accepts the medical man's advice and sends the child to a fever hospital, he will be charged two or three guineas per week for its maintenance.  His neighbour whose child also had diphtheria reads this Bill, makes difficulties and says: &ldquo;I will not let my child go to a fever hospital.&rdquo; The health authority then makes an order and the neighbour who is a difficult citizen gets his child treated free, while the parent who is co-operative and accepts the advice of the medical authority has to pay.  I think it is something which requires to be looked into between now and the subsequent stages of the Bill, because what will happen, in my opinion, is that everybody will get clever after a while and it will be necessary to make an order in every case of infectious disease and everybody will be treated free, be he prince or pauper. I am not pressing anything at the moment, but I think it requires looking into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps so.  The policy we are aiming at is a policy of providing free institutional treatment for all infectious diseases, for children and for <Col N="1476" /> those classes dealt with under the Public Assistance Act at the moment. The public health authority will have a discretionary right to make a charge on any person outside these classes. We come later on to certain amendments dealing with charges under the infectious disease regulations relating to ships and the intention is that these charges should remain when we get this Bill implemented.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 16 and 17 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 18.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 18, but in Part II, to insert the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Whenever a health authority is satisfied that useful service is being or will be rendered to persons requiring institutional services by the provision of such services in an institution in the functional area of such health authority, such health authority may, on the request of the governing body of such institution and with the consent of the Minister, provide for such institution any land which is shown by such governing body, to the satisfaction of the said health authority, to be required for the efficient performance of the funetions of such institution or for the purpose of enlarging or extending it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where a health authority determines to provide under this section any land for an institution, such <Col N="1477" /> health authority may acquire such land either by agreement with the consent of the Minister or compulsorily under Part VIII of this Act and (in either case) may convey such land to or for the benefit of such institution.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where a health authority is requested by the governing body of an institution to provide under this section any land for such institution, such health authority shall, as a condition precedent to their so providing such land, require such governing body to undertake to defray the whole of the cost of so providing such land.</P>
    <P>This is a new section which enables a health authority compulsorily to acquire land for an institution such as a voluntary hospital, an institution not run or owned by itself.  There was a similar power in Section 22 of the Public Assistance Act, 1939, but it was limited to the acquisition of land for institutions providing accommodation for public assistance patients.  There are certain hospitals which provide such services, but it would not be applicable to all voluntary hospitals and, in particular, to certain tuberculosis institutions, and these are the institutions we have particularly in mind in this connection.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 18, but in Part III, to insert the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A health authority shall, in accordance with regulations made under Section 24 of this Act, make arrangements for safeguarding the health of women in respect of motherhood and for their education in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section at the moment refers to expectant mothers and nursing mothers. It was thought that that might be a rather difficult phrase to interpret in certain circumstances and the phrase has been altered to refer to women in respect of motherhood.  It is very hard to define the term &ldquo;expectant&rdquo;&mdash;how long or in what circumstances a woman <Col N="1478" /> might be expectant&mdash;but we do know when she is a mother.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be safer for the Minister to speak with regard to the intentions of the original section.  If this is put as an amendment, I take it that the discussion on the matter stops and the discussion on Section 18 has not begun yet, because the Minister ought to tell us what is contemplated under Section 18.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This will necessitate the deletion of Section 18 in the Bill.  We consider that this is a better definition. I take it the Deputy wants to have a discussion on the whole matter of mother and child welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I submit that that is what the Minister is putting before the House when he asks us to accept Section 18, whether in the form in the Bill or in his amendment. This is the only occasion on which, I understand, the matter will be under discussion, and I suggest that the Minister ought to tell us on the amendment what he would tell us if we asked him to explain what his proposals were under Section 18 as a matter of general policy and what steps he proposes to take to implement the ideas in Section 18 or in his redraft of Section 18.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's general proposals in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal is that, as soon as we have the opportunity&mdash;and the opportunity will depend more on personnel than anything else&mdash;as well as on improving our institutions, our dispensary buildings and making them more suitable for the reception of women who expect to become mothers, mothers and young children&mdash;they should be looked after by the district medical officer.  As I pointed out on Second Reading, if we want to improve the health of the population generally, we should commence with the pregnant <Col N="1479" /> woman, look after her during her pregnancy and see that she is in good health and capable of producing a healthy baby, and, the baby being born, we should, so far as lies in our power, see that the baby is kept in good health, is guarded against infectious disease and every other disease and is reared in a healthy way.  That is the general principle we have in mind.</P>
      <P>Coming down to the working of the scheme, it is likely that very many more dispensary doctors&mdash;district medical officers under the new scheme&mdash;will be required in some of the bigger dispensaries, because it may be impossible for the dispensary doctor to do this work as well as the work he is doing at the moment, though, in areas of smaller population, the dispensary doctor may very well be able to do this work as well.  He will have the care of these mothers and of the children before they commence going to school.  Afterwards, he will have the duty of school inspection and treatment of children generally until they reach the age of 16, as laid down in the Bill.  I hope in time we may be able to provide for the specialists necessary, such as dentists and people who look after the eyes and ears, etc., to whom the district medical officer can refer these children if they want such treatment.</P>
      <P>When I say that it is intended to have this work carried out by the dispensary doctor as district medical officer, there will be an exception in the case of the City of Dublin.  In the City of Dublin, the three lying-in hospitals are prepared to undertake the mother-and-child service until the child is one year old and then it will pass over to the district medical service, the same as everywhere else.  That is probably a novel idea which has not been tried elsewhere.  But we are fortunate in this country to have such reputable people concerned with our maternity hospitals and I think it is well worth giving this system a trial in the City of Dublin at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I learned from the general body of the profession these three sections, 18, 19 and 20, are the operative sections of the Bill and <Col N="1480" /> they are the portions of the Bill about which there are most doubts and fears. There are a great many points of view and I think every point of view has to be very carefully considered in a matter of such importance as this.  I do not think anybody would disagree with the aims of these three sections, namely, to provide an efficient service for expectant mothers, infants, and children up to a certain age.  But where opinions apparently clash is as to how it is to be done, the machinery that is to be used.</P>
      <P>When the Minister talks about the district medical officer doing it, he is not talking of a dispensary doctor here and another there.  He is talking of every dispensary doctor, and that is where doubts must arise.  You have many types of dispensary doctors.  You have them of all ages from 80 down to very young men.  You will have octogenarians carrying out this particular work in these new clinics when they are built and down the whole age range.  That is, as far as age goes. As far as time goes, you will have just as great a variation.  The Minister knows well that no dispensary doctor can possibly hope to maintain himself and a family and educate that family on the salary, either past, present or future, of a dispensary doctor.  All over rural Ireland doctors accept such positions in order to make the main end of their livelihood in practice, and the more successful a man is and the more efficient he is, the greater his practice, which grows with years up to a point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are dispensary doctors known to everyone of us who are working&mdash;not to exaggerate&mdash;15 hours a day between their present dispensary work and their practice.  These are the most highly efficient and most successful practitioners. According to the Minister's statement, this service will be a responsibility placed on their backs just the same as in the case of a man in a dispensary district with a tiny population and with a very small practice who is merely there as a bird of passage until he is advanced into a somewhat better and busier district.  So far as I have met dispensary doctors&mdash;and I do not claim to have met any more than others&mdash;they have very grave <Col N="1481" /> doubts as to whether, when this Bill is fully functioning, the new duties under Sections 18, 19 and 20 can be carried out.</P>
    <P>The Minister meets that objection to an extent by saying that there will be a great number more doctors required, which, of course, means that the size of the existing dispensary district in a great number of cases will have to be reduced, possibly halved.  That is to be done by a law enacted by the votes of every one of us here, and not a single one of these, or anybody representing them, has been consulted as to what compensation will be given for the areas taken off them and for the new plantations.  Surely that is not fair play.  Every Deputy may not be as closely associated with medical men as some of us are.  But surely there is not a single Deputy sitting anywhere in this House who would consider that that is fair or just treatment.  If a cobbler had a practice by appointment or by contract through the machinery of the Local Appointments Commission in a small town or village and we were legislating without consulting that cobbler or anybody representing him to halve the number of his clients or his customers, would not every Deputy with a sense of justice be up in arms and say: &ldquo;What compensation do you propose to give the cobbler?  That is not fair play.&rdquo;  That is what we are doing with the dispensary men generally; that is what we propose to do in a happy-go-lucky style, without any consultation or discussion.</P>
    <P>The Minister will say that that matter will arise in connection with the regulations and that we will deal with it afterwards when the regulations become effective.  You will deal with the doctors when the regulations are being implemented and you will have the law to compel them to toe the line. Can you imagine any two bodies going before the Labour Court and the Dáil passing a law beforehand making it mandatory that one side has to accept what the other gives irrespective of the court?  The precedent being established here in relation to the medical profession is one that is going to be disastrous.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the water they <Col N="1482" /> had a Bill which is a kind of forebear of this Bill; this Bill is rather a mild copy of theirs.  How did they work it? A negotiating committee of the medical profession sitting daily with the Minister's representatives went into every clause, section or sub-section of the Bill that might in any way affect injuriously the members of the profession or overload them with work.  All that was gone into fully between representatives of the profession to be affected and the Minister's representatives before the Bill came before Parliament. That is the precedent over there and that was carried out in full by two British Governments very dissimilar in make-up, by the Government under Mr. Churchill and by the Government under Premier Attlee.  But that did not mean that the medical people got everything they wanted, or even half of what they wanted.  At all events, their case was listened to and their objections were made and the Minister went before Parliament and said: &ldquo;There is a negotiating committee there; we have been carrying on negotiations with them around every clause and section of this Bill; we know their views and we have studied them and considered them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Over there, remember, the practice is very dissimilar from here, but here we have a Bill which proposes to bisect the income of more than 50 per cent. of the dispensary men without any consultation with any of them.  We will do it by law and we will negotiate with them afterwards when the law of the land lays it down what duty they must do, if they do not wish to become lawbreakers. That is as far as area goes.</P>
    <P>As far as patients go, I ask every Deputy to consider what we are doing in these three sections without any discussion with the representatives of the profession.  Even assuming what the Minister has already told us will not be so, that we are leaving them all their present areas, without curtailing their areas or the size of their districts&mdash; assuming we leave all that, what are we doing with their practice?  Every woman, every infant, every child up to the age of 16 years will become a free patient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are very few philanthropists in the country who are going to press money on a doctor for his services when they are entitled to have those services free.  However, he will be bound to give his services free. If he gets a present, that is another matter, but by law we will ensure that every woman, infant and child up to 16 years, for every ailment and every disability, gets free treatment.  The Minister knows as well as I do how a doctor in rural Ireland makes his livelihood. It is not by the hardy men who will stagger along through an illness and only send for a doctor when on the point of death.  That is not where he makes his livelihood, and he does not make it out of young, healthy adults either.  It is out of the income gained by attending women and children. That is where 60 or 70 per cent. of the ordinary dispensary man's income comes from.</P>
      <P>In the next five or ten minutes, if I sit down quickly enough, we will make that the law of the land and we will do it without discussing it with them, without hearing their views, without hearing what they think about it.  Is that fair?  Is it reasonable or rational? Was the like of it ever done on any body of men before?  Was it ever done by any Parliament?   The Minister and his officers sit in secret; they produce a design that is very attractive.  In the main, they formulate a policy that is very sound, but before its application to the individuals vitally affected in the material sense, they do not discuss it with them.  Doubtless, the Minister's answer is &ldquo;We will&rdquo;.  We will, as soon as the dice is loaded; we will, as soon as the law is made; we will, as soon as the Minister is in a position to say: &ldquo;There is the law of the land, approved by Parliament; those are the duties you must carry out, no matter if I do not give you a halfpenny.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On those terms he will negotiate and I am appealing to the Minister's sense of fair play.  I say that that is not reasonable; it <Col N="1484" /> is not fair to a body of men who have contributed towards making the name of this country what it is, a body of men who, in face of periodic dangers, have worked on in the danger zone unselfishly, a body of men who rarely raised financial questions, a body of men who, in the main, do 50 per cent. of their work gratuitously. I do not think we are treating them fairly.</P>
    <P>I am rising, without a mandate, to point out to every Deputy here exactly what we are proceeding to do, and I would like every Deputy, from the Minister downwards, to ask himself is that fair treatment to mete out to those men&mdash;to pass a law to have their area of practice curtailed, to reduce by two-thirds their number of patients and not even to discuss with them how they will be treated financially, what compensation they will get, or, in fact, whether they are willing or able to undertake the new duties that will be imposed on them by law.</P>

      <P>I may have misled the House by giving what I visualise to be the position of dispensary doctors doing this job.  So far as the Bill is concerned, all we are doing here is <Col N="1485" /> putting an obligation on the health authorities to give a free service in relation to mother and child welfare. We do not tell them how it is to be provided.  I did assume that we would get agreement with the dispensary medical officers to do it.  Agreement means negotiation of course.  That is what I had in mind.  I thought that to proceed properly, we should first put this obligation on the health authority to provide this service and then, when we come to make our regulation, we could negotiate with the dispensary doctors or whoever else may be brought into the scheme.  In my own forecast of how the thing would work, I thought that we might get the dispensary medical officers to carry out the work, sometimes perhaps by taking away part of their present dispensary districts from them and sometimes, in a fair-sized town, by giving the dispensary doctor an assistant.  All that, however, is subject to negotiation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The health authority must and the machinery for implementing the Act is to be laid down in regulations. The White Paper makes the thing clear.  The Minister's Second Reading speeches, opening and closing, make it clear that the machinery will be the dispensary doctor.  The Minister did say that there may be extra doctors required.  He said that there was a survey being carried out of dispensary areas and that we may require a lot more dispensary districts.  If we accept the Minister's previous speech, it means that the area of practice of each doctor is going to be reduced&mdash;a very serious loss of income to the doctor.  Be that as it may the Minister says the time for negotiation and the time for discussion is when the Bill is law.  That is Departmental prompting.  Of course, that is the ideal time from the point of <Col N="1486" /> view of the Department but surely it is not the prompting of a human sense of fair play?  Surely it is not the prompting of a Minister anxious to try to do the right thing by a very deserving profession?  It is the ideal time for Departmental chiefs to meet unfortunate dispensary doctors and talk turkey to them.  It is the ideal time, when they can get a few moves in the game in advance and have the law on their side.</P>
      <P>The dispensary men are simple meat then, when they have no right to refuse to carry out the new duties.  Will they call them in to negotiate now and say to any one of them: &ldquo;I am going to halve your practice, I am going to take 60 per cent. of your patients away from you&rdquo;?  Will they meet them before the case is prejudiced, by the votes of the whole lot of us?  If they met them that way, ahead of the Bill, then they would be negotiating on equal terms because the Dáil may accept it from me that there is no group, no members of the community who are so anxious for good health, for healthy mothers and healthy children, as the members of the medical profession.  If the negotiations took place before the Bill were passed, then there would be equal negotiations, held in an atmosphere where it would be possible to have fair play, but there is no good in negotiations with the other fellow when he is looking along the sights of the rifle and you are looking down the muzzle.  That is the kind of negotiation we are going to have after the Bill becomes law.</P>

      <P>We have to read Section 18 as redrafted in connection with Section 24.  The Minister implies that this section simply gives him authority to do certain things when he <Col N="1487" /> makes up his mind to do them.  He has indicated earlier that the regulations or the machinery cannot be enforced in every part of the country at the same time but the Bill gives him power to order a health authority to put certain machinery into operation. Section 24 indicates that the Minister may make regulations &ldquo;applicable to every health authority, every health authority of a particular class or to a particular health authority&rdquo; and that the regulations may prescribe the manner in which the powers can be exercised and the extent to which the powers may be exercised.  So that the Minister has power to discriminate as between the various authorities as to the extent to which the scheme will be put into operation at any particular moment or in any particular manner.</P>
      <P>It would help us all if the Minister gave us some idea as to some geographical area in which he is going to approach the matter in the early days with a view to putting a scheme into operation.  The Minister indicated that it might be possible to put it into operation in the City of Dublin at an early stage.  The City of Dublin is a very special case and I think we would all be very interested to get from the Minister some idea as to the kind of machinery he was going to operate in the City of Dublin which would give full medical treatment to women and children in the way he has indicated here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that from the point of view of the problem of which Deputy Dr. O'Higgins spoke, it would be desirable that we should have some idea as to the part of rural Ireland in which the Minister intended in the early days to put the scheme into operation.  He said that he could order a health authority to put a scheme into operation. When a particular authority, say the authority in Westmeath, is ordered by the Minister to put a scheme into operation, is it the health authority that starts negotiations with the medical officers or is it the Minister who will start negotiations with the doctors in the locality?  What exactly is the process going to be?  I think it is very important that we should <Col N="1488" /> have the Minister's views on that particular matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Higgins speaks of the effect of this Bill on dispensary doctors but there are also other medical practitioners who will be affected by it. Take any large urban centre where there are doctors in private practice who have no official appointments as dispensary doctors.  As soon as this scheme is put into operation in their area, there is taken away from them the greater part of their ordinary private practice.  In any contemplation for loss of livelihood such as Deputy Dr. O'Higgins spoke about, that particular class of medical practitioner should be taken into consideration. What is going to happen a doctor living out of private practice in, say, a substantial urban centre when this scheme is put into operation?  He is going to have the greater part of his livelihood taken away from him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be very interested to hear a neighbour of my own, Deputy Dr. Brennan, give his views on this proposal because I think a queer situation arises.  Deputy Dr. O'Higgins is of course well versed in medical matters and experience but I suppose he has had most of that experience in the eastern part of the country, for which I am not competent to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know the usual practice there but I would be amazed to hear from dispensary doctors coming from the part of Connacht in which I live that the volume of red tickets they receive is in any sense substantial. There are all sorts of medical services provided free at the present time but no considerable body of the population avails of them.  I think it is the exception rather than the rule for a dispensary doctor in the west to be summoned on a red ticket to anyone but those who are virtually destitute.  The fee may be small; the fee very often is nominal; the fee very often is not paid but the doctor goes on the understanding that he is going to a fee-paying patient and not in answer to a summons on a red ticket.  I think it is right that I should emphasise that it not infrequently happens that the fee never gets paid and those of us who know dispensary doctors appreciate <Col N="1489" /> very warmly the extent to which they attend the poor amongst their neighbours, sparing them what would be for them the humiliation of presenting a red ticket and yet foregoing a fee because they feel they are not in financial circumstances which would justify the doctor pressing them for payment.</P>
    <P>But I cannot see the institution of ante-natal clinics and provision for maternity welfare of that kind substantially reducing the fee-paying practice of the dispensary doctor in the part of Ireland from which I come because I do not anticipate that 10 per cent. of the total panel of patients with whom he deals will avail of those free services. Consider any small town in the West of Ireland and the houses from which the dispensary doctor draws the bulk of his fees.  How many residents who own their home are going to send their wives to the dispensary for ante-natal care, to sit in the dispensary waiting to move in in due course to the dispensary nurse and the dispensary doctor in the public dispensary?  I think very few.</P>
    <P>Now, if the addition of some of the services outlined in Sections 18, 19 and 20, which I believe we are considering more or less together, should involve a reduction in the actual area of a dispensary doctor's dispensary, in many parts of the country that may be a great blessing, because some of these areas are much too big, but I am not altogether sure that that must inevitably reduce the dispensary doctor's income. What I think it is going to do is this&mdash;to make it virtually impossible for the young doctor to set up, as some of them do at the present time, and earn a livelihood side by side with the dispensary doctor.  I think you will find in most dispensary districts that when a young doctor hangs out his shingle a good many people say: &ldquo;Ah, that will vex the dispensary doctor,&rdquo; and then discover, to their amazement, that the most relieved man in the parish is the dispensary doctor because he knows that, being the senior man, being the established man, he will retain the bulk of the fees and it is not altogether unwelcome, very frequently, to have a second doctor in the area who carries part of the burden and who <Col N="1490" /> will do locum for him if he wants to go away for a day to the races.</P>
    <P>If, however, you reduce the size of the dispensaries and increase the number of public health doctors throughout rural Ireland the principal effect, I think, will be that no young man may attempt to set up a practice in rural Ireland unless he has a dispensary. Apart from that, I do not think it will have very much effect on the existing income of the doctors who are practising in that part of the country which I know.  I want to emphasise that I am making that reservation because I fully appreciate that in eastern Ireland, where you have a large number of agricultural labourers, you may have a very much larger section of the population using the red-ticket system and a completely different set-up.  So far as the part I know is concerned, I doubt if this arrangement will make very much difference to the doctors' emoluments or earning capacity.  When I read of all these magnificent schemes about ante-natal care, etc., etc., I am a little amused because all of us know perfectly well that the vast bulk of the population will never avail of them.  If they want ante-natal care the husbands will send for the doctor but the wives are not going to sit in a dispensary and advertise to all and sundry that they are going to have a child in eight months' time because my experience about the neighbours at home is that that is a matter about which they have a quite extraordinary delicacy.  There is a kind of universal conspiracy to avoid letting the neighbours know too soon.  God only knows why.  But if you think the average young girl or seasoned matron is going to notify the whole parish eight months before her child is born that she thinks that she is going to have one, you never made a greater mistake.</P>
    <P>When we come to the child welfare department and get down to Section 21, I think we are in a different sphere of country altogether because, if I read that section, as amended, correctly, it is quite daft and if left in the Bill in its present form, will certainly result in the Bill being declared unconstitutional. I had to warn you about that once before and I was told I was a bad <Col N="1491" /> dog and was just trying to vex de Valera.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Taoiseach got a shock this afternoon.  Now I hope the Minister for Finance will polish his spectacles as I have polished mine and take the precaution of consulting Bunreacht na hEireann before we go very much further with the next section we have to discuss.  Pending the discussion of that section, I want to raise a specific question, distinct from the general matter of principle touched upon by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins. I observe in the sections under discussion that the Minister has power to direct the health authority to provide for the treatment of children's illnesses and defects and to ascertain cases of mental deficiency.  I want to ask him this specific question, and I would greatly appreciate a categorical reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the last Public Health Bill was before the Dáil I received what I understood to be an assurance that in the event of its passing one of the first things to be done under a similar section would be to direct the Dublin Corporation to establish a psychiatric clinic for children in the City of Dublin to which delinquent children brought before the Children's Court and remanded in custody might be sent so that during the period of their remand their psychological condition could be investigated, their physical health examined and an adequate report made to the district justice on these matters before he finally made up his mind how to deal with them.  I read of proposals for the examination of all the children in the national schools, sick and well, and with that proposition everybody seems to agree without any doubt at all.  There is, every Friday, gathered in the Children's Court in Dublin Castle a group of children, drawn almost exclusively from the houses of the poor, whose conduct manifests the existence of some defect in their physique or psychology, whose conduct cannot be explained on any other basis than that they are in some sense abnormal.  Do Deputies <Col N="1492" /> of this House realise that there is no machinery available to anybody for determining the quality of that defect and that the district justice is obliged to dispose of those children in absolute ignorance of the most essential information that he should have before making up his mind how best to deal with them and that they must be dispatched to an institution which, of its nature, is obliged to receive them on the assumption that they are normal and free from defect and to treat them accordingly?  It is from such as these that the inmates of Borstal come and the recidivist persons who serve in penal servitude prisons.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister will he say this: that when this Bill is passed he intends, under the powers conferred upon him, to require of the Dublin Corporation, in collaboration with the Department of Justice, to institute such a clinic as I have in mind so as to ensure that here after every child brought before the Children's Court who cannot in the circumstances be returned at once to the custody of its parents and who must be retained in custody on remand will be sent not to a bleak remand home, with no amenities whatever in it, but to a properly equipped psychiatric clinic where whatever difficulties the child labours under may be diagnosed and where the authorities of it will have power to prescribe that the proper treatment for the correction of those defects will be made available and where the parents of the child will be facilitated in getting for their child that without which the child must grow up a problem and, possibly, an enemy of society&mdash;that for which they themselves cannot afford to pay and that for which we all know we would be able to afford to pay and would procure for our own children were they similarly affected.  May I mention this?  I have been pressing in this House for 12 weary years the necessity of the institution of such a clinic as I here prescribe.  I know of no Deputy in any part of the House who has argued against me on this subject. How long, oh Lord, how long! Are we ever going to reach the stage when somebody will take sufficient interest in this particular small group of children to provide the means of their <Col N="1493" /> redemption?  The cost would be trivial.  The means and personnel to equip it effectively are available. Nothing now is required but the initiative to put the matter in train. Will the Minister now say that it is his intention to do so without delay, for if he will I will charge myself with the responsibility of reminding him of his undertaking at that proper time and I feel certain that nothing more than that would be necessary once such an undertaking had been given by him?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinBrennan" hpid="Dr. Brennan Dr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I am in substantial agreement with what Deputy Dr. O'Higgins said in connection with the position in which dispensary doctors will find themselves when this Bill is put into operation.  I am satisfied, however, that the Minister will be perfectly reasonable and that he will meet dispensary doctors and discuss the situation with them.  I would be glad if it would be possible for him to meet representatives of the dispensary doctors before the Report Stage of this Bill and that he would then be in a position to tell us what he proposes to do or introduce some clause whereby he would provide that the remuneration would be in proportion to the additional duties assigned to dispensary doctors and also that due consideration of the private practice taken from them as a result of the new duties imposed would be considered.</P>
      <P>Another question will also arise: that is the question of the training of doctors for those duties that will be assigned to dispensary doctors.  As a dispensary doctor, I would not be conversant with the duties which are at present carried out by the county medical officers of health.  It would be necessary to have some short courses for dispensary doctors in which they would be given a general idea of the type of work, which would be new to all dispensary doctors.  There would also be the question as to whether we could supply the necessary number of qualified nurses for that type of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question that what applies of course to dispensary doctors as regards taking away private practice would also apply to the dispensary <Col N="1494" /> midwife.  The case of the dispensary midwife should also be taken into consideration when the assignment of the extra duties to doctors and nurses under this new scheme comes into operation.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that the Minister has seen fit to take note of this question of mental deficiency.  It is a big problem, especially in the rural districts, where people are still inclined to hide the fact that they have anyone mentally deficient in their home.  I think that, under this mother and child welfare service and with the inspections contemplated, it would be possible to find out the extent of that problem.  I am aware that the Minister is getting some of the county medical officers of health to agree with him to investigate that problem.  The question will then arise&mdash;where are these people to be treated?  I have sent cases of that type to local institutions.  They had to be kept there for months and months before a place could be found for them in an institution where they could be properly looked after.  I hope that, under this scheme of hospitalisation, due consideration will be given to that problem, and that there will be proper institutions provided by the Government to cater for a substantially greater number of such cases than can be catered for at the moment.</P>
    <P>I agree with some of the things Deputy Dillon has said about tickets. I do not think that the fact that people have been discouraged to get red tickets means that there is not as much free medical treatment given to-day as in former times.  The fact is that, at present, dispensary doctors do not insist rigidly on the presentation of a ticket.  They realise that if they were to do so patients might feel that they were not getting the sympathy and the consideration which they expect from the doctor.  In the West of Ireland at any rate it is true to say that doctors are not insisting rigidly on the presentation of tickets.  I think that is all to the good.  I think that the presentation of the ticket was a relic of the old slavery that existed in the country.  I should like to see that system abolished altogether.  I am satisfied that if a person is not able to pay, or does not <Col N="1495" /> present a ticket, that the doctor will act as conscientiously and as faithfully as if he were getting a fee.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Higgins that there will be a substantial reduction in the income of dispensary doctors as a result of the operation of this proposal. I cannot agree with Deputy Dillon that if you divide a dispensary district and put two men there, that the dispensary doctor will be as well off as he was before.  Is it not obvious that, if you divide a district, the private practice will be divided, and that there will, therefore, be a substantial reduction in the income which a doctor gets from his private practice?  I think there cannot be any justification for the theory put forward by Deputy Dillon. I think that the Minister should see the dispensary doctors and also the representatives of the midwives.  In that connection, due consideration should also be given to the private practitioner.  I should like, if it were possible, that the Minister would see the members of the profession before the Report Stage of the Bill is taken. In that event he might be in a position to give the House a better outline of his policy in this respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputies would like to join in the well-deserved tribute which the Minister paid to the three maternity hospitals in this city.  The most interesting portion of his statement as it applies to Dublin was that in future the care of the child, up to the age of 12 months, would be the responsibility of the three maternity hospitals in the city.  I should like if the Minister would amplify his statement and indicate what the machinery will be when that new change comes to be operated. I can understand that the three hospitals will be able to provide the medical and nursing attendance, but I venture to think that the treatment will have to go much deeper than that.  There will be the question of suitable accommodation and, so far as the mother and child are concerned, the question of clothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to proper housing conditions, to what extent will the hospital authorities be empowered to implement the <Col N="1496" /> full machinery of this section?  Will there be any conflict as between the hospital authorities and the local health authorities, and to what extent does the Minister propose that there should be liaison arrangements between the two?  In asking that, I have in mind the position that is likely to arise in so far as the child welfare department of the City of Dublin is concerned.  We have a very excellent department there as the present time, inadequate only in so far as personnel is concerned.  It is doing remarkably good work.  To what extent will it be affected under the new machinery suggested by the Minister?  I think it is important that we should have some details of that kind before we pass from the section.</P>
    <P>I am not able to adjudge what the position with regard to the dispensary doctors will be.  It would appear that we shall have a different type of machinery so far as the City of Dublin is concerned.  As an ordinary layman, I should like to add my voice to the appeal made by Deputy O'Higgins and supported by Deputy Dr. Brennan that there should be consultation with the people concerned.  I think that very good results might result from such consultation.  Apparently, there is going to be a radical change so far as the dispensary doctors are concerned. In so far as they may have serious apprehensions with regard to their position, I think that a conference between them and the Minister might be a very good thing indeed.</P>
    <P>I support wholeheartedly the plea made by Deputy Dillon.  He has made this subject of the mentally defective child his special care here for years past.  I think that he may rightly claim the support of every Deputy in the House for the suggestion that he has made, and that he should seek for more than an assurance from the Minister that when this Bill becomes law the Dublin Corporation will be required to set up the type of clinic that he has suggested.  May I say that even now the Dublin Corporation would be only too pleased to set up the type of clinic he speaks of if it were empowered under the present law to do so?  My information is that it is not.  Therefore, I suggest to Deputy Dillon that <Col N="1497" /> he should try to get more than an assurance from the Minister requiring the Dublin Corporation to set up this clinic.  That assurance will be valueless in my opinion unless the Minister takes steps to see that there is some section in the Bill authorising the corporation to provide the service that Deputy Dillon and other members of the House would like to see in operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two things that we ought to keep separate when talking about this section.  One is the obligation that we put on the local authorities and the health authorities to provide this mother and child welfare service.  We are going a bit further than that.  There was an Act passed in 1915 which is referred to as the Notification of Births (Extension) Act.  It is laid down there that sanitary authorities may make such arrangements as they think fit, with the sanction of the Local Government Board for Ireland, for attending to the health of expectant and nursing mothers and of children under five years of age.  We had, therefore, from that period the duty&mdash;while not so specifically enforced, perhaps&mdash;laid on the local authorities to consider this question or provide these services as far as they thought it advisable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next thing raised was the school inspection.  We are going a bit further than that in these clauses here, by making it obligatory on the health authority to provide these services for the mother and for the child up to 16 years of age.  The health authority will have to provide these services.  The question has been put whether it is the health authority or the Minister would carry on the negotiations with the medical men.  There will be two sets of negotiations, as far as I can visualise the position. I should say that the Minister will meet the Medical Association and the Association of Dispensary Officers and discuss generally with them the new powers that they will be asked to take over by the health authorities.  I am quite sure that they will be able to argue their case fairly effectively, as far <Col N="1498" /> as the extra work is concerned and as far as the loss of private practice is concerned. I did meet the Medical Association already and they had thought of those points before they were raised here at all.</P>
    <P>Then we may take it that there will be a second set of negotiations in each particular area.  When the health authority is changing the size of the dispensary, all relative factors will have to be taken into account.  I have no doubt whatever, if a dispensary doctor has a certain area at the present time and if he claims on the one hand that he would have too much work in the new area and on the other hand claims that, if part of it is taken from him, he will lose a certain amount of private practice, these things will have to be kept in mind and an agreement reached with these men.</P>
    <P>I was asked if I could meet the dispensary doctors at this stage.  I had a preliminary talk with the Medical Association on this Bill and pointed out that nothing very much could be done until the Bill would pass, if it was going to pass, and at that stage we could discuss their position in view of the regulations to be made.  As far as my recollection goes, I do not think they thought that unreasonable.  They did ask to see me again recently and I said I thought there was no great use in meeting them until the Bill had gone through the Oireachtas.  If they press I do not mind meeting them.  I would be very loath to refuse to meet representatives of a body of men who are very seriously concerned in a measure of this kind, but if I do meet them at this stage all I can say is that, as soon as the Bill goes through, we will be able to get down to talk business.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with what Deputy O'Higgins says, that the Minister should have met these men before the Bill was brought in.  What could he say to them?  Is it not obvious that the negotiations go down practically to each individual county where the changes are being made?  They go down to individual classes, at any rate. As I said already, if an agreement is reached with these dispensary men, some of them will probably have to surrender part of the territory, because they would have too much to do otherwise. <Col N="1499" /> In some cases, it may be possible to appoint an assistant to a dispensary medical officer and leave him as he is.  That would be so in a fair-sized town.  There would be various ways of dealing with each man's difficulties as the case may be.</P>
    <P>The case was mentioned of men who are in private practice.  That case was also raised when I met the Medical Association and I said we would have to consider that and see what could be done.  In the first place, of course, if there are young men, a number of them may be appointed to new dispensaries or as assistants to existing dispensary men.  If you take a man in private practice in a town and if the clauses are passed as they are here, if the parents must send their children to school to be inspected or, alternatively, get the private practitioner to inspect them and send in a certificate, it will give more practice to those private practitioners than they get at the moment and not less, as I have no doubt whatever that, under the Act, a number of parents will send in the certificate to show that the child has been inspected rather than send the child to stand amongst other children for inspection.</P>
    <P>With regard to mental deficiency, I do not know if it arises in particular here, but I am very interested in that subject.  First of all, we will probably need legislation, as the Mental Treatment Act dealt only with a certain class of people, and I think we will have to bring along proposals to the Dáil for legislation on this question of mental deficiency.  In the meantime, I think we can do practically anything we are asked to do here.  One of the difficulties we have in regard to mental defectives is that we have not got nearly enough accommodation for institutional treatment.  We are making moves in that direction. Since I became Minister for Health, I have sanctioned a scheme for the enlargement of one institution and at least one scheme for a new institution for mental defectives; but we want many more than that before we will have sufficient.</P>
    <P>Deputies know that these people have to be graded.  Some of them can <Col N="1500" /> be turned into quite ordinary citizens capable of earning a livelihood, some of them may be improved at least to the point of looking after their person, and some of them are practically hopeless, at least as far as medical science goes at the moment.  Therefore, we have to provide a number of institutions to deal with these various classes and we are getting on with that as quickly as we can.</P>
    <P>As regards the specific request for a clinic here in Dublin for the examination of those children who come before the Children's Court, I have no doubt that it will come in time, but I would not like to say just here and now what it may be possible to do.  I shall certainly make inquiries into the matter and see whether it may be possible to do something on those lines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that will be necessary. I would like to point out to Deputy Dillon and others that, until we get these institutions going, we will be limited in what we can do with regard to those children who may be mentally defective.  The last question raised was concerning the lying-in hospitals.  These have agreed to carry out this scheme in the City of Dublin for the welfare of the mother and for the child until the child is one year old.  They will do that, first, by ante-natal clinics in the hospitals and also by domiciliary visits by nurses employed by these lying-in hospitals. Then they will carry on as at the moment by providing, so far as they can, for confinements in the hospitals, and, as well as that, sending out nurses, students, and, if necessary, doctors, to women confined in their own homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be post-natal clinics for these mothers and for the children up to one year old, and again, where they are not in a position to visit the clinics, there will be domiciliary visits by nurses and, if necessary, by doctors from the lying-in hospitals. When the child reaches the age of one year, all records will go to the health authority.  The health authority has been in these negotiations and has <Col N="1501" /> approved of the scheme, so that there is a perfect understanding between the health authority in the City of Dublin and the lying-in hospitals on this matter.</P>

      <P>It strikes me very forcibly that, in order to make these sections effective, it would be better to get local authorities to have maternity wards available in every hospital.  It is very doubtful if you will be able to get the ordinary people in rural areas, or even in towns, to attend the dispensaries for the purpose of getting instructions from the doctor.  Take, for instance, mothers and expectant mothers.  It will be very hard to get them there, whereas, if they were encouraged to go into a maternity ward for, say, a fortnight or three weeks before confinement and for a month after, it would be much more effective from the point of view of the welfare of the child.  I cannot see for the life of me how it will be possible for the dispensary doctor to instruct all mothers and expectant mothers in his area, and the general feeling is that it would be much more practical to have maternity wards attached to all the existing county and rural hospitals. That would overcome much of the difficulty which arises in these areas and, in my opinion, would be 100 per cent. effective in safeguarding the future of the mother and the welfare of the child.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister has no intention of misleading the Dáil, even to a minor extent, and I freely admit that my recollection may be at fault, but the Minister, in the course of his remarks, stated that he had met representatives of the Irish Medical Association, and, taken in conjunction with the subject he was discussing, this Bill, one would assume that that meeting was in relation to this Bill.</P>

      <P>No, I should like to correct that impression.  I do not want to mislead the Dáil and it would be very bad if I tried to do so.  The Medical Association came to me with regard to the present cost of living and we discussed that matter.  They made a few remarks about private practice and I <Col N="1502" /> said that we would discuss that later on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I was about to say.  The meeting the Minister had with the Medical Association was with regard to a national increase <i>vis-à-vis</i> the cost of living.  This Bill was not even in their hands at that time.</P>

      <P>The Minister informed them that, when the Bill came, he would have to discuss the matter of their remuneration under the Bill. They have requested and urged upon the Minister to see them and discuss these things before the Bill becomes law, because they are not asleep to the delicacy and the dangers of the position, namely, that their bargaining power is very considerably reduced once this Bill becomes law.  The Bill lays down that the health authorities shall make provision for a certain number of things.  It does not make it mandatory, I admit, on the dispensary doctor to give his services, but it does make it mandatory on the health authority to have a scheme in accordance with the Minister's regulations. The Minister may decide: &ldquo;We will allow any dispensary doctor who wishes to keep out of the Bill to keep out of it, but we are going to see that the services under the Bill are given.&rdquo;  How will they be given?  They will be given by having another doctor, or two other doctors, salaried by the Department, in the district to carry out the services outlined in the Bill, plus anything and everything else they can get from the recalcitrant doctor who does not toe the line and do as he is bid.  Surely the Minister will not argue that the doctor's bargaining position will not be considerably worsened when this Bill becomes law.  I think it is obvious.</P>
      <P>With regard to the extent to which a doctor may be very seriously hit in his private practice by these clauses, I do not pretend to know nearly as much as Deputy Dillon with regard to the customs or inclinations of the coy ladies of Connaught&mdash;whether they would go to a maternity clinic or not.</P>

      <P>It may be that they would be reluctant to do so, but the very smallest extent to which they will be injured under these clauses would be in the matter of maternity clinics. I do not think Deputy Dillon adverted to the fact that any and every illness or defect&mdash;not just maternity work but any and every illness or defect from which the classes referred to may suffer &mdash; is to be treated free &mdash; the infant, the child and the youth&mdash; whether it is pneumonia, appendicitis or a broken leg.  If I can read English, that is what this phrase &ldquo;provide for treatment of their illnesses and defects&rdquo; means.  We have already been told that the treatment referred to here is to be free and freely available, so that for every and any illness or defect that any child, male or female of any class, up to 16 years of age may suffer from, there is free treatment available.  We are also told&mdash; and this was hammered in and it is important, if this Bill is to be a success &mdash;the work, duties and services established under this Bill will be in no way associated with the poor law services which still have the taint of destitution and pauperism.  That was made very clear on the introduction of the other Bill and of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Because there are 77 Deputies over there; that is why it will go through, anyway.  I am not objecting to that in theory.  If we could give bread, meat, tea, sugar, butter and houses free to all the people of the country without injury to the bakers, the grocers, the butchers, or anybody else, it would be a grand country.  We are proposing to give free medical treatment, but we are to give it free by injuring the doctors, or, at all events, we are not prepared to say how we propose to compensate the doctors.  What we do say is that as soon as we have the law behind us then we will talk to the doctors.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan, who is sitting two seats behind the Minister, asked to have the negotiations with the doctors carried out before the Report Stage. Deputy Brennan is no fool.  He knows very well the difference between negotiating with and meeting the doctors before this Bill is law and afterwards; so do the Minister's advisers know. When this Bill becomes law, it will not be a case of &ldquo;How much will you take&rdquo;; it will be a case of &ldquo;How much I am prepared to give you&rdquo;, and whatever is given, be it little or much, there will be no alternative but to accept.  All I say is that the profession deserve better of the Department, of the Dáil and of the country than to be treated in that way.  If it were any other organised section of the community who were freer, if you like, to use weapons that doctors cannot use, no Minister would dare to treat them that way; no Minister, no matter how many votes he had behind him, would come into the Dáil with proposals to treat them that way&mdash;that he would put them on the wrong side of the law and after that negotiate with them.  It is not fair play and it is not justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made reference to school inspection by every dispensary doctor and I can see a lot to be said for it.  But, remember, the health statistics of the country are based on the returns from the various administrative areas.  We have never reached the point of having uniform standards <Col N="1505" /> and the health statistics at the moment are based on 30 different standards. The standard of classification for, say, malnutrition in one county differs very much from the standard in the next. The standard as to what would be classified as an enlarged tonsil in one county differs very much from the standard in the next.  Doctors, of course, have different standards, except they go through some machinery for arriving at something like a common standard.  In army medical services all over the world that is the very first of many difficulties that have to be faced&mdash;different standards coming up from the different regimental and medical officers and, so far as possible, you get them to a common depôt where an agreed standard will be reached. Then you have something like a uniform standard.</P>
    <P>Even with regard to the county medical officers of health at the moment you have 30 different standards. Our health statistics are faulty to the extent that the standards differ. People often ask: &ldquo;Why is it you have so much more goitre in one area than in another?&rdquo; The answer may well be that the standard of what would be classified as a goitre worth mentioning differs between one administrative area and another.  We are all conscious of that and we know it; but, as I say, we have 30 different standards at present.</P>
    <P>Now we are going to put 1,000 men on the job, some of them trained in medicine in the last century, some of them having completed their training in the last month; all the dispensary men that are there at the moment and the extra 300 or 500 that the Minister indicated on the Second Stage of the Bill. Where will that land us?  In Bedlam.</P>
    <P>You might just as well liquidate your statistical department so far as health is concerned, because you cannot base national health statistics on 1,000 different standards.  It may be that you will have some system for making something like a rough-and-ready national standard.  But the more I read this Bill and the more I see the implications of different sections, the more I am convinced that we are legislating in haste and that we will do the consideration, the deliberation and the <Col N="1506" /> consultation after we are committed to a certain course.</P>
    <P>The Minister knew when he was over here and knows since he went over there that when a Minister introduces a Bill the Ministerial colours are hoisted and nailed to the mast.  It is too late then to have a Bill altered or modified to any extent.  The points that might arise on an important question like health should all have arisen and been discussed before the Ministerial colours were swung up.  After a Bill becomes law the position is very much worsened. It is not only a Ministerial retreat and a hauling down of the colours; it is a case of coming into the Dáil with an amending Bill to make not only the Minister and his Department, but all the Deputies of Dáil Éireann, look foolish in the public estimation.  If portions of this Bill which we are putting through turn out to be unwise or unworkable, we will have travelled somewhat further along a road that we should only have trod with caution.  All these conversations, negotiations, and discussions which the Minister says will be carried out in the dim and distant future, but only when the Bill becomes law, should have been carried out before the Bill was introduced.</P>
    <P>The Minister for a great many years was Minister for Agriculture.  During these years when he was Minister for Agriculture I do not believe that he ever introduced any legislation affecting the cattle of this country or the health or welfare of the cattle without discussing it with some organised section representing the agricultural mind. He was only dealing with cattle then; now he is dealing with humans, and his attitude in his dealing with humans is &ldquo;I will get my Bill through first and then I will discuss it with the people entitled to have views and expected to know most about health problems&rdquo;. It is very different from the way things were done on the other side of the water.  There they had years of negotiation and then legislation, years of negotiation in advance, negotiation going on all the time the Bill was under discussion, and the chits going in and coming out from Parliament, negotiation following the passage of the Bill and even during the different stages of the Bill, the Bill being altered, <Col N="1507" /> amended and remoulded because of the advice given.</P>
    <P>In the past, one of the curses of this country was the number of secret societies and now every Government Department is to become a kind of secret society, framing and considering legislation in secret without any of the affected parties, any of the experienced personnel that knows something about the subject, being consulted, every one of them locked out.  Then the Bill is brought into Parliament, where the bells ring and it becomes law, assurances and promises being given that, after the Bill became law, &ldquo;We will then talk to you about what should or should not have been in the Bill or how it should operate&rdquo;.  I can only raise my voice against the wisdom of proceeding along such a course; the rest is for the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to hear somebody defend or justify the proposition that my neighbour should pay for medical attendance on my child. In the name of God, why should that be?  I can quite see that it is a good thing to provide, throughout the country, the best medical attention available for anybody who is not able to afford a doctor, so that nobody's child will go unattended simply because that child's parents are poor.  But how do you proceed logically from that principle to the proposition that in this country the State will provide medical attention for the children of everybody?  Why should you not clothe my child?  Why should you not provide him with everything else?  I consider that is a daft principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I know the clues to this foolish proposal.  One is the extremely bad example of the Socialist Government in Great Britain and the other is the basis of family allowances in this country.  The reason family allowances were made applicable universally here is a purely administrative reason, because we do not want to apply a means test in the case of every applicant.  What we provided was that any person who is liable to income-tax would have his income-tax allowance abated by an amount to correspond with what he actually receives <Col N="1508" /> under the Children's Allowances Acts so that, in fact, he would not benefit at all.  But for purely administrative reasons and to avoid the means test we gave it to everybody. Surely to God we are not going to take that as a precedent for declaring that every citizen, without regard to his income or circumstances, is entitled to bespeak the services of the dispensary doctor and then tell him that is part of his duties for which he is paid by the county council.</P>
    <P>I do not choose that the county council should pay for the medical treatment of myself and my family.  If I fall on hard times, I prefer to depend on charity; I elect to go to a charitable institution rather than to the State or authorities acting under the State.  If I were a resident in Dublin I would go to the Sisters of Charity or the Sisters of Mercy or some charitable institution and there seek assistance rather than go around to a public health dispensary and take State aid.  It is no shame for someone who is poor to turn to the source of charity which is provided there for the purpose of consoling and helping those who need medical treatment, but I think any Christian man may feel a very profound reluctance in passing over his family responsibilities to the State.</P>
    <P>That we in this House should announce that every man's child hereafter, whether his parents desire it or not, must become the responsibility of the State in so far as the maintenance of its health is concerned, is to me an astonishing and most undesirable proceeding. I think the initiative in bringing the individual child or the individual expectant mother within the scope of this scheme should be most strictly reserved to the family to which that mother or child belongs.  There should be every facility for any family requiring such assistance to get it, but the initiative in be speaking it should be a matter for the family, and any attempt to short-circuit that is, in my opinion, a most undesirable development of a trend which is becoming all too strong the world over of abrogating to the State the duties which God Almighty laid upon a man and woman when they chose within the bonds of matrimony to bring children into the world.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1509" /> There is no use writing Article 41 into the Constitution if, when legislation comes to be passed by this House, Article 41 is treated as if it were clap-trap.  Either the State recognises the family &ldquo;as the natural, primary and fundamental unit group of society and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law&rdquo;, as set out in Article 41, or it does not.  If we continue to permit the State to take over one duty after another of the parents of the family, it must be perfectly clear that when Article 41 was enacted by this State, somebody had his tongue in his cheek. I cannot too strongly emphasise a distinction between automatically bringing everybody's children, whether they like it or not, within schemes like this and making this scheme available to any family in the country who desires to avail of it.  I am in favour of the latter proposal, but I am radically opposed to the first.</P>
    <P>I want to inquire of the Minister, in connection with the powers taken under this section, whether he intends to do anything with a view to remedying the extraordinary situation in the Dublin dispensaries where, in fact, the numbers attending the dispensaries make it utterly impossible for the dispensary doctor adequately to deal with patients who require his aid.  Has the Minister looked into that matter and has he any intention, under the powers conferred on him, to require the health authority in the City of Dublin to provide one doctor per so many patients as evidenced by attendances at dispensaries and the calls on dispensary doctors during the last four or five years? If my information is correct, the conditions in the dispensaries in the city are becoming almost farcical in that the doctors are asked or expected to treat numbers of people far in excess of the ability of the most industrious and hard-working man carefully and adequately to diagnose and treat their complaints.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I want to express amazement at Deputy Heskin's proposal.  If the National Agricultural Party is going to hospitalise every expectant mother in this country a month before <Col N="1510" /> confinement and keep her in hospital for a month afterwards, the whole country will be filled with lying-in hospitals and a system will obtain in this country unlike anything which obtains in any other civilised community in the world.  I think Deputies generally in the House will agree that it would be deplorable if a suggestion such as Deputy Heskin has put forward were adopted.  It may be sometimes necessary in special circumstances that a woman should have her baby in hospital but I think the weight of competent medical opinion would be that any woman who can have her baby in her own home would be very well advised to do so and that the general hospitalisation of expectant mothers is something greatly to be deprecated.</P>
    <P>I want lastly to press upon the Minister for Health, of whose goodwill I feel convinced, that the class of juveniles for whom I want clinical treatment falls between the class which is described as mentally deficient and the class which is described as normal.  A continually recurrent problem is how to provide for sub-normal children.  The urgency of the matter of the clinic which I here propose to the Minister is that, in my submission, the function of this clinic is to prevent the psychotic child from becoming mentally deficient or, more correctly, from becoming mentally deranged.  My hope is that we would establish by collaboration between the Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice a clinic of this character primarily designed to take the place of the remand home, and that round it would rapidly grow a child guidance clinic to which the problem child might be referred by the dispensary doctor or the medical practitioner in the City of Dublin.  At the present time if any general practitioner or dispensary doctor finds himself charged with the responsibility of advising parents what to do with a child whose conduct has reached such a degree of abnormality as to cause parents to bring it to a doctor, he is constrained to say: &ldquo;There is nothing we can do because there is no place to which you can bring such a child for treatment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>An essential pre-requisite adequately to treat that child is to get him into <Col N="1511" /> some clinic where he can be observed, without his knowing that he is being observed, so as to arrive at a correct diagnosis.  That is an essential pre-requisite and that can be done only by a staff highly trained for that purpose. If that is done, the vast majority of psychotic children&mdash;in this they are unlike psychotic adults&mdash; can be pulled back from the brink of insanity and made perfectly normal children.  Undoubtedly, it is only too true that in the case of the psychotic adult the prospects as to what the psychiatrist can do for him, on the evidence of results, are not encouraging, but the very reverse is true in the case of psychotic children.  There is abundant evidence of that in the child guidance clinics in London and in the innumerable child clinics that operate at present in the United States and in New Zealand.  It is a source of constant amazement to me that public health authorities in this country have evinced so very little interest in this problem and indeed sometimes react to petitions with impatience as if one were an eccentric in being interested in such matters when the problem is recognised and is being effectively dealt with in Great Britain, the United States of America and indeed in most of the Dominions.</P>
    <P>I dare to say that with every month that passes without a clinic of the kind at least one child who might have been saved is going over the border of mental derangement which may be diagnosed and bring it within the ambit of a mental hospital or which may be concealed and will wind up by its being shovelled into a recidivist prison as an incurable criminal.</P>
    <P>The problem is one which few people outside doctors know much about.  I feel certain it is one which has come under the personal attention of the Minister for Health in the course of his professional career and I bespeak his sympathetic and urgent support for the proposal to establish this clinic now, not only to provide for the children referred to it by the courts but in its development to enable every general practitioner and dispensary doctor in this city to take some steps <Col N="1512" /> to meet that recurrent and, to my mind, most desperate problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right, so.  We agree.  I met the consultative council that was set up and I discussed this Bill with them.  They are not satisfied either.  They raised some points which I promised to attend to.  As a matter of fact, I have dealt with a few of the points by amendment already, and as regards the position of the dispensary medical officers, as I have said, I pointed out that we would have to discuss all these various problems that might arise when the time would come. I do not think that they could expect that anything else could be said at this particular time.  What they want, of course, I must say, is this&mdash;not that their position should be settled now but that we should not bring in too much free treatment because that is going to interfere with private practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards this free service, Deputy Dillon asked how could it arise, or how could it be defended.  The mother and child welfare scheme in operation at <Col N="1513" /> the moment is free to everyone who wants to avail of it.</P>

      <P>In the original Public Health Bill, brought in last year, it was free also and when I was bringing in my Bill I had all points brought to my notice where Deputies were in disagreement with the Bill.  As far as I remember, nobody disagreed with the provision that they should be free. Therefore, we did not make any change.  The reason advanced for this free treatment is: It is essential that mothers and children should be looked after and it is argued that if you make certain people pay, those on the border-line may not adopt the best treatment for their wives and children because they may not be able to afford it.  If you do not give free treatment to everyone you must draw the line somewhere, at some level of income, or in some way of that kind, and the argument is that you might in that way make it difficult for certain people to adopt the best treatment for their wives and children or that they may not, at any rate, be too anxious to pay for the treatment that would be advisable. It was thought better, therefore, to offer this free treatment to everybody. Of course, the Department, before I went into it&mdash;and I agree with the view of the Department&mdash;were of opinion, and are still, that we should not, if possible, have any taint of charity in this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am quite prepared to admit that Deputy Dillon may give very good arguments against it and if Deputy Dillon will put down an amendment we could have an interesting discussion as to whether it should be free or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But the initiative at present is from the State to the family.  I think the principle is safe if the initiative is passed over to the family.  Let the family ask for free treatment and they will get it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the point, yes.  That is not the position.  The family will be entitled under this Bill to demand free treatment from the medical officer, whoever he may be, but I am inclined to think&mdash;and I think Deputy Dillon thinks the same&mdash;that many people will not ask for this free treatment; they will pay.  There is, I think, a historical error in one of Deputy Dillon's statements.  He said we are following the Socialist Government in England.  It was the Coalition Government that brought in this principle.</P>

      <P>As to the number of doctors in Dublin, I could not say what the position is at the moment but I have no doubt that when these schemes come in, such as mother and child welfare, we will require a very much bigger staff of medical men in the City of Dublin.  It means adding to the staff in each dispensary or making more dispensaries.  As far as I have given any thought to that subject, I think it would be better to add to the staffs in the dispensary districts as they are.</P>

      <P>Certainly.  Deputy O'Higgins raised the point referred to by Deputy Dillon.  I think there is a tendency that way, that women, even in the country, are inclined to go into hospital for their confinement and if there is a big tendency in that direction as years go on I suppose we will have to provide for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move Amendment No. 11:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 24, after the word &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;and subject to the consent of the child's parents&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
      <P>The section, as it stands at present, reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A health authority shall, in accordance with regulations made under Section 24 of this Act, do, in respect of children in their functional area who are not pupils of any school, the following things&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  safeguard and improve their health and physical condition;</P>
      <P>(b)  arrange for their medical inspection at schools or other places;</P>
      <P>(c)  provide for their education in matters relating to health;</P>
      <P>(d)  provide for treatment of their illnesses and defects;</P>
      <P>(e)  ascertain cases of mental deficiency.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of my amendment would be that the opening of the section would read, &ldquo;A health authority shall, in accordance with the regulations made under Section 24 of this Act, and subject to the consent of the child's parents, do, in respect of children in their functional area who are not pupils of any school, the following things...&rdquo; I submit to the Minister that it is imperative to insert that amendment there.  By the natural law it is the family and not the State which is charged with the duty of promoting the physical welfare of the members. The State may be required in case of necessity to offer assistance to the family but, in giving that assistance, it must be careful to respect the autonomy of the family.  If the State intrudes in this matter and overbears <Col N="1518" /> the authority of the family we will reach the position in which there will be a deterioration in family morale which will prove detrimental to the whole social strength of people here and I believe, as a result of that, detrimental to public health.  Article 41 of the Constitution has been quoted by Deputy Dillon in relation to our previous discussion.  I would ask the Minister to refer to Article 41 of the Constitution, sub-paragraphs 1 and 2, in which is laid down under the heading &ldquo;The Family&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;1.  The State recognises the family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
    <P>2.  The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the nation and the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Guarantees to protect the family in its constitution and authority.&rdquo; Article 42 of the Constitution, subparagraph 1 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;1.  The State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the family and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I submit to the Minister that the provisions of Section 19 here, and, as you say, Sir, also in a similar amendment of mine to Section 20, are such as to suggest that the Minister would propose to override the authority of the family, if necessary, in these matters. I submit that, in the first place, that would be wrong from a moral and from a natural law point of view.  I submit, in addition, that it would be contrary to our Constitution.  Therefore I move amendment No. 11, that these words be inserted, &ldquo;and subject to the consent of the child's parents.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy's two amendments are necessary. <Col N="1519" /> These are, if you like, directors to the health authorities to provide all these things but no child is obliged to accept treatment through its parents or otherwise.  The only compulsion that it is sought to insert in this part of the Bill is the compulsory examination of children in certain circumstances. That question can be discussed on amendment No. 14.  It is unnecessary to insert this amendment, and I suggest to the Deputy that he might withdraw his two amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand that the Minister's approach to this is that, under the regulations which he contemplates making under Section 24, there will be nothing in the way of taking power to override the authority of the parents in connection with the safeguarding of the health, medical inspection, the provision of education or the treatment of the illnesses of their children?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's line, therefore, I take it is that the regulations which will be made in relation to children as regards the safeguarding of their health, medical inspection, treatment of illnesses, the ascertainment as to whether they are mentally deficient or not, will not be subject to approval by the advisory health council.</P>

      <P>Before holding under Section 19 or Section 20 of this Act a medical inspection of the children of a particular class in an area or of the pupils of a school, a health authority shall give in the prescribed manner the prescribed notice of the time and place of such inspection.</P>
      <P>There was a certain amount of discussion on this section on Second Reading. I expressed the opinion as regards certain things that it might not be necessary to enforce the section, as it stood, in every county.  I thought that we might provide, at any rate, that it need not be enforced all over at any particular time.  Consequently, I am proposing to divide the section so that it may be possible to do what is proposed in the way set out.  The proposed new section will replace sub-section (1) of Section 21, and will extend its provisions to require notice to be given other than to non-residential schools.  If this new section is agreed to, we can take the remaining part of the section as a new section and discuss the principle of compulsory inspection on that.</P>

      <P>It should be understood that in many cases staff and other services are common to more than one scheme and that accurate segregation of the cost of such staff or service as between the various schemes is not possible.  That position applies particularly in the case of unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance, where by far the <Col N="1390" /> greater portion of the cost is in respect of salaries of officers of the employment branch who deal with both schemes, the portion of the time of officers devoted to each scheme varying from office to office and from day to day.  In addition, these officers perform other duties, some related directly to, and some only remotely connected with, their work on the schemes in question, e.g. placing of unemployed persons in employment, administration of the intermittent unemployment (&ldquo;wet-time&rdquo;) and the harvest labour schemes and emigration control, and no deduction has been made in the table following in respect of the cost of performing the duties in question, nor has it been found possible, for the reasons indicated, to segregate the cost between the two major schemes.</P>
      <P>Subject to the foregoing, the following is the information requested, in respect of the year 1945-46, the latest year for which audited figures are available:&mdash;</P>
