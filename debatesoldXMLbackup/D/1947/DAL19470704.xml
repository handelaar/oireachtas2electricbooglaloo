      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am formally opposing this motion in order to ascertain what the Minister has in mind.  I gather this Bill is for the purpose of giving statutory effect to certain readjustments in pensions and that it is necessary to have this statutory power in order to make the adjustments which the Minister has already decided upon. I see that item No. 11 provides for what is apparently a token Vote covering the sum involved and it is probably the legislative way of implementing the provisions of the Superannuation Bill.  Will the Minister say whether it is intended by item No. 11 to take power to make these adjustments now, allowing the Superannuation Bill to follow afterwards, giving statutory effect to what is proposed under the Supplementary Estimate?</P>

      <P>This Bill is entitled an Act to amend and extend certain enactments relating to superannuation.  A number of civil servants, who retired after the Standstill Order affected Civil Service salaries, did not get the pension or the bonus related to the cost-of-living figure.  It is proposed, as the Standstill Order has been abolished and an <Col N="924" /> agreement made with the civil servants regarding future salaries, to adjust the pensions affected by the Standstill Order.  That is what the Bill proposes to do.  It will be circulated, I hope, early in September.  It is drafted and item 11, which is merely a token Vote for £10, will give us power to pay out the lump sums and pensions which will be validated by the Bill.</P>

    <Title>Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Order) Bill, 1947&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Deputies are aware that an Order imposing duties of this character requires to be confirmed by legislation within eight months.  In January last, an Order was made imposing a customs duty on combs suitable for personal use or adornment.  These combs are made by an injection moulding process from imported plastic powders and they are manufactured here on a considerable scale.  The firms engaged in the business are, however, temporarily prevented from engaging in an export business.  Owing to the operation of <Col N="927" /> the non-discriminatory clause of the Washington Loan Agreement, the British Government has to exclude them from that country.  Efforts to engage in an export trade with other countries have also been impeded by Government regulations.  The import of these combs has increased considerably of late.  It apparently is the practice of the trade to sell cheaply combs which are produced in a defective way by the moulding process. The importation of these slightly defective articles at low rates constitutes a form of unfair competition which is prejudicing the development of the industry here.  The Government, therefore, decided to impose an <i>ad valorem</i> duty of 37½ per cent. or 25 per cent. preferential, which, of course, is the effective rate.  That duty was imposed in consideration of the fact that the articles to be produced here are to be sold at prices which will not be in excess of the price of similar articles sold in Great Britain and it is intended to require that the same standard of efficiency in production will be maintained.</P>
      <P>There are a number of people employed in the manufacture of these goods.  It is not easy to give the precise figure because the firms making the goods make other goods as well, but one firm in the vicinity of Dublin employs 140 persons.  Since the imposition of the duty, another concern has gone into the business, although I cannot give precise figures as to the employment afforded by that firm.  It is located at Nenagh, County Tipperary. I think the industry is one which should be capable of efficient development here.  Having regard to the abnormal circumstances which obtained in 1946 the duty was considered justifiable.  In fact, imports of combs in 1946 were valued at £64,000 as compared with an imports value of something like £10,000 or £12,000 prewar. Even allowing for increased values since the war, it is obvious that abnormal importations were taking place which justified the Government in making this Order to prevent irreparable damage being done to the industry here.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement, if it is supposed to be a sample of the kind of statements we are to get here, must be regarded as unsatisfactory and when the Minister considers the matter from the point of view of the House, I think he will realise that.  I would ask the Minister to review the general manner of the presentation of such matters to the House.  We are asked to put a substantial tariff here on manufactured combs.  There may be something to be said for that, but nothing that the Minister has said would indicate that there is.  He tells us that £64,000 worth of combs were imported into the country last year, but he gave us no information at all as to the value of the production in this country.  I could understand that it might be difficult to say exactly how many people are engaged in the manufacture of these goods but an attempt could surely be made to try to indicate what the wages factor in the total cost of combs manufactured here was.  The Minister cannot expect, having regard to the high cost of living here and the enormous rise in customs duties which are really not all coming from tobacco, that we can, without very careful examination of these things in relation to the employment they give and the cost to the people generally, agree to impose a comparatively high tariff on imported articles.  I should like the Minister to say what was the total value of the production of these articles here during the last three years and whether he can give any indication of the total amount of wages paid annually to workers employed in the manufacture of these goods.  These are some of the questions that should normally be asked and an attempt should be made to answer them before we impose substantial tariffs of this particular kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister what class of combs exactly are covered by the Order?  Is the duty levied only on combs manufactured of plastic material or is it levied on any type of combs no matter what class of material is used in their manufacture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On all classes of combs suitable for personal use or adornment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> It would not cover wool combs or industrial equipment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The case that has been made is that this Order imposes a duty on imported plastic combs which are now extensively manufactured in Britain and elsewhere.  It is put to me that there is still an affection for bone combs because the bone comb is a better article and that the effect of it is to impose a tariff on imported bone combs.  I am assured by those who import them that they do not mind whether this tariff goes on bone combs or not and that they are prepared to pay the tariff on the imported bone comb.  But the point is that those who prefer bone combs to plastic combs will have to pay more for their bone combs because it is not proposed to make these bone combs here.  What we are really doing is this&mdash;if my information is correct and I think, from an investigation I have made, that it is&mdash;we are proposing that those in the future who prefer a bone comb will have to pay extra duty for it.  There will be a duty on imported plastic combs, of course, but those who know the difference between bone and plastic combs tell me that if you want to get good value in a comb you should buy a bone comb and that if you want to buy a number of combs in the year you should buy a plastic comb because it does not last any length whereas the bone comb lasts a long time.  I do not say that this goes to the roots of our whole economic fabric and I am not raising the matter in any profound way but I would like the Minister to say what is the purpose of imposing a tariff on bone combs when we do not make bone combs unless it be for one purpose only and that is to make the person who says: &ldquo;A bone comb is better value, and in this matter of toilet I want to get the best value&rdquo; pay more for a bone comb, when nobody is making bone combs in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear as to what Deputy Mulcahy has in mind in regard to the general manner of presentation of proposals for legislation of this kind.  Normally attempts are made to group Bills of this kind so that they come to the Dáil as a series of measures implementing Government policy in regard to industrial development which leads to a general discussion. At the present time there are very few alterations in duty being made and, as the Deputy knows, the great majority of the duties which operated pre-war are suspended.  I am anxious to give the House as much information as possible.  It will be appreciated, however, that in a case of this kind it is difficult to give the precise details Deputy Mulcahy is seeking.  These combs are made by firms which are engaged in other forms of production as well.  Before the war none of these goods were made in this country.  When imports ceased during the war a number of firms went into the business of manufacturing these combs, using, in the main, home-produced casing as the raw material.  The casing comb was not a satisfactory product but it was the only type of comb that could be produced here during the war.  With the conclusion of the war the firms which had entered the business installed plant and made arrangements to produce these combs by the injection moulding process using plastic powders of various kinds and thereby producing a product which is quite satisfactory and completely competitive in price with products of a similar kind produced elsewhere.  It is true that some bone combs are used.  They are very much dearer in price than the type of products now being made here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>These plastic combs are only a fraction of the cost of combs produced from bone.  I know of no reason why combs from bone should not be produced here, but they are not. I think it would be impossible to segregate one from the other in a simple form which would permit of administration of this duty by customs officers.  That is a problem we frequently come up against in the administration <Col N="931" /> of customs duties.  One must have a definition of the product which is so clear that the customs officers administering the duty cannot err in distinguishing the product from other products of a like kind.  It would be possible to grant licences for the free importation of bone combs but I should think that the total quantity coming in is very, very small and that the operation of a licence provision would cause a great deal of administrative difficulty. I will, however, certainly look into that matter.  I think the ideal solution would be to get these firms which are making plastic combs to undertake the manufacture of bone combs as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not tell Deputy Mulcahy, precisely, the wages paid in the manufacture of these goods or the number of people employed.  In the first place that information would not be available through the ordinary census of industrial production because the firms engaged in the manufacture of these goods would not be asked to segregate their costs as between these articles and others manufactured by them.  It will, however, I am sure, be appreciated by the Deputy that concerns making a range of articles are dependent for the success of their whole enterprise on the adequacy of their total sales and that the abandonment of this particular project might also jeopardise the economy of their concerns as a whole.  It is fair, therefore, to assume that the employment given in these concerns as a whole in all their activities is bound up with the development of this particular activity by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to remove any misapprehension as regards the payment of customs duties at the present time. I want to emphasise that very few protective duties of the ordinary kind are at present in operation.  The rise in the total yield from customs duties is mainly attributable to tobacco which, I think, produces more than four-fifths of the total yield and, as to the balance, it is due to increased imports of petrol, wines, spirits and other <Col N="932" /> commodities of that kind which are taxable for revenue purposes only. The total yield of income from other duties which are in operation at the present time is quite small.  It is intended to maintain that position until a buyer's market has reappeared in respect of particular goods.  As soon as it is obvious that adequate supplies are available to introduce the element of competition in trade we will have to consider the possible reaction of excessive importations upon the manufacturers of these goods here.  That situation is beginning to appear in respect of some commodities, but only in respect of a few.  It is, I think, to be expected that it will be a substantial period of time yet before any need will arise for a general reimposition of customs duties.  In some cases it may be practicable to modify the scope of the duties without adverse effects.  There are, however, a number of industries of this kind which were begun during the war because of the inability to obtain the goods during the war, and I think that those who entered them should be given every encouragement now to install the plant and manufacturing processes they require for the purpose of continuing in an efficient and economical way in the business into which they entered during the period of wartime scarcity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 1 I would like to put this point to the Minister. I think the sensible way of getting over the difficulty that would be caused by the imposition of a duty on imported bone combs would be to go to the manufacturers of the combs here and to say: &ldquo;Look here, we want to protect you from unfair competition from outside.  The nation is standing a tariff to your industry, but if it is going to do that it will expect you to make some substantial contribution towards supplying our needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="933" /> This tariff is on the assumption that you are going to continue the manufacture of bone combs&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Until such time as they do that, the Minister would not find it difficult to arrange that anybody&mdash; and the obligation is on the importer&mdash;who wants to import genuine bone combs or get a licence to do so, would have to prove that they were bone combs and, having examined both, I do not think there should be any difficulty in ascertaining the difference.  However, I will leave the point to the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite the difficulty.  The difficulty arises generally from the Revenue Commissioners, indicating the problems they might experience in their administration in effectively distinguishing them.</P>

      <P>There are two difficulties&mdash;one in describing the article and another in identifying the article.  It does not inspire confidence if we are told that the article cannot be described and also that we cannot depend on the customs officials to identify the articles and distinguish them.  To have it admitted officially that the users of a particular class of article have to pay 25 per cent. more, because administrative convenience or ability cannot provide a solution of these difficulties, is not very convincing. There ought to be a different type of presentation.  I do not want to do away with the machinery of the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, but I do say that, at the earliest possible <Col N="934" /> moment, a statement should be made which will give all the relevant facts.  If part of the reason for imposing a duty is that it is desired to develop the industry or give people an opportunity to get in machinery for laying the foundations of an industry, that should be stated frankly and fully. There ought to be a formula for the presentation of these matters to the House, under which information would be given in a systematic way.</P>

      <P>Has there been consultation between the Minister and the Irish manufacturers in this connection? I cannot claim to have any technical knowledge in the matter, but it seems to me that the manufacture of bone combs would be somewhat different from that of plastics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>You might have a company which might not be interested in plastics but would be interested in the other type of product.  You might have a separate company altogether.  We should welcome this Bill as an encouragement of the bone product, if necessary.  As an agricultural country, we ought to be rich in bones and there ought to be no reason why the manufacture of articles out of bone, in addition to combs, should not be undertaken by some firm here.  I do not expect that such a manufacturer would seek to deprive us politicians of our living by using up the various bones of contention.  It would be desirable to develop not only the manufacture of combs but of other articles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to Deputy Cogan's point, there is no restriction on anybody entering into this business and any firm engaged in any cognate industry would be free to go into the manufacture of combs of any kind&mdash;not merely the firms at present engaged in manufacturing combs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ordinarily, I would agree with Deputy Mulcahy that it is desirable to give certain items of specific information concerning firms which are benefiting by proposals for protective duties.  Sometimes, there may be difficulty, on account of the reluctance <Col N="935" /> there is to disclose the affairs of an individual firm or where the activity concerned is only part of a wider range in which a number of firms engage.  The difficulty of enforcing customs duties arises from the fact&mdash;to which, perhaps, Deputy Mulcahy did not fully advert&mdash;that the test of the difference between one product and another is often not practicable without damaging the article in some way.  I came across that difficulty quite recently in relation to textiles.  The Revenue Commissioners said the only possible way of distinguishing one particular textile from another was to tear it or to treat it with acid or in some such way as that, and clearly that was not practicable.  The difference must be so clear that it can be distinguished by the customs authorities without subjecting the article to tests of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>On the adjournment ast night, I was dealing with the effect of bad housing and low wages on the spread of tuberculosis.  The Minister <Col N="936" /> should take up with the Minister for Local Government the question of the grant given for the building of new houses.  Before the war, when building materials were plentiful, the grant was £40, but at the present time, when the cost of materials has gone up to such an extraordinary degree, to give the usual grant of £40 is just a joke. Bad housing has more to do with the spread of tuberculosis than anything else and new sanatoria and various health provisions will not deal with the matter while the root cause is still there.</P>
      <P>We have a problem in Mayo which I will bring to the Minister's attention. We have a tuberculosis waiting list of about 60 and our annual death roll from tuberculosis is 104.  The waiting list of 60 is an indication of the size of the problem.  We have 40 beds in the sanatorium at Creagh and 12 other beds in the county home, so the Minister will see at a glance that we have only just about half the accommodation we should have. Several schemes have been put forward at the Mayo County Council for the acquisition of suitable houses or mansions, but after a careful survey of the county, none was found to be available.  We have put up the suggestion that additional temporary structures of some kind should be erected at the present sanatorium at Creagh.  We are informed that there will be serious delay in obtaining sanction from the Department.  I want to inform the Minister that proposals will be coming in, if they have not already arrived, for the provision of additional beds.  That entails other things.  It will entail extension of the farm to supply milk and vegetables for the patients and staff.  It will mean the erection of a new chapel and out-offices, increased kitchen accommodation and equipment and huts or chalets or whatever form the extensions will take.  When the proposal comes before the Minister, I would ask him to deal with it as expeditiously as possible and not to give us the kind of treatment we have been used to receiving from the Custom House of having to wait six to ten months for sanction for a matter that should be disposed of out of hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="937" /> Apart from the 52 patients we are able to accommodate with beds in Peamount, we have a waiting list of 60 and I think the Minister can take it that the average of 104 deaths per annum is a clearer indication of our problem than the actual waiting list or the number of patients on hand because there must be many cases of tuberculosis in every county that do not come under the notice of the medical authorities.  It would appear that we have to wait three years for the new regional sanatorium in Galway.  I maintain, as I maintained at the time the Bill was going through, that the provision of 400 beds to deal with five counties of Connacht, and Donegal and Clare is inadequate to deal with the waiting list in these counties.  The County of Mayo will probably be allotted 20 or 30 beds.  That will not cope with the problem.  If we are to tackle the problem properly we must get down to it now.  The County Council of Mayo is more than anxious to do the work, provided sanction is forthcoming speedily.</P>
    <P>There is one other vital matter, that is, delay in sanctioning waterworks. While that is a matter for the Minister for Local Government, I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that in some towns very insanitary conditions exist in consequence of insufficient waterworks or lack of waterworks.  In Castlebar a scheme has been dragging on and if something is not done about it the health of the town will be affected.  The Minister might direct the attention of the Minister for Local Government to the fact that in parts of that town and in other towns and in the county the water supply is so inadequate that people have to wait up until 1, 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning to fill vessels. Once the normal life of the town commences at 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning, the pressure is so low at certain elevations that people cannot get water.  That is a very grave danger to health.  Those concerned are to be complimented that there has not been an outbreak of fever as a result.  I have raised the matter several times here.  The Minister's Department and the Department of Local Government <Col N="938" /> are closely linked and I need not impress upon the Minister the need for close co-operation between them.  I would say that the Minister for Health requires the very closest co-operation of the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, when the Minister was reviewing the activities of his Department in regard to the provision of hospitals and sanatoria, most Deputies were amazed to learn that it will take two years to provide a substantial sanatorium in any part of Ireland.  He indicated that the Galway Regional Sanatorium would be ready in about three years' time.  I want to ask the Minister is it not possible to move more rapidly, especially so far as the City and County of Dublin are concerned? Is it not possible to take over some large building, some of the new luxury hotels, or some place on the outskirts of the city to accommodate those who are urgently in need of treatment now, not in three years' time?  There are 181 patients on the waiting list in Dublin alone.  Only yesterday I received an application from a mother of a girl of 16 who requires sanatorium treatment.  I made inquiries to see if I could obtain sanatorium treatment for her a little earlier than was promised.  I was informed that she was 31st on the list and that in about three months' time accommodation might be found for her in a sanatorium.  That means that the child will be three months farther from the possibility of a cure and the three months' worry of waiting will further injure her health.  I also tried to obtain sanatorium treatment for a young man of 19 who had been discharged from the Army.  I was informed that there is no hope of getting accommodation for him within three months.</P>
      <P>I earnestly appeal to the Minister not to be satisfied with plans that have been presented to him for the erection of large buildings in three years' time. I ask him to move quickly to provide temporary accommodation and to give those who are on the waiting list to-day a chance of being cured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that persons in sanatoria at the present moment are worried because of the condition of their families.  There is no allowance for <Col N="939" /> the family of a person suffering from tuberculosis other than that which the relieving officer of the city may give them.  They give the family the barest subsistence allowance.  There is no provision made for rent and the rent falls into arrears and there is always the fear of their being given notice to quit.  That is not helpful to a patient who is anxious to get better and to return to his work.  I would appeal to the Minister to put pressure on and see that immediate arrangements are made to give substantial allowances to the families of those suffering from tuberculosis.  Take the case of a young married man earning £4 10s. 0d. or £5 a week, with a family of four or five children.  The rent of his cottage is 12/6 a week.  He suddenly breaks down in health and has to enter a sanatorium.  While he is there, if he is entitled to national health benefit, the family gets about 25/- a week and about 7/6 a week from the local authority.  That means starvation for them, and the worry of it will keep the man back from making a recovery from his illness. That family will be suffering from malnutrition as long as he is unable to earn for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke yesterday about the making of a nutrition survey, to ascertain what is possible for a family to live on.  I would be glad to know if he has yet any knowledge of the conditions in the poorer quarters of Dublin, and if this nutrition survey will take in such places as the Seán McDermott Street area and the Dublin dispensary areas.  Once a week the Dublin evening newspapers publish an item such as this: &ldquo;Dublin relief to-day.&rdquo; I find that on the 2nd July the following particulars were given: &ldquo;7,221 cases relieved at a cost of £3,089.&rdquo;  That means relief at less than 9/- per week per person relieved. Everybody knows that a person must be completely destitute before he or she will get such an allowance from the local authority.  I say that it is a miserable allowance.  It does not provide people with bread or potatoes and neither does it afford the nutrition that the Minister hopes to give when his survey is completed.  The Minister <Col N="940" /> admits what we all know to be so, that the child death rate in Dublin City is excessive.  I join with him in the hope that he expressed that an improvement will take place in that situation. The child death rate in Dublin is due to the hardships which are borne by the mothers.  It is due to the want of proper feeding in the case of expectant mothers.  That has been stated so often by medical experts that it is almost like a parrot cry to repeat it here.  We have, thank God, the Catholic Social Service feeding centre and the St John Ambulance feeding centre for expectant mothers, but these organisations are not getting sufficient grants to help them in their great work. I put it to the Minister that he should see that those who are doing the work that he wants done should get the necessary moneys to enable them to carry on.</P>
    <P>There has been no mention made in any of the statements that I have seen concerning public health as to whether the Minister has made any recommendation that a substantial sum should be put aside for cancer research. I want to ask him what is the position with regard to that.  It is a matter that requires the earliest possible attention from the experts.  If we can manage to cure tuberculosis but at the same time find there is a continuous growth of cancer, then I think the Minister ought to be alive to that fact. I feel confident that he is, but so far we have not been told what is being done in that direction.  I appeal to him to see that those engaged in cancer research will get sufficient moneys to enable them to carry out research not only at home but on the continent so that they may be able to bring back the benefits of their experience for the relief and cure of those at home.  I have no knowledge as to whether or not cancer is on the increase, and perhaps the Minister may be in a position to give us some information.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to put it to the Minister that the best way to prevent most of the diseases that we complain about is to see that proper food, shelter and clothing are provided for those most in need of them.  It is most annoying to me and to the other Dublin representatives when visitors who come to the <Col N="941" /> city say: &ldquo;Why have you so many barefooted children in the streets of Dublin and why are they so badly clothed?&rdquo; It is hard to explain to visitors because it is the one set of children they see, and they naturally come out of the tenement quarters. They come into the sunshine and the brightness of O'Connell Street, and because of their appearance and the way they approach them visitors can sometimes be imposed upon.  I will say nothing further on that beyond this, that Deputy Cosgrave last night referred to the fact that the local authority has the power to provide the parents of those children with footwear for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think he has because it is a public health matter.  If the children are provided with proper clothing and footwear their health will be safeguarded.  If they are allowed to run about the streets barefooted in the snow and in the rain then they will become prospective patients for our sanatoria. Perhaps another Department would help the Minister to see that they are properly covered and sheltered.  Every member of the House has joined in praising the Minister for his efforts on behalf of the health of the people.  I will say nothing further on the points that I have put to him beyond this, I believe he has them all at heart and is anxious to do things. I could not sit here, however, and not say something about what I see going on in Dublin.  Most of my colleagues in this House know O'Connell Street <Col N="942" /> from the front door of the Gresham Hotel.  There are so few of them who know Dublin from the back door of the Gresham Hotel that I would advise them to go there on any Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday when the free turf is being distributed so that they may see the condition of the men, women and children who are availing of that free turf.  You will see barefooted children wheeling perambulators and handcarts and the turf depôt is at the back of the Gresham Hotel.  They should see Dublin from the back door of the hotel as well as from the front door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The one matter in which I am mainly interested on this Estimate has been very largely adverted to by Deputy Byrne and that is the question of tuberculosis.  In the course of the Minister's statement last night, he mentioned that he believed he had secured a site for a sanatorium to replace the one at Santry Court. No Deputy would like to jeopardise in any way the negotiations which are presumably going on and which are not completed; but I should like to direct the Minister's attention to the fact that opinion is divided as to whether the right steps were taken in connection with Santry Court in so far as it related to a 1,000-bed scheme.  If I refer to the matter now it is to ascertain from the Minister if his new site is intended to provide for a 1,000-bed scheme in the same way as the one at Santry Court. If not, may I point out to him that the Dublin Corporation on their own volition secured a site in Ballyowen quite convenient to the city which was deemed suitable in every way for a sanatorium?  That site is still in their possession.  That scheme was not intended to provide 1,000 beds but it was intended very largely to relieve the existing situation with regard to tuberculosis in the City of Dublin.  The question arises as to what is to become of the Ballyowen site if the Minister has secured this other site.  I suggest that the Minister should inform the Dublin Corporation at the earliest possible moment of his decision in regard to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was also a second scheme, for which a site was secured in Ballyfermot, <Col N="943" /> to replace Crooksling and the Pigeon House.  I understand that that scheme was abandoned because it was understood that the purpose for which it was intended would be served by the 1,000-bed scheme at Santry Court.  I understand that the site at Ballyfermot is on the point of being disposed of to the Office of Public Works for a Borstal institution.  Before the final stage in this matter is reached we ought to know whether either of these sites will be required for a sanatorium.</P>
    <P>It is true, as Deputy Byrne said, that notwithstanding the interest aroused about 18 months ago in the drive against tuberculosis, comparatively little progress has been made so far as the provision of additional beds is concerned.  It is true that some additional beds have been provided, but the position to-day is that some 200 persons are waiting to get into institutions under the control of the corporation.</P>
    <P>There is also an ancillary scheme, namely, the domiciliary scheme, which has been undertaken by the Dublin Corporation for the treatment of patients in their own homes.  I understand that that scheme has been reasonably successful up to the present and that good work is being done under it.  But, in my opinion, and in the opinion of a good number of people, the results are bound to be negligible owing to the fact that the housing accommodation of the persons concerned is not all that might be desired.  It is proposed, under the regulations made by the Local Government Department, to assist such people by putting up an additional room to their houses.  But anybody who knows Dublin and the number of people affected by tuberculosis will readily understand that the provision of that very desirable amenity is not possible in a good many cases.  Many of these people live in overcrowded tenement rooms and the provision of an additional room in such cases is not practicable.  Where it is practicable, I understand that the provision of the additional room is being undertaken by the corporation in consultation with the Local Government Department <Col N="944" /> and that where that additional room cannot be provided the provision of a chalet will be undertaken.</P>
    <P>The question of the allowances referred to by Deputy Byrne in connection with the treatment of tuberculosis has been a matter of concern for quite a long time.  In fairness to the Minister, however, it should be stated that he has made provision for that in the Health Bill and that in future the cost will be borne as to 50 per cent. by the local authority and 50 per cent. by the State.  On that point, might I say to the Minister that the Dublin Corporation have already initiated a scheme which was forwarded to the Local Government Department when it dealt with health matters based on the scheme in operation in Great Britain and Northern Ireland so far as the scale of allowances is concerned?  For reasons which can be understood, that scheme has never been implemented and I should like the Minister to have an early consultation with the corporation as to the type of scheme which would be suitable for the City of Dublin.  So far as the corporation are concerned, they will be generous in the matter of the scale, particularly when they know that the Minister is prepared to supplement it to the extent of 50 per cent. There is just another matter to which I should like to advert.  I am not sure whether it comes within the functions of the Minister for Health, but it is closely allied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I am switching over to the question of tenement by-laws, the operation of which is very largely a matter for the Minister for Local Government.  The Minister for Health, however, can perform a useful service in connection with it. We have what is almost an international standard relating to the cubic space per person required from the point of view of public health.  I am not quite sure whether the present standard&mdash;I think it is 400 cubic feet for adults&mdash;is quite sufficient.  But, in any case, in connection with these regulations there are extraordinary anomalies and hardships.  There are <Col N="945" /> rooms in this city, particularly in districts like Mountjoy Square and the older sections of the city which, because of their Georgian construction, are of a very large type.  We have cases where a father and mother with five or six children living in one room are not eligible under this peculiar standard to be provided with accommodation by the corporation.  Obviously, owing to the present need for housing accommodation, the local authority are precluded from housing a family of that kind because, if they do, they will lose the subsidy attaching to the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932.</P>
      <P>I have a case in mind which will illustrate the position in the best way for the Minister.  It is the case of a man who has a small four-roomed house on the North side.  He let a room to a friend, who at the time had three or four children, because of the very bad housing position in the city.  The family in that one room has now increased to six and the man has been there for four and a half years, and simply because the room occupied by that family of eight persons does not come within the tenement regulations the Corporation Housing Department is precluded from housing that family, even though the room which they occupy does not comply with the standard cubic space regulation I refer to. There are other cases of rooms of that type throughout the city.  There is, for instance, the case of a family on the fourth flight of stairs.  The woman has to come down 50 or 60 steps to get water and the sanitary accommodation is outside.  Such conditions are apparently not taken into consideration because of this arbitrary standard of cubic space.  The corporation are anxious to rid themselves of these anomalies.</P>

      <P>I was about to suggest that, as in the case of Ballyowen and Ballyfermot and the treatment of tuberculosis in the city, plus the matter I am now referring to, which is an urgent matter, the Minister should lend his good offices to the corporation in a joint conference with Local Government <Col N="946" /> on these matters.  I venture to say that, if he did, very good and useful results would follow.</P>

      <P>I want to raise the matter of cancer research.  We have discussed the question of tuberculosis at considerable length in this debate and there is not very much that can be added, but I think it will be generally recognised that the death rate from cancer in this country is very high.  It is perhaps high in all civilised countries and the fact that this malady is associated with modern conditions of living and modern diet makes it an urgent matter for investigation and the provision of some effective cure or preventive. I should like to know if vigorous methods are being adopted to investigate all possible source of information with regard to the causation of this disease and possible remedies or preventives.  If it is due to a nutritional deficiency of some kind, or to some defects in our modern diet or conditions of living, it is the duty of all connected with public health to devise a remedy, and I regard it as a welcome step that this country is being linked up with other countries in an international health organisation.  It is desirable that the most up-to-date scientific knowledge on this subject should be availed of by our Department, and I should like to know if special investigations are being undertaken by the Department in the matter and if any useful results are forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that cancer is very difficult to diagnose and that it has usually reached a critical stage before either the patient or the medical officer is aware of it.  On the other hand, we know that external cancer is frequently and almost invariably dealt with in rural areas by unofficial or non-medical practitioners, who, in many cases, achieve apparent success.  This may be due to the type of cancer with which they are dealing not being of a very dangerous character, or to the fact that it may not be cancer at all, and it may be due to the fact that they have, in some way, got a little ahead of the medical profession.  On the other hand, most of the cases dealt with medically or surgically are of an advanced <Col N="947" /> internal character, and, very frequently, success is not achieved which does give a certain amount of prestige to the quack as against the medical or surgical profession.  The whole matter is one for close investigation and it would appear to be a type of malady which ought to be overcome by the elimination of the causes, if they can be discovered.  It might be due to some defect in modern conditions of living.</P>
    <P>I welcome the promise of the Minister that a rapid advance will now be made in the provision of institutions not merely for the treatment of tuberculosis but for hospital treatment generally.  We have had a seven or eight years' interruption of the building programme, and it is necessary that the time lost should be made good as early as possible.  People are more inclined to avail of institutional treatment to-day than in the past and, on the whole, I think it is a desirable tendency, but in many counties there is a serious shortage of accommodation.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the investigation in regard to nutrition which is being undertaken.  I hope, however, that it does not mean the subjection of human beings to experiment in the matter of diet on the same lines as those on which one would experiment with guinea pigs and so on.  I hope it is more in the nature of discovering not what type of nutrition is harmful but what gives the best results.  I should be very much opposed to human beings being subjected, for example, to some type of diet which the medical profession might consider injurious but in respect of which they had doubts which they wished to remove by experimentation.  That would be altogether wrong, and, if I may say so, somewhat immoral.  I hope that is not being undertaken.</P>
    <P>I think the net result of this survey will prove that a very large section of our community are living under nutritional conditions which are very low. The food upon which they support themselves, particularly the younger people, is altogether inadequate.  It <Col N="948" /> is lacking in many essentials which are absolutely necessary for health.  I am told that the younger people in some of the war-racked countries, and even in Great Britain&mdash;those who have grown up within the past seven or eight years&mdash;show a lack of vitality when compared with other generations. That, I think, is also true of those who have to live in crowded tenements and who are compelled to exist on a very limited diet, insufficient, in the first place; and, in the second place, limited in variety and quality.  The net result of this investigation, if it is carried out fully, would be to show how our modern conditions are failing in the provision of essential food.  As a result of this investigation I believe we shall have to make a resolute effort to step up the living and nutritional conditions of the lowest paid and humblest sections of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important Estimate and it gives us some idea of the steps that the Minister is taking to improve the health of our people. I was glad to hear him state yesterday evening that he had approved in principle of a 50-bed hospital for Ballinasloe.  Approving of a hospital in principle is one thing, but approving of the plans is very often a long time away.  That is our disappointing experience in County Galway, as I am sure the Minister is well aware.  I should like to know if the hospital in Ballinasloe will be a district or an auxiliary hospital.  I favour the latter. I believe that not merely should it be a 50-bed hospital but, by reason of the proposed situation and the position of the county, it should be an auxiliary hospital of 75 beds, with surgical, medical, maternity and fever accommodation on the lines of the proposed regional hospital.  It would greatly relieve congestion in the proposed regional hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like, as well as approving the principle, that something would be done to hasten the completion of the plans.  We have had a very disappointing experience in County Galway as regards approving in principle and then planning.  I am sure it is at least 20 years since steps were taken to have erected in Galway a hospital suitable <Col N="949" /> for the accommodation of patients there.  Time went on.  The board of health did their part.  An architect was appointed and I do not know how many sets of plans were prepared.  I am sure there were almost ten sets of plans prepared, between the original plans and the revision of plans sent up to the Department.  They eventually came back but, with the exception of having a fever wing and a maternity wing and a nurses' home built, we seem to be as far away as ever from getting the regional hospital.  I hope the Minister will see that whatever difficulties are there, they will be removed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand, nor can any man down the country understand, why it is that when the medical people under the local authority and the medical experts in the Department want something and fix their minds on getting something to meet the requirements of the people, and explain it to the architect, it should take such a long time to get the plans completed.  It is very difficult to understand the cause of all that.  We are now in an unfortunate position in that the architect who was preparing the plans, a very good man, died.  May the Lord have mercy on him.  I suppose that will cause some further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister quite well understands the position in Galway.  There was an inquiry there and evidence was given at that inquiry showing the great lack of accommodation for patients and the difficulties under which the medical, surgical and nursing staffs are operating.  I wish to urge on the Minister the need, in regard to the regional hospital in Galway, or any other hospital, to have something definite arranged between his medical advisers and architects and to see to it that this matter will not carry on for a period of anywhere from seven to 20 years.  There can be no excuse for that.  There can be an excuse, so far as Galway is concerned, in one sense, and that is that since 1939 the difficulty of getting materials was there, but still we had from 1927 to 1939 and from 1939 <Col N="950" /> to 1947 and the plans could have been completed, but apparently they are not yet completed.</P>
    <P>This is something that the local authorities and the people generally are disappointed with.  It is not very encouraging to them to be prepared to provide money when there is a hold-up like the one I have mentioned.  I would like the Minister to reconsider this matter of the Ballinasloe hospital.  I think he should provide there an auxiliary hospital to the regional hospital.  Perhaps we will be told we have been pretty well treated in County Galway.  If we have been, we were always prepared to meet that treatment by putting up the money.  We have gone as far as anybody in that connection; as far as the cost of anything in the way of maintenance of any of our institutions is concerned, I think we can boast that we are second to none in that respect.</P>
    <P>We had before our county council meeting last Saturday a letter which was read by the manager asking that permission be given to the county medical officer of health to take, with other county medical officers of health, a course in Canada.  I understand that the county medical officer of health is quite prepared to go, on certain conditions, of course.  Naturally he is entitled to expect an adequate subsistence allowance and allowances for certain other purposes.  We are called upon to put up a certain amount of money, half of which is to be recouped but should the county medical officer avail of this course, as we hope he will, we expect at the same time that we should be entitled to have a claim on his services for at least five years after he returns.</P>
    <P>If we put up the money, and if some other county which perhaps will not provide any money to send away its medical officer of health, offers him a position and he agrees to accept that position, I think it would be unfair to charge County Galway for improving the position in the other county which, of course, would be the result of his going to that county.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, if the medical officer of <Col N="951" /> health is sent on a course like that&mdash;and I know that it will not be wasted on our medical officer of health&mdash;his loss would be very greatly felt in County Galway because it is almost impossible to describe the success which he has made of his work since he came there. The pavilions which have been erected are a credit to him.  The whole outline of Woodlands has been completely changed and great progress has been made in the county in the fight against tuberculosis.  Consequently I should like&mdash;and I am sure other Galway Deputies will speak in support of the suggestion&mdash;if he goes away and we put up the money that we should be entitled to require that he would remain in the county for at least five years after he comes back and that if not, in the event of his being promoted to another county or even to the Department of Local Government, the ratepayers of County Galway should be entitled to a recoupment of the money they put up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very necessary in my opinion that Deputies from County Galway should on this occasion, the first on which the new Minister has introduced an Estimate for his Department, bring before him a position that for many years we have been bringing before another Department. Personally I welcome the Minister.  I think he was a good selection for the position because it was very necessary to have a member of the medical profession at the head of a Department such as this.  I believe myself that he has a thorough understanding of the functions which the Department should fulfil.  I want, first of all, to support the point made by Deputy Beegan regarding the position of the county medical officer of health in Galway.  It would certainly be a bad day for the county if he should decide to leave it as he would be a terrible loss to the people.  I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that he is the most self-sacrificing man who ever entered the profession.  I believe he is responsible for saving more lives in Galway than any other doctor before him.  He is an honest and sincere worker and, to a certain extent, he risks his own health <Col N="952" /> in trying to work under terrible conditions for the sake of the patients in the county.  That has been the case for many years and I join in the tribute which Deputy Beegan paid to him in that connection.</P>
      <P>I should also like to refer to the dilapidated condition of the dispensary buildings throughout County Galway. It appears to be the official view that anything in the line of a make-shift is good enough for the country.  Something should be done immediately especially in rural areas to improve the condition of these buildings, as doctors and patients are very often wet to the skin when they arrive there and it is unfair to house them in dilapidated buildings.  Of course the medical officers in the various areas do their best.  There is another matter, which it may not be popular to mention at the moment, but nevertheless it is very necessary to mention it.  Dispensary medical officers are very hard workers. They are at the beck and call of all sorts of people night and day and they do their work very conscientiously. Sometimes they have to work for nothing when it is a case of a poor patient.  In the times in which we are living, I put it to the Minister that it is necessary that the salary conditions of these officials should be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the statement in regard to the hospital at Ballinasloe which will supply the long-felt want in East Galway.  I am sure the Minister remembers his friend, the late Monsignor Joyce who, for many years before his death, fought for the erection of some institution of this kind in that part of Galway, especially in Portumna. It was his pet subject.  It is more necessary to provide such a hospital in Ballinasloe than in many other parts of the country.  County Galway is a very large county.  It may appear strange to some Deputies, although it is true, that one portion of Galway is nearer Nelson's Pillar than the other end of the county is to that portion.  There is, therefore, a great necessity for cottage auxiliary hospitals. For instance, I know that instructions are being issued to dispensary medical officers to send only urgent cases to the Central Hospital in Galway <Col N="953" /> on account of the overcrowding there. None other than surgical cases can be accepted at times.  That is a terrible state of affairs, but the manager is obliged to send out instructions such as these because of the overcrowded conditions in the so-called Central Hospital.  I believe the provision of a hospital at Ballinasloe is, therefore, a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that districts in the extreme north end of Galway, such as Williams-town, Ballymoe, and Glenamaddy are 40 or 50 miles away from the Central Hospital.  It is very necessary that, in that portion of the county, some auxiliary or cottage hospital should be set up.  I would like to make a few remarks in regard to the Central Hospital in Galway as this happens to be the first time this Department is under the charge of the present Minister.  I want to point out, as Deputy Beegan has pointed out, that for the last 20 years, I might say, there have been proposals to do something about the matter.  The Central Hospital was an old disused workhouse which was taken over, and all the people of County Galway have to use it.  Very often, on account of overcrowding, very necessary cases cannot be taken in.  I believe, as a matter of fact, that the fault that a new hospital was not erected in Galway years ago lies with the Department that held control previously.  I agree that the fact that it was not there was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of people in County Galway and I hope that the Minister and this new Department will not allow that situation to continue. I know that during the past few years it could not be done because of shortage of building materials and so forth but I think that the time has now come when something can be done.  In Galway the Central Hospital is looked upon as an old dead-house.</P>
    <P>I wish to bring to the Minister's notice the fact that it has been stated that there is some hidden hand or influence operating in Galway which is responsible for holding up the erection of a new hospital there.  I may as well tell the Minister what it is, even though I myself do not believe it because I <Col N="954" /> know that the gentlemen concerned would not be responsible for such a thing.  It is definitely stated in Galway that the reason why the erection of a new hospital has been held up for years is in order to accommodate certain private homes and private hospitals there, because if the people had a good hospital to go to, they would not go to these private homes and private hospitals. That is supposed to be the hidden influence although I myself do not believe it.  Still it is as well that I should bring the matter to the Minister's notice.  I need not dwell on the sworn inquiry which was held there recently.  The Minister has got the report and he knows that lack of accommodation is responsible for all of it.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to another matter which concerns the erection of regional sanatoria in this country, with particular reference to County Galway.  I would ask the Minister to speed up the matter because very often tubercular cases are taken into the Central Hospital in Galway and surely he as a medical man realises that it is ridiculous to have tubercular patients beside other patients in hospital.  We all know the harm it does.  We all know the name it gives a hospital.  We all know that people do not like to be in a hospital where there are tubercular patients.  I would ask the Minister, therefore, to be more active about this matter than the Department which was controlled by another Minister was and which was responsible in the past in this connection.  As a matter of fact, the Central Hospital in Galway has got such a name&mdash;not because of the professional people there, the nurses, the doctors and so forth, but because of the terrible conditions&mdash;that people who cannot afford to pay in a private hospital or in a private home prefer to go, if possible, into hospital in Roscommon, rather than turn up in the place that is supposed to be such an old dead-house as the Central Hospital in Galway is supposed to be.  In my opinion the conditions in that hospital are a crying shame.  I believe that, for years back, the conditions in that hospital have been responsible for the deaths of hundreds of our people in the county.  In some instances, because of lack of accommodation, urgent cases <Col N="955" /> cannot be admitted there and are, consequently, very often lost.  As a result of these conditions, they go to another hospital if at all possible rather than to the Central Hospital in Galway.  I would ask the Minister to take special note of this matter particularly on account of rumours of a hidden influence in the matter, although I myself do not believe them. I am sure the Minister will take steps in this matter because, as a member of the medical profession, he must realise the great necessity which exists in Galway for the erection of a new hospital. I believe that no other county of the Twenty-Six Counties which Dáil Éireann rules is in such dire necessity and want for hospital accommodation as County Galway is.</P>

      <P>I wish to bring one matter to the Minister's notice and that is the provision of a new county hospital in Louth.  I mention this matter now lest the Minister may put it on the long finger as he is new to the job.  I would like to remind him that this matter is a long time on the carpet. My colleague, Deputy L.J. Walsh, will agree with me that Louth was one of the first counties which was eligible for a grant out of the first sweeps.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>£70,000 was got from one of the first sweeps for that purpose and that money is lying there still.  It is possible that some of it is being used to relieve the rates or the upkeep of the present hospital.  As this Minister and the previous Minister know, we have been very patient.  We realise, of course, that due to circumstances over which neither the county council nor the Government had control, no action could be taken in the last few years.  I refer to the war and to the lack of materials or to the difficulty in securing materials which would be necessary for the erection of a building of the size required.  As I say, we have been very patient.  We do not usually harry any of the Departments in these matters. <Col N="956" /> But we feel now that the time has arrived, as the war is over, as building materials are becoming more plentiful and, as far as I can understand, as there are no outstanding points of any great importance as regards plans or the selection of a site to be decided.</P>
      <P>The people of County Louth are hopeful that a start will be made in the very near future in connection with the erection of a new hospital.  I do not wish to worry the Minister unduly. I feel sure he knows all about it already.  The hospital we have is a very old hospital with limited accommodation. It is not, in fact, able to meet the demand.  For that reason, large numbers of patients have to be sent to the city hospitals which, by the way, are themselves already overcrowded and have difficulty in accommodating even the people from the City of Dublin.  Taking all these things into consideration, I would ask the Minister to see that the erection of this hospital in County Louth is proceeded with as soon as possible, so that this long-standing grievance may be removed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>A few statements were made by Deputy Donnellan which should not be let pass, as they conveyed the impression that the Central Hospital in Galway is a death trap.  There is no doubt it is very crowded, but I have yet to know of anyone who has made a statement to the effect that it was responsible for numerous deaths all over the county. It has as good a staff as there is in Ireland and the patients who go there are catered for as well as in any of the homes referred to in Galway.  In regard to the talk about a hold-up in the new hospital, I have never heard it rumoured that there was some hidden hand stopping the erection of the new hospital.  The county manager his indicated on many occasions to the Galway County Council, in Deputy Donnellan's presence, as well as in mine, that the work of erection was held up during the war through the lack of materials&mdash;as has been the case with many similar buildings all over Ireland.  I understand that the materials are practically ready, and I <Col N="957" /> hope the Minister will see that the work is put in hands now without delay.  The Central Hospital is definitely overcrowded, but to make statements beyond that would not be fair to the hospital or to the nursing or medical staff.</P>
      <P>In the sanatorium in Galway we have the nursing staff housed in the same institution as the patients.  The county medical officer of health has made an effort to get up a nursing home and that should be proceeded with immediately.  If there is any delay in the Department in regard to the erection of that particular hospital, I would ask the Minister to see what he could do to speed the matter up.  I know there is probably a difficulty there because a new sanatorium has been erected in Galway.  There may be a difficulty in connection with the erection of a suitable hostel for the nurses, but it is not right or reasonable to leave the staff where they are.  Their work is very heavy and they have to deal with a very infectious disease and it is not a proper thing to have them housed where they are at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard many comments during this debate on the spread of tuberculosis, but I do not think anyone has put his finger on the real cause.  I have visited the sanatorium in Galway and other sanatoria all over the country and, to my mind, the cause of tuberculosis all over this country at the present time is dance halls.  People leaving dance halls at four and five in the morning go home for half an hour's sleep and go off on the following day to do a day's work, after being in a sweat all night, and they are half dead from want of sleep.  When you talk to a young fellow in a sanatorium and ask him what happened to bring him in there, he will tell you: &ldquo;I went to a dance on such-and-such a night and when I came home after it I did not feel well.  I got a dose of a cold, but I did not want to admit it, as I knew my father would not be sympathetic, since it was at a dance hall that I got it.&rdquo; We will have to face this question of closing down the dance halls at an earlier hour.  Three o'clock in the morning is no hour for dancing; people can dance up to 12 or even 1 o'clock, <Col N="958" /> and that is late enough for any man who has to work the following morning. If you examine the vast majority of the younger people in the sanatoria at this particular time, you will find you can trace the reason back to coming home late from some dance hall.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beegan mentioned the suggestion to ask each county to send out a doctor to make a study of the up-to-date methods of dealing with tuberculosis. The Minister should take note seriously of what he said.  We have as good a medical officer of health in County Galway as you will find in Ireland and we are quite prepared to send him away; but if every county is not prepared to send a doctor away and bear the expense, the expense should be borne by the State.  To send our doctor away would cost in or about £1,000 and we have no guarantee that when he gets back he will work for even two hours for our county, and we may get a man from another county who will not have the experience he has had.  Unless every county in Ireland is prepared to bear the expense of sending someone, the expense of sending out a certain number should be borne by the State, as I do not see why one county should be mulcted and another get the benefit of it.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Blowick's condemnation of everything in front of him and behind him and above and below him.  Everyone should look to his own end of things first and set his own house in order, before starting to condemn everyone else.  It is the grandest thing in the world to come in here and condemn the Department or the Government. One of the reasons why our Central Hospital in Galway is packed out is that we have to keep a number of patients from Mayo, since they seem to have very poor hospital accommodation in Mayo.  I do not know if they have anything at all in the nature of a sanatorium.  Our children's home in Tuam is in the same way.  Half the patients are from Mayo and Deputies such as Deputy Blowick should make a little effort in their own counties to start off with.  They should see that Mayo is a shining example before they start to condemn the Department or anyone else.  We will have an opportunity <Col N="959" /> at a later stage of discussing this further when the White Paper comes before us.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the advance has been made in Galway, where the county council is second to none in Ireland and where the regional hospital is second to none.  So far as the care and comfort of patients are concerned, the county council and the Galway public health authority have not been lacking in any respect.  For that reason, they deserve first consideration from the Department in any of the schemes that are put forward from time to time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I look on this Department as the most important one in the State, as it is solely responsible for the administration of schemes for the general health and well-being of our people.  This is the first Estimate we have had from the Minister for Health and I believe that, no matter what demand is made in this House or in any other Parliament for the improvement of health, it could not be great enough or big enough.  The millions that are spent on the provision of schemes or on cures for diseases or the administration of a proper Department of Health are moneys very well spent. The old saying is that a man who has his health is a millionaire.  From what we read time and again of millionaires who have not their health, we know they look upon themselves as very poor people.  If we have our health, we have everything that is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment, the vast majority of our people are not healthy.  Tuberculosis has got such a grip that if some serious effort is not made to put a check on it, the greater portion of our people in ten or 20 years' time will be wiped out.  It is definitely a plague. Although there is something being done, I am not satisfied that any great battle is being waged against tuberculosis. It is a disgraceful state of affairs that there should be so many persons suffering from tuberculosis parading the streets, living in the same houses as their families, and hundreds on waiting lists for sanatorium treatment. I have known many cases of tuberculous patients being refused <Col N="960" /> admission to hospitals or sanatoria because of lack of accommodation.  The first work the Minister for Health should undertake is the provision of sufficient accommodation for all such people.  Where hospital accommodation cannot be provided, every effort should be made to make special provision in the patient's home.  For this purpose the Government should go all out and give full grants for the erection of a room attached to the patient's house. I am aware that grants are provided by local authorities for that purpose but I consider that the local authorities should have more power in that respect so that any member of a family suffering from tuberculosis who could not get immediate accommodation in a sanatorium or who, perhaps, would be discharged from a sanatorium after treatment, could be provided by the State with an additional room to the cottage or house, where he could be isolated from the rest of the family and have all the facilities necessary to effect a cure. Such provision would go a long way to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Killilea says that he believes that the dance-hall is responsible for the spread of tuberculosis.  Surely Deputy Killilea cannot attribute tuberculosis in a child of three or four years of age to the dance-hall.  How many school children are there who are suffering from tuberculosis?  How many old people are there who have never been in a dance-hall who are suffering from tuberculosis?  I think that is &ldquo;tripe&rdquo;.  The dance-hall has nothing to do with it.  I honestly believe that the real cause of the spread of tuberculosis is the low standard of living and lack of nutrition which arises from the enormously increased cost of living.  Our people are unable to purchase their full requirements of beef and milk.  Our farmers are unable to produce milk in quantities sufficient to allow every citizen to have as much as he requires for proper nourishment.  We have appeals being made and warnings issued as to the safeguards that should be adopted against tuberculosis, but the only remedy that I see for tuberculosis is proper clothing and good food.  That is the greatest defence of <Col N="961" /> all against tuberculosis.  How many children do we see going to school without footwear, without proper clothing?  How many of our people are unable, when winter comes, to buy extra woollens?  I believe that the cause of tuberculosis lies in our low standard of living, our low wage system, and lack of nourishment.  We are only whipping a dead horse in this House when we talk about providing temporary measures.  What we want is to stamp it out completely.  We can do that by providing for our people the necessaries of life and healthy housing accommodation.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that diphtheria and fever are increasing, at least in my constituency, at an alarming rate.  I maintain that the cause of that is the neglect by the local authorities to carry out the necessary maintenance of town drains which have sewage flowing into them.  I consider that there should be a law requiring every local authority to have every drain closed and properly piped.  There should be no open drains in any town or village. I have known cases where local authorities were willing to provide for the piping of town drains and the county engineer would not recommend it to the county managers, and the schemes were not carried out.  In the days of the boards of health more was done in the matter of public health than is being done at the present time. I believe that the County Management Act is a hindrance to members of local authorities, who would like to exercise their duties in the matter of public health.  I have known cases where the engineering staff of local authorities turned down recommendations and the local representatives had no say whatsoever.  There should be subcommittees of each county council, solely responsible to advise the county manager and the medical officer of health on matters relating to the public health of the county.  It was unwise on the part of the Government to abolish the boards of health.  While there was a good deal to be said about the encumbrance they were, there was a good deal to be said in their favour. The members of the boards of health <Col N="962" /> knew exactly the remedies to apply in matters of public health requiring urgent attention.  I believe that at some future date the Minister will have to see that there is more co-operation between local authorities and himself and between the local authorities and county managers and the public representatives.  To my knowledge, that co-operation does not exist and cannot exist until there is legislation introduced or until the Minister for Health takes special note of this matter.  There is great need for the establishment of sub-committees of each county council who would devote their whole time to the question of the health of the county. The old boards of health did a very good service.  They were always there to advise the dispensary doctors. They were responsible for the administration of the health services in their districts and they knew where there was urgent need of proper sanitary accommodation, sewage schemes and proper water supply.  We all know that nothing can spread disease as quickly as bad water.  In this case, when we had the old boards of health in existence they knew the problems that concerned each area and were able to get them attended to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion the mental hospital committee and the other committees that we have in the various counties have not enough power to enable them to advise and to assist in these matters.  I think that if they were given more power, and were put in the position of being able to make recommendations to the Minister, it would lead to a general improvement in the case of our county institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and his Department are actively engaged in the provision of sanatoria and hospitals, but I wonder when we have sufficient hospitals built <Col N="963" /> where the Minister thinks he is going to get personnel to staff them.  We all know that nurses are flying out of the country.  They have received some increase in their salaries, but they find even with that, it is not sufficient to enable them to live up to their professional calling.  Due to the low salaries they receive there is nothing to attract them to remain at home and we find every other week the nurses in our county institutions tendering their resignations and going to England or elsewhere.  Nurses are as important to the community as doctors, and we should endeavour to keep them at home.  One attraction for them would be, I believe, if homes were provided for them in which they would reside when off duty.  I believe that a nurse who works 12 or 13 hours a day should not be obliged to spend the remainder of her time in the same institution as the patients.  It is bound to get on her nerves, and hence I say nurses' homes should be provided convenient to the public institution.  We have one of the finest hospitals in the country in Portlaoighise. It is one of the most efficiently run in the country.  When it was being built a few years ago it was thought that it was too big and too elaborate for the county, but now we find that it is too small and that the patients are lying on the floors.  That hospital is run by a religious order of nuns.  I suggest to the Minister that a convent should be provided convenient to these hospitals for the accommodation of the nuns and a nurses' home for the nurses.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about our dispensary doctors who play a great and a noble part in discharging their very responsible duties.  One may say that they are on duty for the 24 hours of the day.  In my opinion they are deserving of more consideration than they have received in the past.  I trust the Minister will formulate a general scheme whereby dispensary areas will be made smaller than they are.  They are altogether too big.  In some places, parts of a dispensary doctor's district are seven and eight miles from his residence. An effort should be made to have smaller dispensary districts and more dispensary doctors.  People may <Col N="964" /> say that it would be a waste of public money to do that.  In my opinion money that is spent on public health is never wasted.  There are some dispensary areas, too, in which the doctor does not live in his district.  That is due to the failure to provide a dispensary residence.  There is one such dispensary area in my constituency.  I refer to Ballyroan.  There has not been a dispensary doctor there for many years.  A doctor is appointed and he comes there, remains a little time and then goes away because of the lack of housing accommodation.  It should be the Minister's aim to see that a residence is provided for each dispensary doctor.</P>
    <P>I desire to draw the Minister's attention to the state of affairs that exists in the town of Birr. Numerous requests have been made over a long period for the erection of a hospital in that town. The Minister's attention has been drawn to it lately by the Birr Urban Council.  The dispensary is situate about three-quarters of a mile outside the town.  That is very inconvenient for the people living in the town who have to frequent the dispensary.  I had a question down some time ago asking the Minister whether he would not see that suitable accommodation would be found in the town of Birr for the dispensary.  I think that such central accommodation could be secured.  Offaly is a very big county. The county hospital is in Tullamore. That caters for Edenderry, Clara and Daingean, but it is not at all convenient for the people in West Offaly and those living near Roscrea close to North Tipperary. If they require to get treatment in the county hospital they have to be taken all that distance through Birr to the town of Tullamore.  I think it would be far better if a hospital were provided in Birr for the treatment of people in West Offaly and those on the border near North Tipperary&mdash;in areas such as Monafadda, Shinrone and Banagher.  Everything seems to be centralised in the town of Tullamore for the County of Offaly.  That should not be the case. The town of Birr is equally important and it would be convenient for everybody if there was hospital accommodation in that town.  I trust that the <Col N="965" /> Minister and his Department will see that such a hospital is provided at a very early date.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister on what has been done.  I believe the Department of Health suits the Minister far better than the Department of Agriculture. Owing to the fact that he is a member of the medical profession, he has practical knowledge of the matters to be dealt with.  I believe the Minister for Health should have a thorough knowledge of public health matters and should be a member of the medical profession.  The present Minister, I think, takes a great interest in the promotion of public health and he will have the co-operation of all sides of the House in any efforts he makes towards improving the health of the nation.</P>
    <P>In offering to the Minister my appreciation of his services, I think he should do something to expedite the work of dealing with any matters that come up to his Department for sanction.  It is unreasonable that matters should be left undealt with for many weeks. When a county manager sends up a recommendation for an increase in the wages of wardsmaids or other employees in any public health institution, the Department should not copy the methods of the Local Government Department which, we all know, takes six months or a year to answer a letter. This is a new Department and it should start with a clean sheet and give good service to the people, as it is one of the most important Departments in the State.  The only thing I have to complain about is the slowness of civil servants in dealing with matters that come before them.  They are good men, they know their job, they are very obliging, but they should deal with matters coming to them from local authorities with more speed.</P>
    <P>The county manager in my constituency has submitted certain proposals for increases to certain employees in the institutions at Portlaoighise and Abbeyleix and they have not been sanctioned yet.  In connection with such matters there should be an appointed officer who should know whether an <Col N="966" /> increase was justified or not and either sanction it or not sanction it at once, and not have it hanging on for months until some civil servant sees fit to dictate a letter.  Less time should be lost in dealing with such matters so as to give local authorities a chance to carry on their work.  With more co-operation between the Department and local authorities a good deal could be achieved.  Since the Department of Health has been established, a great many improvements in various institutions throughout the country have been outlined.  I am very glad to hear that. I should like again to impress on the Minister the need for a complete overhaul of the county home at Mount-mellick which is very necessary.  That building is almost 100 years old and a big general scheme of repairs will have to be carried out there at a very early date.  The same thing applies to the fever hospital in Abbeyleix, which serves all of South Laoighis, and the county hospital at Portlaoighise.  I hope no time will be lost in sanctioning any proposals that come forward for the erection of a nurses' home or any additions to the existing institutions in that county.</P>
    <P>We happen to be fortunate in having in that county a sanatorium which is very efficiently run and serves a great portion of North Tipperary and Offaly.  The manner in which the staff have catered for the many patients sent there is a great credit to them.  I think that institution needs to be completely modernised.  Just as there is an inspector for mental hospitals, there should be a medical inspector to go round to these other institutions periodically and, where repairs are necessary, draw the attention of county managers to the fact. The sanatorium outside Portlaoighise is most beautifully situated and has a lake convenient to it.  I would be glad if the Minister would see that improvements in the way of decoration and making the place more attractive for the patients are carried out.  He will have the full support of the local authority in doing that.  I wish the Minister good luck in his present position, as he is the right man in the right place.  He knows more about public health matters than any other <Col N="967" /> Minister.  I believe that he is the most suitable person for this Department.  I can assure him that he will have my full support and wholehearted co-operation in any matter that he puts forward to achieve the aims for which his Department was formed.</P>

      <P>This is the first Vote of the Department of Public Health.  I think the nation is very fortunate in having a Minister so well fitted to guide the destinies of that Department. I want to add my voice to that of Deputy Coburn in appealing to the Minister to expedite the provision of the county hospital for Louth.  It is true that this hospital has been on the stocks, so to speak, for the last 22 or 23 years.  It was one of the first hospitals to be earmarked for a grant from the Hospitals Trust Fund, even before the Government controlled that fund.  The delay in building that hospital is not entirely due to the Department.  It is true to say that the local authority was responsible for the delay up to 1939.  I want to make my position quite clear.  I am not blaming the Department for that delay, but I do think that since 1939, notwithstanding the fact that we passed through a very trying time, something more might have been done.  In the town of Drogheda, a first-class, up-to-date, modern hospital of some 50 beds was erected, which is known as the Lourdes Hospital, under the guidance of that great person, Sister Mary Martin.  Surely if a private enterprise can succeed in erecting a hospital, there is no reason why public bodies could not achieve something on the same lines.  I know that the Minister has only begun his duties, and I am not so foolish as some Deputies to expect him to wave a magic wand or to perform miracles in a short space of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hospitalisation necessarily must be a long-term policy.  All of us are claiming our rights for our constituencies, but the Minister must consider what is best for the people as a whole and for the treatment of any particular disease, in particular tuberculosis.  I have studied this question from the statistical <Col N="968" /> point of view over a long number of years and I am quite satisfied that there has been no marked increase in tuberculosis in this country.  I say that unhesitatingly.  Very fortunately, there is an awakening with regard to tuberculosis amongst our population, which is all to the good.  People to-day are more ready and anxious to submit for examination and treatment than they were ten or 15 years ago, and that is largely responsible for the suggestion that it is more prevalent to-day. Statistics will prove that, as I say, there is no marked increase in the incidence of tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>In County Louth, we have four institutions serving the people as hospitals, but none of them is a hospital in the strict sense of the word.  They were erected 100 years ago, most of them having been created during the clearance period after the famine when they wanted to get rid of our people. North County Dublin is about the only area which levelled the institution to the ground and made a road of it, and the sooner all these institutions are levelled to the ground, the better it will be for the health of the people. There is no proper hospital service in any of the four institutions in Louth&mdash; the Louth County Infirmary in Dundalk, the district hospital in Dundalk, the district hospital in Drogheda, and the district hospital in Ardee.</P>
    <P>Our county is a small county with a population of some 63,000 and a valuation of something like £275,000.  Notwithstanding all that, we, the public representatives, are very anxious that we should have our own county hospital in Louth, and I see no reason why there should be any great delay in the Minister giving final sanction to the plans that are being prepared.  Last October, we agreed to an alteration in these plans, which have since been submitted to the Department, and I ask the Minister to take a special interest in this hospital, in view of the fact that Louth was one of the first areas to be recommended for Hospitals Trust grants.  We have got substantial grants from the Hospitals Trust Fund, much of which has been invested, but it will take a good deal more than the amount <Col N="969" /> now available for this purpose to provide the necessary institution.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Drogheda Cottage Hospital, this is an institution some 50 years old.  It was built as a private hospital to cater for the needs of the town and it has always been very highly appreciated because it has saved many of our citizens from having to travel to Dublin for treatment.  This institution, like the rest of our institutions, has now become too small and the hospital authorities seek to make an extension. The matter has been hanging for the past couple of years.  It is a small matter of adding something like a dozen rooms to the existing building. During the war years, we succeeded in getting built a completely new hospital &mdash;an achievement of which the citizens of Drogheda as a whole feel very proud &mdash;and I ask the Minister to give his attention to the sanctioning of the county hospital plans in particular and the proposed extension of the cottage hospital, an institution responsible for a considerable saving to the public purse.  The very large number of patients treated in that hospital, both intern and extern, is surprising, and for that reason the hospital is entitled to special consideration.  We are told that building material is now becoming freely available, and we are all very glad to hear that, and I hope the Minister will see to it that there will be no undue delay in sanctioning the plans submitted for the Louth County Hospital and the Drogheda Cottage Hospital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to tuberculosis, I want to say that money spent in the direction of reducing the incidence of this disease is money well spent and I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the growing demand for better treatment of tuberculosis cases.  In Waterford, we have not got accommodation for these cases and, quite recently, at a meeting at which the report of the medical officer was considered, it was stated that 20 cases were awaiting treatment.  These cases while awaiting treatment are a danger to other members of their families and there is the danger of 100 and more other people becoming infected in the near future.  For that <Col N="970" /> reason, every effort should be made to eliminate the danger which threatens the country in relation to this terrible disease.</P>
      <P>The Waterford County Council recently sought to make provision for such cases by placing at the disposal of the appropriate authority a wing of the hospital in Dungarvan.  I believe that has been turned down, and I should like to know if the Minister is taking any steps to provide alternative suitable accommodation, because the people involved have tried different counties and institutions in which treatment is given to find accommodation and have failed to get it.  I should like to hear the Minister say that he is taking immediate steps to provide for these people.</P>
      <P>Another matter with which I have been dealing in my own locality is the matter of better provision for children whose parents are not able to maintain them properly on their earnings.  When a recommendation to this effect is made by a doctor, the assistance authorities should be in a position to provide more financial assistance for these people, with a view to the provision of better and more suitable nourishment for these children.  When neglected in their early years, these children are the people most likely to be affected by tuberculosis in future.  I urge the Minister to take steps to provide for tuberculosis cases and to arrange for their immediate removal from contact with other members of their families and thereby remove the danger of further infection.</P>

      <P>Absolutely.  Therefore, I shall confine myself to saying to the Minister that I trust, in his administration of this Department and in excogitating the various problems that may arise, he will bear carefully in mind the strongly held opinions of Deputies with a view to creating that atmosphere of bland conciliation which so greatly facilitates, not only Parliamentary procedure, but the effective implementation of the legislation of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the big subject of discussion on this Estimate was the position of sanatoria and, while we all agree that everything possible should be done to provide more sanatorium accommodation, I think Deputies might like to hear something more with regard to the difficulties we are up against and, to some extent, an explanation of what they believe to be very unwarranted and unnecessary delays.</P>
      <P>Santry Court was mentioned by a number of Deputies.  Santry Court was selected and all the experts were unanimous in believing that it was the most suitable place available at that time.  The medical men, not only in the Department, but also medical opinion from those who had a good deal of experience of the administration of sanatoria, together with the architects and the engineers, combined in recommending Santry Court as the most suitable place.  What they were looking for was a place which would accommodate 1,000 patients and, on the pavilion system, they thought they would want 250 acres for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing was to get a place big enough, and there was a limited number of places that came up to the standard with regard to extent.  In a sanatorium, from the medical point of view, you require a very well-drained site; you cannot have that sort of retentive soil which you get in some places.  And again, it must be well sheltered.  Santry Court fulfilled this condition also.  Then it must be within reach of the city, for two reasons. Patients are a long time in a sanatorium and relatives like to go to see them and the patients like to see their relatives.  You must, therefore, consider <Col N="972" /> the convenience of relatives visiting patients.  As well as that, you must consider the convenience of an institution of that kind for the staff.  There would be a very big staff in such a sanatorium; it might number 300 or 350.  Where you have a big nursing and domestic staff it is not so easy to get them to stay in a place unless it is convenient to a city or town.  All these conditions were fulfilled by Santry Court and, therefore, it was selected as the best at that time.</P>
    <P>The point was made that there was a good lot of muddling in selecting it and then giving it up.  I do not think it should be called muddling.  It must be remembered that when Santry Court was selected, Collinstown was an aerodrome with grass runways and was used entirely for cross-Channel traffic &mdash;that is, small planes between here and Great Britain.  If it had remained like that, I do not think it could be considered a nuisance to Santry Court as a sanatorium.  But gradually the conditions changed.  At that time it was considered that Collinstown would be purely a cross-Channel aerodrome and that Rineanna would be the aerodrome for the big planes dealing with transatlantic traffic.  Gradually it was realised it would be necessary to fit out Collinstown for bigger planes.  If a plane could not land at Rineanna it would be well to have an alternative place where it might land in this country rather than have to continue to England or the Continent.</P>
    <P>Then there was a bigger development than might have been expected in the traffic to far-away centres on the Continent.  There was also a tendency to use bigger planes and everything combined to make it imperative that Collinstown should be developed with concrete runways to take larger planes. These larger planes make more noise. I do not think the risk of a plane falling on the sanatorium need be considered, because that risk is something like a million to one chance that it would ever do so.  The real point is that these big planes coming in constantly would have a disturbing effect on patients lying there day after day and liable to be annoyed by anything of that kind.  People in a sanatorium <Col N="973" /> must have rest and contentment above all things and if there is anything that might irritate them, it would be very bad for their health; in fact, it might mean all the difference between recovery and death if there was annoyance of that kind.</P>
    <P>There was also the consideration that people coming back from that sanatorium and asked by their friends what sort of place it was might say: &ldquo;Well, it was a very nice place and we were very well treated, good medical treatment, but the frequent passing of planes over the institution was terribly annoying and it was very hard to sleep at night because of the noise.&rdquo;  That report might get around and people sent to Santry Court might go there with a prejudice that it was not a very nice place to be sent to under any circumstances.  When Santry Court was selected there did not appear to be any great danger from the aerodrome at Collinstown, but there was a gradual growth of business at Collinstown and it was only when that became appreciable that there developed a doubt in the Department of Local Government that perhaps it would be a bad thing to continue with Santry Court.</P>
    <P>In the end, we decided that as we were to spend over £1,000,000 on the building, it would be a great pity to go ahead with it if any fault could be found afterwards arising from any such cause as I have referred to&mdash;heavy planes passing over.  In these circumstances, we decided to abandon the site.</P>
    <P>The next thing that arose was the expense that had been incurred.  It is not true to say, as some Deputies have said, that the place was not insured. It was.  The mental hospital authority that actually owned the place at the time the fire occurred did, in fact, draw the insurance, which amounted to more than they had paid for the place in the first instance, so that they had it very cheaply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The State was eventually &ldquo;stung,&rdquo; I believe, by the insurance company who took action against the <Col N="974" /> Minister for Defence but I am not sure whether they recovered the whole amount from the Department.  The point I want to make clear is that the place was actually insured but negligence was established by the insurance company and that cost the Minister for Defence a certain amount of money. The money spent on the development of this place will, of course, to a great extent be lost.  Some equipment such as piping which will be useful on the new site will be recovered and practically all the plans and the architectural work done will also be utilised on the new site.  I have asked the architects about the matter and they say that with some slight modifications, we shall be able to adapt the plans to the new site.  In all probability, the plans drawn up for the various buildings on the Santry Court site will be used practically in their entirety on the new site so that the work done for the past two years in the architects' offices is not altogether lost.  The delay in changing from one place to another will be only a matter of, I should say, about six months.  We must remember that local authorities as well as the Department, the Dublin Corporation for instance, have met with great difficulties in making even alterations.  The alterations made by them at Rialto have been going on for three or four years although it was a matter of adding only 65 beds.  I am not blaming them for the delay; I do not think they could have done any better.  I am only just giving you an instance of how difficult it has been for the last five or six years to get materials.  We must not find fault with the Department, the corporation or any local authority if there has been a serious delay in providing sanatoria during the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the sanatorium in Mayo was mentioned by Deputy Blowick and other Deputies.  This institution, which is situated at Creagh, near Ballinrobe, has never been a satisfactory sanatorium by any means and there have been many disadvantages connected with it.  The administration building, where the cooking is carried on and where the nurses stay, is a good way from the pavilions in which the patients are kept.  A very <Col N="975" /> serious disadvantage is that food must be carried from the central block to the patients and it is impossible to have the food conveyed to them in a warm and good condition.  There is the other disadvantage, as one Deputy pointed out, that the sanatorium is situate in a corner of the county, miles and miles away from the northern end, and it is not by any means popular when a patient has to be sent to the sanatorium from the northern part of the county.  The Mayo County Council asked to have the sanatorium enlarged but the report which I got on the matter indicated that we could not stop at increasing the bed accommodation because we should also have to increase the cooking accommodation and the accommodation for the necessary staff.  It has always to be borne in mind in enlarging any nursing institution that it is not simply a matter of adding a ward with ten or 20 extra beds.  We must always keep in mind that accommodation has also to be provided for extra nurses and extra domestic staff.</P>
    <P>The sanatorium is also situated in a place where it is practically impossible to buy milk or vegetables, so that they would have to provide these commodities themselves.  It was difficult to see how that could be done because I understand the amount of land available is limited.  It is not easy to see how more fresh vegetables and milk could be provided if the institution were enlarged.  Some of these difficulties might be got over.  They are not insurmountable, but they are difficulties that we must count with.  Even if all these things were provided and the money spent as advocated by the county council, we should still have a very unsatisfactory and unpopular institution, a place that might possibly be closed when good regional sanatoria became available.  On the whole it would appear that the least possible expenditure should be embarked upon there now and that we should try to deal with the waiting list they have by providing accommodation for them elsewhere if we can.  That is a matter into which we are looking, to ascertain if we can spare for patients from the County Mayo some extra beds in the <Col N="976" /> institutions around Dublin in which increased accommodation is being provided at the moment.  I think that would be the best solution of the problem.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies mentioned dispensaries.  It is intended, of course, to improve and, in fact, to rebuild most of the dispensaries and to provide the buildings, according to the modern clinic idea, where people who are waiting on the doctor would have a proper waiting-room and would not be obliged to stand out in the weather, where the doctor would have a proper room to examine patients and where there would be a room also for the extra staff that will be needed.  In some of the bigger dispensaries there may be an extra medical man and in the smaller dispensaries accommodation will be needed for nurses and midwives.</P>

It will take some years to have that done.</P>
      <P>In regard to the county homes, Deputy Cosgrave asked about St. Kevin's.  It is intended to take the chronic patients away from St. Kevin's and to establish as it were a county home, apart from St. Kevin's.  Again, it will take some time to provide some place for these chronic patients.  The commissioner is, with the approval of the Department, at the moment investigating the possibility of removing these chronic patients.  He is to make a report and to submit rough plans for discussion with my Department as soon as possible for that purpose.  It will take some time of course before all these discussions are complete and the scheme is brought to a conclusion but at any rate we are making a move in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the ordinary county home itself. The first thing I believe we should do is to take certain classes of people away <Col N="977" /> from most of the county homes.  As soon as we can provide other accommodation for imbeciles and epileptics they should be taken away.  We should like to provide, as soon as possible, special institutions for people such as imbeciles and epileptics.  The next class that should be removed as soon as possible are the unmarried mothers. Then, eventually, we would be left with only the old people who have retired there for the rest of their lives.  I certainly will favour any proposal from any local authority that will go towards getting a more congenial home for these old people when they alone are left and all the other classes removed.</P>
    <P>On the subject of dispensaries, Deputy Cosgrave asked about Crumlin. Crumlin is one of the first places we have on our list with regard to a new clinic.  Naturally, with the great increase of population there, the present facilities are not adequate. Deputy Cosgrave also mentioned, as an instance, the supply of surgical boots where, apparently, some delay occurs. A medical man recommends something to a patient: the county manager agrees and sends up to the Department for sanction.  I think the Deputy's point was that sometimes there is a delay and that the patient suffers by the delay, in fact, not only pain but perhaps more permanent injury.  A rather undesirable state of affairs exists there.  Wherever, in the past, the Department had given a grant&mdash;say half the cost of a scheme of that kind&mdash; the county manager has always to get prior sanction.  We must try to arrive at some more workable arrangement by giving sanction for a certain scheme or a certain proposal which will cover such things, and where there would not be necessity for individual sanction, so that there will not be any unnecessary delays.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave also asked me if the scheme which I had outlined for the City of Dublin lying-in hospitals and mother-and-child welfare would apply to County Dublin.  The answer is no. County Dublin will have to come into the scheme like any other county on the district medical officer system, that is, the men who are now known as dispensary doctors will become the district <Col N="978" /> medical officers and will take over public health as well as their other duties in their own areas.</P>
    <P>Two matters were raised by Deputies which they do not realise are already being done.  The first is a request that where sanatorium accommodation cannot be found for a patient an extra room should be provided in his own house.  That is already provided. The local authority is authorised to sanction this extra accommodation where there is a tubercular patient. Under this scheme the cost is paid up to £100 or up to two-thirds of the cost, whichever is the lower.  I think it was Deputy Byrne who made the second point which is that we should try to provide for the family of a person who is suffering from tuberculosis. There is provision in the Health Bill which has just passed this House that the local authority will submit a scheme of payments in such cases and the Minister will sanction, or sanction with modification, the scheme put to him and the Department in that case will contribute half the cost.</P>
    <P>I was asked if there was any provision for research into cancer.  A committee was set up to consider this question of cancer pre-war, but I think they had not got very far with their deliberations when the war interrupted them.  We have been considering again either the revival of the same committee or the setting up of a new committee to consider this whole question of cancer&mdash;research into the cause, the treatment, and provision for institutional treatment, and whatever may be necessary in that way.  I hope we may be able to proceed with that in the very near future.  It must be remembered that, as with tuberculosis, early diagnosis of cancer is the important thing, that is, as our knowledge stands at present.  Maybe we may reach the stage of scientific advancement where cancer can be cured even at a later stage than now, but as our knowledge stands we must diagnose cancer at an early stage if we are to have hope of curing it.  Generally speaking, people are inclined to submit themselves for examination much earlier now than they did, say, some years ago.  There is no doubt that that is the experience <Col N="979" /> with tuberculosis.  Many cases are discovered earlier now than 25 or 30 years ago, and it is easier to deal with tuberculosis on that account.  I think the same may apply to cancer, although I cannot say I have seen any great evidence of it.  In these various schemes of mass radiology, etc., that are coming along we may attack cancer as well as tuberculosis as time goes on.</P>
    <P>As we improve the public health and eliminate the mortality from infectious diseases, and so forth, people must die from something and we may have more deaths from cancer as time goes on than at the moment.  If we eliminate cancer, then, I suppose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We will see about that later on.  Some Deputy spoke&mdash;was it Deputy Cogan&mdash;of the nutritional survey and protested against any idea of experimenting on human beings with regard to diet.  We are not.  Deputy Byrne asked about this matter too. We are taking representative samples &mdash;people living, as Deputy Byrne said, in a place like Seán McDermott Street and people living in better circumstances&mdash;and inquiring into the exact diet they have at the moment and what it is costing them.  That is followed up by medical examination of these people to see how they stand under that particular diet.  That is the nutritional survey that is going on at the moment.  We are getting a great deal of material, but it has not been analysed yet to see what deduction is to be drawn from the present dietary and what modifications can be suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked about Galway Hospital, the regional and county hospital, the hospital at Ballinasloe and many more hospitals if they could be provided in other parts of the county.  I will admit that there has been a long delay about the regional hospital in Galway.  I only came across this a few weeks ago in my research into this new Department and I am inclined to spend another few weeks in investigating it. Times have changed in this and in everything else, and I am not sure at <Col N="980" /> all that the regional hospital plan for Galway to replace the county hospital would be at all big enough.  It may be better to plan on a different scale or to go ahead and build it and leave the county hospital there, as it might be needed as well.  We need a few weeks more to look into it, and what we do there will rule what is to be done in Ballinasloe or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>From what Deputy Flanagan said, one would think we were all slave workers&mdash;that the dispensary men, the nurses, the wardsmaids and the attendants were all slaves.  He said we should feed them, clothe them and house them properly.  It is the easiest thing in the world to say that.  The medical men have got an increase recently and the organisation for the dispensary doctors accepted it; the nurses working under local authorities have got a big increase and the nurses' organisation has accepted it; but Deputy Flanagan thinks they should not, and says it was not nearly good enough.  There is no use in Deputy Flanagan or anyone else being positive about tuberculosis being due to malnutrition or low nutrition.  If that were a fact, there should be very much more tuberculosis in other countries than there is here.  There is a variety of causes, as in the case of other diseases.  Probably, as suggested by Deputy Killilea, going to a dance hall and dancing all night, then going out into the cold air and going home and then working all day, has been the cause in a number of cases.  However, as medical men will tell you, if it was as easy as some Deputies suggest to name the cause without there being any doubt about it, the task of the doctors would be very much easier.  You can never get such a simple cause of any disease and all sorts of things come into it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan is under the impression that fevers and diphtheria are increasing in incidence. That is not true at all.  There is a very big decline in the incidence of all fevers, as I mentioned in my opening statement last night.  Things got worse from the beginning of the war up to 1942 or 1943, but since that there has been an improvement all round and that improvement is being maintained, not only in regard to the incidence of infectious diseases, including diphtheria, but also in a number of other diseases.</P>

      <P>Amongst the hospitals mentioned was the one at Birr.  The existing hospital there has been improved and a new hospital might be built sometime, but I am afraid we could not justify putting it high on the priority list.  On the other hand, the hospital mentioned by the County Louth Deputies, that is, for Dundalk, was mentioned by me in the opening statement, when I said it was very high on the list and one of the first that would be tackled.  In regard to the Cottage Hospital at Drogheda, I discussed that matter with Deputy Walsh and pointed out some of the difficulties about it, but I am sure we will get over them in time.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether, before the dispensary clinics are improved or extra depôts established, there is any definite idea of revising the extent of the dispensary areas, as many of them are unwieldy and inconvenient for <Col N="982" /> patients; or whether it would be a function of the local authority to make suggestions to Ministers where there is a prevalence of these unwieldy dispensary areas.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £750,000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1948, for the Alleviation of Distress in Europe due to War.</P>
    <P>The amount which it is proposed to make available in the present year for this service, while only half that provided in each of the past two years, will it is expected be sufficient to cover our outstanding commitments and leave a margin for contingencies.</P>
    <P>Last year, owing to circumstances beyond our control, it was not found possible to despatch the full quantity of certain supplies which had been provisionally allocated, but we did succeed in honouring our commitments in respect of most of them, involving an expenditure of about £1,800,000.</P>
    <P>No draft horses were despatched, as relief demands were in effect confined to requests for foodstuffs, textiles and clothing.  Apart from&mdash;(a) cattle for slaughter, of which 2,000 head were offered to each of the countries, Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia and the British and American zones in Germany; (b) surplus Government stores, all of which were sent to the International Red Cross; (c) 285 tons of bacon supplied to U.N.R.R.A. for distribution in Poland, Austria and the Ukraine, the relief supplies were allocated on the basis of 15 per cent. to Italy, 10 per cent. to France and the balance to the Joint Relief Commission of the International Red Cross for distribution in Central and Eastern Europe.  As from the beginning of 1947, the International Red Cross allocations were distributed by the International Centre for Relief to Civilian Populations.</P>
    <P>There are now several agencies operating in the relief field, and knowing the wishes of the House as to the safeguards in distribution which might be desirable, it may be taken that the <Col N="986" /> agency whose services may be availed of in respect of a particular area will be that considered most suitable.</P>
    <P>Our main outstanding commitments are in respect of cattle and canned meat.  Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia were unable to arrange transport last year when suitable cattle were available, and transport difficulties arose after the export of cattle for the American zone in Germany had commenced. Considerable difficulty arose also in securing supplies of tin plate for canned meat, but we did manage to despatch approximately 3,400,000 lbs. in March last and it is expected that a further 3,000,000 lbs. will be shipped this year&mdash;in fact about 690,000 lbs. have already been consigned to Italy.</P>
    <P>Further shipments of cattle, which in any event would not be possible before August, will depend on the availability of transport.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that developments in the supply position at home may set a limit to relief shipments in kind, and for this reason no specific programme of shipments has been framed for the current year.  There are of course other ways in which it is felt that this country can contribute to the alleviation of the distress which is still so widespread on the Continent.  It is contemplated for instance that we should make some contribution towards the operational expenditure of the Inter-Governmental Committee on Refugees, towards the administrative expenditure of which we already contribute, and it is proposed to make a contribution of £18,000 accordingly. Another possible channel of relief is the International Children's Emergency Fund for the relief of children in the distressed areas of Europe which was established by the General Assembly of the United Nations.  The Secretary-General of that body has invited Governments, including this country, as well as voluntary agencies and individuals, to give the fund generous support.  This appeal is at present receiving consideration.</P>
    <P>Similarly an appeal has been received from the International Red Cross Committee on behalf of prisoners of war. This also is receiving consideration.</P>
    <P>Any money payments for purposes <Col N="987" /> such as these mentioned would of course be outside the present ambit of the Vote, but the necessary formal steps to regularise such payments of the kind as might be considered desirable would be taken in due course by means of a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one point I wish to put to the Minister on this matter.  I think anybody who realises the severity of the sufferings of people in certain parts of Europe will not question the relief which this country has provided and proposes to provide in the coming year.  It has been often stated here that there is sufficient distress at home and that we should confine expenditure to home needs.  However unfortunate the conditions may be here in certain areas, nevertheless, I think we are anxious to assist, and have assisted in so far as our means allow, certain peoples who were stricken by war and by the aftermath of war, but reports or rumours have reached this country from time to time that the distress fund or provisions which were sent from here did not reach those in need, that on certain occasions the provisions sent from this country were diverted to or got into the hands of people who used them, not to assist those in need, but in order to make a profit out of them. The validity or otherwise of these rumours cannot at all times be ascertained, but the fact is that on a number of occasions reports have come that certain cargoes did not reach the desired destination.  At the same time, from reports from certain parts of Europe, in particular from France, it would appear that conditions in France vary greatly in different parts. In the rural areas and in certain cities and towns there is nothing like the distress that was at first painted.  It is significant that the French in many respects have outstripped other countries since the end of the war.  In sport they have succeeded more than a number of other countries.  Their football teams have done very well. Their horses have done exceptionally well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is a fact that because of some <Col N="988" /> fault lying with the French Government or the French administration and through lack of proper distribution of the available foodstuffs in France, there is distress and suffering in certain parts, the Government should make representations to the French Government or to any other Government in Europe, that it is their responsibility, if they have the supplies, to provide effective distribution and that we should not be called upon to supply foodstuffs or assistance where a better system and proper methods of administration and more effective distribution would reduce, if not eliminate entirely, any distress that may exist there at the moment.  I think that while we are prepared to assist those people who have suffered, we should get adequate guarantees and assurances from the Governments concerned that they have exhausted all the powers available to them to alleviate suffering within their areas.  It is only when their entire resources have been exhausted that they should feel obliged to call upon this or other countries in a position to help them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to walk circum-spectly in this matter.  When we appropriate £1,500,000 or £3,000,000 here for canned beef for Europe it may look an awful lot from this end, but there will be very few sovereign Governments in Europe which would peacefully entertain a questionnaire from an Irish Government as to how they were conducting their internal affairs in exchange for a consignment of our canned beef.  Everybody who acknowledges himself to be bound by the obligations of the Christian belief must subscribe to the general proposition that where there are hungry people we must try to feed them, whoever they are, or whatever they may have done in the past.  The acceptance of a general principle of that kind imposes no obligation on us to abandon prudence and commonsense.</P>

    <P>I do not know what function this country has in sending supplies of food to Poland, the Ukraine and Yugoslavia. Poland is a very large exporter of food, and the Ukraine is exporting food to Russia.  I do not think it makes <Col N="989" /> sense for us to be sending food supplies into Russian occupied territories which are themselves sending out food on the foot of arrangements entered into between the U.S.S.R. and their own Governments.  I think it is common knowledge that out of Poland and Yugoslavia large quantities of live stock were removed by the Russians.  I am informed that in Yugoslavia a great part of the supplies delivered there by U.N.R.A. were taken over by the Government, then sold to their nationals, and the proceeds utilised to pay for armaments supplied by Russia, which had been captured from Germany.  These abstruse transactions may be of interest to the people of Russia, but why we should become involved in them I cannot imagine.</P>
    <P>So long as the Taoiseach, when dealing with the distribution of this stuff, was in a position to say to us that he was handing it to some central committee of the Swiss Red Cross which was personally supervising its distribution to individual necessitous persons, my mind was quite at ease, but I discovered with some dismay that this national body had been set aside by what is known as the Paris Committee. That Paris Committee, if my information is correct, consists of delegates from every national Red Cross in Europe.  The national Red Cross in Ireland consists of a fair cross-section of our people, but when you go to Yugoslavia, Poland, Bulgaria or Roumania the Red Cross consists of groups that are obedient to Joe Stalin. If they go to the Paris Committee and fail to do what Joe tells them, they get shot when they go home.</P>
    <P>The result of that situation, as far as I know, as regards supplies delivered to certain eastern European countries through the agency of the Paris Committee and thence to the local Red Cross Societies in their respective countries is this: that if you wear a red tie you get beef and that if you do not you go without.  I do not know that it is any part of our duty to be getting involved in that kind of transaction.  I strenuously object to it.  I do not care whether a man is a Bolshevik, an ex-Bolshevik, an ex-Nazi or an ex-anything <Col N="990" /> else, if he or his wife or his children are hungry I would feed them. I would do that because he is a person in affliction.  What I do strenuously object to is that you have a Government getting control of supplies which we are sending out to feed the hungry, and then using them for the purpose of victimising the hungry because they do not subscribe to the political tenets of that Government.  It is using them for the purpose of enriching those who support it.  What is even worse, those supplies are being used to fill the vacuum created by the domestic Government's readiness to permit the Government of the U.S.S.R. to remove foodstuffs which should have been retained if the domestic Government were doing its duty by its own people and not conforming to the wishes of the Government of the U.S.S.R. on the goodwill of which the domestic Government is depending for its own survival. I know that the simple thing to do would be to close our eyes to all this business, simply to send out the stuff and pat ourselves on the back in the belief that we are doing marvels for the relief of Europe.  If we are going to intervene in these kinds of things, then I think there is a duty on us to exert ourselves to see that the relief which we have been able to make available&mdash; and it is very, very little but such as it is&mdash;will go to those who deserve it.</P>
    <P>I want to say further that we cannot ask France to reassure us that she is controlling the distribution of the foodstuffs in her own country, or ask any other sovereign State in Europe. But I think we are bound to ask ourselves this.  If we have good grounds for believing that there are large accumulations of foodstuffs in a given area and that the people will not give them to their hungry neighbours, that they hold out for a black-market price and send their own neighbours hungry from their doors, how can you possibly justify our sending foodstuffs into an area where that is going on, when unquestionably there are a great many people in this country short of food? I think a great deal of dishonest capital will be made out of the suggestion that, so long as anybody here is hungry, we ought not to send any relief to Europe.  That is a very simple <Col N="991" /> proposition, not easy to controvert, but it could be very dishonestly made. It seems to me, however, that there is something wrong, when there are people hungry in Gloucester Street and Meath Street because they cannot afford to pay for the quantity of good food that would nourish them adequately, when one of the contributing factors to the cost of food is the drain on our supplies by the despatch of food to Europe, if, at the same time, an Irishman can come back from Western Germany and say he was sitting in a farmer's house where there was a sufficiency of plain food, that a knock came to the door while they were at dinner in the kitchen, and the woman of the house, a German woman, went to the door and the Irish visitor heard some altercation take place and the door slammed; when the German woman came back and sat down at the family dinner table in dudgeon and her husband asked her what had annoyed her she said: &ldquo;It is that rascal out from town again.  I gave him potatoes yesterday on his promising to bring me boots for them and he has the impudence to come back to-day with no boots and say he is hungry and he wants more potatoes.  I told him I would see him damned first.&rdquo;  There were plenty of potatoes in the house; they had enough for themselves.  Her approach to the problem was that anyone who wanted her good potatoes should pay her in boots or tangible commodities which would not suffer the penalty of depreciation.</P>
    <P>That is a very practical outlook on life.  But I cannot help feeling that, if the rural community of Germany are not prepared to feed their own neighbours, it is a very severe demand to make upon us that we should send food out to German cities while our own people are hungry.  Of course, what we send is only a drop in the ocean, but it amazes me to see countries like Great Britain and America sending floods of food to feed the German city population when the German rural population themselves will not feed them.  I do not understand that.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, be interested to hear Deputy Brady who toured <Col N="992" /> Europe on behalf of this House.  I do not think he got to Yugoslavia, but he travelled over certain countries in Eastern Europe with a view to reviewing how this food that was provided was being distributed.  I understand that his primary duty was to report to the Government, but I am sure that his colleagues here will be interested to hear his impressions of what he saw. I do not know whether the Minister can place before us to-day the report of Dr. Hourihan and another gentleman who, I believe, toured Yugoslavia on the Government's behalf with a view to seeing how these food supplies were distributed.  I want to say, quite explicitly, that I think the Government were right to send food to the hungry in Europe.  I want to say that I think that, unless certain reasonable misgivings are frankly recognised and dealt with, honest, reasonable people in the country may find ground for resentment when they think we are sending food abroad to people whose own neighbours will not feed them while some of our neighbours have to go hungry.</P>
    <P>It is easy to make a rampageous case against the Government on the ground that they are sending out supplies of food to Europe which they ought to keep at home.  But I do not think that it does any service to any interest our people should hold dear that that kind of case should be made. If I were to arrogate to myself the right to judge people's motives, I might take a different view of all this business.  But none of us is competent to judge our neighbours' motives and I am prepared to take this at its face value as a genuine effort on the part of a small nation, with limited resources, to do what it can in keeping with the Christian precept.  As such, I think it is a good work.  A variety of other motives might inspire it and might very materially alter the quality of what is being done; but I do not think it is necessary to go into that We are entitled, however, to assume that what is being done is being done from the right motive and, on that assumption, I cordially tender to this House on my own behalf and on behalf of those whom I represent and speak <Col N="993" /> for the provision here proposed for the relief of hungry people in Europe, whoever they may be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much regret that I cannot speak in the same way as Deputy Dillon did on this matter.  I hold very strong views as to whether this country should extend help so generously to European States.  I have in the past in this House opposed schemes of this nature and I rise to-day to protest against the sending of food abroad.  I am as charitable a Deputy as stands in this House in my own way and my charity extends as far as that of any other Deputy, but I am one of those who believe that it should be our first and primary aim to place any food we have at the disposal of our own people.  It is two years since I said here that charity begins at home. A public ballot was sponsored by the <i>Sunday Independent</i> some time ago in order to ascertain the views of readers as to the sending of food abroad, and if the Minister read that very valuable journal, he would see that it is quite evident from the vote given against the exporting of food from this country, in the form of gifts or otherwise, to Europe, that the majority of our people are opposed to it and look on it as a very unsound policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that it is Christian charity to extend our sympathy to those who are grief-stricken, homeless or hungry.  That is what we are bound to do, but we are not a country which can afford this policy of exporting food.  We are a country in which many of our people are on the very verge of starvation and recently there appeared in the papers the news item that a family from a certain district of the most fertile county in Ireland, County Westmeath, were removed to Mullingar poorhouse dying from exposure and hunger.  I myself had the experience of placing in a coffin the corpse of a travelling woman who died from hunger not far from my own town. The relatives of that woman were unable to secure one loaf of bread in the town of Mountmellick on the morning her remains lay in a caravan between Mountmellick and Portarlington. When such circumstances exist in our midst, it is insane, unsound, bad <Col N="994" /> policy and merely fishing for cheap praise for us to send to Europe what we want for ourselves and what we are denying to our own people.</P>
    <P>How many have we marching the streets of Dublin to-day with empty stomachs in search of work?  How many of our own people suffering from tuberculosis are unable to get the tinned beef and condensed milk which is going in shiploads from Dún Laoghaire or the North Wall?  This country experienced a shortage of sugar, and, despite the fact that we had a very serious shortage of sugar and that none of our people could get a suitable substitute, I have it on the best authority that the greater part of the condensed milk manufactured in the factories was going across to Europe, so that we are sending to the people of Yugoslavia, whom we condemned a few months ago for their brutal treatment of that prince of the Church, Archbishop Stepinac, whom they hold in prison to-day, shiploads of food to keep them alive so that they may continue to persecute Christianity. Deputy Dillon says he would like to feed these people.  I should be proud to see them die from hunger and I say that without fear of contradiction in any part of my constituency.  Our job should be to look after our own people. What shiploads of food came into this country to feed our people during the famine?  When we are in distress, or want, or when we stand alone, we get very little assistance from outside.</P>
    <P>I notice in the papers that a committee has been set up in France to erect a stone convenient to Napoleon's grave on which the Taoiseach's name is to be inscribed, together with a tribute to the great and splendid part he played in saving the French people from starvation.  If they erect a stone in tribute to his gallant effort to keep the French people from starvation, it will not be possible to erect any stone in this country praising what he has done to save the Irish people from starvation.  There will be plenty of stones erected if tomb stones are erected over the graves of the many dying from starvation in this country to-day, like the poor woman whom I placed in a coffin recently.  The sooner the Minister realises that our own <Col N="995" /> people, richest and the poorest, are up in arms against the export of this food from this country the better.  Is it not a crying shame when meat is not available for our own people and when not a pound of bacon can be secured in our provincial towns, we should read only a few weeks ago that 250,000 tons of bacon were sent abroad?  Why send bacon abroad when our own people need it?  Why send condensed milk abroad when it is needed at home, and why cater for the foreigner, for the persecutors of Christianity in Europe, many of whom are to-day enjoying the gifts sent through the generosity of the Fianna Fáil Government?</P>
    <P>Some time ago, the House voted a huge subscription for the relief of distress in India.  Would it not be much better if the Minister for Finance, instead of sending out this food and other assistance to Europe, directed some of his attention to the distress existing at home amongst our unemployed and amongst the farming community, many of whom, during the severe weather in the winter, lost the last four-legged beast they had?  There was no question of providing compensation for these people, or of relieving the deplorable distress that exists in Wicklow and that exists in my own constituency within a stone's throw of my own door.  I saw several families in practically four parishes in County Laoighis left without food and other necessaries of life, and left without live stock. They are still without their live stock and no financial or other assistance was given by the Government.</P>

      <P>Why not, instead of catering for those people in Yugoslavia and Poland and elsewhere, direct some of our energies towards catering for the distress in our midst?  I very much regret I cannot subscribe to this Estimate presented by the Minister for the relief of distress on the Continent. If we were in a position of prosperity and if we had sufficient food, clothing and shelter for all our own <Col N="996" /> people, then as a Christian country it would be our bounden duty to send our surplus food abroad for the relief of distress in Europe, but that is not the case.  In our midst there are people actually starving and living under deplorable circumstances.  Almost every section of the people is discontented. In spite of those conditions, you are here proposing to deprive our people of their cattle, their condensed milk, their bacon and their sugar.  You are keeping it from our own people and sending it out to Europe.</P>
      <P>If we had commodities in abundance and if our people could purchase the necessaries of life in sufficient quantities, I agree that we could extend our generosity to the people who are in need on the Continent, but this country cannot afford to do that; our people must not allow the food to go.  Imagine food being exported when our people are pinned down to three loaves a week, two ounces of butter, and asked to pay fabulous prices for beef. Meat is a luxury for the working classes.  We are proposing to send food to Poland, a country that can produce sufficient for her own people and for export purposes.  That should not be tolerated.</P>
      <P>I am opposed to this Vote.  Charity begins at home and there is an obligation on us to see that our own people are properly treated first.  If there is food to spare, place it at the disposal of families in Cork Street, in the Coombe and other parts of the city where meat is but a memory and where many essential foods are also but a memory.  The same applies to our larger towns.  Poverty and distress have reached their peak under the Fianna Fáil administration.  This food is being taken from our own people and sent to foreigners who do not give a thraneen about our country or our people, but nevertheless they enjoy our fine food.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the privilege of being the only member of the Dáil who has had an opportunity of viewing conditions in Europe as they are to-day and seeing how the gifts of the Irish people have been distributed to other countries.  I may say those gifts are very acceptable.  I can assure Deputy Cosgrave that although I do not know anything about France, I know something of the conditions in the three countries I visited&mdash;Germany, Austria and Hungary.  I may say that so far as it is humanly possible to distribute goods under the conditions which exist there to-day, our goods are reaching the people for whom they were intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I visited every part of Germany.  I got facilities to go to different places in connection with the distribution of Irish goods.  I could go to any particular place I chose to visit.  Everywhere I went I discovered that the food that was allocated for that particular place, together with clothes, bedclothes, etc., arrived there safely, and the patients in the hospitals and the children in institutions were able to tell me that they had received the gifts <Col N="998" /> from Ireland and that they got amongst other things Irish sugar.</P>
    <P>The conditions are such that it is not possible for every scheme of distribution initiated in this country to be 100 per cent. perfect, but the scheme that has been operated through the officials of the International Red Cross, to whom our Government and people should be deeply indebted, is as near perfection as it is possible to have it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this by the body in Geneva?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanMylesBrady" hpid="Mr. B. Brady Mr. B. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. Deputy Dillon referred to the change in the name.  At the last International Red Cross Conference, in so far as I understand the position, it was decided that the function of acting as agents for outside relief organisations was not the function of the International Red Cross and some separate independent body would require to be set up to carry out that function.  Consequently, the body operating in Geneva, which is composed of the same personnel, are, so far as I know, carrying out the distribution of gifts to-day.  A change had not come about when I was there. It was on the 1st January this year that the change came about.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon talks about a woman in Germany who turned a hungry man away from her door, but it must be remembered that in any community you will get individuals, people of the type of Deputy Flanagan, who talk about charity beginning at home, who will always turn away a hungry man or woman from their doors.  While the rural community are not nearly so badly off as the people in the cities, it must be remembered that a quota is placed on the farmers in Germany. The farmers have to provide a certain amount of potatoes, milk, etc.  Where it is possible, the occupying authority leaves it to the German Government to collect that material, but if the German authorities do not do it, the soldiers of the occupying authority go out and seize the fixed quota of foodstuffs from that household.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rural community are forced to contribute in that way.  The foodstuffs are brought into the towns and are distributed <Col N="999" /> by the German local authorities or by the occupying authorities. There are two zones, particularly in Germany, where the occupying authorities, which are no small fraction of the total population, take from each particular farmhouse their quota of potatoes.  The Russian authorities and the French authorities take the foodstuffs from the farmhouses and whatever is left is distributed among the Germans themselves.  When an individual farmer has contributed his quota to the common pool, after the occupying authorities have taken what they need, there is not very much left to distribute in charity to anybody.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon made another point that may seem strange but conditions are such that nothing seems strange to me.  He made the point that Poland was a great exporting country. Hungary before the war was the garden of Europe; it provided wheat for itself, for Austria and for some part of Poland.  Deputy Flanagan talks about our ration of bread being only six pounds per week but, when I left Hungary, the ration of bread there was only one loaf per person per week and Hungary was the granary of Europe ten years ago.  It is all very fine for Deputy Dillon or any other Deputy to say that the domestic Government should see to it that the food in the country is distributed to its citizens. Remember, domestic Governments in a great many countries to-day have very little to say as to the ultimate distribution of foodstuffs.  The big stick is always held over their heads.  If the Russians say that they want 20,000 head of cattle, they are going to take them whether the domestic Government likes it or not.  In the same way, if they want agricultural machinery, industrial machinery or manual labour which may be available in that country, they are going to take it whether the domestic Government likes it or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it common sense then to send live cattle in the front door to these countries while the Russians are taking them out the back door?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanMylesBrady" hpid="Mr. B. Brady Mr. B. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>No live cattle have been sent from this country.  Representations <Col N="1000" /> were made to me about that matter of getting live cattle to help these people to rebuild their farm stocks.  Unless something like that is done these people are not going to take any action to rebuild their agricultural economy.  I have been assured that if cattle were distributed through the International Red Cross, or some international body such as that, they would not be interfered with.  The Russians, when they first occupied these countries, were badly in need of food themselves and there was more of a feeling in that direction, which has probably now died down.  There was more of an incentive to take reprisals for seizures made when their country was occupied by an invading army. You had all these factors operating at the time Russia invaded Hungary.  I am not defending the Russians but I think I can say there was a feeling at that time that they were just having revenge for seizures formerly made on themselves.  The feeling now is that that phase is over and that, even if live cattle were sent out there for breeding purposes, they would probably not be interfered with.  If a number of bulls were sent out there to restock the farm, I think they would not be interfered with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making my own speech now and I shall make it whether Deputy Flanagan likes it or not.  I am not playing to any gallery.  There are certain people in this country like <Col N="1001" /> Deputy Flanagan who are continually repeating the parrot cry that charity begins at home but it is a damn bad charity that ends there.  People who talk like that do not know the meaning of the word charity.  If Deputy Flanagan had an opportunity, such as I had, of going to Germany, for example, and seeing the conditions under which people live there, he would have a different story from that which he put before the House to-day unless he has a heart of stone.  If there are people in this country who are starving, I say it is their own fault.  There is plenty of provision made for them in this country, either through Government aid or charitable organisations and there is no necessity for anyone to die of starvation.  Deputy Flanagan knows as well as I do that anyone who is talking in that strain is talking nonsense.</P>
      <P>Seventy to 90 per cent, of the cities of Germany are destroyed to-day.  The people have no homes, no living accommodation except in the cellars and air-raid shelters.  In addition to their homes being destroyed, at least 60 per cent. of the cooking utensils and equipment have been destroyed and when their homes were destroyed, their clothing, boots and shoes were destroyed. Most of them are down to the last garment and the last pair of shoes. We heard a lot of talk about the conditions in Belsen camp&mdash;and I mention this not for the purpose of condoning the conditions in Belsen camp&mdash;but the prisoners in Belsen camp were allowed 800 calories per day.  There were people in Germany last October and November&mdash;and I am sure the same is true to-day&mdash;who were living on far less than 800 calories per day.  Remember that was regarded by the people in charge of the camp as just sufficient to keep the prisoners alive, to keep them under starvation conditions.  I could give many further instances but I do not want to delay the House further than to say that if Deputies in this House had an opportunity of seeing the conditions in Europe to-day, they would be prepared to go even much further than we have gone so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They would go even much further than we have gone so far.  Deputy <Col N="1002" /> Flanagan said that if we were a rich country, if we had work enough and all those things, it would be all right to send food.  There is not much charity when a man gives something of which he has plenty.  If it does not hurt a man to give something, then there is not much charity about his giving.  There is an old saying here in Ireland that the poor are good to the poor.  It is the few countries that escaped the war, and only a very few, that are in a position to help Europeans to-day.  Take a country with a population similar to our own or with, perhaps, a little more&mdash;Switzerland. Switzerland has two meatless days per weak.  Switzerland has subscribed in meat, food of various kinds, clothes and other commodities at least ten times as much as this country to the relief of distress in Europe.  The only fault I have to find with this Vote is that the amount we are giving to the relief of the people in Europe is not sufficient. I think we should give far more generously this gift which has the approval and the support of the whole people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan talks about this gifts as being a gift from the Fianna Fáil Government.  It has been the experience, since this Vote was first introduced in this House, that the representatives of all the responsible Parties in this House have supported this Vote and that down throughout the country in every county, town and village, people have subscribed to the appeal of the Irish Red Cross Society to help the people in Europe.  Our experience is that the people of this country are wholeheartedly behind the Irish gift to Europe and that it is not a Government gift.  It is a gift from the whole Irish people.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would like to say that one would have to witness the expressions of thanks and gratitude of the people of the countries I visited&mdash; Germany, Austria, Hungary&mdash;to appreciate what the Irish gift has meant to them.  I have met three Cardinals, three or four Archbishops, Bishops of Protestant Churches, and representatives of the various Governments and all have expressed their gratitude to the Irish people for the help that they <Col N="1003" /> gave them in their hour of need and they expressed also, as I wish to express on their behalf now, the hope that that help will be continued.</P>

      <P>On many occasions in this Dáil Deputy Flanagan has behaved in a way in which one would think that he was trying to bring the greatest possible disgrace upon himself and upon the name of his country.  Particularly when there are strangers from abroad present he gets up here and acts in a manner which, if we saw it on the stage in this country or in any other country, the theatre would be torn to bits because it would be condemned as stage Irishism and a libel on the Irish people.  That seems to be the standard of conduct which Deputy Flanagan always tries to achieve.  With that I will leave him&mdash; leave him to the praises he spoke about, &ldquo;the cheap praises&rdquo; of the <i>Sunday Independent.</i></P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon raised a question which has always been present in the minds of the Government Departments here with regard to the distribution of the gifts of the Irish people to Europe.  On all possible occasions the Government has tried to distribute these gifts of the Irish people to the Continent of Europe in a way in which the distress of these peoples would be best relieved.  Agencies of various kinds have been selected according to the availability of such agencies.  Other relieving agencies are now coming into the field.  As I said in my opening statement, the Dáil may take it for granted that &ldquo;the agency whose services may be availed of in respect of a particular area will be that considered most suitable.&rdquo;  That is as far as we can go in the line of any guarantee in that matter.  I am personally convinced from all that I have heard that the foodstuffs we have given have <Col N="1004" /> been distributed in a way which would give the greatest possible relief.  I agree with Deputy Brady that rather than try to cut down on this Vote we should extend it, if it were possible to do so. Deputy Brady and those who feel like him in that regard will have to realise that for the last couple of years we were not able to spend the amount of money which the Dáil here approved of.</P>
      <P>For a couple of years the Dáil voted £3,000,000 per annum and the instructions given to the committee in charge of this, representing various Government Departments, were to do their utmost to see that the food would be delivered.  We are not situated, as Switzerland is, in the heart of Europe. We are here on the fringe of Europe and we could not deliver with our own trucks or our own railways the food, the cattle, and the other things which our people were prepared to give.  We are depending upon various other Government agencies.  I am not throwing any blame on them.  They had a very difficult task to try to reorganise transport out of the chaos into which the last phases of the war reduced them.  Already, of this £1,500,000 which we are voting this year, quite a substantial amount has been promised. I hope that food will not be the biggest want of the European peoples in the coming 12 months.  We are getting authority here from the Dáil in this Vote to make contributions for the relief of distress in other ways than in the giving of food.  For instance, there is an Inter-Governmental Committee on Refugees and we are making a contribution of £18,000 to it.  Then there is the International Children's Emergency Fund, to which we propose to make a contribution also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another fund for the relief of distress among prisoners of war which must be one of the matters causing the most acute pain to the women of Europe.  As I said in the beginning, the Dáil may take it that everything possible will be done by the Government to see that this gift of the Irish people under this Vote will be spent&mdash;Deputy Flanagan's falsehood about the Taoiseach's name being put on a stone in Paris is a fitting one from him&mdash;will be spent in a manner which the Irish people would like and <Col N="1005" /> which will redound to the credit of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>I wish to put a question in regard to what is now known as the Marshall Plan.  As Deputies are aware, the United States Secretary of State, speaking at Harvard recently, announced that the policy of the United States Government now was to offer its assistance to the sovereign States of Europe, on condition that those sovereign States would themselves undertake the preparation of a plan acceptable to themselves and furnish that to the United States Government, so that that Government might feel that, in providing the wherewithal to make it possible for this plan to operate, no question could arise of the Government of the United States having alleged against it, with any pretence of verisimilitude, that they were making their assistance conditional on the abrogation of any of the sovereign rights of the European States who wished to avail of the assistance offered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pursuant to that generous and historic <Col N="1007" /> declaration on the part of the United States of America, Deputies will remember that Mr. Bevan, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in Great Britain, took the initiative and invited M. Bidault and M. Molotov, of the French and Russian Governments respectively, to meet him in Paris.  That meeting has taken place and, as a result of the manifest desire and intention of the Soviet Government to wreck the enterprise, the Soviet representative made no constructive proposals at all, but declined even to discuss any of the proposals that were advanced and returned to Moscow.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, that manoeuvre has not resulted in the other nations&mdash;France and Great Britain&mdash;abandoning the attempt to prepare a coherent scheme for the rehabilitation of Europe.  I understand that they have jointly declared that it is their intention at an early date to extend an invitation to every sovereign Government in Europe to consult with them as to the preparation of such a scheme.  I think it is right, in any case, to afford the Minister for Finance an opportunity for saying (1) whether his Government anticipates such an invitation would reach us and (2) whether his Government, having examined the probabilities in connection with the matter, are prepared to inform the House what the intention is in the event of a certain invitation reaching them.</P>
    <P>I agree that, under ordinary circumstances, it would be preferable if an inquiry of this kind could be postponed until the invitation had reached us, but inasmuch as it looks very much as if the invitation, should it come at all, will come when this House is in recess, and inasmuch as it is very important, from every point of view, that every sovereign State taking part in these deliberations should be free to proceed with all despatch, I think it is necessary to raise the matter now, so that the Government may feel that it is free to pursue the policy it has determined upon in regard to this matter, in the knowledge that it is fortified with the views of the members of this House, in the light of such information as the Government may see fit to impart.</P>

      <P>The invitation referred to by Deputy Dillon has not reached the Government formally, but I understand it is on its way.  As the matter arose only this morning, the Government has not had time yet formally to decide the answer to the invitation.  I cannot commit the Government as to what the answer will be, but the Deputy himself can see that, in the past couple of years, conferences of all sorts and kinds have been called to which an Irish delegation has been invited.</P>
      <P>Whenever these conferences were for the purpose of doing anything for the reconstruction or relief of Europe the invitations were warmly accepted and a delegation went.  I suppose this invitation will be considered by the Government, to-day or to-morrow, as soon as it reaches us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  As I informed the Dáil last November when the measure setting up the new Departments of Social Welfare and Health was before it, the Government's intention was to retain under the Department of Local Government those services which aimed at creating a sanitary environment, whilst services which were more directly concerned with the treatment and cure of disease would pass to the new Department of Health.  The measure which I am now submitting to the House has been framed is accordance with that general line to provide us with a sanitary code better adapted to modern requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1010" /> The existing powers of local authorities in relation to sanitary services are based on the Public Health Act of 1878.  That Act was a consolidating Act and in regard to sanitary matters comprised provisions that previously were to be found in about 20 statutes. It aimed at creating a sanitary minimum, especially in towns where in the last century recurrent outbreaks of epidemic disease claimed many victims. In its time the Act was undoubtedly a great advance.  It substituted a constructive code for what had been a negative policy and opened up the way for the many beneficent measures that followed.</P>
    <P>It will, however, be readily understood that a sanitary code formulated more than half a century ago requires revision to meet the needs and the higher standards of to-day.  The Act of 1878 has been extended and amended, not merely by later Public Health Acts, but by separate provisions scattered through enactments which do not form part of the sanitary laws.</P>
    <P>The time is now ripe for a consolidation of sanitary legislation to make it more readily intelligible to persons affected by its provisions.  This Bill, while it does not purport to be a full consolidating measure, will provide a measure of consolidation and will also remedy certain defects in the existing law.</P>
    <P>The Bill is divided into seven parts. Part I contains the usual preliminary matter, definitions and such like, and the remaining parts deal respectively with drainage, water supply, temporary dwellings and use of land for camping, provision of baths, washhouses, bathing places, etc., disposal of bodies, and miscellaneous matters.</P>
    <P>Part II of the measure will strengthen the powers of sanitary authorities to enforce the connection of premises with existing sewerage systems.  At present owners of premises can be compelled to connect only in cases where not even an absolute minimum of drainage already exists.  I feel, and I am sure the House will feel, that a higher standard than this should be set and that where a public system has been installed, drainage by means of cesspools or similar arrangements should no longer be permitted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1011" /> The Bill introduces a new procedure for dealing with this problem.  If it becomes law, owners of premises may in future be required on the coming into force of a drainage Order, to carry out specified works for the drainage of separate premises.  The conditions for the making of a drainage Order are set out in Section 12 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>So far as the works covered by a drainage Order are concerned, the sanitary authority shall lay such portions of them as pass through land not the property of the owner of the premises to be connected and, if the total length of sewers necessary exceeds 100 feet, the sanitary authority shall provide the portions in excess of that length.  In other words, an owner of premises to which a drainage Order applies shall in no case be required to meet the cost of laying more than 100 feet of sewer.</P>
    <P>Under Section 17 the local authority has power to ascertain the cause of nuisances in drains and to take steps to have the defective drains repaired.</P>
    <P>In case of default by an owner the sanitary authority, under Sections 16 and 17 of the Bill, may carry out the necessary work and recover the cost. There is provision, however, in Sections 13, 15 and 17 for an appeal to the Minister in the event of dispute arising in relation to the making of a drainage Order, the works to be executed by the sanitary authority, or payment for works executed by such an authority.  Part III of the Bill contains somewhat similar provisions in relation to water supplies.  The only existing provision under which a sanitary authority can require a building to be provided with a proper domestic water supply is Section 72 of the Act of 1878.  This section is defective in several respects.  It takes no account first of all of the improved standard of supply which should be required when the building is in an area where a piped water supply is available.  Moreover, it relates only to dwellinghouses, whereas very often it may be desirable in the public interest that buildings not used as dwellings should also be served by a water supply.</P>
    <P>Lastly, before a sanitary authority <Col N="1012" /> can serve the notice provided for in Section 72 of the Act of 1878, the Minister must determine that the cost is reasonable, yet there is no provision for him to consider representations made by the owner before he comes to his decision in this regard.  Under Sections 20, 21 and 22 of the Bill a simplified procedure is laid down for requiring the connection of a house or other building with a public water supply.  It empowers the sanitary authority to make a provisional water supply order requiring the connection to be made in a specified manner within a stated time.</P>
    <P>Section 23 prescribes that the sanitary authority, as in the case of drainage connections, shall make all portions of the system which are more than 100 ft. from the building to be served.  In the event of default, as before, the work can be executed by the sanitary authority and the cost recovered from the owner.  An appeal to the Minister is also provided for in the event of dispute.  This procedure, it will be seen, follows very closely that prescribed in Part II of the Bill, that part which relates to the making of a drainage Order.</P>
    <P>Spring wells on private property are the source of the domestic water supply of many rural dwellers.  In many areas where there is at present no public supply, considerable improvement in conditions could be obtained at little cost if the local authority could improve small private supplies.  They have at present, however, no power to do this.  Section 26 will give them this power and will thus enable local authorities to make grants to private persons, or to incur expenditure themselves, for the provision, improvement or maintenance of water supplies which are not public supplies.  The consent of the Minister will be required in all cases.</P>
    <P>Difficulty is at times experienced by local authorities in carrying out repairs to water pipes running through land which is not the property of the owner of the premises affected.  Power is given under Section 28 to a sanitary authority at the request and at the cost of the owner of the premises to <Col N="1013" /> enter on lands for the purpose of carrying out the necessary repairs.</P>
    <P>Part IV relates to temporary dwellings and camps.  There has been a considerable growth in the practice of holiday camping in tents, huts and caravans and there are indications that the practice is likely to increase in popularity.  There is no intention to interfere unwarrantably with this healthy and inexpensive method of holiday-making, but it is felt that some degree of regulation is necessary.  The only existing legal power to deal with this matter is contained in Section 20 of the Local Government Act of 1925. This Section was framed primarily, however, to apply to those itinerants who are in the habit of dwelling temporarily on road margins.  Something more is needed to deal with the conditions which I have in mind.</P>
    <P>Accordingly it is proposed in Part IV of the Bill to give power to sanitary authorities to make by-laws in respect of the use of temporary dwellings. Such by-laws may relate to habitable condition and cleanliness, the prevention of injury to the amenities of the locality, the securing of orderly behaviour by the occupants.  The relevant provisions in this respect will be found in Section 30.</P>
    <P>Section 31 goes further and empowers sanitary authorities to prohibit temporary dwellings in any part of their district if they are satisfied that the erection or retention of such dwellings would be prejudicial to public health, or the amenities of the district or would interfere to an unreasonable extent with road traffic.  This section, I should mention, gives to any aggrieved person a right of appeal to the Minister.  Sections 32 and 33 are designed to prevent nuisances arising from the use of temporary dwellings.</P>
    <P>I think it will be agreed that if landowners make their lands available for campers as a profit-making enterprise it is not unjust to require them to provide reasonable standards of convenience. Section 34, accordingly, relates to permanent or semi-permanent camping grounds; it provides for the issue of a licence by the sanitary authority to an occupier of land, authorising the use of such land for camping for a period of 12 months. <Col N="1014" /> The licence may include conditions as to the maximum number of dwellings, their nature and size, the distances between any two, the distance from the public road, sanitation, behaviour of campers, maintenance of healthy conditions, preservation of amenities and the employment of a warden to supervise the camp.</P>
    <P>It will, if the measure passes, be illegal for a person without a licence to use land for camping for more than 14 consecutive days or more than 30 days in a year.</P>
    <P>Licences may also be granted by the sanitary authority direct to a camping organisation with the consent of the landowner.  Any organisation which desires to avail itself of this provision will require to obtain from the Minister recognition as a camping organisation.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill introduces a complete code relating to the provision of public baths, including swimming baths. It consolidates and amends the Baths and Wash-houses Act of 1846, Section 77 of the Town Improvement Act, 1854, and Sections 92 and 93 of the Public Health (Amendment) Act of 1907.  The existing power to provide these amenities is available to urban authorities and town commissioners, but may be conferred on rural authorities by the Minister under the Public Health Act of 1896.  It is now proposed to confer full powers on county councils.  It is considered that the financial resources of town commissioners are generally too small to permit of undertakings of this kind but any town commissioners who have already provided baths, etc., will be permitted to continue to operate them.  At present a sanitary authority can provide baths only within their administrative area.  The Bill extends that power to the establishment of these facilities outside their district subject to the consent of the sanitary authority of the area where the baths will be situated.  It is hoped that this power will facilitate the provision of open-air swimming pools.  As a natural corollary to all this the Bill also gives power to provide lifeguards and swimming resorts, to arrange for instruction in swimming and rescue from drowning, and to make by-laws for the regulation of swimming baths <Col N="1015" /> and bathing places and of public bathing.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill contains regulations in regard to the disposal of the remains of deceased persons.  While at present burials usually take place in recognised burial grounds, Deputies may perhaps be surprised to learn that there is no legal provision requiring this to be done.  If burials are permitted in other places no records are kept and the usual regulations as to depth of soil, etc., cannot be enforced. Accordingly it is now proposed under Section 44 to prohibit burials in any place but a recognised burial ground. Exceptional circumstances may, however, arise occasionally and the Bill makes provision for the consent of the Minister to be obtained in such cases. Sanitary authorities have at present no power to undertake for a consideration the care of graves in burial grounds under their control.  This practice is common in the case of burial grounds maintained and controlled by other bodies and it is proposed under Section 45 to give such power to sanitary authorities.  Such arrangements are desirable from many standpoints and the power to be conferred, if properly exercised, should bring about an improvement in the appearance of many cemeteries.</P>
    <P>Section 46 deals with exhumations. There is at present no power, save under Section 15 of the Coroners (Amendment) Act, 1927, or for police purposes to permit the exhumation of bodies except from burial grounds under the control of sanitary authorities. It is desirable to control exhumations, when required, in other burial grounds so as to ensure that they are carried out with propriety. The section provides that exhumation may be carried out only under licence granted by the Minister.  Section 47 empowers the Minister to make regulations to govern the disposal of human remains otherwise than by burial.</P>
    <P>The miscellaneous provisions of Part VII are intended to remedy a variety of defects or gaps in existing sanitary law.  While urban authorities are at present authorised to provide playgrounds, the position in regard to <Col N="1016" /> rural authorities is less clearly defined. Section 48 of the present Bill confers the necessary powers on all sanitary authorities and will simplify procedure.</P>
    <P>Section 29 of the Public Health Act, 1878, prohibits the erection of any building over any sewer of an urban authority.  It is proposed under Section 49 to extend this prohibition to the erection of any building over a sewer or a water main of an urban or rural sanitary authority.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable change of opinion and of policy in recent years in regard to the method by which special expenses in rural areas are charged and many county councils now prefer to charge all special expenses on the county health district generally rather than to require the expenses to be met in their entirety by the area benefiting, and the new arrangements in regard to the agricultural grant will encourage this tendency.  Under existing law the determination of the area of charge requires an Order to be made by the Minister in every case.  Under Section 50 of the Bill it is proposed that all such expenses shall be general expenses unless the county council apply to the Minister for an Order fixing a special area of charge.</P>
    <P>These are the general purposes of the Bill.  I am sure there will be general agreement in regard to them; for all Parties in the House appreciate the importance of creating a healthy environment and the need for good water supplies, good drainage and sewage disposal and other requirements of sanitation.  The provisions contained in the Bill are simple and practical and will remove some of the difficulties that hitherto have impeded progress.  I am certain that the local sanitary authorities through whose agency we have to work will welcome them.  Accordingly, I commend the Bill for Second Reading to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill and I look upon the legislation which will be made effective by its final passage through the House as a considerable improvement.  When speaking on the Estimate for the Department of Health, I referred to the question of drains convenient to towns which are causing a considerable amount of inconvenience and which have a very serious effect on the health of the community. I know of a number of such drains in my constituency which the local authority has no legal right to put into a proper sanitary state or even to have them piped.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied the Minister is going a long way to meet the problem of having proper sanitary accommodation attached to houses and connecting many of these houses up with main sewerage schemes.  I hope the necessary steps will be taken as soon as possible to compel local authorities who have houses or cottages of their own in large towns where there are the most elaborate sewerage and water schemes to connect these houses up with these schemes.  That is long overdue, and it is in the interests of public health that every house in every town and in villages of from 300 to 400 population should have a proper water supply and proper sanitary accommodation.  It is deplorable that in many large provincial towns in which the local authorities have undertaken large schemes of houses only the most modern houses built since 1932 are connected with main sewerage schemes.  The failure to connect these houses has a very serious effect on the health of the occupiers and I am pleased that there is to be some improvement in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had expected that provision for fair greens would have been made in such legislation as this.  In many towns in which fair greens are not available fairs are held in the streets, and a good deal of opposition, perhaps; might come from the trading elements in these towns if the fairs were removed, but I believe that would be a very selfish way of looking at a matter <Col N="1018" /> which is important from the point of view of the public health.  All sorts of live stock are on the streets for the greater portion of the day.  I know many of these towns in which it is impossible for a man to walk through the streets the following morning or even the following evening, in a great many cases.  Even in towns where there are not town commissioners, the county councils should be compelled to see that the streets are swept clean after fairs.  It is only to be expected that, after a fair, these towns should be in a condition which would enable people to pass along the streets.  In my own constituency, I have known cases of fairs being held after which one would be afraid to put one's nose out the door the day after the fair.  That is a deplorable state of affairs from the point of view of public health.  It may be said that it is not right to take a fair away from a town because it would mean doing away with business, but the fair can be conducted on the fair green and then those engaged in the purchase and sale of live stock can do their business in the towns.  I hope the Bill will be amended in such a way as to ensure that, in the absence of a fair green, the local authorities will be compelled to clean the streets immediately after a fair.</P>
    <P>As I say, the connecting of houses with main sewerage schemes is long overdue and I am very glad that some steps are being taken in this respect. The Minister spoke about the provision of land for camping.  I do not understand the section because I have not read the Bill very closely, and I am wondering if the local authority is to be given power to remove those of the itinerant class who camp convenient to a town and cause a nuisance and annoyance.  It is only right that some legislation be enacted to deal with this matter in order to prevent these people from loitering on main roads.  One section of people are as good as another and every person has a right to live, but, at the same time, the manner in which people of this class camp by main roads is not a credit to themselves or to the country generally. I am glad that steps are to be taken to see that these people camp <Col N="1019" /> in less noticeable places and cause less inconvenience to the general public.  The provision of safeguards in respect of swimming pools and so on is also an important point.</P>
    <P>Having read over the Bill and having heard the Minister's statement, I find that there is no part of the Bill which is in any way objectionable.  The Bill is heartily welcome and I gave the Government an assurance previously that, whenever legislation was introduced to benefit the community, they would get my wholehearted support and co-operation.  This is a Bill for the protection of the public health and for bringing about greater efficiency and a Bill which the Minister will experience very little difficulty in piloting through the House after the Recess.  He is to be congratulated on the very important provisions contained in it and on the fact that, when the Bill becomes law, it will bring about considerable improvement in many directions.</P>

      <P>While I agree that there is very little desire for a prolonged discussion on this Bill, it is well to sound a note of caution, because I do not think the Minister will get all the sections of the Bill without considerable discussion and some attempt at least to amend them.  The Bill is non-contentious and represents, in the main, the non-contentious portions of the Public Health Bill discussed last year. With regard to the provisions for the improvement of drainage, water supplies and other amenities, the Government will have wholehearted support, but we must, however, be very careful to ensure that, so far as possible, no injustice is done to local authorities, ratepayers or private owners of property.  It is essential that a fair balance should be struck between the rights and interests of the community and the rights and interests of the individual, and while it is desirable, particularly in towns, to ensure that there is proper sanitation and sewerage, there is always the danger that there may be imposed upon some private owner an excessive charge for which he ought not to be held liable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I welcome in particular is the provision for improving our water <Col N="1020" /> supplies generally.  That is one of the most important and most desirable reforms, because it is true that many of our smaller villages are inadequately catered for, and, even where supply systems are installed, perhaps because of the minor nature of the scheme, or because of the limited demand in these places, the entire scheme in many villages I know is not as satisfactory as it should be.  I know some villages in which the people, notwithstanding the fact that they have a piped water supply, still depend for their drinking water on their private wells.  They find the piped water is unsatisfactory for drinking purposes.  It may pass all the medical tests, tests in regard to chemical analysis; it may be all right that way, but it is unsatisfactory from the drinking point of view.  Possibly, that is because the schemes are small and it may not be so easy to have proper filtering and the proper precautions to ensure that the water will always be in good condition.</P>
    <P>With regard to the rural areas, it is absolutely necessary to make a big step forward.  I do not believe in a piped water supply for houses in the rural areas.  The spring well is the best.  I am not particularly keen on rural houses having water laid into them, because that would be very expensive.  You want an all the year round water supply convenient to the kitchen door.  If you can achieve that, you are getting a long distance. The main thing is that the water should be good and that it will be in sufficient supply the whole year round.  The position in regard to many areas is that you have one pump catering for nine or ten houses, and that is not satisfactory.  It means that the woman of the house has to travel sometimes a quarter of a mile in order to procure water and, in addition, it means that the pump is public property and it is liable to be damaged.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes provision for swimming pools.  I think every urban centre should have swimming facilities. Nothing is more conducive to a better standard of living and to health exercises for our people.  I have often wondered would it be desirable to provide this amenity free, or would it be <Col N="1021" /> better to have a charge.  My feeling is that any amenity of this kind is more appreciated if there is a reasonable charge for admission.  Usually you find that where you have a public swimming pool and there is no charge, it is not appreciated to any great extent. I suppose that if cinemas were open all day and there was no charge, we might not have such long queues for admission.  I think that if a swimming pool was covered to provide protection from the weather, a pool which would give all the necessary comforts and amenities, the public would be quite willing and happy to pay a molerate charge for admission and would regard it as a very desirable thing.</P>
    <P>Strangely enough, I am inclined to agree with Deputy Flanagan with regard to fairs on streets.  It is a rather extraordinary thing that there is tremendous opposition to the removal of fairs from the public streets.  Farmers generally, however, would be inclined to welcome the provision of fair greens, provided they were convenient to the railway stations or to the loading banks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as farmers are concerned, they will always find their way to the pubs if they have the money. We have gone through times when farmers took their cattle to the fair and found their pockets were so empty that they had to remain on the streets all day, even though the pubs were only a few yards away, and that was simply because their cattle were unsaleable. These days, I hope, have passed.  The publichouses are always near enough to anyone who has the money to enjoy them.  I think it would be in the public interest and in the farmers' interest, too, if proper fair greens were provided. It is not that I hold the view&mdash; perhaps it is because I am a farmer&mdash; that cattle are unhealthy or create unhealthy conditions.  Actually, cattle do not carry any disease, whatever they may do with regard to upsetting the general appearance of a street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the sections dealing with huts, tents and caravans are desirable, but I am not sure whether they would <Col N="1022" /> apply to travelling gipsies and others of that type.  There should be regulations with regard to such people.  It is true they have no votes and, therefore, they do not matter to Deputies, but that is no reason why they should not be considered.  They are people who travel from district to district.  They are entitled to justice and fair treatment, just the same as other members of the community, and, if any law is made governing their conduct, it should equally apply to holiday makers.  I do not want one law for travelling tinkers and another for tourists.  The same law should apply to both.  Some regulations in this respect are necessary.</P>
    <P>People who travel from one district to another can violate the law with more immunity than a person in a fixed residence.  Travelling tinkers, though they may cause a lot of annoyance and nuisance, are in the main comparatively honest&mdash;at least, as honest as other sections of the community. It is rarely that they are guilty of robbery in relation to property.  They may sometimes trespass upon a farmer's land with their horses and other stock, but it is very rarely they steal.  We should be as just to those people as to everybody else.  They may become a nuisance and it is for that reason they should be subject to regulations.  For instance, they may become a nuisance if they remain too long in the one district and their horses and donkeys trespass upon other people's land or damage fences.  There is the necessity to ensure that they do not, by the manner in which they live, inflict injustice or cruelty upon their children or others depending upon them.</P>
    <P>A point I raised when the Public Health Bill was going through has reference to interments.  It is provided in this Bill that a person shall be interred only in a registered or recognised cometery.  In most country parishes it is the custom for the parish piest to be interred in the ground of the local chapel, and I think an exception should be made in this respect.</P>

      <P>The Bill seems to be welcomed generally by all sides of the House.  In its general purpose it is non-contentious.  It covers a variety of miscellaneous matters, all of which, as Deputy Mulcahy has said, might be discussed on the Committee Stage.  I was only anxious that before the House adjourned for the Summer Recess we should at least give formal approval to the principle of the Bill so as to allow Deputies, local authorities and other interests which may be concerned in the measure, an opportunity of considering its provisions and of making suggestions <Col N="1024" /> as to amendments if they think such are desirable.  I do not think that I need delay the House further.  I am sure most Deputies are anxious to get away as early as possible and as the Bill is, as I have said, non-contentious, I do not think it necessary to deal with any of the points raised.  I have no doubt they will be raised again on Committee when we can discuss them more fully.</P>

      <P>The drainage of the areas to which the Deputy refers will be considered when the Ballyteigue catchment, of which they form part, is being dealt with under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945. I can make no forecast at this stage as to when a drainage scheme for that catchment can be formulated.  The Wexford County Council is responsible for the maintenance of the existing drainage districts in the area to the extent provided for in Section 23 of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.</P>
