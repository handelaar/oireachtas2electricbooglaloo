      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.  I am aware that, owing to weather conditions since last August, there are turf shortages in Carrick-on-Suir and Clonmel in common with many other places. My Department is in constant touch with merchants and local authorities all over the country and the measures taken to meet difficulties in any particular place vary so much from day to day that a statement of the steps being taken at any particular time would be of little value.  The Deputy may be assured, however, that everything that can be done to remedy local shortages is being done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the turf area is concerned, in normal circumstances, the responsibility for providing fuel supplies rests upon the local merchants and on local resources.  In present circumstances, in view of shortages, special and exceptional measures are being taken to endeavour to distribute the available supplies so as to prevent absolute shortage in any particular place, if at all possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the turf at present supplied to Enniscorthy, Wexford and other areas is of very poor quality; that the condition of this turf is causing great hardship to the people concerned; and if he will take immediate steps to see that turf of a better quality is made available and also that timber is released for use as domestic fuel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards turf supplies, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a Dáil question on 22nd January, 1947.  No control is exercised over the supply and distribution of firewood, and therefore the question of the release of timber for use as domestic fuel does not arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain restrictions are exercised under the authority of other Ministers on the cutting of timber, but in so far as it is possible to interpret these restrictions in a manner which will increase to the maximum the supply of firewood, that has been done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the turf position generally, the supplier in Bunclody told me yesterday that the amount allowed for that village this week is 1 ton 13 cwts.  So many new orders are being issued every day by <Col N="661" /> Fuel Importers, Ltd. that merchants do not know what to do in the matter of getting turf for next week or next month, and the Minister should make arrangements whereby Fuel Importers, Ltd., would not send communications to merchants telling them that they are to get so much this week, based on the amount they handled in a certain week last year.  That is the latest order which has been given to merchants in my town.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to the prevailing shortage of materials for textile production the supply of blankets is below normal and the scarcity is no doubt accentuated by an increased demand stimulated by the severe weather conditions. For some years past there have been <Col N="662" /> periodical consultations in my Department with the textile producers so that production might be regulated to make the best possible use of the available materials and acting on my directions the Irish woollen mills are producing 90 per cent. of the country's pre-war requirements of woollen blankets but there are practically no supplies of cotton blankets now available.  I am satisfied that the mills are doing all that can reasonably be expected of them having regard to the materials at their disposal and to the other essential demands which they have to meet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan (for Mr. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether Mr. J. P. Byrne, importer and merchant, 38 Dame Street, Dublin, made an application, last September, for a licence to import 50,000 tons of white flour from America; if he will state the reasons for his refusal to grant this application, in view of the serious shortage of flour and bread which followed; whether similar applications for licences to import flour were made to his Department and refused; and if he will make a general statement as to the Government policy in refusing such applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the Dáil Debates for January 29th, when I dealt fully with this matter. As I pointed out on that occasion, the position has been and still is, that flour may not be exported from the United States without the authority of an export licence granted by the United States Government and such licences are granted only in respect of the quantities of flour allocated by the United States to the importing country.  No such allocation has been made to this country since last August. Many traders, including the trader named in the question, have had offers of flour from United States firms, but in the absence of an allocation in favour of this country these offers are worthless.  It is settled policy to import supplies of foreign wheat and flour through Grain Importers (Eire), Limited, the non-profit making company <Col N="663" /> set up for that purpose.  This is desirable not only from the point of view of keeping the cost of imports as low as possible but also to secure the orderly distribution of supplies as well as facilitating the payment of the flour subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister explain why Mr. Byrne was informed when he made application in September that there was no real danger of a shortage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Byrne was not so informed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was present when Mr. Byrne interviewed an officer of the Minister's Department and I can assure the House and the Minister that Mr. Byrne was informed that there was no serious danger of a shortage. He was further informed that he could not be given a licence.  I should like the Minister to explain that.  If it was the policy of the American Government not to export, surely it should be the policy of our Government to import wherever possible and any merchant or citizen who was in the position to import or who was made an offer should have been given every facility and should not have been refused a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the first part of the Deputy's supplementary question, I can only say that there is a conflict of evidence.  I am assured by the officer who interviewed the gentleman named and the Deputy&mdash;and I have seen his record of the discussion&mdash;that no statement of the kind quoted was made.  I am prepared to accept that officer's word on the subject.  As regards the second part of the supplementary question, there is an obvious advantage in confining the imports of whatever wheat and flour is allocated to this country to one importing organisation.  Not merely does that ensure that firms here would not be bidding against each other for whatever supplies are allocated to us, but it also has the effect of eliminating private profit and thus reducing the cost of supplies, while it facilitates distribution and the payment of the subsidy.</P>

As regards the question of making arrangements with the individual firms previously supplying Army canteens to give quotas to ex-service men, the position is that each applicant must find a wholesaler willing to supply him.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As the footwear distributed under the schemes forms part of the retailer's ordinary quota, it has to be distributed through the normal trade channels; when the Public Assistance Footwear Scheme was introduced, public notice to this effect was given to retailers of boots and shoes. It was intimated that individual retailers who desired to participate in the scheme should apply to their ordinary suppliers for stocks of official footwear. Retailers were also urged to consult the local officers of the public assistance authority, so as to relate their orders for official footwear to the estimated local requirements under the scheme. My Department has no control of distribution of official footwear; but in order that distribution may be related as nearly as possible to the allocations, by the Department, of footwear vouchers, notice of the allocations <Col N="673" /> to the various public assistance authorities is given to the trade bodies concerned.  So far as the western counties are concerned, their requirements as submitted by the local authorities have been fully met by these allocations.  The only complaints of shortages received in my Department from these counties have been from a trader in Galway, and from Leitrim Public Assistance Authority. In the case of the complaint from Galway the trader claimed that there was a surplus in East Galway County.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take question No. 34 from Deputy Giles on the same subject in conjunction with this question from Deputy Norton.</P>
      <P>It has been decided to make a special payment in respect of service rendered during the period from the 20th March to the 30th October, 1946, inclusive, by teachers of national schools which were affected by the strike.  I do not know whether these teachers were or were not members of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.</P>
      <P>With reference to the subsidiary queries put by the Deputy, the replies are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) The number of teachers receiving this special payment is 416 of whom 52 are serving in ordinary national schools and 364 in capitation convent and monastery schools.  I do not propose to give the names of the teachers or the names of the schools in which they were employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="680" /> (b) The total amount of these payments is £4,868 10s. 0d. and the amount payable to each individual teacher is £20 in the case of principal teachers and £10 in the case of other teachers.</P>
    <P>(c) The payments in question were approved by me with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  Rule 132 of the Rules and Regulations for National Schools provides that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These rules may be altered or rescinded with the approval of the Minister for Education and, in the case of rules involving finance, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not consider a formal alteration of the rules and regulations to be necessary as I hope that the circumstances which gave rise to these payments will not recur.</P>
    <P>(d) The special payments are being made from the Vote for Primary Education, sub-head C (1)&mdash;&ldquo;Salaries etc. of Teachers in Ordinary and Model Schools and in Reformatory and Industrial Schools and Grants to Schools paid on a Capitation Basis.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>(e) The payments are being made to the teachers concerned in respect of the extra work and/or responsibility which devolved on them in the difficult circumstances of the period in question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>With particular refer ence to (e), will the Minister say whether this grant was paid to a lady in the Central Model Schools, where one pupil or no pupil attended during the strike, and was it also paid to the principal of the Drimnagh school for extra work where no pupil attended during the strike; and will the Minister say whether, after a strike lasting approximately seven months, he thinks the best way of promoting harmony between his Department and the teachers' organisation is to pay bribes to people who worked during the strike?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be necessary, I think, for the Deputy to give me notice regarding individual cases.  I presume that in the two cases which he mentions, the teachers have been paid <Col N="681" /> the bonus in question.  As well as the additional responsibility and extra work cast upon teachers who elected to serve in the schools during this period to provide for the education of children, there were also teachers who were prepared to serve; they were placed in very difficult and trying circumstances, but, had the children returned to school at any time during the period, they would have been ready and willing to continue their classes.  If there is any case of a teacher who was so prepared, but who, in fact, was not teaching for any period it should be considered; I think it would be inequitable and, in fact, impossible, to distinguish between such a teacher, who was prepared to give his or her services if called upon during the period, and those who actually did give their services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the reason for making this payment under (e) was extra work.  If that was the basis on which payment was made, why was payment made to the principal of the school at Drimnagh, where no pupil attended during the strike, and why was it paid to a lady in the Central Model Schools where only one pupil or no pupil attended during the strike?  Surely, it is a waste of public money, apart from the vicious principle involved in this matter, not merely to pay a person full wages, but to pay a special bonus to a teacher who did not see a pupil in the school during the period of the strike?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>If the situation is that the teacher in Drimnagh or anywhere else was at his post during the period, and held himself in readiness, in the trying circumstances with which I know that particular teacher had to contend, to provide instruction in the event of the pupils returning to school, I am not prepared to deny that he should receive the same measure of appreciation as a teacher who, in fact, did give service during the period.  It would be impossible to make a distinction between those who gave service by actually teaching and those who demonstrated by their daily attendance at the  <Col N="682" /> schools, that they were ready and willing to give such service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that payments were made to teachers in respect of extra duties and responsibilities. In the cases where teachers had not any schools at all, and where they had just as good a holiday as the kids, they did not have extra duties or responsibilities, and the Minister is taking up a funny attitude when he encourages scabs and blacklegs by the payment of a bonus simply because certain people did not take part in what was not an illegal strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the term used by Deputy Corish with reference to these teachers.  I think the thanks of the parents, and of the people of the City of Dublin generally, are due to the teachers who continued to provide the children with education.  In my opinion, the expression used by the Deputy should not have been used.  I want to say, with reference to the statement that these teachers are being paid for services that they did not give, that the teachers in question were at their posts and remained at their posts until they received official instructions, probably from the manager, but at any rate instructions, that they need not continue.  So long as I am satisfied that they were at their posts and that they were prepared to carry out their duties any day the children returned to school, I do not see how I could make any distinction between their case and that of the others.</P>

No applicant has been refused a disability pension in respect of tuberculosis on the grounds that he could not produce evidence in support of his claim.  In fact, the investigations carried out by the Army Pensions Board in these particular cases are conducted in the most careful and sympathetic manner possible, every care being taken to ensure that <Col N="684" /> all the evidence available in support of an application is secured before a decision is taken, including an examination of the applicant's Army history, to ascertain any hardships endured during his service.  An unfavourable decision is taken only after all possible evidence favourable to the applicant has been obtained.

Applications which were made for pensions were refused on the grounds that the disease was not attributable to, or did not arise out of, military service.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The wages of forestry labourers in the Gort district and elsewhere are related to the rates of wages payable to other classes of labourers in Government employment and are reviewed from time to time in the light of the rates prescribed for agricultural labourers by the Agricultural Wages Board.  The current wages for forestry labourers in the Gort district, for a 48-hour week, vary from 46/- for skilled experienced labourers to 44/- for others; from these amounts the usual employee's contribution for national health insurance is deducted.  These rates were fixed since the latest wages Order of the Agricultural Wages Board was promulgated and they will be reviewed whenever the board makes a new wages Order.  The question of work on church holidays is usually governed by local custom; stoppages of work on such holidays are due to the voluntary action of the workmen. Overtime on forestry operations, especially during winter months, is not usual.</P>

      <P>Questions numbered 43, 44 and 45 relate to the same subject and I propose, with your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle, to take them together. The prices fixed for flax of the 1946 crop ranged from 20/- to 25/- per stone according to grade, with an additional 1/6 per stone for each grade of turbine scutched, dam-retted flax.  The average price paid to growers in respect of flax of the 1946 crop already sold at Clonakilty market was 21/5 per stone. I have received complaints that flax sold at this and other markets has been grading low.  I am advised that the low grading may be attributed to the inferior quality of the flax as compared with previous years, due to the exceptionally unfavourable conditions which prevailed during the season, particularly at harvest time.  The prices to be paid for flax of the 1947 crop have not yet been fixed but it is expected that they will show a considerable increase on last year's prices. There will be no increase in the allocation of potash to flax growers in 1947.</P>

      <P>If there were ever a case for any amendment ever moved in this House, I think there is a case for the amendment which is on the Order Paper on the Second Reading of this Bill.  So far as I know, outside the Minister, no one knows the real plan for the Army.  I venture as a mere civilian to say that those who are in the Army itself do not know the plan for the Army or for national defence. So far as the ordinary person like myself is concerned, all we see is that the Minister is asking the approval of this House for a policy and a scheme which aims at getting as soon as possible two-thirds more men than are in the Army at present.  I am concerned with that aspect of it, as if the Minister succeeds he will do so only at the expense of what appears to me to be much more important work at present and in the immediate future.  I venture to say that there is no suitable Army personnel that can be recruited at present or within the next 12 months except what might be recruited at the expense of vital and essential work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I go further and say that there is not available the type of person who ordinarily would make a career of the Army and who would join the standing Army.  So far as that type of personnel was available, it has cleared out and is not there.  We know there is not enough labour available now for the essential services of providing food and fuel and we know that considerable quantities of both food and fuel were lost last year because sufficient labour was not available.  I am leaving out altogether the other aspects of this matter, as I take it that they have been fully dealt with already and dealt with, I am sure, far more effectively than I could hope to do so&mdash;that is, with regard to the £4,500,000 and so on.  I am concerned with the avowed policy of the Minister to try to recruit, in the shortest pos- <Col N="697" /> sible space of time, two-thirds more men than he has in the Army at the moment.  If that personnel is available and if it is considered more essential to get those men into the Army than into producing food and fuel, we should be told that and we should be told why.  So far as I know we have not been told.</P>
    <P>We are facing perhaps the most critical year in our history.  We find ourselves to-day, as regards both fuel and food, with a shortage greater than ever affected us in a century, perhaps greater than threatened us since the Great Famine.  That is not an exaggeration. It is true to say to-day that, not only in the City of Dublin and the other cities but in nearly every provincial town, there are people who cannot get sufficient fuel for heating, much less for cooking.  Unless every man&mdash; and, indeed, every woman, for that matter&mdash;who is willing and able to aid in the production of food and fuel in the coming year is left available for that purpose, our position this time 12 months will be infinitely worse than it is even at the moment.  There are enough sources tapping and trying to tap and trying to attract away from rural life the young men and young women, without the Minister setting out to do it also.  That is my principal reason for intervening in this debate. It is no answer to me to say that in a crisis, either to save the harvest or to save fuel, the personnel of the Army will be made available.  Any Deputy who has any knowledge of rural conditions, on the farm or in the bog, knows as well as I do that such people have to be either one thing or the other, if they are to be effective in either field&mdash;they have to be soldiers or workers producing essential requirements. I would be inclined to say what I have already said even if the Minister were much more frank with the House and the country than he has been; but I feel impelled to say what I have said because he has not disclosed either his own mind or the mind of the Government to the House or to the country as to the real plans&mdash;if they have plans, and I am sure they have&mdash; for national defence.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of pretence about all <Col N="698" /> this.  The Minister knows that it is more than a question of personnel, more than a mere question of 5,000, 10,000 or 20,000 men.  There is the question of equipment and the types of equipment which we can get or which will be given to us.  However, that is a line I do not want to go into, as, in the first place, I know very little about it, and I have said so quite frankly.  There are men in the House who are much more competent to deal with that aspect of it than I am.  Yet I feel it my duty as a member of this House to probe this matter as far as I am able to do so.  I do know something about the main theme of what I am saying, that is, in regard to the manpower requirements of this country if the essentials of life are to be produced for our people.  Every Deputy, no matter on what side of the House he sits or to which Party be belongs, if he has any knowledge of rural life in this State, knows quite well that we cannot afford to take away for other purposes one single man who is at present or will be in the coming year engaged in producing food or fuel&mdash;to name only two of our principal requirements. It is for that reason that I started by saying that if ever there was a good case for a reasoned amendment to the Second Reading of a Bill, that case exists in respect of the amendment on the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>On the first day, the Government was charged with assuming complete responsibility for the defence of the country.  If the Government did not assume responsibility for the defence of the country, who, in the name of Providence, is to assume that responsibility?  If Deputy Morrissey remembers some of the speeches made by his immediate neighbours when the Turf Bill was going through last year, he will remember that we were told to forget about turf and to depend on coal.  I <Col N="699" /> am glad that he has been converted now to the possibility of finding fuel here in our own country.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the amount of money which it is proposed to expend on defence during the coming year and undoubtedly it is a considerable sum.  I wonder if the Minister can see his way to make better provision for the dependents and semi-dependents of soldiers who die while in the Army.  We have questions raised here periodically and I have two cases in mind.  It is an extraordinary state of affairs that where the Army authorities delay coming to a decision on a particular matter&mdash;and delay not for one or two months but maybe 12 months or longer&mdash;and if, in the meantime, the person whose case is being considered dies, the money is withheld from his relatives or personal representatives. I have in mind the case of the widowed mother of a soldier who had died who applied for a grant of some kind and, who after 12 months' consideration, was awarded a gratuity of £112 or so.  Some time before the award was made, she died and even though she had been provided for by another person in the meantime and was buried at the expense of that person, that person was denied even part of the money which was awarded to the deceased woman and which would have been given to her had she lived.  I suggest that the Minister should bear such cases in mind and so frame future legislation as to cater for the dependents or semi-dependents of such deceased soldiers.</P>
      <P>It has been rumoured that it is the Minister's intention, with the expansion of the Army, to introduce a system of having teachers attached to the Army.  I suggest that if teachers are attached to the Army, they be given commissioned rank, and that so far as possible, they will be recruited from the Local Defence Force, if suitable applicants can be found in that force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Morrissey when he says we will be short of labour because only recently figures published in the newspapers showed that in the Twenty-Six <Col N="700" /> Counties there were over 70,000 unemployed.  There is a big number of men unemployed since the Army was demobilised&mdash;men who served the Army faithfully but who have since had to go across to the English coal-mines. The last Deputy who spoke referred to turf and hit back at Deputy Morrissey, but I have to hit back at the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party who said that we should burn everything British but coal.  To-day they would burn that coal if they could get it.  Young men are to-day signing at the labour exchanges for 6/- a week and they are told now by the managers that they had better join the Construction Corps. I know some of these lads and they ask me why they should join the Construction Corps in view of the treatment which their brothers and, in some cases, their fathers, received after soldiering for all the years of the emergency.  These men have been thrown on the scrap-heap and they do not even get preference from the local authorities.  The men who belong to the Fianna Fáil clubs get the preference over the ex-Army men.  That can be proved in regard to any county council and it is certainly the case in regard to the Wexford County Council where ex-Army men did not get a vote when rate collectors' and other jobs were being filled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been told by young men who have a liking for the Army that the age limit here is from 18 to 28 while the age limit for the British Air Force, which is taking all these young men, is from 18 to 33.  I know young men&mdash; some of them married&mdash;who are debarred from joining the Army here because of that age limit.  If we want to get these young men into the Army, we should extend the age limit to 33 years to facilitate those who are willing to join.  Further, if we want to encourage them to join the Army, we must give them comfortable surroundings. Young men are sent to the Curragh where there is no light of any kind, where they see nothing but sheep grazing and occasional race-meetings.  If these young men were given good surroundings, with good picture houses and dance-halls near the camps, there would be a much better chance of <Col N="701" /> getting them to join the Army than there is in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also look into the position with regard to men who contract disease.  I have a fair amount of correspondence with regard to soldiers in my constituency who are at present in receipt of 7/6 national health insurance, having come out of the Army unfit.  They are at present receiving treatment from their local doctors and their applications for pensions are turned down on the ground that 50 per cent. of the disease was not contracted while in the Army.  That is very unfair because the State paid doctors during the emergency to examine every recruit going into the Army and these men were passed in as medically fit.  They are passed out to-day medically unfit.  Some of them have tuberculosis and many have since passed to their eternal reward.  That is bad treatment and you will not get men to join the Army if that is the treatment they are to get.  We had the honour of having more Wexford men in the Army than any other county, but to-day these men have to leave the country and go to work in the mines in Wales and elsewhere.  They could not get work and they had to go away.  I do not believe that there is a scarcity of labour because, if you pass by the labour exchanges in this city or the labour exchanges or police barracks in rural areas, you will see the best of men lining up there who cannot find work. We should give up saying that there is a scarcity of labour.</P>
    <P>We want an army.  Every State, of course, has a standing army.  It is always better to have a trained army than to be caught out in the way some nations were who were not prepared for the last war.  The same thing happened here.  Only for the way all Parties came together and the loyalty which was shown all over the country, when all the people stood together in the emergency, it might not have been possible to preserve our neutrality.  I appeal to the Minister to extend the age limit for the Army.  I have been asked to do that by young men over 28 years of age who are willing to join the Army but are debarred from doing so.  Otherwise they will have to join <Col N="702" /> the English Air Force, for which the age limit is 33.</P>

      <P>This Bill, on its face, appears to be simply an ordinary continuation of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts, with certain adjustments to meet the needs of the present situation.  So far as I can see, the main content of this Bill is simply to continue the existing Acts. The principal part of the Bill, when all is said and done, is largely devoted to changes in nomenclature, so that the length and extent of the debate on this Bill is surprising and might lead one to think, if one did not look into it, that a revolutionary or completely novel measure was being introduced.  I think it is proper to comment on the fact that this is merely a continuation of the existing legislation in the ordinary way and that this particular Bill introduces nothing of a novel or controversial nature such as should evoke the debate which has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On perusing the reports, I find that a lot of what has been said appears to me to be more proper matter for a debate on Estimates rather than on this Bill.  However, I suppose it is legitimate to take the opportunity if one does want to talk about defence policy and I presume that the Opposition, in their motion, have in mind something of that nature.  I think there is an implied assumption in this motion that defence policy should be something to be thrashed out in the open or debated around a table.  I wonder are Deputies serious in that.  Is it not perfectly obvious that there are certain matters in Government that must, in their very nature, be treated with a certain amount of reserve?  For instance, it has been accepted that certain matters relating to, say, the judiciary and certain matters relating to external affairs are always regarded as matters to be dealt with in the House with a degree of discretion.  It has been understood always that these matters are of such a nature that more harm than good can be done by over-discussing them.  I was under the impression that the same type of thing, of necessity, came into considerations dealing with defence.  It certainly came into them during wartime and I <Col N="703" /> think must come into them at all times. I was under the impression that it was an accepted thing that the Government of the day would be responsible for these matters, but that it was its duty to disclose as much as possible, consistent with the serious business of Government and the serious matter of providing for the well-being of the State in times of war or emergency; that these limitations which are imposed mean, of necessity, that the same disclosures and the same details of discussion that would be warranted on very many other measures are not warranted in the case of a Defence Bill.  I wonder do the Opposition mean that they want to have everything thrashed out in that way.</P>

As regards certain details and problematical matters in the future, personally I think it would be very much better if the Staff kept these things to themselves, while providing for them as far as possible.</P>

      <P>The position is this.  A Government is there to govern. In such matters, the Government, while it is the Government, has to take its decisions and has to deal with such matters and, consistent with the public interest, disclosures should be made. But a motion of this nature can do nothing else but produce a lot of red herrings and a lot of uninformed talk and I think can do no good at a moment such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come to another aspect of it, I should like to refer to General Mulcahy's opening speech.  The Leader of the Opposition was at some pains to point out that there is always a certain lack of clarity in a defence situation at the end of a war and that there must be, so to speak, a certain amount of holding things open.  With that, everybody will agree.  Perhaps it is for that very reason that it is premature at this stage to commit oneself to a hard and fast and irrevocable line of action in respect of defence.  To take the matter of equipment alone, during most wars, and I think it applied to both of the recent big wars, the armies started off with a certain type of equipment which was judged, all things taken into account, to be the most suitable equipment for the army in question.  Now, a war develops.  One belligerent or the other, and all of them, usually, in turn, develop novel weapons or novelties in the design or modification of existing weapons, with a view usually to securing some surprise advantage.  That surprise element in war inevitably brings about a development and a progress in the army in which it is adopted, but that development is always constrained by the tension of the war situation existing when the development takes place. Time is pressing.  Therefore, experimentation has to be rather rapid.  Not only is time pressing, but existing machinery, existing plant, have to be used with the least possible modification so that constantly there is a conflict going on, on the production side, between the weapon which is wanted and which is ideal, on the one hand, and existing weapons, production machinery and productive <Col N="705" /> capacity on the other.  The solution is generally a mean solution.</P>
    <P>However, the situation changes when it comes to peace time.  In peace time the great Powers and the big Powers generally are in a position to exploit more fully the ideas that occurred to them during the war or new weapons that have been either born or developed during the war.  They are not hampered by the same war situation and, consequently, they are at liberty to develop something, which may be new, but which certainly is a very much improved form of weapon or weapons, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>In a situation like this, a small country, or any small army, must pause at the end of a war before it commits itself to a wholesale purchase of equipment. If it buys up existing equipment at the end of a war, it runs the risk of having inferior stuff at a later stage.  I need not pursue the argument very much further on that line, but I think it is quite clear, and most reasonable people, especially anybody who has had any dealings with the question, will realise that it would be better to press the Minister at the moment to defer committing himself to an equipment programme, for the present, rather than to press him to formulate a policy or a programme at this moment.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I oppose that portion of the motion.  It is impracticable and it is immature.  Even if one were to admit the doubtful principle, I think the wrong principle, that such matters should be thrown open, I think by far the better procedure to adopt is that which all Governments in this State have adopted up to date in regard to defence disclosures and, in time of crisis, there is always the solution that was adopted in the last war for informing the responsible members of the Opposition.  I think that is much the safer and much the better procedure. But, even if you do run riot and say: &ldquo;Let us have these all out on the table, let us have the bone for everyone to pull at and everyone to fight about&rdquo;&mdash;and really I do not think that is intended&mdash;the question of formulating a policy or a programme in regard to equipment is, in my humble opinion, <Col N="706" /> premature, that at the moment no useful purpose could be served and, worse, if the Minister were weak enough&mdash;I sincerely hope he never would be&mdash;to yield to such a thing, that we would be committed to a certain amount of foolish dreaming and exercise with figures and hypothetical situations that would completely paralyse the usefulness of our Defence Forces if and when they were called upon to perform any of their proper functions.</P>
    <P>If you come to that conclusion in regard to equipment, I fail to see how you can formulate a hard and fast and definite programme in any other sphere of Army activity.  Unit and combat organisation will depend largely upon the equipment that you have adopted and the equipment that you have available, among a large number of other factors.  So, I fail to see that a motion of this nature can bear any fruit.</P>
    <P>To come to what is required in regard to defence at the end of a war: I for one would urge the Minister&mdash; and I am sure he has done it already&mdash; to consider that at the end of a war is the time to sit back and take stock.  It is at the end of such a war as the last, where we were so singularly fortunate, thanks to Providence&mdash;because we can put it no other way&mdash;that the first thing to do is to sit back and see what lessons are to be learned from the information at our disposal and from our own experience. I find myself in a rather difficult position in a debate of this nature in that, as a person who has served in certain places, I may have information that it is not proper to make any use of but I think I am in no way abusing the knowledge which I gained in another situation when I say that I am certain that the Minister for Defence caused a careful examination to be made of our existing situation as far as can be seen&mdash;that is as far as you can go&mdash;and likely future situation, and our past experience, when he was preparing for the establishment and the carrying on of the Army through this difficult interim period.</P>
    <P>Now I have only to deal with matters that are public knowledge.  Let us look back and see what these were.  After 1924, you might say the Army of this State became established in the sense in which we know it now.  The Government <Col N="707" /> of that day had to face up to a problem, just as I almost feel General Mulcahy is putting it up to us now to face up to it.  The problem is this: Does a country of our size need an Army at all or is it a special police force that is required?  If we are to get down to brass tacks on the question of defence, let us ask ourselves fairly and squarely, is it simply a police force you want or is it a defence force?  That question was asked at that time and, of course, we know the answer that was given.</P>
    <P>I have heard nobody, despite the criticism of numbers or anything else, say that we do not want an Army at all, that we want only an augmented police force.  I am stressing that point because, if that is any Deputy's point of view, I say: &ldquo;That is the end of the argument.  There is a certain amount to be said for your point of view but, if you stick to it and I stick to my point of view, that is the end of the argument.&rdquo;  I can quite understand that attitude, but, if the answer to that question is that we require a defence force, then we have to look at the matter from another angle.  If it were merely a matter of local social security, the prevention of crime, or the maintenance of ordinary civil order within the borders of the State, then by all means have your police force.  But do we require to do anything else?</P>
    <P>Rightly or wrongly, it was decided, even in the time that the present principal Opposition Party were the Government, that an Army should be maintained here and, as far as our resources at the time permitted, an effort was made to equip it as an Army.  That policy was continued when the present Government came into office and an effort was made, as far as our resources would permit, to build up an Army. Why?  For the good and simple reason that we have got here a certain geographical unit of territory.  Unfortunately, we have not the whole island; if we had, the defence problem might in some ways be a simpler one for us.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from offensive action and defensive action in the absolute sense, there is the consideration of garrisoning it.  We could not just lift <Col N="708" /> the anchor, float the island to the Antarctic, and remain safe if a war broke out involving Europe.  When you could not do that, the territory of this State would be of importance to some belligerent, and that territory had to be accounted for, so to speak. When you take into consideration the fact that that piece of territory is adjacent to one of the big Powers likely to be involved in a war, the matter becomes clearer still and, without going into any question as to association or anything else, the fact remains that that piece of territory has to be accounted for and has to be garrisoned.</P>
    <P>There is this further question, is it in the interest of this State and its people that we should, as far as garrisoning the country from the defence point of view is concerned, undertake that duty ourselves or adopt a completely passive attitude, with, of course, the corollary that somebody else must garrison it in time of war?</P>
    <P>That was the general argument and it remains a valid argument, irrespective of the fact that that garrison may not be able to put up an absolute defence. In the case of a major set of operations that might involve us, they would invariably involve others who would be hostile to the people attacking us, in which case the ultimate defence responsibility might rest elsewhere; but that does not take away at all from the important role of garrison troops, troops to take the first shock; that duty would devolve on our defence forces.</P>
    <P>I know that in attempting to deal with a matter like this and trying to deal with it fairly, it is very easy to say: &ldquo;Oh, the idea of a handful of men in this country defending it against a major Power,&rdquo; and start to ridicule things that way.  That is not the point at issue.  I am talking about the necessity for a garrison.  The choice, therefore, is between garrisoning your own country and at least keeping yourself intact during the pre-operational period, or throwing the thing open, in which case you will have to be garrisoned by somebody else.  What I am trying to do is to recapture the attitude of two Governments with regard to maintaining a defence force here.</P>

      <P>I will get forward in a moment, but sometimes you can get a good view of the front if you go high enough to the rear.  That was the view, apparently, of two Governments before this and I say that in the event that view was justified.  Inadequate and all as our Defence Forces were in 1939, the fact is that we were able by, to a certain extent, good luck in 1940 in the raising of an Army, to garrison our own country.  To that extent the Army contributed largely to our immunity from actual physical interference during the war.</P>
      <P>Just remember the time France fell. A very serious situation developed for England.  They were in a very bad way.  If we were not in a position at that time to make some effort to garrison the country, to provide the outpost, the outlying picket, so to speak, in this island, bad and all as they were themselves from a military point of view, they would have had no other alternative but to occupy our territory, embarrassing as it might have been to them, and involving a dissipation of their forces, which they could ill afford to dissipate at the time. Notwithstanding all these factors, selfprotection would have, of necessity, demanded the garrisoning of this island.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply giving you an argument and I am asking the Deputy, as a soldier, to point out if there is any fallacy in that argument. If the flank is completely open, has something not to be done about it?  Have you not to take some precautions to protect it?  An open flank is a very dangerous place, is it not?  The point is that our Defence Forces did justify themselves during the emergency.  I say, no matter how weak they were, no matter how inferior in numbers and equipment, they did contribute in a material way to our immunity during the last war.  In that is to be found the <Col N="710" /> justification of the view of those people who, before the war, had decided that, notwithstanding the expense involved, we should make some effort to maintain an Army here rather than merely a police force.  That is the conclusion I draw and I say it justifies the people who made that decision.</P>
      <P>That being so, again the question may be posed at present: Do we need an Army or do we need a police force? As I have said&mdash;I do not think the Deputy was in the House when I made the statement and I am repeating it&mdash; if your view is that it is a police force we require, there we are on different ground and I would argue with you differently but I think the Deputy does not intend it that way.  I think he will agree that the previous Government and this Government decided the matter on the principle that we must have some Defence Force in this country.  If we are to have a Defence Force, there is no use having one at all, if it is not able to make some show or in some way fulfil the role for which it is designed because defence forces and armies are an expensive insurance in peace time.  They are in the nature of an insurance.  They are, unfortunately for the country which has to maintain them, expensive items and they become more expensive as time goes on.  I could have a certain amount of sympathy with the views of the Deputy if he said that it was simply a police force we needed but I have to argue on the ground that we are agreed that we require a Defence Force because I think it is admitted that we are agreed on that point.  It is here that both the experience of the past and of the present, particularly the experience of the past, comes into play. What did we find in regard to our Defence Forces when this State was confronted with a war situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us hark back to the days when many sincerely said: &ldquo;Leave the Army alone; do not do anything about it, it is time enough when you are confronted with a war to develop and expand it. Just keep a few officers to study.&rdquo; That was the attitude, and I should go so far as to say the understandable attitude. of people who had no experience of what was involved.  But let us see <Col N="711" /> where that attitude brought us.  We cut and cut our Defence Forces before the war to the stage when they were practically useless as a Defence Force.</P>
    <P>Any officer of the Defence Forces will tell you what happened.  Ask any of them and they will tell you.  Most of them, especially the junior officers, were involved in such an interminable routine of guard and garrison duty that they were unfit for anything else.  Let the Deputy try to imagine what these unfortunate officers had to put up with because of the strength of the Army. For nights on end, week after week and year after year, these officers were out of bed or could merely permit themselves a short lie-down while on guard at Government Buildings, at the Bank of Ireland or while acting as orderly officers in barracks or as duty officers in the command.  I can imagine no more demoralising experience for any man.  That is what these unfortunate officers had to put up with. Is it any wonder that they were handicapped in their efforts to become competent professional soldiers?  The wonder to me is&mdash;and, mind you, I can talk with a certain amount of experience as I saw them before the war; I was with them from 1934 onwards&mdash; that their morale stood up to it as long as it did.</P>
    <P>Then there was another group, a small nucleus of officers, some of rather senior rank, who tried to study very hard and keep their interest alive under very adverse circumstances. These men had no equipment, no opportunities for doing anything, but read and exercise on paper.  They did what they could and they achieved a great deal, but they will be the first to tell you that the experience was not one conducive to efficiency or one which in any way fitted them for the role of building an Army at short notice.  I need not mention the unfortunate non-commissioned officers and men who were compelled to submit to a regime of 24 hours on and 48 hours off.  I have known units of the Army which at the very beginning of the war had to face rounds of 48 hours on and 24 hours off.  That was the situation and why was that situation necessary? <Col N="712" /> It was due purely and simply to the fact that the strength of the Army was totally inadequate to meet the demands made upon it.  That little Army of a few thousand men&mdash;nominally it was 5,000 men, but it was below that figure &mdash;was responsible for guard and garrision duties, responsible for training reserves, responsible for the Voluntary reserve, for such things as A.R.P. and anti-gas defence for the community at large and so forth.  The task was completely beyond the capacity of a force of that size.  If there is any lesson to be learned from that stage of the proceedings it is this: that the strength of the Army before the war was completely inadequate and that, in fact, it hardly justified the existence of the Army at all.  That is No.1 point.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the question of equipment. Before the war we had very, very little equipment.  There is no need to go into figures.  We had a few batteries of artillery and rifles.  We had not even equipment in light automatics necessary for manning the nominal units of strength that we had. If the Minister for Defence wanted more money for equipment there was an immediate outcry from many quarters asking what were we spending this money for, and again the plausible cry, &ldquo;Wait until war is more imminent; wait until the situation is clarified, then get the equipment, get the latest and the best, there is time enough.&rdquo;  Yes, but what happened? 1939 came and efforts were made then when a war situation confronted us. We then heard, &ldquo;Let us get the men, let us get the arms&rdquo;.  We got the men, yes, but what about the arms?  Officers and senior representatives of the Civil Service went to America and endeavoured to get arms. At that very critical time when perhaps we might have needed arms more than at any other time, we failed completely to get the supply of arms that would be adequate.  I believe that we got afterwards some 20,000 .300 rifles.</P>

      <P>I had already dealt with some of these matters before the Deputy came into the House, but that is what happened.  There is a lesson to be learned from it.  Now let us come to the actual strength at the moment that we wanted it.  I think that the Deputy was a member of the Defence Conference at the time and is probably as well informed as I am as to the very straitened circumstances of our Defence Forces in the crisis of 1940 when this paratroop landing threat was pretty imminent.  The Deputy knows as well as I do our inadequate resources in that regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that there was a fact there from which a lesson could be learned.  I think it is to be learned now.  The mobile forces, after what we had in garrisons were accounted for, at that critical period were completely inadequate even for an outpost job.  If all these lessons are to be digested and appreciated, surely it needs this that, for the future, if we are going to maintain an Army at all &mdash;and, mind you, everything that I say is subject to that qualification&mdash;you must have it of such strength and equipped in such a manner that it will at least justify its existence and be ready to perform at least what I have called an outpost job.  Now, I think that is just what the Minister had in mind, as a result of these lessons, when it was decided to recommend that the forces should be maintained at the level that he has outlined.  I imagine I can guess that that was the figure decided upon as being the absolute minimum that would give you the Defence Force that you would be at all justified in having: that if you had <Col N="714" /> anything less you would be simply throwing such money as you would spend on a lesser force down the drain. That, I think, is the argument for the figure of 12,000, because it has to meet not only garrison, training and staff work and the maintenance of a reserve, but it also has to be ready as a skeleton, so to speak, on which an adequate force in a time of emergency can be built.</P>
      <P>I think the Deputy in his speech referred to something like the speed at which men can be trained&mdash;in two months or some period like that, that is, I presume, emergency soldiers.  He said that soldiers can be turned out, when they are wanted, as quickly as sausages can be turned out from a sausage machine. I agree with the Deputy up to a point, but the point is that a <i>sine qua non</i> for turning them out as a sausage machine turns out sausages is that you have a proper cadre and a proper skeleton on which to build your emergency Army.  You cannot turn out sausages without the sausage machine. As a matter of fact, we came perilously near breaking when we tried to build in 1940, and I should not ever like to see the country faced with that situation again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another thing that is forgotten, and that is the peculiar position we were faced with in 1940. Remember, the reserve was largely mobilised in 1939.  A certain portion of it was demobilised under pressure and on various pleas that we could not afford to keep a reserve, but a large proportion of that reserve was maintained on a standing Army basis from September, 1939, until March, 1940.  Now, in those six months that portion of the reserve had been assimilated in the regular Army, and remember that you expanded your Army in 1940 not on your old nucleus but on an actually bigger force.  I am not in a position to say what the strength was of the reserve that was mobilised, plus the standing Army, in March, 1940.  I imagine that it was somewhere about double that of the standing Army of peace time, and it was on that double figure that you built your emergency Army and barely built <Col N="715" /> it.  There is the story told of a certain senior Army officer at the time who said, I think it was to the Minister: &ldquo;Well, sir, we will do our job or burst.&rdquo;  Afterwards, when relating the story, he used to say that it was the mercy of God that we did not burst. The fact is that it is a fallacy to assume that you built your emergency Army of 1940 on your old standing Army.  You did no such thing.</P>
    <P>You had already practically doubled your standing Army by absorption of the reserve.  In many of these cases very well trained officers of the reserve were available.  The difficulty in these cases is sometimes not so much lack of trained officers as lack of trained non-commissioned officers and, in this case, non-commissioned officers who had seen service in another war were frequently available.  The only sensible thing to do is to legislate for a standing Army that can cater for your immediate requirements&mdash;your reserve, your garrison duties and which has a reasonable prospect of being a cadre which you can expand and so build up the defence force of the future.</P>
    <P>A Deputy put a question to me about equipment.  I have already dealt with the question of equipment.  In a nutshell, what I said was that it was premature&mdash;I am now merely giving my own opinion&mdash;to decide irrevocably the standard of equipment required for the Army.  I suggest that the Minister should take his time on that matter. Either he or some other Minister for Defence will have the awkward problem of deciding between letting the decision go long enough and not committing the mistake we committed before by letting it go too long.  I have taken up a considerable amount of time on this matter.  I have done so because I feel that no useful purpose can be served at this stage by the motion put before us by the Opposition. If you are to have an Army, it must be of a certain size or it will be worse than a luxury; it will be a waste. That fixes the strength question.  As to equipment, I say that it is as yet premature to decide that question.  As to policy, I think that I have dealt <Col N="716" /> sufficiently with that matter.  Then, what about this motion?</P>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy who said that the Army is so important to the community and so expensive that it should not be made a plaything for debate or political points.  I should not like to find myself compelled to make any accusation and I do not make one but I do say that, taking all these things into consideration, there is no case for a motion of this nature at the present moment.  The Bill is really nothing more than a continuation Bill. The few consequential amendments are matters of nomenclature.  It is, therefore, apparent that this Bill, which is merely an ordinary routine piece of annual Parliamentary business, has been made the occasion for a debate of this nature.  If ever a debate should be justified, the time is not now and I leave it at that.</P>
    <P>Before I close, there are some matters which I should like to mention to the Minister.  In the change over to peacetime, the Minister has had his difficulties.  In selecting officers and men for the post-war Army, the Minister was, perhaps, a wee bit hasty in dispensing with the services of a number of experienced men.  The same remark would apply to the reserve. That, however, is a <i>fait accompli</i> now and no useful purpose would be served by my trying to stress it here.  In this regard, however, I should like to bring one anomaly to the attention of the Minister.  Non-commissioned officers of the forces have been pensioned off. Increased rates of pension have been granted to meet the change in values. Unfortunately there has been a certain discrimination, with the result that non-commissioned officers discharged after a certain date get a higher rate of pension than non-commissioned officers discharged before that date.  In actual working out, I think that that is a trifle unfair.  I am referring to regular non-commissioned officers, with 21 years' service, and, particularly, to those non-commissioned officers, who served during the emergency.</P>
    <P>If I understand matters correctly, the anomalous position exists that a man discharged after 2nd September, 1946, will get one rate of pension and a man discharged a little bit earlier will get <Col N="717" /> a lesser rate.  If that be so, it is hardly fair.  Two sets of men may have given the same service, including emergency service, and, just because one set goes out on one side of a date and the other set goes out on the other side, they get different rates of pension.  Would the Minister consider adjusting that?  I take it that the increased rates of pension are due to the fact that there has been a change in values.  If that be so, I fail to see why the changed rates of pension do not apply to all Army pensioners&mdash;I am thinking of non-commissioned officers and men.  If the Minister is not prepared to give that, then, I certainly think that what I say should apply to men who served during the war&mdash;men with 21 years' service who had that extra strain placed upon them.  The old regular non-commissioned officers played a very important part during the emergency and it seems more than a trifle unfair that, because a man went out on one side of a date, he should get less than a man who went out on the other side of that date, if service was comparable in both cases. I should go so far as to point out to the Minister that, from 1946, men were being encouraged to go, on a sort of voluntary demobilisation, so as to ease the strain of the ultimate demobilisation. Therefore, the men who went rather early were facilitating the Minister. Instead of hanging on to the last moment and trying to get every penny out of the State, many of these men secured employment and tried to make themselves useful citizens.  They left a trifle early, but they had completed the statutory period and had served during the critical time.  Why should these men be penalised?  What happens in the case of officers?  I am not sure of that, but if the case is different, it is rather hard to understand why the unfortunate non-commissioned officer should be treated differently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure as to that but, if the same position exists regarding officers, I make exactly the same comment.  Off-hand, <Col N="718" /> I should say that, if the adjustments of pension are in relation to value, I fail to see why all pensioners should not be put on an equal footing and get equal benefit.  But if I am told that you are taking service in the emergency into account and making the adjustment partly a matter of value and partly a matter of service during the emergency, then that excludes all those who had ceased to serve before the emergency.  There may be something to be said for that view, but there seems to be very little to be said for differentiating between one man and another merely on the question of a date.  I suggest it would be much more equitable that, instead of making a date for discharge, it would say something like this: &ldquo;A man who has the necessary statutory period of service and who in addition has served for not less than three years between the 1st September, 1939, and the 31st December, 1945&rdquo;&mdash;or whenever you would consider the emergency ended. If it were put in that category, it would be fair, but to discriminate merely on the date on which a man left the Army is to my mind unfair and I should also say it is illogical and unreasonable. Therefore, I press the Minister as strongly as I might on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of dealing with officers of the reserve at the demobilisation is a <i>fait accompli</i> now, so little can be said.  However, I would like to point out to the Minister&mdash;and I think it may have been forgotten&mdash;that experience counts in army matters, too, and that officers who have given loyal service, whether as reserve officers or as regular officers, for a long period of time have inevitably gained experience, which in itself is valuable.  Though they might not have the standard of technical efficiency which might be demanded of them in the abstract, there is a case still for considering them of value and for retaining them. There is also the psychological case, as it must be remembered that, if we disillusion men who have served the country in a period of emergency, if we make reservists feel they are just people that we get something out of; if they get the idea that when the need is over, they will be put aside in <Col N="719" /> favour of new people, that creates the idea of disillusionment and will have its inevitable fruit in the future when the Minister or any other Minister seeks to build up a reserve.  The men he will want to attract to it, or even bring into the regular Army, will very naturally&mdash;in these modern days, when information flows so freely&mdash;say: &ldquo;Yes, but what happened to the last batch?&rdquo; For these reasons, I would ask the Minister, particularly in regard to the reserve of the old Army, to show a little appreciation of their value in that sense.  If anything, allowances should be made where, perhaps, the strict interests of mechanical efficiency might demand otherwise.  That is as much as I can say on the matter. There is nothing in the Bill itself that calls for comment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>If our Army is to be brought up to the strength outlined in this Bill, I appeal to the Minister to consider some of the men who had to be let go and in particular to consider those volunteer officers and others who had to leave the Army and were put on the reserve, mainly, as I understood it, because the Army was reduced.  The Army is at a very low mark at the present time and what I have in mind is that, if it is being brought up to strength, these men&mdash;who were efficient and still are efficient, and a number of whom are still held in the reserve&mdash; should be brought back to their old ranks.  I take it that, in the main, there was nothing against these men except that the Army had gone from its wartime or emergency stage and they were redundant or superfluous. They gave very good service during the emergency, as indeed did the volunteer officers from the time the volunteer force was established.  That might be remembered and, if and when there are vacancies in the ranks of different officers and there is room for them, the Minister should consider reinstating those men before other promotions are considered or other ways and means are found to fill these particular posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am at a loss to understand what actually is in the mind of the Opposition as regards our Army, in particular <Col N="720" /> from the speeches of Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy O'Higgins.  The Minister and the Government appear to be criticised for a lack of policy in Army matters.  Deputy Mulcahy, in a very long speech on this matter, blames the Minister for a lack of policy in connection with the Army and defence in general, but I notice he is very careful not to tell the House or the country in so many words his particular policy or the policy of his Party.  There was a time a few years back when Deputy Mulcahy was much more clear in his enunciation of his Party's policy on this issue.  There was a time when the Deputy planned for an offensive and defensive alliance with the British Government and the British people.</P>

      <P>Can we not have it one way or the other from the main Opposition, as to whether they want an offensive and defensive alliance with the British or not?  If they do want it, let them say so; but if not, if Deputy Mulcahy finds himself isolated in his view both in this House and throughout the country so far as a British alliance is concerned, should they not be honest enough to say so now and let us bury this bloomer of Deputy Mulcahy's in 1939 and give it a decent funeral?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice from the Deputy's speech that he still seems to be flirting with that idea, though I doubt if there is any member of his Party sitting on that Bench now who would back him. Deputy Mulcahy in his speech referred to certain members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, particularly Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and said they were not prepared now to co-operate or at least go in with the British Government as far as defence is concerned.  Those particular countries probably found what many of <Col N="721" /> us knew for quite a long time&mdash;that in practically every major war the British are anxious to fight any particular battle to the last Australian or the last Canadian; and would, if Deputy Mulcahy had his way, fight their battles to the last Irishman.  People, however, have moved on in this country, and they are not prepared, nor do I think is the House prepared, to enter into any defensive or offensive alliances with our neighbours across the water or indeed with any other country, without knowing exactly where we are going.</P>
    <P>I have searched the speeches of Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Mulcahy to find out what their idea of what the Army in this country should be and what our commitments in that respect should be and I failed to find in either of these speeches any plan with regard to policy, what the number in our Army should be or the amount which we should ask the taxpayers to pay for its maintenance.  It would appear to be accepted by these two Deputies that we must have an Army, but, reading their speeches, I fail to find what they have in mind with regard to what our Army should be or how far we should go in maintaining it, but once we accept that we are to have an Army&mdash; and I take it that both of these Deputies accept that we must have some kind of an Army&mdash;I would expect that, if these Deputies are not satisfied with the Minister's proposals for the Army, to hear from them their idea of what our Army should be, and how far we should go with regard to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has put his proposals before the House, and I would like him and the Government to concentrate on having the Army, even though it is a small Army, efficient. In peace-time it may well be said of any army that it has a certain number of ceremonial uses and I suggest that we should have some sections of the Army here which will carry out these duties of an ornamental nature in a good way.  If we are to have an Army in peace-time, we should have a smart and efficient Army, an Army trained and capable of expansion, if necessary.  For the ordinary ceremonial <Col N="722" /> occasions on which our Army may be used, I ask the Minister to see to it that it will be efficient and smart, and that some particular companies might be specially trained, equipped and dressed for such occasions.  That system obtains in other armies throughout the world, and I suggest that, in so far as part of our Army is to carry out ceremonial duties, it should be properly selected, trained, equipped and dressed for such purposes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey seems to suggest that there is such a great demand for manpower for turf production and agricultural purposes that men should not be given an opportunity of going into the Defence Forces.  I do not think that what the Minister is seeking will affect either of these vital industries in any way whatever.  If the Deputy was particularly worried on that score, I would have expected to hear him raising his voice in the House in favour of prohibiting our people from migrating during this year, last year, and the year before, but I did not hear his voice raised for the purpose of stopping the thousands of our workers who go in season every year to work on the other side.</P>

      <P>I am endeavouring to point out that the statements made that men going into the Army would affect the turf industry are ill-founded, and, with respect, Sir, I refer you to the speech made by Deputy Morrissey this evening in which he alleged that there were no men available for the Army because they were urgently required for the turf industry.  Surely I am entitled to point out that that was <Col N="724" /> untrue.  Surely when it is stated that there is such a shortage of agricultural labour and of men for the production of turf and when I know that that is not so, as every sensible Deputy knows, surely I am entitled to deny the statement. If any such suggestion were accepted, it would mean that the young men coming out of secondary schools to-day who are anxious to make the Army a career would be told that the opportunity was not there for them to enter the Army, simply because Deputy Morrissey is of the opinion&mdash;although nobody else in the country is of the opinion&mdash;that we have not sufficient men to produce turf.  I do not think that can follow.  I do not think it is true, and the young people who want to make the Army a career should not be deprived of the opportunity of doing so simply because Deputy Morrissey endeavours to find an argument against the passing of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey must find great difficulty in thinking out some means of opposing this measure. When he refers to the men who were recently retired from the Army, he is again on unsound ground, because the motion which was tabled in this House in connection with these men proved to be a boomerang so far as the Deputies who tabled the motion were concerned, when it transpired that, instead of being treated harshly, these men were enabled to retire from the Army on a pension that certainly shocked a number of people in the country.  I think that nobody who heard the propaganda about these men could possibly believe that they had been treated so generously.  When I calculated that, according to the present pensions to which these men are entitled, these few officers are going into civil life on a pension approximately of £850 per year, I decided to shed no tears about them.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will hear it. If we take the reductions in rank, acting colonels would be reduced to the rank of senior majors.

If they were continued in their old rank, they would have had to retire earlier and to retire on a pension based on lower pay.  They got the benefit of the increases in the Army pay.  They would be on a scale approximately of 18/- per day basic, plus an allowance.  They got increases of approximately 16/- per day, or £24 per month, or £288 per year on their old scales.  Unlike Deputy Morrissey, I certainly will waste no time in sympathising with men who have to go out on a pension of £850 per year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make an appeal to the Minister in connection with some of the Army regulations with regard to people developing diseases in the Army.  The Minister stated that, so far as tuberculosis was concerned, the Army authorities dealt very generously and sympathetically with soldiers who contracted that disease.  I have no doubt that that may be so within certain limits.  But I have had a certain amount of difficulty, and possibly a number of Deputies had similar difficulty, about some of these cases, and I should like to be assured that in the future there will be a definite line taken by the Army authorities.  When a recruit is attested after being thoroughly examined and passed as fit and some years afterwards develops tuberculosis or some other disease and is invalided out of the Army, there should be a definite responsibility on the Army to see that that recruit is entitled to some benefit.  It is very difficult to prove that tuberculosis, for instance, was contracted on active service. It is virtually impossible.  Apart from the Army, I have known of workmen's compensation cases and even cases of nurses working in tuberculosis institutions who have developed tuberculosis, where the persons concerned did not succeed in their claim or, in other words, prove that the disease arose out of and in the course of their employment.  If that can happen in an ordinary court of justice, it is even more difficult for a person in the Army who has developed tuberculosis to prove beyond yea or nay that the development of the disease was due solely to <Col N="727" /> his Army service.  Although he may have been exposed to the elements and got severe wettings during training, or on sentry duty, or on manoeuvres, it is difficult for a medical man to prove that the disease was contracted on active service.  Once a recruit has been attested and found to be fully fit, if he is invalided out after a few years, no matter how the disease arose while he was in the Army, provision should be made to give him a pension or benefit of some kind.  I know of cases which have been turned down already.  While the Minister stated that tuberculosis cases were dealt with sympathetically by the Army authorities, he did not state under what circumstances a pension would be granted.  He did not state what the particular regulation of the Army authorities was for determining whether the disease arose from the soldier's employment or in what cases a pension would be given and in what cases it would be refused.  I know it is a very difficult matter, but I think the Minister should go the whole way and, once he was satisfied that a man was in sound health when attested, should agree to provide a pension or benefit of some kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have come across other cases, and I am sure there will be cases coming up from time to time for the Minister's consideration, of men who have developed ulcerated stomachs and men who have developed blood pressure or other diseases and who had to be invalided out of the Army but who were not able to get the benefit of a pension scheme. It is quite true that it is possible to develop these diseases in any other occupation but it is equally true that you can develop tuberculosis in any other occupation.  It appears to me that it was chiefly due to the work the men had to do in the Army and, possibly, to the type of food they had to eat on some occasions and to the way in which, of necessity, the food was cooked and to the accommodation available for them in barracks, that they developed some of these diseases and it seems to me to be very severe that these men, through no fault of their own, and having given good service in the Army over a number of <Col N="728" /> years, should be thrown on the scrapheap and have no method open to them of getting redress.  This is a matter about which the Minister should make up his mind now.  Apart from what occurred in the past, for the future this aspect of Army life should be regulated on the widest and most sympathetic terms.</P>
    <P>Many considerations enter into the question of recruitment for the Army. The pay has a great deal to do with it but the man who considers joining the Army has other things in mind. One of the matters that will affect the Minister's recruiting campaign and the future of the Army is the provision that will be made in case of incapacitation through illness or otherwise while serving.  The Minister knows that when a man has been in the Army for a number of years it means that he has adopted the Army as a career and is possibly unsuited for any other walk of life.  One of the matters that will vitally affect recruitment will be the consideration of what the position will be if the soldier cannot continue, by reason of disease that he might develop while serving in the Army. This question of stability is a vital matter.  The Minister should provide that when a man has signed on for a long term, no matter what may happen to him in the way of disease or incapacity, he will be taken care of. I would ask the Minister to consider that matter in framing the future attitude of his Department towards the Army.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that there is no necessity for me to deal any further with the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions). Bill.  I have dealt already with the sections, in my opening statement, and there has been practically no discussion on the Bill proper, if we except a couple of inane remarks on Section 4 of the Bill.  The Bill, I take it, is more or less generally accepted.  The debate developed generally around the amendment and the motion.  The amendment asked for certain information. I thought I met fully the demands made in the amendment by giving the fullest possible information on the matter contained therein. <Col N="729" /> However, it did not appear to satisfy the members of the Opposition and I have come to the conclusion that the Opposition, when they are talking about Army policy, are inclined to mix up Army policy with external policy.</P>
      <P>I have stated very fully what the Army policy generally in regard to the defence of the nation is.  The approach of the Deputies who spoke on the question of defence policy generally appears to me to lack sincerity and conviction. A statement on defence policy was requested and when I gave the information the Opposition seemed to me to be surprised that there was a policy at all.  Deputy O'Higgins, in particular, said that, while every other country in the world was guessing as to its future, we know exactly where we stand.  I feel that I have not got to apologise for the fact that the Government has a broad defence policy which indeed is generally the policy that has existed in this country over a number of years.  I mentioned the fact that we required 12,860 all ranks and during the course of the debate several Deputies took it on themselves to interpret that as meaning that that would be the force that would be used if the necessity for using it against an invading force should occur.  Any Deputy of any intelligence will understand that the 12,860 men are merely the cadre which will be there to provide the training of any emergency force such as we had to raise in the past, that they will be there to train that force and to make it capable of dealing with any situation that might be likely to arise.  I cannot understand how Deputies could think other than in these terms on that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputies are talking about the speed with which we trained the Army in the emergency, they seem to be under the impression that the men as they were enlisted became trained soldiers within the course, as Deputy O'Higgins said, of a month or two That was not so.  The position was that at the end of 1942, when we held the very large manoeuvres, we discovered that we had still a vast amount to learn; that we were far from being trained in that effective way in which, <Col N="730" /> if the necessity should arise, we could meet it in the fullest possible way.</P>
    <P>Soldiers are not turned out, as Deputy O'Higgins suggested, as quickly as sausages.  I know that Deputy O'Higgins likes to exaggerate grossly when he is making speeches of that type, and I take that to be merely one of his gross exaggerations.  I am sure that Deputies know that the great American nation, which turned out very large armies in what might be described as a reasonably short time, estimated that it took 12 months to turn out a soldier who was capable of being sent abroad.  I think that even 12 months would not be sufficient time to turn out what might be described as a highly trained soldier, a soldier who would be capable of taking charge of groups of his colleagues if the necessity should arise.  That should be the aim of all trained soldiers.  When we talk about turning out men as soldiers in a period of two months, we are talking what can only be regarded as utter nonsense.</P>
    <P>I have already stated, in reply to a Parliamentary question put down by Deputy Mulcahy, that this country had no consultations with Great Britain or the United States on defence matters. In spite of that reply, we had Deputy Coburn informing all and sundry here recently that we had secret agreements with Great Britain and the United States.  All I desire to say is that the answer that I gave to Deputy Mulcahy was quite correct and the position suggested by Deputy Coburn is merely a fanciful idea of his own.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, in the course of his statement, made play with the strength of the Army.  He made our flesh creep and then he made us smile by his suggestion that when the atomic bombs are dropping here and there the Army will gallop from Dublin to Galway and from Galway to Cork, and so forth.  In spite of whatever Deputy Dillon may think in regard to the future of the human element in warfare, the fact remains that all the nations of the world are at present building up stronger peace-time armies than they have ever had before.  I have no doubt that this is because of the very uneasy peace that exists in the world to-day.</P>
    <P>Deputies who have told us that the <Col N="731" /> Army is two and a half times too large have not got the responsibility of government.  This Government is responsible for the defence of the nation and it is their opinion, based on the advice of their military experts, that that is the number required in order to meet any eventualities that may arise in the future.  I am pretty certain, if the Opposition were in our position, that they, too, faced with that responsibility, would act similarly on the advice given them by their military experts; otherwise they would be adopting the attitude that they were the military experts and not those people who had given life service to that particular work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan inquired about our defence scheme in relation to the United Nations Organisation.  He also asked about our naval policy. On the first point, I can only say that we are not yet a member of the United Nations Organisation and as we would not know what our commitments are likely to be unless and until we have been admitted to membership, it would be futile at this stage to make any assessment of the effect of membership on our defence policy.  Our naval policy, based on our experience of the recent emergency, is the maintenance of a small naval service which would patrol our territorial waters and cover our principal ports.  It would be absolutely essential, from the point of view of the maintenance of our neutrality, that we should be able to ensure that our territorial waters are not used as operational areas for belligerent purposes.</P>
    <P>I think it can be taken for granted that the hastily organised measures which sufficed in the late war would not be adequate in any future conflict. Accordingly, the organisation of a suitable naval service has been commenced and a number of vessels has been acquired.  In considering the type of naval vessel and the nature of the organisation which would be most suitable in time of war, regard was also had, because of the heavy expenditure involved, to the duties which would be performed by a naval service in peace time.  The most important of these duties is fisheries protection <Col N="732" /> patrol and the vessels which have been purchased are capable of being used for the efficient and economic performance of that particular type of work.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the cost of a permanent force, particularly in the light of the pre-emergency cost, and also to the loss from productive employment of the personnel of the permanent force.  As regards the cost, it must be remembered that the cost of equipment and commodities of all kinds has increased since pre-emergency days.  That factor, together with increases in pay and allowances and the cost of improved facilities, is largely responsible for the increase in the Army Vote.  There is no hope whatever of getting back to pre-emergency costs. The maintenance of a permanent force, whatever its size, unfortunately entails the absorption into the Army service of men who might otherwise be engaged in productive work.  The position is an unavoidable one, however, and, as I have already explained, nothing smaller than a permanent force of the strength proposed can be regarded as adequate. There must also be added the cost of the Construction Corps and the new Naval Service together with the cost of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil.</P>
    <P>As regards the officers who are being retired, it was suggested in the course of the debate that they should not be retired unless there were adverse reports against them which they had an opportunity of seeing and that, if an officer was guilty of inefficiency or misconduct, there were appropriate ways of dispensing with his services.  I know that there is a provision in regulations for the retirement of an officer for misconduct or inefficiency and that an officer, who is being retired on either of these grounds, has to be given particulars of the alleged misconduct or inefficiency and must have an opportunity of making representations in the matter.</P>
    <P>Now, I did not say at any time that any of these officers were being retired on the grounds of inefficiency or for misconduct.  I stated that some of the younger officers had shown themselves unsuited to Army life and that, of the remainder, some had failed to maintain their interest in the service while others <Col N="733" /> had not kept up with the advances which had taken place in their profession. It was for these reasons, and because of the retired pay aspect of the matter, that retirement in the interests of the service was decided upon.  Had it been decided upon for any other grounds, the very favourable consideration which they have received could not have been given them.</P>
    <P>Just as a matter of correction, I should say that, in spite of the fact that I was very particular in stating the number of officers involved, Deputy Dillon seemed to think that there were 20 officers involved and Deputy Giles, I think, kept repeating something about 24.  The number involved was 13 and one of these has since retired voluntarily.  The ages of the officers ranged from the 20's to the 40's.  Their ages did not exceed the higher limit.</P>

      <P>I agree.  I should say that the pensions ranged from the lowest of £210 to the highest, taking I.R.A. pension and Army pension into consideration, of something like £540 odd.  Beyond that I do not like to discuss the question.  I do not think it is desirable.</P>

      <P>A desire was expressed in the course of the debate that the personnel who are being retired and discharged should be given the most generous treatment by way of pension. That is being done, as was indicated in my opening statement.  The officers who are being retired, where they have 20 or more years' pensionable service, are being credited for retired pay purposes with a maximum of a further five years.  In other words, the officers concerned are being brought up to the maximum number of years' service which they could reach if allowed to serve to full retiring age.  I think that can be regarded as reasonably generous. They have also been given six months' pre-retirement leave which we hope will enable them to secure suitable employment in that period.  During that period of six months' pre-retirement leave, they are still members of the Army receiving the pay and allowances to which they are entitled.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin in the course of his speech, while he did not say that any of these men were being retired for political reasons, expressed the hope that there were no political animosities used against them.  I want to say right here and now that the question of animosities of any kind, political or otherwise, did not arise.  I should like to emphasise that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins and a number of other Deputies who spoke seem to think that the reversions should have been avoided.  Personally I do not see how the reversions from a large emergency army to a peace-time army could have been avoided.  He referred to acting rank having always been abused in the Army.  I want to say that, actually for many years before the emergency, acting ranks were not conferred.  There was no such thing as an acting rank during the period from 1930 onwards. The acting ranks which were in being before that existed in a similar way to that in which acting ranks operated in our own period.  Men who held acting rank in the period from 1924 to 1930 were similarly dealt with&mdash;some confirmed and some reverted.  That was the natural sequence in an <Col N="735" /> expanded army which was contracting in the ordinary course of events.  I am rather pleased that the number of officers who reverted from acting rank during the recent emergency was so small.  At one period I did not think it would be possible to confirm in their acting ranks as many officers as we eventually did confirm. The suggestion that we should have confirmed the whole lot is impracticable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave suggested that an unfair distinction, in the matter of pre-retirement leave, had been made between officers who were retired on age grounds on the 1st October last and the area administrative officers who will be retired on age grounds next April.  I think he is under a misapprehension in this matter because it was decided in 1945 to bring the normal retiring ages into operation. They were suspended altogether during the emergency, and at the end of the emergency it was decided to operate these ages.  The decision was taken in October, 1945.  With a view to giving the affected officers timely notice, the date on which the retiring ages would come into operation was fixed as the 1st October, 1946&mdash;that is, one year from the date of the notice. It was also decided that officers who actually reached the retiring age on or before 1st April, 1946, should be given pre-retirement leave with full pay from the 1st April, 1946, to the 30th September, 1946.  This six months' pre-retirement leave was intended to give the officers an opportunity of resettling themselves in civilian life. Officers who reached retiring age after the 1st April, 1946, but before the 1st October, 1946, were likewise given pre-retirement leave from the date on which they reached the retiring age to the 30th September, with a minimum of 28 days' leave.  Thus, all officers concerned received a year's notice of the introduction of the retiring age and also received pre-retirement leave from the date of reaching the retiring age, subject to a maximum of six months and a minimum of 28 days.</P>

      <P>The other officers got 12 months' notice.  At least they got six months' notice of the fact that they were going to get six months' pre- <Col N="737" /> retirement leave.  That is the actual position in respect of the officers concerned.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins seems to think that in the case of the old reserve&mdash;arising out of the amalgamation of the former reserve class into the first line reserve &mdash;that the old reserve officers had reason to believe that they ought to be retained in the reserve until they had reached the age limit, and said that even if amalgamation took place, these officers should have been permitted to complete their service.</P>
      <P>This would suggest that Deputy O'Higgins is under the impression that the services of a large number of officers of the general reserve were terminated even though they had not reached the age limit.  The actual position is that of the 191 officers of the general reserve that were on the reserve strength in 1945, four were appointed to the permanent force, and 51 to the first line reserve.  This left a residue of 136, of whom 97 were ineligible for the first line reserve because they had reached the age limit.  The remaining 39 were ineligible or unsuitable for the first line reserve on various grounds.  Included in the 39 were a number who, as both Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Mulcahy are aware, were retained on the reserve although they were not called out on permanent service during the emergency.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin also made reference to the permanent Bill and to the fact that we are continually bringing in these Temporary Provisions Bills. Deputies are just as well aware as I am that we had actually introduced a permanent Bill.  The Bill had received a First Reading when the world war intervened and when the emergency occurred for ourselves.  During the emergency quite a number of temporary measures had to be introduced into this House with the result that the particular draft of the Defence Forces Bill would, in the course of time, have become more or less obsolete and inappropriate.  The position at the moment is that the Bill will have to be redrafted and reintroduced. I cannot say at the moment how long it will take to do that work, but I feel that the temporary provisions measure will still have to be introduced for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" /> Deputy Keyes and a number of other Deputies raised a question which has often been raised in this House.  It was raised to-day by the last speaker&mdash;the question of the medical examinations which take place in regard to men who are medically boarded out of the Army.  All I can say in respect of that is that we have a statutory body dealing with those examinations.  I am sure that Deputies do not suggest, for one moment, that I should intervene between the applicant and that body.  I think that that would be highly undesirable.  As I stated in reply to a question to-day, two of the members of that board are civilians and one is an Army medical officer.  On a number of occasions on which I found it necessary to make inquiries, arising out of representations made by Deputies, I was perfectly satisfied that, so far as sympathetic consideration for these cases was concerned, everything was being done that could be done and that, where cases were being turned down, it was, in the main, on information which was available to the board and which was not available to the Deputies who were making inquiries. I hope that, in the future, the necessity for discussions on that question will not be so common as in the past because we are now in the position of having every recruit not only physically examined by medical doctors but examined through the medium of the X-ray.  In that way, I hope that the position will be clarified in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish was worried as to why the 11th May, 1945, was fixed as the date up to which men should have served in the Army before getting credit for years of service when competing for posts in the Civil Service and under the Local Appointments Commission. The 11th May, 1945, was the date on which the terms of the Government White Paper on demobilisation were made generally known and that is regarded as the first day on which soldiers were discharged under the demobilisation scheme for the Army.  Prior to that date, soldiers were not normally released from their obligations unless they supplied proof that their services were required for a particular purpose in civilian life or <Col N="739" /> unless they were found to be medically unfit for Army service.  The former were regarded as having obtained permanent employment and as not being in need of concessions.  Though demobilisation did not take place for some months after 11th May, 1945, it was decided that soldiers discharged after that date and soldiers previously discharged as medically unfit should get credit for their Army service when posts in Government Departments or under the Local Appointments Commission were being filled.  The point is that that date was regarded as the date on which demobilisation began and the men who went out before that date went out only on the understanding that they were going to permanent employment.  When requests to go out were made, as a large number were made prior to that date, we had to verify the truth of the statements made by the individuals concerned that they were, in fact, going into permanent employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Steps were taken to verify the statement of the applicant. If our information showed that the man was either returning to his former employment or that he appeared to be going into permanent employment such as he described, we released him. At the time, we released only men who stated they were going into permanent employment.  Where they were so released, this date applies.  It does not apply to men discharged as medically unfit.  These men still secure the benefits to which the men who remained on and who were automatically demobilised after that date are entitled.</P>

      <P>No.  It is the case of a man who had long service in the Army.  He had a sort of temporary job under the Wexford County Council and he wanted to apply for another position under another local authority. He would be suited for this post, which was being awarded by the Local Appointments Commission but he could not get credit for his years of Army service so as to bring him within the required age limits.  He had been discharged in March, 1945, and he found that 20 or 30 days debarred him from applying for this particular job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>We facilitated those men who went out to secure employment. We said, &ldquo;Here is a man who is going into employment and it is desirable that he should be resettled in <Col N="741" /> civilian life.&rdquo;  We facilitated that man, though, in some cases, I recall discussions with the Army authorities, who were still anxious to retain men because of their outstanding service.  Nevertheless, the attitude always was that if there was a question of resettling an individual into civilian life we should go ahead and resettle him.</P>
      <P>Then comes the question of the individual who remained on and who was automatically demobilised and who, for one reason or another, was unable to secure employment.  We decided, and I think the House will agree with me, that it was a reasonable and just decision, that such men who were automatically demobilised would be entitled, in the first instance, to secure any employment that would be going.  That was the purpose behind this particular decision, to ensure that a man who was automatically demobilised and had not secured employment would be one of the first to be taken into employment.  That was not the man who left the Army on the understanding that he was going into a permanent position and giving up one position, like the man Deputy Corish mentioned, who decided there was a better position going and applied for it.  I think the man who was in one position ought to have held on and allowed the man who was not in a position at all to get an opportunity of filling a vacancy.  I do not think there is anything in that decision that might be regarded as unjust.  There may be a number of men in due course who will have lost the employment to which they went and who will not get the benefit that their comrades who remained on will get.  However, if there is any outstanding case&mdash;and I do not think there is, as the first I have heard of is the one Deputy Corish mentioned&mdash;I will be quite prepared to have it examined.</P>

    <P>Deputy Bartley, in the course of his speech, made an appeal on behalf of the Irish-speaking battalion, whose recruits are usually trained at Renmore Barracks and who now, like those of every other unit, undergo their training on the Curragh.  I can assure the Deputy that the training which the recruits of the First Battalion, <Col N="742" /> which is the Irish-speaking battalion, undergo will be continued completely and entirely in the Irish language as heretofore, even though the training will have to take place in the central training depot on the Curragh, where we are standardising training in such a way that every man, whether he is in the First Battalion or any other battalion, will be trained on the same principles.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne raised a question about soldiers who were in receipt of pensions over £52 a year and who are debarred from obtaining employment on Government-subsidised relief work. Only persons who are in receipt of unemployment assistance are eligible to be considered for employment on special and minor employment schemes. One of the statutory conditions which qualify the applicant for unemployment assistance is that his means be not more than £52 a year if he is resident in a county borough or the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, or £39 a year if he is resident elsewhere.  As the person mentioned by Deputy Byrne resides in Dublin and is in receipt of an Army pension exceeding £52 a year, he is not eligible for consideration under this particular scheme.  I should mention, however, that his name is included in the special register of unemployed exservicemen kept by the Department of Social Welfare and thus he has the same facilities for obtaining employment by reason of his Army service as those generally provided for ex-Army men.</P>
    <P>There were a few minor points, such as that by Deputy Morrissey, which was quickly countered by Deputy O'Leary.  That is the sort of discussion we have had generally during this debate.</P>

      <P>I am perfectly satisfied that the recruitment which is taking place and which will take place is not going to affect either the industries the Deputy had in mind or the agricultural position, for the simple reason that the main source of recruitment is the towns. Now, generally speaking, the men in the Army, while they are what you might describe as good all-rounders, cannot be regarded generally as skilled agriculturists.  When an emergency of one kind or another arises&mdash;it does not matter whether it is a question of food or fuel, or one such as we have at present, where they are out aiding the engineers of the Telephone Department in restoring communications&mdash;whatever it may be, they are generally capable of giving effective and good help.  I do not think there need be any fear in the mind of Deputy Morrissey, or of any other Deputy who thinks similarly, that recruitment is going to have an adverse effect on the general production to meet the needs of our people.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £3,340 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st March, 1947, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>This Estimate represents the cost of the Office of the Minister for Health for the remainder of the present financial year.  Until the Estimate is passed the salaries of the Minister and the officers concerned will be borne on the Vote for the Department to which they have previously been attached, the amounts so borne being repayable to the Departments concerned out of this Vote.</P>
      <P>The expenditure for which the authority of the Dáil is now being sought relates only to the salary of the Minister and the Secretary and Assistant Secretary of the Department of Health, together with the usual secretarial staff attached to the Minister's office, and a round sum of £1,000 in respect of such additional staff as it may be found necessary to transfer to the service of the Minister for Health before the close of the present financial year.  The provisions in the existing Estimate for all other staff and for the services for which the Minister for Health will be responsible, in pursuance of the provisions of Government Orders transferring functions, will be borne on and accounted for under Vote 41 (former Department of Local Government and Public Health).  I want to stress that point because there is a difference in the next Estimate&mdash;that the expenditure will be accounted for by the present Department of Local Government.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made a very remarkable statement in the light of what we expected to hear from him.  I take it that he is moving the Estimate for the Ministry of Health.  Considering all that was said here on the Bill for the new Ministeries and all that was said and promised before, it is a rather remarkable omission that the Minister has not made a statement which might be some substitute for the White Paper on the new Ministry of Health which the Taoiseach <Col N="747" /> promised us specifically when dealing with this matter on a previous occasion in the Dáil and which has been referred to so often here.  It would have helped us a lot if the Minister had made some kind of statement on the way in which he is approaching the work of putting together the machinery that is now being put into his hands and the broader aspect of the work which we understand he is facing.  I hope that the Minister will do something to supply that omission before he asks the House to pass this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some things I should like to say on the Estimate, but there is one thing I should like to deal with first.  It may be a simple and individual thing, but it is urgent and I think it is no harm to throw it into the forefront of our remarks on this Estimate.  On several occasions during the last year I have drawn attention to the condition of the people in the Blasket Islands. In dealing with the matter I was dealing with the possibility of their carrying on the work from which they get an existence and pointed out that, in order to help them to do their work systematically and properly and to live in their modest kind of way, it was necessary to provide them with suitable facilities for landing on the mainland. On two occasions I pressed very hard to have the condition of the pier at the Dunquin side looked after.  Within the last three weeks a young man, one of the remaining population of about 30 on the islands, got ill.  He was ill for a week.  During that week he was not able to get the attention of a doctor because the boat could not set out from Dunquin.  He was not even able to get medical advice by telephone, because the telephone arrangement was not working.  There you have, in one of the sections of our people we are particularly anxious about because they form that part of our people who hold in its richness and in its continuity our national language, people left in circumstances in which they can die of illness within a week because they have no means of communicating with a doctor even by telephone. The Minister, according to what was set out when the new Ministries and Secretaries Bill was before us, <Col N="748" /> is responsible for these things and I do not apologise in any way for asking him to see, with regard to this one remnant at any rate of our people there, that something will be done so that the small population there shall not be allowed to die in the way in which this young man was allowed to die within the last three weeks because contact could not be got in any way with a doctor.</P>
    <P>The attitude seems to be that the population should be taken off the Blaskets. The school has been shut down there and there is very little likelihood of getting the Government to face up to doing anything that would improve the economic condition of these people. But, small as the population there is, within the last year two young married couples have started life on that island and, with any kind of realisation on their part that the Government was interested in them in any way, that island could arise again. At any rate, until such time as something is done for them, it ought not to be possible for us to have it said that the inhabitants of that island can die without the attention of a doctor or a priest.  I speak of the doctor side of it because the Minister is responsible for it.</P>
    <P>In the absence of any statement from the Minister, I should like to review the general spirit in which we have been asked to deal with public health matters in this House, say, during the last 12 months, since the Public Health Bill was introduced, in November, 1945.  That Public Health Bill, although it is on the Order Paper, has been dropped, and I wonder would the Minister see that the Government ask for an order discharging the entry on the Order Paper.  It need not stay any longer there to remind us of some of the objectionable provisions of it.  I want to speak of the general atmosphere in which public health has been approached, as a result of the discussions that took place around that Bill and on another occasion since.</P>
    <P>In the first place, it was indicated in connection with that Bill, that something like £500,000 requires to be spent in increasing medical services <Col N="749" /> throughout the country, that half that amount will be raised from local authorities and half will be borne by the State; and that, in connection with nursing services, an amount, that the Parliamentary Secretary at that time was not prepared to specify, would be required.  Very elaborate figures were quoted as to the cost of erecting new public health institutions or public assistance institutions of one kind or another and a very large bill of expenditure was foreshadowed.  I think this would be an occasion for the Minister to review, in however broad details, the line of policy that the Ministry of Health has in mind and in respect of which this expenditure is contemplated, if it is contemplated now.</P>
    <P>In the second place, I should like to ask the Minister whether the approach of the Ministry of Health to the organised medical profession in the country is going to be the approach of the Department of Local Government and Public Health in relation to the medical profession in dealing with the preparation and previous discussion of the Public Health Bill.  The Minister will remember that the attitude was that the Minister for Local Government or his Department declined in any way to discuss with the organised medical profession any aspect of the policy that was enshrined in the Public Health Bill.  Perhaps that is the matter that we would most like to have information about to-day and it is the matter in respect of which it is most important that we should be assured.</P>
    <P>I do not think, therefore, that I need apologise for asking the Dáil to listen to a statement published by the County Limerick doctors on that aspect of public health policy.  The statement was published in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of the 28th January, 1947. A meeting had been held of the County Limerick Division of the Medical Association of Ireland.  I read an extract from it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Attention was drawn to the fact that, however great its importance public health legislation lay in a domain which had been found to be fraught with danger to the autonomy of the family.  It is necessary, for instance, to guard the family's right <Col N="750" /> and duty to control the physical welfare and physical education of its members, and it is necessary to respect the authority of the family in all its rights and duties, including privacy, in relation to medical records.</P>
    <P>The demands of the natural and supernatural law may not with impunity be set aside for the purpose of achieving any fancied gain in efficiency or scientific knowledge. However spectacular the results, the ensuing loss of family morale would be disastrous even from the public health point of view.  The conclusions of medical science are of inferior rank to those of moral science, and hence the practice of medicine is governed by the conclusions of moral science in a higher way than by the conclusions of its own science.  The effective solution of public health problems requires not only the application of the rules of hygiene, but also the employment of all measures within the competence of the State which may be expected to enhance the sense of `family' in the community and, in particular, a spirit of family independence.  This spirit will not flourish in the absence of good moral, social, economic and other environmental circumstances and especially of good food and good housing conditions.  The State's problem is to secure these things for the community while at the same time upholding family morale.</P>
    <P>If the doctor is to take his proper share in this work of promoting health and coping with disease, he must be allowed to retain that degree of professional freedom which is indispensable to him.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that, as the doctor is a servant of the patient or of the family&mdash;because this is the source of his authority for all he does to the sick person&mdash;it follows that any limitation of the doctor's clinical freedom is really a limitation of the rights of the family.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, the profession is opposed to any suggestion that its members should become, primarily, State-directed officials.  A case can be made for the right of the State to <Col N="751" /> direct doctors `to' the work for which they are qualified, but no foundations exist for a claim to direct them `in' their clinical work.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that `it is no part of the normal function of the State to teach'.  This dictum is most strongly applicable to the teaching of medicine.  Health education can only be successfully carried out by individual personal teaching, for it requires that pupil and teacher be in intimate personal relationship.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The statement goes on to give certain points that I am sure will be brought to the Minister's notice or that we may refer to at a later date but there is a very considered and thoughtful statement by a section of the medical fraternity, speaking on behalf of part of their organised body, and it deals with matters that are troubling, not only Irish minds at the moment, but the minds of people wherever the State is asserting itself in any strong way with regard to public health.</P>
    <P>The matter has been referred to within the past 12 months on very many occasions in Great Britain where, in connection with some of the changes they are bringing about in their machinery for dealing with public health, there has been a considerable amount of discussion&mdash;much more discussion and much more comment than there has been in Ireland.  The same principles are involved, but, so far as we are concerned here, the same principles have been attacked.</P>
    <P>Lord Woolton is reported in the London <i>Times</i> of 8th October last as giving an inaugural address to the students at the Westminister Hospital Medical School.  He said there was no doubt that immense advantages had arisen out of the scientific and mechanical apparatus that had been brought to the aid of diagnosis, but he warns that medicine could not be mechanised, because the body was not the whole of man.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The achievements of the men with specialised knowledge who used these modern wonders were truly great, but in the end the general practitioner's intimate knowledge of the patient was the greatest force in <Col N="752" /> both curative and preventive medicine. It was founded on detailed observation of many facts and was built with the material of confidence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on to add that there were doctors for patients even more certainly than there were horses for courses, and the patient must be free to change his doctor for no other reason than that he did not like him; and the doctor should be free to tell the patient to seek advice elsewhere because he knew that, for one reason or another, he would never do that patient any good.</P>
    <P>Again, some time in October of last year, as reported also in the London <i>Times</i>, Sir A.  Webb-Johnson, President of the Royal College of Surgeons, discussed the national health service in an address which he gave in Liverpool Cathedral.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He said that the doctor's work was primarily a personal service and his calling exacted the utmost that man could give&mdash;full knowledge, exquisite judgment and skill in the highest, to be put forward not at any self-chosen moment, but daily at the need of others.  The doctor had often to be his patient's confidant and friend. The well-equipped clinician must possess the qualities of the artist, the man of science and the humanist, but he must exercise them only in so far as they subserved the recovery of the individual patient.  He must feel directly responsible to his patient&mdash; not for him to someone else.  It was a hard doctrine but none the less true, that this essential function of the doctor&mdash;the care of the given patient&mdash;might involve the foregoing of exactly scientific diagnosis, of the artistic perfecting of an operation, or even of the interests of society at large.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Lord Woolton warns that the actual machinery that has been brought to the aid of diagnosis is a thing that you have to take care against; that man is both a body and soul and that to some extent the relationship of the doctor to the patient has some element of the relationship of the priest to the penitent.  If that is so, that we have to be careful of machinery in the hands of the practitioner who realises his <Col N="753" /> personal responsibility to the patient, the fear that we may have of the machinery of State working on the individual patient and interfering between the patient and the doctor is even greater still.

      <P>We are considering an Estimate giving the Minister power to administer a particular Department.  I am not so much discussing policy; I am discussing the atmosphere in which administration will be carried out.  We have had experience during the past year of a Department of State introducing proposals for public health and dealing with patients and doctors while claiming that they were not going to discuss the proposals enshrined in that legislation with the medical fraternity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but our experience of having had to discuss these matters with the Government is very strongly present in our minds.  I think that it will probably save parliamentary time ultimately and help towards a little understanding if I am allowed to finish my point.  I suggest that I am entirely in order in discussing the administrative approach.  It is the administrative approach we are concerned with here.  The Minister is embarking on a new Ministry and the principal machine he has is the medical fraternity in this country.  I am speaking of the administrative approach of the Minister to the medical fraternity and in relation to that I am picturing to some extent the positions and the functions that are peculiar to the medical fraternity.  The <i>Catholic Herald</i>, dealing with the national health scheme, gives the opinions of a practitioner and a priest.  The priest is Father Bonnar and he says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The principles which must chiefly be invoked to throw light on the present matter are those concerning <Col N="754" /> social justice, individual rights and duties, individual freedom, and full respect for the rights of conscience in doctor and patient.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on he says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Professional secrecy between doctor and patient is one of the most valuable and scared elements in the medical tradition.  This is not a specifically Christian matter but it accords well with the Catholic view of the doctor's vocation, which is second only to that of the priest. There may be a definite danger that, in a State medical service of an all-embracing character, our health will be card-indexed and the information handled by a number of civil servants, and that this information will be used for other purposes than that of promoting our personal health. Another danger to the Catholic conscience is the possibility that treatment may be so standardised that the liberty of Catholic doctors and Catholic patients in respect of medical and surgical procedures repugnant to Catholic morality, may be crushed out.  The more immediate danger is that Catholic doctors may be excluded from many positions....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it well to bring these matters before the Dáil and particularly before the Minister because of our experience in dealing with the Public Health Bill and because of the way in which certain provisions of that Bill overrode the rights and invaded the privacy of individuals and seemed to hold out a strong State hand to grip and direct the medical fraternity in a way which I do not think that profession should be gripped or directed.  I refer to this matter all the more because of the attitude the Taoiseach took up in the Seanad.  He did not agree with the co-ordination of certain services under the Ministry of Social Welfare; he held that no good would arise from the coordination of these services, but that he was proposing to have them coordinated, so that they could be better managed and better supervised.</P>
    <P>The Minister will not object to my recalling that he particularly, as a Minister, has declared that the day for the State managerial idea has now <Col N="755" /> come and that, before the State manager, vocationalism will become less and less of importance.  These are all matters that I think make it advisable that we should get some idea from the Minister, in asking the Dáil to pass this Estimate, as to what his relations are going to be with the medical fraternity.  It might perhaps enter on the domain of legislation or policy if I went further, but I do think it would be advisable for the Minister to give the House at this stage some idea of the extent he contemplates private medical practice is going to be allowed to remain in the country.  That may be asking him to comment on some of the provisions of the Public Health Bill which is being withdrawn, but if he were in a position to make a pronouncement now and give us some idea as to the extent to which he was modifying the Ministerial approach to the setting up of the new public health machinery, it would be helpful.  It would help him, if he is going to enter into discussion with the various professional bodies connected with public health in the country, in his relations with these bodies.</P>
    <P>The reason I ask for a statement of that kind is that the Public Health Bill as it stood aimed at making over to the local dispensary doctor the whole of the medical services for all children and all mothers in each area.  I feel that it would be well if we could know definitely now whether the Minister was approaching the work of his new Department with the idea in his mind that he was going to place the whole of that work under the local dispensary doctor&mdash;that is, that the care of children from the time they are infants up to the time they are 16 years of age or until they leave school, would be the responsibility entirely of the local dispensary doctor and that the care of mothers would also be his responsibility. If that is going to be the position, then I think he should let us know to what extent any kind of private medical practice is going to be left in the country and in what way there is any likelihood of there being left in the country that relationship between <Col N="756" /> patients and doctors of their own selection which the medical fraternity here and elsewhere feel is one of the most important aspects that can be considered in connection with public health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ascertain from the Minister if he has now arrived at the stage at which he can say whether all the various items which are finally to come under the purview of his Department have been segregated absolutely from those dealt with under the Department of Local Government.  If so, has he so advised the public bodies concerned and can he say if the arrangements arising out of these notifications are in actual operation? Further, would he say finally where it is intended to have the headquarters of his Ministry?  I do not want to impinge too much on questions of policy.  I recognise that there are limitations to the discussion on this Estimate but since the Minister is inaugurating a new régime, might I point out that one of the most important matters connected with the subject of public health is the question of the treatment of tuberculosis?  In that respect I should like to have some information also.  There are two phases of the treatment of tuberculosis which the Minister can approach quickly and deal with effectively&mdash;the question of accommodation and the question that has often been discussed in this House, namely, allowances for the dependents of those who are undergoing treatment in sanatoria.  I mention tuberculosis particularly, because of the activities that were pursued in the late Ministry some months ago in connection with the setting up of regional sanatoria. One of these sanatoria was to be established at Santry where it was intended to have bed accommodation for up to 1,000 patients.  There is a good deal of doubt existing at the present time as to whether in fact the project of the sanatorium at Santry is to be proceeded with.  I think the Minister would be performing quite a good service if he would indicate whether there is a definite and positive decision to proceed with the establishment of the regional sanatorium in Santry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the other question of allow- <Col N="757" /> ances for the dependents of those who are undergoing treatment.  There has been a disposition for quite a considerable time to deal with that question by the old worn-out method of public assistance.  I would ask the Minister, now that he has the opportunity, to take into consideration the unanimous viewpoint of this House that we should have a fixed scale of allowances for the dependents of patients in sanatoria on the same basis as exists in the North of Ireland and in England.  Members of the medical profession in this House and outside it will bear testimony to the fact that it is absolutely impossible to proceed successfully with the treatment of tuberculosis while individual patients are subject to the worry that their families and dependents outside are perhaps in want.  I suggest to the Minister that he should give some indication so far as may be practicable as to how he proposes to deal with waiting lists, and also that he might make some pronouncement as to whether the sanatorium in Santry still remains a public project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House very long on this Estimate.  It is obvious that once the House has sanctioned the establishment of the new Department the salaries and wages required between now and the end of the financial year for that Department must be provided by Parliament. On that aspect of the matter I have nothing to say.  Deputy Mulcahy referred to some evidence we had of lack of co-operation between the Minister's predecessor and the medical profession as exhibited very clearly and acutely in connection with the Public Health Bill.  The Minister's appointment to the Ministry of Health has been welcomed by the medical profession as a whole&mdash;by individuals, and by the organised profession.  I do not pretend to join in those notes of welcome, not for any particular objection that I have for the individual or to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated very clearly in the House, at the time the proposal was made, that I thought it was a mistake to have a medical man in charge of the Ministry of Health.  It is bound to lead to confusion between the medical <Col N="758" /> minds of the paid medical experts and advisers and the medical mind of the Minister, and when there is a division between those two minds the medical Minister is in the position, in fact, of being a kind of superior doctor.  A soldier in charge of the Ministry of Defence would be just as big a mistake. If we look to any of the older countries that have worked for centuries through the parliamentary system and the parliamentary machine we will not find a doctor in charge of the Ministry of Health, a legal man in charge of the Ministry of Justice, a soldier in charge of the Ministry of Defence or a naval man in charge of the Admiralty.  Those technical expert matters are to be dealt with by the staff, by the experts, by the specially selected men, and the Minister is supposed to represent the mind of the layman only to see how the recommendations of those professional experts affect the lives of the ordinary people.  If you have professional experts, with their minds duplicated higher up, the whole system and the whole idea of Ministerial control breaks down.  For that reason and that reason only, I objected and still object to a medical man, a member of my own profession, being in charge of the Ministry of Health.  It would be better to have a cobbler, a lawyer or a farmer there and have the present Minister, with his Ministerial experience and capabilities, in charge of some other Department.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, I make those observations in order to make it clear that, although the appointment has been generally welcomed by the profession, I think the profession generally is making a mistake.  I do certainly congratulate the Minister on the fact that his early steps, as an infant toddling, as the new Minister for Health have been very wise steps. He has certainly completely departed from the policy of his medical predecessor. The previous medical mind in that Department seemed to consider that health&mdash;national health&mdash;was the affair of the individuals who frequent the Custom House, and was not the affair of the men and women down the country or of the members of the medical profession throughout the country. <Col N="759" /> I think it was the height of presumption for any Minister to bring in a far-reaching, comprehensive Public Health Bill dealing with the health of all people from infancy to old age and death, and to state, in introducing it, that he had not gone into conference with, and had not consultation with, the members of the medical profession. His statement that his reason for that was that it was because they were addled politicians was ignorant and offensive.  That Bill was doomed the day it was introduced, and even if it had been passed through this House it was stricken and doomed.  Any Bill that deals closely with the health of the people, that depends for its implementation not only on the work but on the enthusiastic work of the professional men throughout the country, can only be formulated after full, adequate and ample consultation between the Department and the individuals who are expected to implement it.  The present Minister's early steps were in the direction of inviting conferences and consultations.  Those were wise steps, and will have very beneficial results for everybody.</P>
    <P>It is nothing short of a scandal that a Public Health Bill should have been a matter of controversy, but that Public Health Bill, as introduced, could never be anything but a matter of controversy, because in its very introduction the gauntlet was thrown down to the medical profession.  The members of that profession were treated with complete contempt and disrespect.  The Minister has undone a considerable amount of the harm done previously. At the moment the relations between the Ministry and the medical operatives throughout the country are, if not harmonious, certainly very much improved. Relations can never be harmonious between the Ministry and the profession generally throughout the country so long as members of the profession are treated as if they were beggars at the back-door of the Custom House, as if they were lower in the social scale financially than people without profession, trade, or even any kind of common skill.</P>
    <P>I should like, seeing that we now have a medical Minister for Health, if he <Col N="760" /> would occasionally scrutinise some of the documents that go out in his name to various officers, boards and councils throughout the country.  If he does he will realise that if his Ministry is to be respected by the profession generally it must show some respect for the profession. Doctors, take pride in their work.  Their profession is an old, long-established one.  It is a profession that is respected by the ordinary people, and nothing should be done by a Ministry of Health to bring it into complete and total disrespect.  Since the Ministry was established, and since the Minister took up duty, I happen to have seen circulars that went out from that Department asking that cases of certain types of infectious diseases over the last 15 years should be visited by the district medical officer, that certain discussions were to take place and that certain specimens or samples were to be collected from those people's bodies&mdash; from people living five and seven miles away.</P>
    <P>The doctor was to go out, he was to sit down and patiently argue, cajole and discuss the advisability of getting a particular specimen.  He was to get the specimens, cork them, label them, parcel them up and send them away to a laboratory, get a report back from it, and send that report on to a county centre.  When all that work had been done, the Minister would be prepared to sanction a fee of 2/6.  Could anybody have any respect for a member of a profession or trade or for a worker or unemployed man who would be sent seven miles away to do a job of work and then be told that the value that would be placed on his services&mdash; having travelled seven miles there and seven miles back to do the work&mdash; would be this, that he would receive 2/6?  That in the year 1947!  That was broadcast throughout the country. I should respect the Ministry of Health and the Minister if they had asked to have that work done in the public interest without any fee.  If the members of the medical profession, irrespective of poverty or anything else, saw that the thing was important to the health of the people, they would not haggle about a fee.  They would rather by far be asked to do the work <Col N="761" /> for nothing than that that circular should have been printed and circulated throughout the Twenty-Six Countries.  Would the Minister, as a householder, send for a tradesman, living three or four or seven miles off, ask him to come to his house and look at a door or a window and produce 2/6 for his time and labour?  He would be a very courageous man if he did that. Would he go to a taxi-man, ask him to drive him four miles out to his house and back and produce two shillings and six pennies as payment?  That is a very unhealthy start and I advise the Minister, if he wants to have proper relations between the medical men who have to do the job of work throughout the Twenty-Six Counties and himself and his Department, to peruse for some time to come everything that goes out from his Department affecting the profession. If irritating things and worrying instructions have to go out, at least ensure that nothing offensive or insulting with regard to the profession generally will emanate from the Department.  Let that be done, at least, until the Minister gets properly established and consolidated there and the avenues of approach between himself and his Department and the profession generally are reopened&mdash;reopened, I hope, with satisfactory results to the centre, the periphery and the public generally.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred, in passing, to a certain matter in connection with tuberculosis.  I shall not explore that to any extent on this occasion but it is regrettable that, in spite of the best efforts and the best intentions of all concerned, tuberculosis should be getting farther and farther ahead.  On the first occasion on which I address myself to a new Minister for Health, I am entitled to say that, when we are dealing with health matters, the people whose advice should be of the greatest importance are those who are responsible for health away down throughout the counties. Their advice should be as important, with regard to health measures and health matters, as that of those who do their work in the Custom House, Dublin.  Although it gives me no pleasure to say &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;, six <Col N="762" /> years ago from this bench I implored the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Supplies to take some interest in the health of the people.  At that time, motor-cars were taken from under the nurses of Ireland. It was illegal for any district nurse to use a motor-car.  Health visiting completely broke down.  The county tuberculosis officer was given for a month as much petrol as he had previously used in two days.  That meant that contacts which should be seen from day to day were not seen even from month to month.  The tubercular case had infected 15 or a dozen others before either the nurse or tuberculosis officer could reach on it.  The same applied to every other infectious disease.  Six years ago I said that, with the petrol allowance given to doctors and nurses, infectious disease was going to get completely out of hand.  A nurse or a doctor was pushing a pedal-bike or walking many miles while motor lorries tore by&mdash; turf lorries, timber lorries and empty Army lorries&mdash;and there was ample evidence that, provided the case was put up sufficiently strongly, petrol could have been got from the Department of Supplies.  The voice of the organised nursing profession and the organised medical profession throughout the country was either not heard or not listened to in the Custom House.  I am mentioning that regrettable and tragic state of affairs&mdash;a state of affairs the results of which we shall be paying for for the next two or three generations&mdash;so that that policy of excluding the people who are primarily and most closely concerned with matters of health will not be pursued by the present Minister.</P>
    <P>With regard to the late and, possibly, not lamented Public Health Bill, there is this to be said: it was a Bill that contained many good and beneficial sections, parts and portions. It was also a Bill that contained some matters which would make it absolutely unacceptable to the people and, I think, to the professional workers.  It is a pity, because of the good portions that were in it, that it should be suspended for so long.  The Bill could be very speedily amended. The views of those concerned could be readily heard. <Col N="763" /> Deputy O'Sullivan referred to one portion of the Bill.  That portion of the Bill made provision for tubercular patients when undergoing treatment. It made financial provision for finding a substitute for the mother or custodian of children while she was undergoing treatment for tuberculosis.  With important sections like that in the Bill and with the state of that disease throughout the country, it is unfortunate that the measure should be unduly delayed because merely of administrative changes.  The Bill in itself was an important one and the sections that were objectionable stood out very clearly.  The Minister is in a position to get the views of those concerned, but with the objectionable sections removed I would certainly deplore any undue delay in introducing a Bill to take the place of the late Public Health Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Vote it is not possible or desirable to have a long debate on the administration of this new Department.   We will have to wait and see how it will develop, as it is only in the course of formation; but we would like to have from the new Minister some indication of the general lines of policy he intends to pursue. I would like to know his views on two main questions.  Firstly, is it his policy gradually to organise and streamline the medical profession until they become part and parcel of the Civil Service?  If it is, it will be a step definitely in the wrong direction, a step towards complete disaster not only as far as public health is concerned but as far as the general welfare of our people is concerned.  The Minister would be well advised to consider the views expressed recently at a meeting of the Limerick branch of the Medical Association, as reported in the <i>Standard</i> last week.  They stated in a resolution:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It must be remembered that the essential means of securing good health is a good moral life in a good social order.  If the doctor is to take his proper share in the work of promoting public health and coping with disease, he must be allowed to <Col N="764" /> retain that degree of professional freedom which is indispensable to him.  For these reasons, the profession is opposed to any suggestion that its members should become primarily State-directed officials.  It is felt that such a condition of things would destroy the normal doctor-patient relationship which implies a mutual confidence and friendship.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The views expressed there are of such importance that the Minister should consider them very carefully, and I think he would be well advised to follow the advice given.  There is a danger that, in the attempts that will be made in the future to promote a higher standard of efficiency in grappling with disease, and particularly with infectious diseases, the medical profession may be regimented to a much greater extent than in the past &mdash;and not only that, but ordinary people over whom the medical profession may exercise their duty may be regimented and controlled.  That must be avoided and it would be well if the Minister could assure the House that it is his intention to preserve and protect the freedom of the medical profession and the freedom of the individual citizen to choose whatever doctor he wishes when he requires treatment.</P>
    <P>Another matter of equally grave importance is the financing of the expansion of public health services which is envisaged.  Will it be the Minister's policy to continue the practice which has been long in operation, of compelling local authorities to bear 50 per cent. of all costs incurred?  There are so many grave and urgent needs in regard to institutional treatment and in regard to assistance for those who are obtaining that treatment and such a wide expansion of the service is so urgently necessary that it would be wrong and unwise not to face these problems on a national rather than on a local basis.  Tuberculosis is a problem which must be tackled nationally and I do not think it would be desirable to impose even 50 per cent. of the cost on the local authorities.  It would be a mistake to have this great work held up by reason of the natural reluctance <Col N="765" /> of local authorities to incur additional expenditure and impose additional burdens on the local people.  The national approach is necessary as well as a national system of financing it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins had rather interesting views to express on the subject of a doctor in charge of a Department of Health.  He thought it should be controlled by somebody other than a doctor.  I am sure that view will be refreshing to the present Minister, as one of the most frequent criticisms I heard of him&mdash;in addition to all his sins of commission and ommission&mdash;was that he was a doctor when in control of the Department of Agriculture.  Frequently I have heard the view expressed, not only by the Minister's opponents but even by members of his own Party, that it was ridiculous to have a doctor in charge of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good deal to be said for the view which Deputy O'Higgins has expressed, as far as public health is concerned, although I do not think any farmer would welcome another doctor to the Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>I would like to bring to the Minister's notice a section of our people whose claim is seldom mentioned in this House and to whom attention is seldom directed.  I speak of infirm people living alone, particularly in rural areas. Very frequently we read of old people being found dead in their homes, sometimes dead for two or three days and sometimes even eaten by rats.  It is deplorable that that should happen in a Christian country and I have always felt that something serious and drastic should be done to bring the benefits of health administration to such people.  I am not going to suggest that people who prefer to live alone in their little homes in rural areas or in isolated places should be hustled away to some institution, but a service should at least be provided by which these people would be visited in their homes and by which grave neglect could be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be said that neighbours and friends should look after them.  That <Col N="766" /> is perfectly true.  It is the duty of relatives and even of neighbours, even though not relatives, to look after people living alone who may be old and infirm, but very frequently what is everybody's business is nobody's business, and often such people are neglected and come to sad and lonely ends.  There is an urgent need for a special investigation into the needs of these people.  Many of them may be proud and may not wish to seek assistance, while others may be mentally weak or defective and may be opposed to anybody interfering in their business, but it is a matter, I think, in regard to which all will agree that something should be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to tuberculosis, and what we are doing to check it, a Bill was before the House some time ago providing for three new regional sanatoria.  I do not know what steps have been taken to complete these sanatoria and I should like the Minister to give us an outline of what exactly is happening with regard to them.  From my experience in my own county, and I am sure the same applies to other counties, tuberculosis seems to be claiming more victims than ever, although we were told during the passage of that Bill that that was not the case, that tuberculosis was more or less on the decrease.  Returns from many county medical officers, however, show that the disease is not by any means checked or decreasing. Some time ago in Mayo, we had to take steps to increase the accommodation for tubercular patients pending the erection of a sanatorium in Galway, and I think that the application for sanction for the new temporary erections will come before the Minister in a short time.  If that be the case, I ask the Minister to expedite the matter&mdash;at least to have it dealt with with more expedition than we have been accustomed to get from the Custom House in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have beds in the county sanatorium at Creagh for 40 patients and 12 additional beds in the county home, a total of 52, but the county medical officer and county tuberculosis officer report that there are more than 52 patients on the waiting list.  Some <Col N="767" /> have died in their homes and possibly the disease has been spread amongst their families.  There have been one or two painful cases of fine young men who have died while awaiting beds in the county home.  If suitable accommodation had been available, some at least of these lives would have been saved, and I urge the Minister to help the Mayo County Council in the matter.  The same applies, I am sure, to other counties, and it seems that it will be a pretty long time before the regional sanatoria are built and equipped, and many victims of tuberculosis who could be saved will have died by the time they are available, apart altogether from the infection they will have spread by then.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy O'Sullivan who referred to a scheme of remuneration for the dependents of tubercular patients.  Such a scheme will become an absolute necessity, and I ask the Minister to take all requisite steps to devise such a scheme, because what happens is that a tubercular sufferer&mdash;a father of a family&mdash;hangs on simply because he knows that if he goes to a sanatorium, he will have to spend six months, a year and possibly two years there and his family will be in destitute circumstances, and all the more so if the valuation of his holding is a bit high.  There is nobody left at home in some cases but his wife and a few young children who are going to school or who have not yet reached school-going age.  Something should be done in these cases because much harm is caused by the lack of a scheme of remuneration for the dependents of a bread-winner.</P>
    <P>We have to a great extent got over the difficulty of the stigma associated with this disease because of which people cloaked and hid it and would not admit that they had it, because of which they would rather die at home than admit they suffered from it, and the next step is a scheme of the type I mention to enable them to go to the sanatorium without having to worry about leaving poverty or destitution behind them and so avoid the possibility of their hanging on in the vain hope that the disease may lift and they <Col N="768" /> may improve, and thus cause harm to people in their households.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the salaries of dispensary doctors, I observe from some of the returns of county managers that, while provision is being made for increasing the salaries of all officials, including nursing staffs, they have omitted making any provision for increased remuneration for dispensary doctors, on whom the poorer section of the community are solely dependent in connection with health matters.  The excuse which one county manager has given me is that he was awaiting some instructions from the Minister for Health, as he understood that dispensary doctors would be taken over by that Department.  That might take a long time and, as public bodies are preparing their estimates at present, I suggest that he should communicate to the county managers his view that dispensary doctors should receive no less generous treatment than is being given to other officials.  Even a third-class clerk under a public body has a higher salary than the dispensary doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the attendants in mental hospitals outside Dublin, the position is that many county councils, in cases where applications have been made for increased salaries and improved conditions, are recommending different increases and different conditions. The union has made representations to the Minister with a view to having the county managers called together for the purpose of bringing about co-operation and deciding on one policy, and I suggest that the Minister might even go so far as to agree to a conciliation board to help and advise him in connection with disputes relating to mental hospital attendants.  I am aware that a large number of institutions outside Dublin have had the matter under consideration for some time, and, in the interest of the health of the mentallyafflicted persons in their charge, I suggest that, as an urgent matter, he should forthwith take the matter up with the respective unions, with a view to bringing about a satisfactory solution of the problem with which he <Col N="769" /> will be faced in relation to various attendants outside the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>As to the question of tuberculosis, the public body of which I am a member did everything possible to give publicity to the fact that in tuberculosis cases a generous grant was given to provide accommodation by way of an additional room to houses on the recommendation of the county medical officer of health.  We also give an allowance to any person discharged from a sanatorium or, if the bread-winner is in a sanatorium, to maintain his family while he is in the institution. During the last week we had no difficulty in having the national insurance benefit supplemented in some cases by a sum from the public body concerned to enable the patients to get extra nourishment while recovering their health after being in a sanatorium. I ask the Minister to give special attention to the two matters to which I have referred.  I know the problem that has to be faced in connection with the attendants in mental institutions, and I ask the Minister to give the matter his immediate attention by having either a meeting of the unions held or a conciliation board set up to settle the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather disappointed that the Minister seemed to treat this Estimate as if it was an ordinary Supplementary Estimate for an established Department, and did not feel that he was called upon to say anything in connection with it, beyond explaining briefly the sums required and the purpose for which they were required. I should like to get from the head of the new Ministry of Health some indication that there will be a radical change in the approach to this matter of the health of the community from the way in which it has been dealt with, in so far as it has been dealt with at all, in the past.  I think it is true to say that the health of the community has deteriorated and is deteriorating. I think it is true to say that there is an increase in disease in this country.  I think it is true to say that we are not making any real effort to grapple with that or with the causes of it.  I should like to get from the Minister an assurance <Col N="770" /> that the matter will be tackled in a different and more comprehensive way and, certainly, in a more effective way.</P>
      <P>We talk about tuberculosis and sanatoria. These sanatoria are very necessary because a certain condition has been allowed to arise and it must be dealt with by way of sanatoria and other curative measures.  But, side by side with building sanatoria, are we still to have conditions that are undermining the national health, that are reducing the powers of resistance of the people to disease?  I do not believe that the provision of more hospitals and sanatoria will improve the health of the community so long as certain conditions with regard to the health of the community are allowed to remain. The Minister recently&mdash;I think it was somewhere in the West&mdash;certainly gave more information than he gave us here as to what he proposed to do.  Amongst other matters he dealt with national health insurance.  I do not want to go into that now beyond saying&mdash;and it can be related to what has been said about tuberculosis&mdash;that there is a fear on the part of tubercular patients to go into a sanatorium for treatment because they have people depending on them.</P>
      <P>Is there any man in his sane senses, unless he is so stricken that he is unable to work, going to lie up and send for the doctor when he knows that instead of getting £2, £3, or £4 a week for himself and his family he will get 15/- national health insurance benefit? That in itself is something that is crying out for a remedy.  I hope that the Minister will indicate either on this Estimate or on the next Estimate his attitude on this matter.  I would suggest, Sir, that we might have the whole discussion covering the two Estimates on this one.  That is a matter, of course, for the House, but what I have to say I should like to say here and now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to hear from the Minister whether anybody can make a case for and talk about national health insurance benefits at a rate which was set up 30 years ago when one considers the purchasing power of 15/- then and the purchasing power to-day.  If the thing were not so serious it would be laughable to call that national health insurance.  I should like to hear from the Minister that some of the time of his Department and himself will be spent in dealing with that and I hope the Minister will be able to bring before the House in the near future something that will give us a real national health insurance service instead of the make-believe that we have at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take another matter.  I venture to suggest that a very big proportion or percentage of our community at the present moment, having regard to existing prices and conditions, are living in conditions bordering upon the existence level.  These people cannot obtain sufficient nourishment to maintain good health or any powers of resistance to attacks upon their health.  Do we not know that that is so?  Do we not know that there has been a bigger strain put on the health of the people during the last four or five years than perhaps at any time in our generation?  Do we not know that there is less protective clothing and that the quality of such clothing as is to be had is far inferior to what it was in pre-war days?  Do we not know, notwithstanding all that has been attempted, that there is less heating available?  So far as the ordinary poor family is concerned, one hesitates to speak about them, having regard to present-day prices and the difficulty of obtaining ordinary bed-clothing.  Do we not know that, because first-class materials cannot be obtained, the footwear for men, women and children in this country to-day is absolutely inferior? Indeed one might say that the best of the footwear is not able to <Col N="772" /> keep a dry foot on either child or adult.  Do we not know all these things are affecting the health of the people?</P>
    <P>I heard it stated here by the Minister's predecessor that poverty had nothing to do with tuberculosis.  I know nothing about medicine, but it would take the whole Medical Association to convince me that a family reared in unhygienic surroundings, in crowded and ill-nourished conditions, are not much more likely to contract and perhaps die from tuberculosis than a family brought up in more up-todate and hygienic conditions and with plenty of nourishing food available for them.  We have got to get back to that.  We have to ask ourselves whether people in this country, from the old age pensioner up, can keep their bodies in a condition to resist disease on the amount of food their incomes will enable them to buy under present conditions.</P>
    <P>These are the aspects of the matter that I should like to see the new Public Health Department turning their attention to.  May I, as one who had a few words to say on the recent Public Health Bill, say that any efforts that will be made by the Minister or by the new Department towards improving conditions and improving public health in this country will have the wholehearted support of all sides of this House?  There is no doubt about that. As Deputy Dr. O'Higgins said, there were certain features of that Bill that were good; there were certain features of it which were highly objectionable, and perhaps not the least objectionable feature of it was the manner in which it was introduced and in which it was sought to pilot it through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Mulcahy was speaking of the maintenance of the slip-way at Dunquin I found it rather difficult to visualise to where he was leading, but, when he explained that he was speaking about the atmosphere, then I had a better idea of his approach to this subject.  We all regret very much the incident that, he recalled, took place on the Blasket Islands but the Minister could hardly have controlled either the atmosphere or the elements.  At the time to which the Deputy referred vessels far more seaworthy than the boat in question were <Col N="773" /> unable to reach their destinations or provide maintenance for those on the headlands, outposts and islands around our coast.  Deputy Mulcahy then quoted from the <i>Cork Examiner</i> some comments from the medical profession in Limerick.  I shall be very pleased to give the Deputy the report of a very eminent practitioner in Cork city, one of the most eminent men in the country, with full permission to pass it on to Deputy Cogan when he is finished with it, in which he praises the Government for the proposals in the Public Health Bill.  That Bill has not yet come into effect but certain things were set out in it as being beneficial to the community and they have been carried out by that medical officer and in this report he praises the people for their co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey has stated that families reared in unhygienic conditions have not much chance but, at the same time, objection is taken to remedying that state of affairs in the houses where the people must remain pending the provision of adequate housing.  Experience has shown, in the City of Cork at any rate, that with a proper approach to this matter, people will co-operate to the fullest extent.  Certainly, nobody wants to interfere, least of all the Minister for Health, with the intimate confidences between doctors and their patients but, as the general health of the community is the concern of all, surely the authorities should be entitled to take such steps, within reason, as will bring about a better state of affairs in that regard.  Deputy Morrissey has also stated that in his opinion there is an increase in disease in the country and that there is little being done to grapple with it.  As one who has studied the statistics for a considerable number of years, I think the Deputy is mistaken, both in regard to the incidence of disease and the steps taken to grapple with it.  However, this is not an occasion for going deeply into these particular matters.  The matter under discussion is the Vote for the Minister's new Department.  I, and many like me, are very glad that a professional man is in charge of the Ministry of Health.  The only reason that I can see for the plea for a non-professional <Col N="774" /> man is that such a man would know less about it and consequently would be able to do less to remedy the state of affairs.  Surely a doctor who knows the problem intimately is the most desirable man to have in office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been waiting for a Public Health Bill for two years. The great man, who was to steer that Bill through, was steering other things, and had to be cast.  As an ordinary worker, living with the poor, I would suggest to the Minister that the first thing he must do is to come to the aid of the sick poor.  In reply to a Parliamentary Question 12 months ago I was informed that in the National Health Insurance Fund there is a sum of £4,700,000.  Yet, every day in the week, honest men who fall sick and who have stamps to their credit have to wait sometimes three weeks before they get their first 15/- out of that fund.  When they get a second 15/- the lady inspector is sent down to visit these people's homes and, if they happen to be outside the door, that is reported and benefit is cut off.  I hope the Minister will not allow that to take place.  No working man or woman would go sick for the sake of getting 15/- after three weeks, and sometimes it is six weeks. Referee courts are held and persons who have stamps to their credit may <Col N="775" /> be disqualified.  Then they have to go to the home assistance officer.</P>
      <P>One of the first duties of the new Minister should be to increase old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions and the benefits to those entitled to them under our system of national health insurance.  There are many deserving people who are on the verge of starvation; they are as badly off as many of the people who, we are told, are starving in Europe.  We have people who are in receipt of 7/6 a week; widows for the most part get only 5/-, and the highest old age pension is 10/-.  I hope the Government will not leave this issue dangling until the next election.  Usually at election times we have platform statements and posters telling us that national health insurance benefits and pensions will be increased.</P>
      <P>Even at the height of the emergency the condition of the poor people was never at such a bad level.  Men receiving a trade union rate of wages of £4 or £5 a week were granted, on the Minister's figures, 15/- of a bonus.  At the same time we have many old people who, only for their friends and relations, would now be dead of hunger. I entered the county home in my own town two Sundays ago to visit some old age pensioners there.  There were 70 or 80 of them in the home, honest old men who had no one to help them outside and whose only refuge was the county home, where they had to hand over more than half of their pensions. They get a few shillings every fortnight in order to buy tobacco.  That is the treatment given to men, some of whom helped to found this State and some of whom are the fathers of 1916 men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak from practical experience when I refer to the conditions of the poor.  I have signed in the labour exchange and I have been on a sick bed, and no one here can tell me that I am not stating the facts.  The Minister, who comes from my own constituency, will, I hope, give some attention to these matters.  When there is agitation throughout the country over old age and other pensions, I hope they will hold their meetings in public and not <Col N="776" /> in rooms.  Let the public know the truth; bring the scandal of the national health insurance before the public.  In the North of Ireland and in Great Britain pensions for old people and for widows and orphans have been increased, but here the poor and the sick are left to die.</P>
    <P>There is a great responsibility on the Minister for Social Welfare.  Every year when the Estimates come up for consideration Deputies advocate better treatment for the sick and the aged, but the Government do not exert themselves. When the Taoiseach introduced the new Ministers we were all filled with hope that our social services would be improved without delay.  No Party will oppose any amount of money that may be voted to help people in need.  There is over £8,000,000 in the Hospitals Trust.  I tabled a Parliamentary Question some time ago and I was told there was £2,000,000 for sanatoria but it would not be in the public interest to say where the other £6,000,000 was invested.</P>

      <P>The former Parliamentary Secretary, Dr. Ward, answered the question, which appeared in the Official Report.  In many parts of the country there are no fires to-night.  In many homes there is very little bread or sugar and there is no bacon.  There is nothing for the poor, but the people with the money are all right.  They will not be short because they can get goods through the black market.  In one provincial town an old age pensioner could not get a proper supply of milk and unemployed men with families could not get the milk they are entitled to.  There was a letter sent to the Department and the milk supplier stated that he could not give the milk as he was not getting his usual supplies. The vouchers given to the people are no use in many cases; they are merely bits of paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all hope that the new Minister, our own man from County Wexford, will tackle this matter in earnest. Delays are dangerous.  If there is not something done soon many people now expecting benefit will have gone to <Col N="777" /> their graves.  The Minister spoke recently at a Fianna Fáil meeting in Borris.  He was not very hopeful when he said that the only way we could increase unemployment, assistance was by increasing the stamps.  Nobody would object to paying one penny extra if he thought he would help his neighbour, but though we are stamping cards there are many workers who are not getting sufficient benefit.  We have lots of officials who are paid £5 or £6 a week going through the country doing little or nothing.  On the other hand, there are many instances where married men are given only 15/- a week on which to support themselves and their families.  Of course, members of the Government Party may say: &ldquo;That man is all right because he is getting a family allowance and free boots.&rdquo; Supporters of the Government will tell you: &ldquo;No one is hungry; is not the Fianna Fáil Government helping them in every way?&rdquo; They are doing it in a half-hearted way.</P>
    <P>Not half enough is done for the poor; there is too much attention given to the other classes.  Stamps are paid for in order to give proper benefits to the sick and aged but they do not get them.  Everyone is paying for the social services, but the Government is not giving sufficient assistance.  The £4,700,000 laying to the credit of the national health insurance should be devoted towards increasing benefits for deserving people.  They are looking hopefully to the new Minister for Social Welfare.  If he does not help them they will give him their answer at the next general election.</P>

If it is not his job, what is the use of his being Minister for Health?  It is his job to look after the poor, the neglected people of the country, old age pensioners, blind pensioners, widows and orphans and the sick poor.  Every country outside Éire doubled the amount of the old age pensions when the cost of living went up.  An old age pensioner here is supposed to live on 10/- a week.  Will any honest man tell me how far 10/- would go to support and old person, a young person or any other person?  Blind pensioners are treated in the same way.  The non-contributory widow receives 5/- a week and 2/6 for each of her children. How far will that go to feed and cloth them and pay rent?  We are very off-handed and very kind in dealing with people we never saw and whom we never will see, and I have every sympathy with those people if they are hungry, but I think we should put our own house in order first and think of the people in Éire. I am sure that the Minister is not a hard-hearted man, but he is mixed up with some very hard-hearted people. The Taoiseach told us some time ago that the former Minister for Agriculture, the present Minister for Health, kept the people of this country from starvation.  Would the Taoiseach tell me whether people who are drawing 10/- a week are starving or have they sufficient to buy clothes and the other necessaries of life?  There is not a country in the world where the poor are treated as they are treated in this State.  When Fianna Fáil were seeking power&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is the first of the crop.  This Estimate, of course, amounts only to £3,340 and I see that it brings us up to the 31st March, 1947. Of course, the Minister did not tell us the exact period which this Estimate was supposed to cover.  Is it a month, two months or three months of the running of this Ministry?  I think the Minister has already been asked if the Department is going to occupy a separate building or whether there is going to be a separate Department for the Ministry in the Custom House. While a number of Deputies referred to what the Minister is going to do or what they would like to see done, the most important matter, at the start anyway, is to ascertain on what footing the Department is to be established. I should be interested to hear from the Minister what size this Department will ultimately grow to, what the normal Vote and the cost will be for a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important point which I should like to hear explained by the Minister is whether a line has been drawn to divide the duties of the Ministry of Health from those of the Ministry of Social Welfare and from a number of duties that will still be carried out by the Minister for Local Government in the Custom House.  We were told when these new Ministries were in the offing that the Department of Local Government had become unwieldy, that it was spread over too wide a field and that the country would gain in efficiency and economy by splitting up the duties at present discharged at the Custom House between these two Departments.  If that has not been done and if people can in future travel round three Ministries instead of one, to find out which of <Col N="781" /> them is really dealing with certain sections of the country's business, our last state will be worse than our first.  The Minister has not told us how far he proposes to avail of the staff in the Custom House who have been carrying out the duties of his Department.  Are they to be transferred holus bolus to his Department?</P>
    <P>I think that many of us can remember that, in the past, when divisions of this kind occurred a number of officials were pensioned off.  Will that take place in regard to this Department, or will officials be left in the Custom House to carry out one-third or two-thirds of their previous duties or will they be transferred to the new Department of Health, and if so will they take on added responsibilities? I think we are entitled to hear from the Minister what the increase will be as regards these two new Departments, plus the Department of Local Government, as compared with the old Department of Local Government and Public Health.  I imagine that there will have to be increased expenditure. I should like to be assured that the Minister has already tried to gather into his Department records that no doubt are in the Custom House relating to the services which the Department will have to undertake.  If that is not done it will mean that for many years to come reference will have to be made to files in the Custom House for information that really ought to be taken away and gathered under the wing of the Minister.  I think that the points that I have made indicate the business-like method that ought to be followed in the setting up of these two new Ministries as well as in the administration of them.  I think we are entitled to a statement of the relevant facts as to how that aspect of the matter is going to be affected by the present Estimates.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;State pensions are not my responsibility except to the extent that the expression refers to old age pensions. I have already arranged for the examination of the whole position in my Department.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="782" /> I am not without hope that we will get an encouraging statement from the Minister to-night following the result of his consideration of this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>While I realise that this is a small Estimate and that the Minister is really beginning at the end of the year in a new Department, I think the House is entitled to a survey of the work which the Minister had already carried out, as well as an outline of the policy which he expects to put into operation in the new Department of Health.  It has been said that the change which has been made was necessary because the Department of Local Government and Public Health became overloaded, and because of the fact that many of the new services administered under both sections of it had increased. I think that the first thing the Minister should do in establishing this new Ministry is not to overload it with unnecessary officials.  Rather he should start at the other end and ascertain first of all what are the minimum standards of health and of wages which are essential in order that the average family may have proper and nutritious food.  I understand that, as far back as 1922, a survey was made here.  I suggest to the Minister that the first essential, from his point of view in dealing with public health, is to set up minimum standards, and afterwards endeavour to see how they may be improved upon: how the services relating to them may be expanded as the necessity for such expansion arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to direct the Minister's attention to this, that nowadays, in dealing with public health, it is fashionable occasionally to say that efficiency may be got by direct bureaucratic action, by directing the public through official channels to do certain things.  I think it is now universally recognised, even by those who have had no experience of national or State medical services, that ultimately the best type of service is that in which the relationship between the patient and the doctor is allowed to remain on a personal basis. So far as one can gather from the observations which are available from the members of the medical profession, the Minister is starting in this <Col N="783" /> new Ministry with their goodwill.  In view of that, I suggest to him that before bringing in any measure which may affect the members of the medical association he should have consultations with them.  That does not mean that their views must prevail, but it would give the public confidence that the Minister had consulted those who were in a position to assess the merits or otherwise of any proposals that he might make.</P>
    <P>It has been said here that, because the Minister is a professional man, he should know more about the work of this Department than, say, a layman. That very often is the popular view.  It is true to say that, in many other countries, professional men are not in charge of departments for which their particular training would qualify them.  Experience has shown that persons without detailed or professional knowledge of a particular type of work are afforded a degree of liberty and freedom which enables them to take a detached view of the opinions and directions put up to them by experts.  It is quite common that when a professional person, or a person with experience in any particular line, is faced with conflicting views, possibly views by experts, his professional knowledge tends in some way to distort his judgment, whereas a person with no professional knowledge may rely on his own judgement and not follow the advice and information supplied by his experts.  I imagine that the Minister, with his long dissociation from actual medical practice, will not fall into that error, and I suggest that he should primarily rely on the expert opinion and views put forward by the Medical Association: that he should consult with those people who have direct experience in public health matters, such as county medical officers of health or dispensary doctors.  That is the course that, I think, he should follow in the case of Bills, such as the Public Health Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would suggest to him that at the start of his work in this new Department he should endeavour to wipe out as far as possible, and as <Col N="784" /> quickly as possible, all traces of the poor law system which has been handed down to us.  In many ways, of course, that system has been modified and altered considerably, but, nevertheless, some remnants of it still degrade our social and national fabric. I suggest to the Minister that the sooner the remnants of the poor law system are eradicated from the national health service, the more satisfactory, from the point of view of public acceptance, that service will be and the greater the effect on our public health.  Finally, I suggest to the Minister that, in order to get in the future the most highly qualified members of the profession to take positions under the Department of Public Health, a radical reorganisation of the salary basis of these positions will have to be undertaken.  Unless the salaries are considerably increased and the terms greatly improved, the Minister will not get into the public health service the best men from the profession.  If the Minister is not in a position to give an outline of the policy of his Department to the House now, I ask that, either by means of a White Paper or other means, he give an indication of that policy before the Estimate for his Department for the year 1947-8 comes before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was placed rather in a dilemma owing to the pressure from certain Deputies that I give detailed information regarding the policy of my Department.  At the same time, I was advised to consult all around me before I would make such an announcement. I have been only three weeks in the Department and I have not had time to consult the people whom I have been asked to consult.  I think that it will be admitted that I could not be expected to give details of the policy of the Department of Health at present. Opportunities will be given to the Dáil in the future to discuss such questions of policy.  The White Paper was referred to.  That will be in the hands of Deputies in the near future.  I cannot say exactly how long its preparation will take but I hope that Deputies will have it soon.  The Public Health Bill had to be divided into two parts. Although the greater part of that measure would come under the control of <Col N="785" /> the Health Department, some of it would be the concern of the Local Government Department, so that the draftsman has to give us two Bills. The Public Health Bill will come before the Dáil and there will be an opportunity of discussing many matters which arise upon it.  The Book of Estimates for the coming year will be published in the course of a few weeks and, in the discussion of the Departmental Estimate for 1947-48, Deputies will have a full opportunity of dealing with the policy to be pursued.  I hope to be able then to say more about policy than I can say to-night.</P>
      <P>I have taken a note of Deputy Mulcahy's point about the Blasket Islands. In that matter, my Department would require the co-operation of other Departments.  I am very sympathetic to the people of the Blasket Islands because, at one time, I spent my holidays in the vicinity.  I shall see what can be done to prevent anything occurring such as occurred there in the recent past.  Many speakers mentioned my relationship with, or approach to, the medical profession.  I am only too anxious to discuss with the medical profession any matter that may crop up and to get their advice.  As Deputy Cosgrave says, I need not take their advice if I do not think that it is right. I should be only too happy to have their advice on matters as they arise. I do intend to have a consultative council of medical men appointed with whom I can discuss matters of importance from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies quoted a statement from the County Limerick Medical Association.  I saw that statement before it was referred to here.  It was a very flamboyant statement.  I had not thought that the literary material amongst the medical profession in the County Limerick was so good.  Their fears are absolutely groundless.  Nobody has proposed that any limitation should be put on the clinical freedom of the medical man.  Nobody has proposed&mdash; in fact, I think I could say it has been forbidden&mdash;that medical men should disclose any information about their patients.  The Department of Local Government and Public Health were careful never to mention the name of a patient in any communication which <Col N="786" /> might take place with regard, say, to infectious disease.  An initial or a number was used instead of the name. I mention that to show that the Department of Local Government and Public Health were very particular that nothing like that should occur.  I do not know how the members of the Medical Association of County Limerick could have got it into their heads that there was a danger of anything like that taking place.  I was also asked what my idea was with regard to the future of medical treatment&mdash;whether it would be State controlled to a great extent. I do not agree with that.  I do not think that such a medical service would be at all the best.  I think that the medical practitioner will have to have his own practice and his own individual freedom, much the same as he has now, though there will be more State work put on to him as time passes.  That is the only way a great deal of this public health work can be done&mdash;by putting it on to some medical practitioner or other.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to nutrition. At present a sample nutritional survey is proceeding and we expect to get some valuable information from it. I was asked as to the size of the Department and so forth.  I cannot give Deputies very good information on that matter at the moment.  When the Book of Estimates comes along, Deputies will see what the cost of the Department will be for a full year. Unfortunately, we have no building into which to go.  Practically all the staff of the Public Health Department are in the Custom House.  They have been there up to now and I am afraid they will have to remain there.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, many of the staff of the Social Welfare Department are centred around Dublin Castle.  My own office will be in the Castle, as well as that of the heads of the two Departments. We cannot have the whole Department in any one building, but that applies also to other Departments and it cannot be helped.</P>
    <P>The staff working on the functions that are transferred will come over with those functions.  In the Social Welfare Department it is a very <Col N="787" /> simple matter, as there were distinct sections, such as the old age pension section and the national health insurance section.  They come over with the staff, just as they are.  In the Health Department, many of the staff were on health matters, but there were certain cases, as mentioned by Deputy Dockrell, where men worked part of the time on health work and another part on local government work.  We have to divide as well as we can, giving some to me and some to Local Government.  They all remain civil servants and there is no such thing as pensioning a man off because the work is gone.  There will not be any additional staff, except at the head.  There is, of course, a Secretary of each Department, over and above what was there before, as well as a Minister.  These are the only additions I can foresee at the moment.</P>
    <P>Tuberculosis has entered into this discussion.  As everyone knows, it is one of the biggest health problems we have.  A Bill came before the Dáil almost two years ago with regard to the building of regional sanatoria.  It has been very slow, first of all, in getting the sites, as a fairly big amount of land was necessary, to spread the various buildings over, but now the sites have been got in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  The Cork site is being taken over within the next two or three days; the Galway one is on hands and the Dublin one, as Deputies know, is at Santry Court.  I cannot say at the moment whether we will proceed with Santry Court or not, as there is a certain doubt whether it is advisable to erect a sanatorium there.</P>
    <P>The architects and the engineers have been working all the time and have done a great deal of the planning for the building of these sanatoria and I think that we should be in a position, in Galway at any rate, to get on with the contracts well before the end of this year.  I am very sorry to have to be so guarded as to when we can get on with the building of these three places, but it is a very slow matter getting the plans ready and getting out the contracts and it will take some years&mdash;two, three, four or five years&mdash; before these sanatoria are ready for <Col N="788" /> occupation.  In the meantime, we are making every endeavour to add to existing institutions and as a result there will be before the end of this year a good addition in the number of beds available around the City of Dublin.  Deputy Blowick mentioned that they were doing the same thing in County Mayo.  I can assure him that, as far as possible in the Department, we will help any county that is making an endeavour to increase the number of beds for tubercular patients.</P>
    <P>With regard to the maintaining of the dependents of a tubercular patient, that was in the Public Health Bill and when it comes back again before the Dáil that provision will be included.  I can assure Deputies who asked some questions on that point that it will not be on the public assistance basis, but will be a right to the person and will, I hope, be on a liberal scale.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies were rather troubled about the fact that I at one time got a diploma in medicine and on that account they think I am not the best person to be in charge of health.  Well, I take a rather modest view of my medical knowledge at the moment.  It is 23 years since I was in practice and in the meantime I was a farmer.  I do not know what objection there is to a doctor becoming a farmer, any more than a school teacher or Civic Guard or shopkeeper, but there appears to be an objection.  We will just have to get over it.  Deputy O'Higgins is here and I can understand his fears.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there is a good lot in the point that if a medical man were Minister of Health and depended too much on his own knowledge there would be a certain danger; but I think if you are not too confident of your own knowledge and can, as it were, get a quicker understanding of the technical advice tendered from the technical staff in the Department, it may be no harm to have studied medicine many years ago.</P>
    <P>Two or three Deputies mentioned something&mdash;I did not exactly understand what they had in mind&mdash;about the patient being permitted to choose his own doctor.  No one ever contemplated doing away with that option that the patient has at present, if he can <Col N="789" /> pay.  Any person who can pay a doctor can go to any doctor he likes and get advice.  Of course, we all know that the person who cannot pay can go only to the dispensary doctor.  That arrangement will continue; but doctors who are now in charge of dispensaries will get more duties and in that way there will be more people in each district entitled to free treatment.  But they are not bound to take it: they can pay another doctor for his advice if they like and need not go to the dispensary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little at the dispensaries&mdash;only bottles of water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not right.  The dispensaries do quite good work.  As far as stocking the dispensaries with medicine is concerned, that matter will have to be examined, too.  Anyway, the patient can choose any doctor he likes in the future, as he did in the past.  The only difference will be that more people will be entitled to get free treatment than were entitled in the past.</P>
      <P>A question was raised about dispensary doctors' salaries.  All I can say at this stage is that dispensary doctors are as deserving of an increase as many others who have got it, but it is a matter for the county manager.  One Deputy said that a county manager had told him that he was doing nothing about it as he was waiting for advice from the Minister for Health.  I do not know why he should say that or why he should wait for advice.  It is a matter for the county manager, in the first instance, to suggest what he thinks would be a fair increase, if he wants to give any increase.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is their job.  I do not think Deputies are consistent when they advise me to say to county managers: &ldquo;You should give the doctors soand-so&rdquo;, because the Government has often been criticised recently and in the past for interfering too much with local authorities and we ought to leave them whatever little freedom they have and not interfere with them any more.  I personally would like to see a fairly uniform scheme for doctors, mental hospital attendants and others, but it is very hard to see how that can be <Col N="790" /> done so long as we have local authorities and so long as these local authorities have autonomy in matters of wages and so on.  One of them may pay more than the other and it is not easy for anybody at the top to suggest that they should all pay the same.</P>
      <P>The remainder of the debate centred around the Social Welfare Department. We should keep this in mind, that these social welfare schemes&mdash;old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, national health insurance and so on&mdash; were never designed to put people in as good a state financially as they would be in if they were working.  They were brought in, piecemeal, if you like, one by one, to help these people and at least we can say that the widow who now has a pension, be it ever so small, is better off than the widow who, some years ago, had no pension and that the person getting sickness benefit now, even though it is small, is better off than the person who is not entitled to that benefit because he is not insured under the scheme or for some other reason.</P>
      <P>If we are to increase these amounts, the question is how are we to do it? Deputy O'Leary quoted me as saying in Borris that the only way was to raise contributions.  I did not say that that was the only way; I said it was one way&mdash;in other words, that if the amount of 1/- a week which the farmer has to pay for stamping a card were raised to 1/6, no doubt higher benefits could be paid.  Similarly with unemployment insurance.  If the unemployment insurance stamp were increased by 50 per cent., the amount given to the unemployed person could be increased.</P>
      <P>The other way is to take it from the Exchequer, and there is a limit to what the Exchequer can do.  These are matters which we are examining and we must see what we can do.  Deputy Byrne said that I stated a fortnight ago that I was having these matters examined, and he asked if I could say anything about them to-night.  I am afraid not.  They are being examined, but I have been only three weeks in the Department and three weeks is not a very long period in which to examine the entire social services of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not, but I hope they may be.  We shall have to examine it first and see where the money is to come from.  Deputies need to remember that some of these services are very costly.  There are 150,000 old age pensioners and to give every old age pensioner an extra half-crown would cost almost £1,000,000.  We have not got a whole lot of millions to spare.  I give that instance to show that, taking all the social services, we cannot do a whole lot, but we can perhaps do something to ease matters here and there.</P>
      <P>I do not at all agree with Deputy O'Leary when he says that national health insurance payments are not made for about three weeks.  That is not true.  One of the things I did since I went into the Department was to go to the national health insurance offices and see the work being done there.  I saw that work being done, and the first payment is always out inside 10 days, unless there is something wrong in the record, unless the person has not got his card stamped or something of that sort.  In other words, if the insured person and the employer have done their duty in regard to sending in the cards at the proper time, the payment is always out within 10 days.  If there is a delay of three weeks, it may be taken for granted that there is some fault on the part of the insured person or the employer.</P>

I do not know when that Bill may be ready, but I hope it will be ready before the Summer Recess at least.  I have not made up my mind about social welfare yet.  I do not know whether the work would warrant a separate committee or not, but it is a matter for consideration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be noticed that the Estimate contains a note to the effect that the Votes for widows' and orphans' pensions and national health insurance <Col N="794" /> for 1946/47 will be accounted for by the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare, and not by the Office of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, as appeared on the face of the existing Estimate for those services. When the Estimate now before the House was being prepared, it was contemplated that in the case of the remaining services transferred to the Department of Social Welfare for which provision for 1946-47 was made in self-contained Votes, that is to say: Old Age Pensions (Vote 7), Children's Allowances (Vote 57), Unemployment Insurance and Assistance (Vote 59) and Food Allowances (Vote 68), the Votes would continue to be accounted for up to the end of 1946-47 by the existing accounting offices.  On further consideration it is felt that accounting arrangements for the four Votes in question should be the same as is proposed for widows' and orphans' pensions and national health insurance, and this opportunity is being taken of bringing the matter to the notice of the House to secure its approval of the arrangement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just two points I should like to raise.  On January 22nd, I asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health a question with regard to certain classes of people who came under the national health insurance scheme because their salaries or wages were not more than £250 per annum, but who, by reason of increases granted simply for the purpose of meeting the cost of living, have been brought outside that scheme.  I asked him whether any steps would be taken to retain them inside the scheme, and his answer implied no, but that they have it in their own power to continue to be entitled to benefit by electing to exercise their right to make voluntary contributions.  I submitted that it is inequitable in the circumstances of to-day that people whose standard of living, instead of being raised, has actually been depressed, even though they are in receipt of recently granted increases, should be withdrawn out of that scheme.  I suggest that it is imperative that legislation should be introduced at once to raise the ceiling of <Col N="795" /> salaries or wages so as to retain a substantial number of these people inside the scheme.  That is the first point.</P>
      <P>The second point is that the Minister said the payments under the national health insurance scheme and the widows' and orphans' scheme are not intended to be made on a scale which would make people as well off as they were before they required the assistance of these payments.  That is understood.  However, I submit that these payments are intended to be such as will enable body and soul to be kept together.  I asked the Minister whether it is the intention of his Department to examine the question of the necessaries of life with a view to establishing basic scales of diet for various people so that Parliament and the Minister will have a yard-stick by which they can measure whether the allowances under these various Acts are sufficient to enable body and soul to be kept together in the case of people getting these payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I put a question to the Minister to-day, but I must confess that I am still rather hazy about the matter.  I should like to ask the Minister whether the new Department of Social Welfare is responsible for the employment and unemployment schemes which were dealt with by the Department of Industry and Commerce in Lord Edward Street.  The reason I put down the question was that in almost every parish in Mayo there is quite a number of young men in search of work.  These young men would rather get work at home even at a lower wage than is available in England.  That applied even before there was a food problem there.  Very few of them wish to leave their country if they could get a reasonable wage at home.  The point I want to put to the Minister is that recently agricultural and turf work closed down completely for a lot of these young men.  On 22nd January, in reply to a question of a Deputy, the Minister for Industry and Commerce informed the House that 29,000 persons had emigrated to England during the last 12 months.  It is quite obvious, of course, that Bord na Móna will need a certain number of <Col N="796" /> skilled workers for turf production.  The food production drive will also need a certain number of agricultural workers. What I want to know from the Minister is whether turf production and food production were affected by shortage of labour owing to the emigration of these 29,000 persons last year.</P>
      <P>The Minister, of course, should keep as many people at home as is necessary to deal adequately with both turf and food production, because they are vital matters.  But I cannot see any sense in keeping at home three or four or five times as many people as there is work for.  These people are anxious to make the best of their youth.  Most of the holdings in the West are small and there is no hope of sub-division there.  The only chance for these people to make use of their youth is to earn sufficient money abroad to enable them to come home in later years and buy a place or marry into a place and settle down.  That has been the custom for a very long time.  We had hoped to see an end to that, but there is no end to it in sight yet.</P>
      <P>I therefore ask the Minister to ease the ban on emigration in most areas, to keep as many at home as are needed for the two major problems of turf and food production in the national interest, but not to keep four times as many at home as we have work for. If the Turf Board needs 4,000 or 5,000 men, which I understand is the number required, and food production requires another 4,000 or 5,000, keep them at home by all means, but do not penalise the others who wish to leave the country for work abroad.  I know several of these young men who have been refused permits and who feel that two or three years of their lives have been wasted.  I made application for permits on several occasions for some of these young men.  I am not blaming the Minister, because he has only taken over that section of the Department, but I cannot understand why some young men in a particular parish or division are refused permits, while young men in neighbouring parishes in similar circumstances are allowed to emigrate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has more or less anticipated the discussion <Col N="797" /> that might have taken place on this Estimate, although a number of Deputies who intervened on the last Estimate confined themselves to that Estimate exclusively.  On the last Estimate the Minister explained his attitude towards social services generally. He made the positive statement that it is not possible for him at this stage to indicate what shape the social services may take in the future. As he is only three weeks in charge of the new Department, his explanation that he needs time to consider a matter of this kind is reasonable.  May I put this to him, however?  Apart from what might be termed his long-term policy, has he not satisfied himself that in present conditions there is an urgent need for an immediate increase so far as certain beneficiaries from public funds are concerned?  In that respect, there will be unanimous agreement that individuals like old age pensioners and widows and orphans should have prior consideration.  There is something more in my statement than perhaps may appear to the Minister. I have personal knowledge that a number of public boards are refraining from giving any increases to their pensioned staffs because they are awaiting a lead from the Government.</P>
      <P>In that respect, in view of all the circumstances, particularly the cost of living, it is almost incomprehensible that the Government have not given us a statement of policy on that particular aspect of their administration.  It is obvious that there are very large numbers of these people on the verge of want, if not close to destitution. Therefore, I suggest to the Minister, on the inauguration of this new Department, that he could not do better than to examine the possibilities of an early increase so far as the particular classes that I have enumerated are concerned.</P>

      <P>It will have to be coordinated with economics also.  The Department of Social Welfare is responsible for the administration of the employment exchanges.  That is, my Department will carry out whatever policy is laid down.  Deputy Blowick will agree, I am sure, that it is Ministers like the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture who are more concerned with the policy that will be pursued with regard to exist permits, and so on, and all I can promise is to carry out the policy as laid down by the Government and that policy, as I explained to Deputy Blowick to-day, is the same for agricultural workers, turf workers&mdash;all male workers&mdash;that is, that they will get a permit to leave the country unless they are in a job or there is a job waiting for them or a job coming off where a certain number of workers are required.  I could not say, with regard to the number that emigrated last year, whether that had any effect on turf work or agricultural work or not.  We all heard individual farmers complaining that they could hardly get men during harvest time, and I think the complaint was made also that there were not altogether enough workers on turf production but I wanted to find out from Deputy <Col N="799" /> Blowick, and I am not yet clear, if he has in mind migratory workers.</P>

      <P>No.  I am sorry if I have not been clear enough on that.  I do not mean the workers from what are known as migratory areas because workers from such areas, on production of an offer of employment from a farmer in England, can get a permit easily enough.  The workers I refer to are those precluded by the ban from travelling.  These are the workers in respect of whom I want the Minister to relax the ban.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 33, Section 14 (d) (ii) to delete the words &ldquo;Accountant of the Courts of Justice&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;President of the High Court&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment to substitute the President of the High Court for the Accountant of the Courts of Justice. Deputy Costello raised a question as to the advisability of going on with this amendment on Committee.  I had put, it down on the recommendation of the President of the High Court. So, when the Deputy questioned it, I withdrew the amendment to inquire further.  I again inquired of the President of the High Court and he thinks it is better to have the bonds in his name than in the name of the accountant.  For that reason I am moving this amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 10, lines 1 to 25, to delete Section 19, and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>19. (1) Every person conducting an auction (other than an auction to which sub-section (2) of Section 6 of this Act relates) shall, if so requested by an officer of customs and excise, produce and show to the <Col N="801" /> officer, there and then or within the next seven days, an auctioneer's licence or auction permit under which he was authorised to conduct the auction.</P>
    <P>(2) Every person who contravenes sub-section (1) of this section shall, unless he satisfies the court that he was authorised to conduct the auction and that the contravention was due to circumstances beyond his control, be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction to an excise penalty of £50.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen put down amendments which I accepted in principle.  One was to extend to seven days the time for the production of a permit.  Another was to increase the penalty from £10 to £50.  That is provided for in this amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 10, Section 20, to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;<Col N="802" /> (3) Sub-section (1) of this section shall not apply to the holding by or on behalf of a licensed auctioneer of an auction of which a notice, bearing the name under which he is licensed to carry on business and the address of his principal place of business in the State, has been published in a newspaper circulating in the area where the auction is held or displayed in a conspicuous position in the area.</P>
    <P>This is another of Deputy Allen's amendments, which I accepted in principle.  It is to provide that where an auction has been advertised in the local Press it will not be obligatory on the auctioneer to put up a poster also.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take the Final Stages now.</P>
    <P>Bill, as amended, received for final consideration and passed.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.10 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 12th February.</P>
